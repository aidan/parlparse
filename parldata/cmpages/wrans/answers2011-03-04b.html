 We need radical reform of the Common Fisheries Policy. Moving away from centralised micro-management to more effective regional management, by those closest to the fishery, is a key priority. Any changes must be compatible with the Treaties, but more responsibility for implementation can—and should—be devolved to member states, allowing them to work together regionally to put in place appropriate management measures, without creating layers of bureaucracy.</p>

The exercise to recruit these people known as appointees was a significant recruitment process carried out last year by the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) working with DEFRA and Capita. The exercise generated considerable interest around the country and was delivered in line with the Nolan principles of public appointments. A total of 341 applications were received of which 283 candidates were interviewed and 111 appointments made to the 10 IFCAs around the country. All appointees were selected on merit against three main criteria set out in the information sent out to all candidates:</p>

I am sure however that the Sea Fisheries Committee and the IFCA going forwards will wish to maintain close links and discussions with the local cockle industry since the Thames Estuary Cockle Fishery Regulating Order forms an important part of the fisheries management and enforcement work. The quarterly meetings are also open to the public and there is no reason that industry representatives cannot attend these meetings to hear the business that is being discussed.</p>

An independent study by the Institution of Engineering and Technology and consultants KEMA on the costs of GB electricity transmission infrastructure options will address costs in power losses and other whole-life financial costs. The results of this work will be published. It is for the Infrastructure Planning Commission to assess each electricity connection scheme on a case by case basis depending on its specific circumstances, as stated in the draft energy National Policy Statements. The Government intend to finalise and formally approve the energy National Policy Statements in spring 2011.</p>

 The network companies, including National Grid, are responsible for developing their networks in line with their licence obligations and, as part of the price control process, Ofgem considers the costs, and other factors such as need, for electricity networks based on investment proposals put forward by network companies in line with its statutory duties. In developing the transmission price control (RIIO-T1) for 2013-21 Ofgem is engaging with the Department and other stakeholders across a range of matters including what further guidance might be provided to help network companies (and stakeholders) consider the broader environmental costs and benefits of their potential investment decisions. Ofgem will set out its views in this area in its end-March 2011 RIIO-T1 strategy document.</p>

LLW Repository Ltd, the site licence company who operate the LLWR in Cumbria, is currently undertaking a review of the capacity of the Repository as part of the Environmental Safety Case process which, once complete in May 2011, will help determine the amount of low level waste that could be disposed of via this route.</p>

 Existing low level waste (LLW) is managed and disposed of as it arises, with LLW management routes focused on the waste hierarchy; aiming to minimise the amount of LLW for disposal whilst making the best use of available disposal routes.

Only some of these sites are currently permitted to accept greater volumes of VLLW and LLW from the nuclear industry; the largest being Clifton Marsh in Lancashire. Clifton Marsh has been accepting waste for disposal since 1986, under authorisations held by the waste producers. The overall capacity of the site is around 9 million cubic metres, but only 10% of this will be LLW, with the remainder being everyday household and commercial waste.</p>

The rail industry National Task Force (NTF) has confirmed that the issue of stranded trains would be investigated again by the Association of Train Operating Companies and the relevant operators.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 2 March 2011]:</i> It is our intention that the area off the Suffolk coast where ship-to-ship transfers are monitored by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) under existing arrangements will be formally recognised as the ‘permit area’ for ship-to-ship transfers in forthcoming secondary legislation. This area off Suffolk has, for several years now, been the only location in UK jurisdiction where the MCA allows ship-to-ship transfers (other than those in a harbour authority area) to be carried out. These waters are recognised by the MCA and by the industry as a suitable area for carrying out ship-to-ship transfers on navigational safety grounds.</p>

 The UK Government is extremely concerned about the humanitarian situation in Libya itself and at the borders. UK humanitarian and stabilisation staff have been sent to the Libyan borders with Egypt and Tunisia to assess the humanitarian situation and coordinate with other agencies on the ground. On 1 March DFID flew in 36,000 blankets and tents to shelter 1,500 people to the Tunisia border at the request of the United Nations Agency for Refugees (UNHCR). The UK Government has also provided three planes on rotation to repatriate several thousand people stranded at the Tunisian/Libyan border. At 10:30 on 4 March, 3,135 people had been flown on UK funded aircraft from the Tunisia border with Libya to Egypt. We are also working closely with non-governmental organisations and other international organisations such as UNHCR and International Organization for Migration (IOM). We are proactively monitoring the evolving situation through our field teams on the ground and partner agencies and I am visiting the region for myself to make my own assessment. We stand ready to provide resources to prevent this becoming a more severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

 It is not possible to provide the information requested without incurring disproportionate cost. UK Forces operate in Afghanistan as part of a wider NATO effort and assets are assigned based on task not nationality. Accordingly, the UK will routinely make use of other nations' assets and vice versa. However, since December 2010, this has included UK troops in theatre utilising heavy lift assets including aircraft, trucks and cranes belonging to Denmark, Slovakia and the United States.</p>

 As part of the strategic defence and security review, it was announced that there would be a reduction in the number of airframes the RAF would be operating in future. This included the early withdrawal from service of the Harrier fleet, a reduction in the number of Tornado aircraft and the cancellation of the Nimrod MRA4. As a result of these decisions, the RAF’s requirement for future trained pilots has now reduced. In addition, there has been a reassessment of the required number of helicopter pilots due to there being fewer service leavers and the limited capacity of operational conversion units.</p>

They are currently being briefed on the personal implications in one-to-one discussions. Those RAF trainee pilots who are removed from the flying training pipeline will be considered for potential re-selection for other ground based appointments. Those that are not successful will be put forward for redundancy and will receive support from the RAF by way of resettlement packages.</p>

 The Ministry Of Defence (MOD) informed its acquisition and human resource staff of the announcement of the introduction of the Principles of Good Employment Practice in December 2010. Since the beginning of the New Year, the Department has focused attention on implementing those principles most relevant to its role as a commissioner for service provision. It is too early to judge the adherence to each of the principles. It is intended that the Public Services Forum (PSF) assess the impact of these principles on good employment practices in the delivery of contracted out services in January 2012. The MOD will assist the Cabinet Office and PSF with that review.</p>

 No RAF trainee pilots have been selected for redundancy at this stage. The RAF is currently in the process of selecting up to 170 RAF trainee pilots to be removed from the flying training pipeline. This will be completed and the individuals informed by mid March. Those who will be removed from flying training will undergo a further selection process for possible transfer to ground based branches within the RAF. Those who are unsuccessful will then be considered for redundancy by the redundancy selection board which sits at the end of May this year. Until this process is complete we cannot announce any further details.</p>

A key element of this approach has been the creation of the Early Intervention Grant for local authorities in England. In a tight funding settlement, some reduction in central government support was inevitable. The grant will however provide a substantial funding stream, with new flexibility to enable local authorities to act more strategically and target investment early, where it will have the greatest impact.</p>

 We are concerned that the number of pupils, especially those in disadvantaged areas, who receive a broad education in core academic subjects is far too small. We want to encourage more pupils to take these core subjects and to bring about greater fairness of opportunity.</p>

               <a name="11030459000267"> The English Baccalaureate does not include all the subjects we think are worthy of study. We recognise that study in other subjects will be just as valuable to pupils and we will encourage all pupils to study non-English Baccalaureate subjects alongside the English Baccalaureate in order to benefit from a well rounded education. This is why we have kept the number of core subjects small enough to allow wider study. Subjects, such as religious studies and music which do not count towards the English Baccalaureate, can and will play a part in a well rounded, rigorous education.</p>

 The Department does not collect data on the availability of and participation in extra curricular activities. However, the Department for Education's Childcare and Early Years Survey of Parents for 2009, published in October 2010, does give an indication of the proportion of children participating in some extra curricular activities beyond the school. The survey entailed interviews with a sample of just over 6,700 parents with children aged under 15. One-third of the sample of families used a breakfast or after-school club on a school site and 7% used a breakfast or after-school club off-site. Full details of the surveys can be found at:</p>

This is why the teaching of RE remains compulsory throughout a pupil's schooling. Success in all subjects studied at GCSE will also continue to be recognised by other performance table measures, as it has in the past. We are open to arguments about how we can further improve the measures in the performance tables and will review the precise definition of the English Baccalaureate for the 2011 tables.</p>

Condoms are not prescription only medicine items, and are supplied by the national health service via other routes and are funded by primary care trusts.</p>

                     <i>Notes:</i>
1. PCA Data
Prescription information is taken from the Prescription Cost Analysis (PCA) system, supplied by the Prescription Services Division of the NHS Business Services Authority (BSA), and is based on a full analysis of all prescriptions dispensed in the community i.e. by community pharmacists and appliance contractors, dispensing doctors, and prescriptions submitted by prescribing doctors for items personally administered in England. Also included are prescriptions written in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man but dispensed in England. The data do not cover drugs dispensed in hospitals, including mental health trusts, or private prescriptions.
2. Prescribers are general practitioners, hospital doctors, dentists and non medical prescribers such as nurses and pharmacists.
3. Net Ingredient Cost (NIC)
NIC is the basic cost of a drug. It does not take account of discounts, dispensing costs, fees or prescription charges income.
4. Long-acting Reversible Contraception includes Intra-Uterine Devices and Diaphragms. Patches and vaginal ring products have been excluded from the figures.
5. Although figures are published by the NHS Information Centre on the number of patients accessing these services, the cost of such provision is not collected.

The agency has also identified the source of the sensors.

 During 2010-11 and 2011-12, primary care trust (PCT) allocations are not broken down into sums for individual policy streams, and it is for PCTs to decide how much to spend in line with the requirements of the NHS Operating Framework. We do not therefore set an overall budget for expenditure on improving food, diet and nutrition.</p>

This included turning the civil service into a civic service, by making regular community service an element of civil service staff appraisals.</p>

               <a name="11030459000757"> On 17 February 2011 the Government announced that as part of the civic service initiative each civil servant will be encouraged to do at least one day of volunteering each year using special leave. Additional we announced that the civil service will aim to give 30,000 volunteering days per year. The civic service will begin from April 2011, from which point civil servants will be able to take part and enrol.</p>

               <a name="11030459000758"> The civic service will play a key role in creating the big society, by encouraging social action among civil servants and enabling them to use their skills to support voluntary, community and social enterprise sector organisations.</p>

The volunteering opportunities created through the civic service will be available to all civil servants, apart from those in the devolved administrations who will have different arrangements. The civic service is wholly focused on encouraging civil servants to volunteer and will therefore not be extended to hon. Members.</p>

Data from the 2005 Time Use survey suggest that the average person spends nearly 17 hours watching television each week. Data from the 2008-09 Citizenship Survey, conducted by the Department for Communities and Local Government, suggest that people in England spend an average of one hour a week on voluntary work.</p>

International sanctions, including those adopted by the UN and the EU, show the strength of international concern about Iran's nuclear programme. It is clear that these sanctions are having an impact. Iran is finding it increasingly difficult to acquire goods of proliferation concern and is also finding it harder to access international finance. But, following Iranian behaviour at the latest round of EU3+3 talks in Istanbul, it is also clear that the pressure on Iran needs to increase.</p>

 As the Prime Minister said in the House on 28 February 2011, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 23-26, Britain has taken on a leading role in co-ordinating international pressure to isolate the Qadhafi regime and ensure that anyone responsible for abuses in Libya will be held to account. On 24 February 2011, the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond (Yorks) (Mr Hague), spoke to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to discuss measures such as the now agreed UN Security Resolution which condemned Colonel Qadhafi’s actions and demanded an immediate end to the violence and killing of protestors. The Secretary of State met Secretary of State Clinton at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on 28 February 2011, during which both the Secretary of State and Secretary Clinton called for Libya’s suspension from the Council.</p>

 As the Prime Minister said in his statement to the House on 28 February 2011, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 23-26, the UK is taking a lead on co-ordinating international pressure to isolate the Qadhafi regime, deprive it of money, shrink its power and ensure that anyone responsible for abuses in Libya will be held to account. For example, the UK instigated a strong UN Security Resolution which was passed unanimously on 26 February and called on the Libyan Government to meet its responsibility to protect its population and imposed a travel ban, asset freeze and arms embargo. On 28 February, the EU agreed a Council decision imposing a travel ban and asset freeze on the Libyan regime which came into force on 3 March.</p>

The Scottish rate of income tax is planned to take effect from 2016-17 which gives five years for HMRC to discuss the detailed implementation with the representative bodies, and complete the design work and the remaining development.</p>

Therefore, Government do not plan apprenticeship places or set targets. We will have funding in place to train over 350,000 apprentices (at all ages) in 2010/11, though to reach this number employers and providers will need to work together to offer sufficient opportunities, in the context of the greater freedoms and flexibilities that we have created in the Further Education system.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 28 February 2011]: </i>We are committed to expanding apprenticeships, and by 2014-15 there will be public funding for 75,000 more adults to start an apprenticeship than under the previous Government's plans. This means we need encourage more employers to get involved by both maintaining quality and making the system easier for employers to take on apprentices.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 3 March 2011]:</i> Our assumption for modelling the new higher education finance system was that the average charge across the sector would be around £7,500 per year. On that basis we would expect the number of student places across the spending review period to be broadly constant. Graduate contributions at that sort of level should replace any reduction in teaching grant. Higher average charges could have consequences for the student finance budget which we have indicated may need to be met from within the overall higher education budget. However, at this stage in the process it is too early to form a judgment on the level of charge that will be set. No institution so far has an agreed Access Agreement in place with the Director for Fair Access which would allow for a contribution to the costs of tuition to be set above £6,000.</p>

 The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills provides funding to support the Union Learning Fund (ULF) and unionlearn, the TUC’s learning and skills organisation, which administers the fund on behalf of the Department. The main purpose of this budget is to enable trade unions and Union Learning Representatives (ULRs) to work with employers, employees and learning providers to encourage greater take up of learning and raise skill levels in the workplace. It is not used to fund the provision of education or training courses but enables trade unions and their ULRs to provide advice, guidance and support in order to help workers, particularly those with low skills, access learning opportunities to improve their skill levels.</p>

In 2009-10 over 233,000 learners in workplaces across the country were helped back into learning by the ULF and ULRs.</p>

Two-thirds of employers say there has been a benefit to their organisation; and 8 in 10 cite a benefit to individual learners, over half of whom improved their qualifications having been helped to access a suitable learning opportunity.</p>

Preliminary impact assessments were published alongside that consultation, “Proposals for Reform of Civil Litigation Funding and Costs in England and Wales—Implementation of Lord Justice Jackson’s Proposals”, available at:</p>

 The margin of appreciation afforded to governments in the national implementation of the Convention rights is not itself defined in the Convention.

I have not yet had specific discussions about the margin of appreciation with my counterparts, although where appropriate in proceedings before the Court, the Government argues for the United Kingdom to be afforded a broad margin of appreciation.</p>

 The estimated cost of the transition to agency status is a total one-off cost of around £8 million by the end of the SR10 period.

 On 18 January 2010 the previous Administration announced an intention to make non-statutory payments to eligible victims of overseas terrorism through the introduction of an ex-gratia scheme. This has not been implemented and is currently under review as part of a Ministry of Justice review of victim services and compensation.</p>

 Transferring funds is a standard part of the Ministry of Justice's business as usual practices. This usually involves taking funds from one area where they are working under-budget and moving them to an area that needs more resources. This is seen as financial best practice. This can include transfers to and from the MoJ's arm’s length bodies.</p>

 It is Ministry of Justice's responsibility to manage the control totals set by HM Treasury and as part of the Department's operational responsibility and financial management, it works closely with its business areas in order to review forecast plans and in year expenditure and uses the estimates process to appropriately align funding to business area forecast expenditure.

These have materialised as a result of falling demand for custodial accommodation and decommissioning of places in the juvenile secure estate. To help deal with forecast pressures elsewhere, this funding was re-distributed to other areas of the Department.</p>
