 The Climate Change Act 2008 sets greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets of at least 34% by 2020 and at least 80% by 2050 (both from the 1990 baseline). The first three carbon budgets, running from 2008 to 2012, 2013 to 2017 and 2018 to 2022, are set in line with the 34% target. This is based on the UK's share of an EU-wide greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 20% from 1990 levels by 2020. Latest projections published in June indicate that on central scenarios we are on track to achieve the 34% target.</p>

In addition to a range of new policy initiatives, the coalition has already announced that central Government would reduce its carbon emissions by 10% within 12 months and that real time reporting of energy efficiency data would be implemented across Government HQ buildings. We are also supporting greater energy efficiency by introducing the green deal and have announced in the House that we are extending the carbon emissions reduction target (CERT) to the end of 2012. We are supporting the carbon price by arguing for the EU to adopt a 30% emissions target for 2020 and we will reform the electricity market to deliver the investment we need to ensure decarbonisation and security of supply.</p>

 An evaluation of the predecessor scheme to the carbon emissions reduction target reported in December 2008, and found it to be very effective. Ofgem administrates CERT on the Government's behalf, publishing quarterly updates of suppliers' progress towards targets. Ofgem accredits the carbon score of schemes where suppliers meet the terms of the operational guidance, including auditing and reporting requirements. CERT has been focussed around measures which deliver long lived savings, namely insulation. We estimate that the measures delivered under CERT will deliver lifetime savings of some 185 Mt CO2 by April 2011. An evaluation of the scheme will be undertaken in 2011.</p>

 The Department for Energy and Climate Change does not publish wholesale energy price forecasts. It publishes oil, gas and coal price assumptions for the period till 2030, which are used in the Department's analytical work. Rather than forecasting prices, DECC attempts to generate a number of price scenarios, based on estimates of fundamentals, that represent a plausible range that might materialise in the future. The assumptions do not capture short-term volatility in fossil fuel prices, but they are intended to reflect potential long-term trends. It is therefore possible to witness significant deviation from these trends in any one year. The Department keeps these assumptions under review, and will update them when necessary. The last review took place in January 2010 but no changes were made. In addition, as part of DECC's Updated Energy and Emissions Projections, DECC produce wholesale electricity price projections which arise from the fossil fuel price assumptions.

 There are 55 directly employed security guards working for HM Courts Service (HMCS) at the Royal Courts of Justice. A further 57 guards at the Central Criminal Court are provided by Corporation of London. However, the majority of security guards currently deployed across the HMCS estate are provided under contract through third party providers. As at June 2010 there were approximately 1,439 security staff working at HMCS sites and a further 72 working at Tribunals Service sites. A complement of circa 300 guards is also available to draw on to cover leave/sick absences. At a minority of HMCS sites, a further (estimated) 24-30 security staff are provided under the terms of occupational lease agreements.</p>

Under the scheme, the police are able to issue penalty notices (£50 or £80) for a range of minor offences some of which attract a higher tariff. The recipient of a PND has 21 days to either pay the penalty or seek a court hearing. No admission of guilt is required and the PND recipient discharges all liability for the offence and receives no criminal record, if the penalty is paid. If no action is taken a fine of one and half the penalty amount is registered against the recipient of the notice. The courts are responsible for enforcing fines arising from PNDs in the same way as any other unpaid fine.<br>

 The extra-statutory scheme has not begun accepting claims, and so no payments have as yet been made. We hope that the scheme will be in a position to start accepting claims shortly. The scheme will remain open for applications for the period of one year from the date on which it comes into operation. Payments will be made on a timely basis on receipt of applications, and any payments outstanding at the end of the one year period for applications will be made as soon as possible after that date.</p>

 Secure training centres are privately run custodial establishments for young people under 18.

 It is essential that approved and effective techniques are available to staff in custodial establishments who find themselves dealing with young people whose behaviour puts the young people themselves, or others, at risk. The independent Review of Restraint in Juvenile Secure Settings, published in December 2008, concluded that, in exceptional circumstances, pain-compliant techniques were necessary in the secure estate for children and young people. Pain-compliant techniques are only to be used as the last resort, where all other methods of control have failed or would not succeed and where there is serious threat to the safety of young people or staff.</p>

 It is essential that approved and effective restraint techniques are available to staff in custodial establishments, to enable them to deal with young people whose behaviour puts at risk the safety of the young person him- or herself, other young people, or members of staff.

 Each secure training centre records the types of physical control in care holds applied during each incident of restraint, and analyses information on a monthly basis.

 There are no techniques authorised for use in secure training centres that involve deliberately taking young people to the floor. If, in the course of a restraint, a young person deliberately takes himself or herself to the ground, then, in general, either the young person will continue to be restrained and will be brought to a standing position at the earliest opportunity, or he or she will be released. A young person must not be held on the floor for more than three minutes, after which he or she must be released. The Physical Control in Care manual makes it clear that girls who are pregnant must not be held face down on the floor. The manual also draws attention to the heightened risks of restraining other groups of young people, including those suffering from asthma, obesity, or recent head injury or who are in a psychotic state or a state of excited delirium.</p>

 The Government are unable to provide the information requested. The Israeli Settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories do not have a separate country code. Consequently, it is not possible for HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to separately identify imports from the Israeli Settlements. However, since 2000, HMRC has issued demands for around £482,000 in customs duty on approximately 1,000 consignments of products imported into the UK from Settlements where preferential tariff rates under the EC-Israel Association Agreement had been incorrectly claimed.</p>

 The Government's policy on settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem is clear. Settlements are not only illegal under international law and in direct contravention of Israel's Roadmap commitments, but they also represent an attempt to create 'facts on the ground' which makes a two-state solution harder to achieve. It is important that consumers in the UK are able to make fully informed decision concerning the products they buy. That is why, in December 2009, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs introduced guidelines in consultation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to label more accurately produce from Israeli settlements that are sold in the UK. This does not represent a ban on the sale of products from Israeli settlements in the UK.</p>

<i> [holding answer 17 June 2010]:</i> Many seriously injured service personnel and veterans are already eligible for the England-wide free concessionary bus travel scheme by virtue of age or disability. Furthermore, the Department for Transport's guidance on eligibility for disabled people sets out that eligibility for a concessionary bus pass may be considered automatic for injured veterans who are in receipt of war pensioner's mobility supplement, where eligibility is linked to the ability to walk. We are currently considering how to extend the scheme to include automatic eligibility for veterans in receipt of similar awards under the new armed forces compensation scheme.</p>

We expect the publication of details of all purchases from suppliers of items over £500 to unleash an army of 'armchair auditors' who will ensure councils push for the best value for money.

 Those who are injured deserve our greatest support. Our policies allow the services to retain those who have been seriously injured, if they wish to stay, for as long as there is a worthwhile role or it is judged to be in the interest of the individual and the service. When an individual can no longer undertake their current role, for medical reasons, they are able to look for other roles that they are medically capable of fulfilling. Where a job can be found, and they are either qualified or can be trained for the job, the individual may be transferred to that post.</p>

 The aim of the discharge medical assessment is to assess and record the medical status and functional capacity at the time of discharge. It is conducted by a doctor during an individual, face to face consultation. The total time spent conducting these assessments can vary from case to case but typically lasts approximately 60 minutes. This currently includes a self-declaration, formal health check (including  hearing and a comprehensive physical examination) and a review of all significant episodes of ill health during service.</p>

In most cases individuals still in service will not have re-registered with an NHS General Practitioner (GP) by the time of their Release Medical, and therefore the individual is provided with a copy of the FMed 133 to pass to their new NHS GP. The FMed 133 also provides the new NHS GP with a single service-specific address from where the individual's full medical records may be obtained, which includes the completed FMed 1 form. The individual must consent to the transfer of their FMed 133 form to their GP and to the GP having access to their service medical records.</p>

 Between 2002-03 and June 2010, some 1,150 Urgent Operational Requirements (UORs) were approved, of which some 550 were for operations in Iraq and some 600 for operations in Afghanistan. Some UORs have been subject to re-approvals as requirements have evolved and some will have been provided in both theatres, so a single capability may be counted more than once in these numbers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_863"><a name="100727w0007.htm_para11"><a name="10072820000409">Some 290 UORs have been approved and are recorded as having a current financial liability. It would be inappropriate to list details of what equipment may be the subject of each of these UORs as its disclosure would, or would be likely to, prejudice the capability, effectiveness or security of the armed forces. The average cost of UORs approved last financial year (2009-10) was approximately £8 million. UOR timeframes reflect the operational urgency of the requirement-many deliver well within a year of the requirement being identified, and 18 months is the maximum planning horizon.</p>

The figure excludes the cost of non-Government Legal Service lawyers, such as the legal advisers to the three service branches, and the costs of legal services incurred by our Trading Funds, which lie outside our departmental accounting boundary.</p>

 The Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill was introduced on 22nd July and sets out revised rules for the distribution of seats. Rule 2 provides that the electorate of any constituency must be within 95% to 105% of the United Kingdom electoral quota. There are only three possible exceptions:</p>
<a name="100727w0007.htm_brev4"><a name="10072820007143"><ul><p class="tabletext">Rule 6 preserves the existing constituencies of Orkney and Shetland and Na h-Eileanan an Iar. These constituencies have small populations and are not easily reached from the mainland. They have already been recognised either in legislation or in practice in previous boundary reviews as justifying particular treatment. We have concluded therefore that exceptions for these areas are justified by their particular geography.</p>
</ul><a name="100727w0007.htm_brev5"><a name="10072820007144"><ul><p class="tabletext">Rule 4 requires that no constituency will be larger than 13,000 square kilometres and that a constituency larger than 12,000 square kilometres would not have to be within 95% of the UK electoral quota, if a Boundary Commission is satisfied that it is not reasonably possible for the constituency to comply with Rule 2. This rule would not, however result in additional representation for a part of the UK where it was applied and all other constituencies in that part of the UK must be within 95-105% of the UK electoral quota. Rule 4 simply aims to prevent extremely geographically large constituencies from having to be created in sparsely populated areas in order to meet the parity requirements.</p>
</ul><a name="100727w0007.htm_brev6"><a name="10072820007145"><ul><p class="tabletext">Rule 7 applies only to Northern Ireland. Because a whole number of constituencies must be allocated to each part of the UK, the average number of electors in each constituency in each part of the UK will be different from the UK electoral quota. This difference might have a particular impact in Northern Ireland due to the small size of the electorate, and might unfairly constrain the ability of the Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland (BCNI) to take account of other factors set out in the Bill, such as  <br>

geography and local ties. The size of the other parts of the UK make this problem manageable elsewhere. The Bill therefore provides that if the rounding effect is of a particular magnitude, and the BCNI considers that either their ability to take other factors into account or to complete the review within the deadline set out in the Bill would be unreasonably impaired, then the BCNI may propose constituencies that vary from the UK electoral quota by a fixed amount (the difference between the UK electoral quota and the electorate of Northern Ireland divided by the number of seats allocated to Northern Ireland).</p>

 The criteria were that food safety should remain independent of Government, but that wider food policy issues should not. It follows that wider food policy for England, where not concerning food safety, has been transferred from the Food Standards Agency (FSA) to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department of Health.

 The Government recognise the importance of the contribution which game management makes to the creation and management of the relevant habitat types.

 On 6 July this year, the Forestry Commission announced a £600,000 support package to support woodland owners in tackling the outbreak of Phytophthora ramorum infection in larch trees in south-west England and south Wales. The package has been put in place as part of DEFRA's five-year Phytophthora programme, which is being managed by the Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera). The first £100,000 has been earmarked to give private sector owners access to professional advice about how to have infected trees felled and marketed in ways that comply with biosecurity and other regulations.

These surveys have intensified and are ongoing, supported by aerial surveillance by helicopter. Notice has now been served on 373 hectares in Cornwall, which have been confirmed with the infection since the initial outbreak was discovered. Only one new infected site was found between April and June this year. Most of the infected sites are on the public forest estate.</p>

 It is our priority to ensure that those who apply for asylum in the UK have their applications processed as quickly as possible. That is why, as outlined in the Partnership Programme, the Government are committed to exploring new ways to improve the current asylum system to speed up the processing of applications. The UK Border Agency is working to meet this commitment and improve the asylum process, which will help promote swifter refugee integration and, where asylum is refused, will assist in ensuring the return and reintegration of failed asylum seekers is done as smoothly and effectively as possible.</p>

 Due to changes in the computer systems used to record travel costs and/or the way travel costs have historically been recorded we are unable to provide complete data. The Home Office HQ and UK Border Agency moved to the current system in October 2008. Other agencies and NDPBs did not have systems in place for the whole period and/or do not separate out travel costs from other expense types. It would have represented a disproportionate cost to obtain data from all NDPBs, but we have included in our response data from the Executive agencies. The table provides all available data.</p>

 The Lisbon Treaty contains transitional provisions for measures adopted under the police and judicial co-operation title of the old Treaty on European Union. These provide for a transitional period of five years to apply in relation to those measures. During this period the European Court of Justice continues to have limited jurisdiction and the European Commission is precluded from bringing infraction proceedings. At the end of the five-year period these measures will become subject to the full jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and the full enforcement powers of the European Commission.

 Police community support officers all have a set of 20 standard powers. They may be granted additional powers at the discretion of the chief officer of their force. There are three standard powers to issue fixed penalty notices (FPN) while five are discretionary. Some FPNs are issued on behalf of local authorities and these are produced in a number of different formats. Hence, training differs between forces, depending on local circumstances. There are no plans by the Home Office to issue guidance to police forces on these powers. The issue of guidance on the use of fixed penalty notices is an operational matter.</p>

The criteria and assessment for disability living allowance are not linked to the capability for work and are therefore distinct from the work capability assessment.</p>

 Supporting lone parents into paid work is essential to our strategy for the eradication of child poverty. As well as maintaining and building the necessary culture and infrastructure around provision of childcare and promotion of flexible working, the coalition Government will introduce a single work programme in the first half of 2011, which offers all benefit recipients, including lone parents, personalised help, delivered by contractors drawn from the private, public and voluntary sectors, as well as social enterprises.</p>

Currently, lone parents whose youngest child is 10 or over and who are not in paid work must ordinarily claim jobseeker's allowance and look for work, or employment and support allowance and undergo a work capability assessment. Before that, they can claim income support. The age of the youngest child will be reduced to seven in October 2010, and the June 2010 Budget announced that it would be lowered to when the youngest child enters school or formal education.

2. The official CPI index starts in 1996 but historical estimates back to 1988 have been calculated based on archived RPI data. These estimates can be considered a reasonable proxy to the official series. Further details are given in Economic Trends No. 541.

This figure covers not only the total number of examinations undertaken across all benefits, but also costs relating to written and verbal medical advice, fixed overheads, administrative costs, investment in new technology and other service improvements.</p>

1. Where an NHS Trust obtains Foundation Trust status part-way through any year, the data provided are only for the part of the year the organisation operated as an NHS Trust. The Department does not collect data from NHS Foundation Trusts.<br>
2. 'Debt' can be interpreted in a number of ways in relation to the finances of NHS Trusts. We have interpreted 'debt' to mean the total amount reported by each NHS Trust in their Balance Sheet in respect of bank overdrafts, loans, finance leases and Private Finance Initiative (PFI) arrangements. These are the items most readily identified with the term 'debt' in accounting terminology.<br>

 Academies are scheduled bodies under the Local Government Pension scheme and are therefore automatically members. Academy trusts will continue to be required to ensure that all employees at academies other than teachers have access to the LGPS. This requirement is included in their funding agreement.

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government announced the Government's intention in principle to abolish the remaining eight Government offices, subject to using the spending review to resolve consequential issues. A final decision will be made at the end of the spending review in the autumn. In the light of that announcement the six DFE-funded GO-based field forces will also come to an end earlier than planned. The six field forces to end early are: Safeguarding advisers; Children and Learners Strategic advisers; Child Poverty advisers; Teenage pregnancy co-ordinators; Sustainable schools network; and, Healthy schools co-ordinators (jointly funded with DH).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1124"><a name="100727w0013.htm_para11"><a name="10072820005898">Closing the GO network is in line with the Government's intention to remove administrative layers and simplify accountability across national and local government and service providers, and to reduce public expenditure. This also supports the Government's commitment to empower local authorities by removing top down monitoring, support and challenge. This approach aims to free up local authorities so they can focus on their own improvement agendas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1125"><a name="100727w0013.htm_para12"><a name="10072820005899">Local authorities themselves have called for greater freedom to plan and manage their own improvement and to be innovative in how they deliver high quality services for children and young people. We are keen to work with the sector in developing its own, sector-led, models for improvement-for example through the Centre for Excellence and Outcomes which shares good practice round the system and uses specialists seconded from the sector that councils can draw on as and when they want.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1126"><a name="100727w0013.htm_para13"><a name="10072820005900">The Government are determined to make child protection as effective as can be, with a focus on better frontline services. We will not do anything that will jeopardise or compromise child safety. We are seeking to put responsibility back to frontline services to ensure they have the right level of local scrutiny and accountability to drive up quality and provide the kind of children's services the public want.</p>

 The Government announced the local government contribution to cross-government savings on 10 June 2010. These savings include £311 million in the Department for Education's Area Based Grant (ABG) to local authorities in 2010/11. This reduction does not imply a direct cut to services funded by ABG, which include the provision of statutory information, advice and guidance to young people. The overall impact on total local government expenditure will be a 3.6% reduction, and we expect local authorities to manage this reduction across all their services, whether the initial funding source is formula or area-based. I am not expecting cuts to fall disproportionately on IAG services over others-these are critical services for young people. The Government believe that local authorities do have scope to make efficiencies this year.</p>
