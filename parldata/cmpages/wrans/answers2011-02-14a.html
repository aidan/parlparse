I stressed that the UK sees negotiations towards a two state solution as the only way to meet the national aspirations of Israelis and Palestinians and lead to a sovereign, viable and contiguous Palestinian state living in peace and security alongside a safe and secure Israel and their other neighbours in the region. This message was reinforced by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs when he met with Foreign Minister Lieberman on 24 January 2011.</p>

<i> [holding answer 11 February 2011]:</i><i> </i>The Department's key programme to tackle drug-related crime is the Drug Interventions Programme (DIP). A national programme across England and Wales, DIP is fully embedded within Leeds and is the main route for ensuring drug misusing adult offenders access treatment and support to reduce their offending. Research published by the Home Office in November 2007 found the overall volume of offending of a cohort of 7,727 individuals was 26% lower following identification through a positive DIP drug test in police custody. Around half the cohort showed a decline in offending of around 79% in the following six months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_574"><a name="110214w0001.htm_para36"><a name="11021424000373">Local information on drug related offending in Leeds showed that proven offending in 2009-10 by a cohort of class A drug misusing offenders was 23% lower than predicted for that cohort, given their offending history.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_575"><a name="110214w0001.htm_para37"><a name="11021424000374">The Government will be enabling local areas to invest significantly in 2011-12 to support the management of drug-misusing offenders. Funding to support the Drug Interventions Programme and the management of drug misusing offenders is around £125 million in 2011-12. Building on this, the police and other local partners in Leeds are delivering an integrated offender management approach to target and manage priority and problematic offenders to reduce crime, including drug related crime.</p>

<i> [holding answer 11 February 2011]:</i> As stated in the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill's impact assessment, elections across England and Wales for police and crime commissioners are estimated at £50 million in 2012. These estimates are based on costs of other national elections, and are therefore not broken down by police force area.</p>

<i> [holding answer 11 February 2011]:</i> We continue to drive the improvement and development of public library services through the Future Libraries Programme (FLP). The programme was announced in July and is led by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA) and the Local Government Association. They are supporting over 30 authorities participating in the programme to explore options that will help them to deliver the front line services communities want and need more efficiently. Learning from the 10 pilot projects will be shared widely to support non-participating authorities to deliver their services more efficiently too. In addition to the FLP the MLA promotes best practice and supports local authorities to develop their library services. Arts Council England will assume responsibility for the library service improvement and development agenda, following the abolition of the MLA.</p>

Other seating was replaced where meeting rooms would also be used as working areas and would need fully adjustable operator chairs. Some other new office furniture was purchased. This was predominantly 'bench style' desks with a much smaller footprint than the desks that were in our previous office and IT sundries.

The previous Government always had an AME margin and therefore, to provide a consistent comparison for implied DEL savings, the table .is based on the assumption that the previous Government would also have set an AME margin of £4 billion by 2014-15. The cuts implied in 'policy inherited by the Government' are therefore made up of £52 billion (including £44 billion DEL savings) as set out in table 1.1 of the June Budget, plus £4 billion of further DEL savings that we assumed the previous Government would have made to fund the AME margin. This gives a gross figure for policy inherited by the Government of £56 billion. Total cuts by 2014-15, which include both the previous Government's cuts as well as this Government's cuts, as shown in the table 1.3, are £81 billion, which is net of the AME margin.</p>

The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of a figure, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV - for example, for an average of 200 with a CV of 5%, we would expect the population average to be within the range 180 to 220.<br>

 The Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated that some additional members, amounting to 1% of the value of the pay bill, would opt-out of all the public service schemes as a result of the increase in pension contributions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_772"><a name="110214w0004.htm_para11"><a name="11021429000838">Further consideration of the effects of this policy on the opt-out rate will be made as part of the process of determining the distribution of increases in contributions across members of the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme. We are engaging with employee representatives on the principles to apply across public service schemes and wish to implement change in a way which minimises increases in opt-out rates. The Government have already committed to implementing contribution increases in a progressive way so that higher earners pay higher rates than lower earners. We expect also to take into account that the indexation changes are likely to impact more on members of the whole career scheme, nuvos, than on members of the final salary schemes.</p>

 The Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme rules set out the calculation of pensions payable to members on retirement. A copy of the rules can be found in the Library of the House and also on the civil service website. The pensions of classic and premium members are based on final salary and pensions at retirement are the same regardless of the index used for uprating. nuvos members have their pensions based on their salary in each and every year of their career, and each year's pension is uprated in line with inflation. It is therefore not possible to calculate nuvos pensions solely on the basis of salary at retirement.</p>

A finished consultant episode (FCE) is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.<br>
<sup>(2)</sup><i> Number of Episodes with a main (named) or secondary procedure</i><br>
The number of episodes where the procedure (or intervention) was recorded in any of the 24 (12 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and four prior to 2002-03) procedure fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. A record is only included once in each count, even if the procedure is recorded in more than one procedure field of the record. Note that more procedures are carried out than episodes with a main or secondary procedure. For example, patients undergoing a 'cataract operation' would tend to have at least two procedures-removal of the faulty lens and the fitting of a new one-counted in a single episode.<br>
<sup>(3)</sup><i> Cataract Surgery Treatment</i><br>

<i> ICD-10 codes:</i><br>
H25.- Senile cataract<br>
H26.- Other cataract<br>
H28.0A Diabetic cataract<br>
H28.1A Cataract in other endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases<br>
H28.2A Cataract in other diseases classified elsewhere<br>

 Rates for remuneration for chairs and non-executive directors in national health service trusts (including ambulance trusts), strategic health authorities, special health authorities and primary care trusts were determined by the Public Sector Pay Committee in 2006. They have been uplifted in line with the pay increase for senior executive staff under the Pay Framework for Very Senior Managers in Strategic and Special Health Authorities, Primary Care Trusts and Ambulance Trusts, in line with the Government's response each year to the recommendations of the Senior Salaries Review Body. In line with the coalition Government's announcement of a two-year pay freeze for public sector staff earning over £21,000, there are no plans to review the amounts further.</p>

 Currently over 17 million people have joined the organ donor register in the United Kingdom and there are a range of ongoing activities to promote organ donation. In autumn 2009, NHS Blood and Transplant launched a UK-wide public awareness campaign to encourage more people to join the organ donor register and to discuss their wishes in relation to organ donation with family members. NHS Blood and Transplant also work in partnerships with the national health service, commercial and third sector organisations to support local events around the country or national initiatives such as joining the register when registering with a doctor. From July 2011 we are running a pilot whereby all applicants applying for a driving licence online will be required to answer a question about organ donation. It is hoped that by ensuring applicants spend time reading the question and considering their response, a higher number of people will join the organ donor register. We will evaluate this pilot, and if it is successful in increasing the number of people on the organ donor register, we will consider rolling it out across other areas.</p>

 The White Paper 'Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS' describes the Government's vision to create a more autonomous and accountable national health service.

A significant amount of cancer care is best commissioned for populations covering one and a half to two million and, where population size requirements mean that a single GP consortium is too small to commission a particular service, then GP consortia will wish to work collaboratively. GP consortia will be able to decide whether they wish to identify a lead consortium for commissioning more specialised cancer services or to do so through commissioning support organisations.</p>

 Public Health England will be responsible for immunisation as one means of preventing infectious disease. It will be responsible for the national immunisation schedule and setting standards as advised by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation and will fund the delivery of immunisation programmes via two routes: local authorities and the NHS Commissioning Board. We propose that local authorities should be responsible for commissioning immunisation programmes primarily delivered through schools, such as the human papillomavirus vaccine and the teenage booster (against tetanus, diphtheria and polio) from a range of providers. Local authorities will also work closely with Public Health England, the national health service and local partners to ensure coordination of any immunisation response during a public health incident.

Secondly, an Employers' Liability Insurance Bureau which would be a compensation fund of last resort for those individuals who are unable to trace employers' liability insurance records, ensuring they are able to receive compensation for injuries or diseases sustained during the course of their employment.

 On 13 January, the Government published a Green Paper, "Strengthening families, promoting parental responsibility: the future of child maintenance" outlining proposals to reform the child maintenance system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_818"><a name="110214w0005.htm_para11"><a name="1102152000066">The proposals aim to tackle the current situation, where it is estimated that there are over 3 million children in separated families, but just under 50% benefit from child maintenance. Research suggests that around half of the parents who use the Child Support Agency would be likely to make a family-based arrangement, if they had the right support. The Government aim to do this by providing more integrated support to encourage people to make family-based arrangements, which are more flexible and collaborative and are better for children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_819"><a name="110214w0005.htm_para12"><a name="1102152000067">For those who cannot make family-based arrangements, there is and will continue to be, a statutory child maintenance service. This is currently delivered by the Child Support Agency, part of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_820"><a name="110214w0005.htm_para13"><a name="1102152000068">The Commission have confirmed that, in order to improve the collection rate within the statutory service, the Child Support Agency is increasing the use of tough enforcement measures, including deducting money directly from bank accounts and seizing property and other assets. It can also apply to the courts to have culpable parents disqualified from driving and even sent to prison.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_821"><a name="110214w0005.htm_para14"><a name="1102152000069">The Child Support Agency has also taken a number of steps to enhance the way it recovers arrears. This includes re-deploying over 400 members of staff into pursuing historic arrears; and when a non-resident parent misses a payment and legal action is appropriate, ensuring that this commences within 12 weeks.</p>

 The Department has not employed any certified librarians between 2000 and 2011. The chartered status of librarians employed by the Department during the same period is not held centrally. It would incur disproportionate cost to examine 11 years' worth of staff records to establish exact numbers. However, information on the chartered status of all librarians in membership of the Chartered Institute of Librarians and Information Professionals (CILIP), the professional body which awards chartership following qualification and evidence of professional development, is publicly available and published in the "CILIP yearbook 2010", Facet Publishing, 2010. ISBN 9781856046787. The Department currently employs 16 librarians of whom nine are chartered.</p>

A report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies published earlier this year indicated that the introduction of the universal credit will help meet the coalition agreement commitment to tackle the worst of the couple penalty in the tax credit system. It is also anticipated that the universal credit will, on average, reduce the couple penalty facing those on the lowest incomes.</p>

 The Department draws on a wide range of sources to inform our understanding of the needs of disabled people, including those in living at home, hospital or in a residential care home. In addition, I have met with a number of disabled people and disability organisations regarding the proposed reforms to the mobility component of DLA. I have also encouraged people to put forward their views on the measure to remove the DLA mobility component from people in state funded residential care as part of the wider consultation on DLA reform which will end on 18 February 2011.</p>

Small changes should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.  6. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication 'Households Below Average Income' series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or 'equivalised') for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living, equivalised using Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development equivalisation factors.  7. Median incomes have been provided rather than mean incomes because the income distribution is skewed with some outliers with high incomes. 8. Weekly incomes have been rounded to the nearest pound sterling.  9. Figures have been presented on a Before Housing Cost and an After Housing Cost basis. For Before Housing Costs, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income, while for After Housing Costs they are.  <i> Source:</i>  Households Below Average Income, DWP.<br>

 The spending review sets out the Ministry of Defence's core budget for the next four years. The budget for the spending review period includes ambitious but achievable targets for delivering non front-line and efficiency savings of some £4.3 billion over the next four years. We are determined to deliver these. This period is the start of a process to bring the Defence budget back into balance. As we are continuing to develop and refine our Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) implementation plans it is not sensible to speculate about the overall cost of the future Defence programme.</p>

 The Strategic Defence and Security Review, undertaken as part of the comprehensive spending review, included a commitment to maintain and further develop the medical support provided by the Defence Medical Services and the NHS. Specifically, it committed an additional £20 million per year for the provision of health care to service personnel. Plans have yet to be finalised but this funding is likely to be applied mostly to providing additional health care personnel, including enhancements to mental health provision, rehabilitation units and at the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine and Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre.</p>
