 In 2009, this Department reviewed remote gambling regulation in Britain, and found it was not working as well as had been intended. Following a public consultation on 14 July 2011, I announced to Parliament proposals for reforming our regulation. This will mean consistent protection for British consumers as all overseas operators will be subject to the same regulatory standards and requirements as British-based operators, for example in relation to problem gambling, preventing underage play and reporting suspicious betting patterns.</p>

 The Secretary of State for Education and the Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport have not had any meetings to discuss accessibility for all age groups to the creative industries. Discussions between our two Departments have primarily focused on the independent review of cultural education that we jointly commissioned Darren Henley to produce by the end of the year. It will consider how we ensure that every child has access to a wide variety of high quality cultural experiences.</p>

               <a name="11102147000415"> It is worth noting also that since July 2010, the Cabinet Office has imposed a pan-Government freeze on external consultancy expenditure to the effect that all intended expenditure below £20,000 has to be approved at Director (1 star) level and above £20,000 with less than nine months duration approved at ministerial level. All consultancy requirements valued above £20,000 and within an intended duration longer than nine months have to be approved by the Efficiency Reform Group.</p>

 At their meeting on 5 October 2011, NATO Defence Ministers endorsed the NATO Defence Planning Capability Report 2010-11 which acknowledged that NATO relies on a few nations, particularly the United States, for provision of costly and advanced capabilities. The report included recommendations to focus on addressing identified capability shortfalls and deficiencies; emphasise multinational procurement cooperation in the delivering of capabilities where appropriate and to work to improve NATO's standardisation process.

 In discharging his duty under the Academies Act 2010, the Secretary of State for Education, my right hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove), will decide whether to establish a free school or an academy. As part of that decision making process, local authorities have a key strategic role to play as a champion for children and families. We have already seen good examples of local authorities supporting parents and communities who want to set up free schools and who promote academies in order to improve standards.</p>

This includes an agreement suppliers will put a prompt on energy bills informing customers how to get the lowest tariff and will write to about eight million customers to tell them what they could save by switching to direct debit. The extended carbon emissions reduction target (CERT) includes a number of changes that will encourage energy suppliers to provide insulation to off the gas grid homes.</p>

 In early 2012, the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) plans to consider new information and analysis which has become available since it formulated its initial recommendations on fresh frozen plasma in 2009. The evidence to be considered by SaBTO includes that from the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens which takes account of evidence from Imperial College and other research groups. In the light of that evidence, SaBTO will consider whether the conclusions they reached in 2009 should be reviewed, and whether they wish to make recommendations on this matter to United Kingdom Health Ministers. Dependent on SaBTO's conclusions an impact assessment may be completed for Ministers consideration and published in due course.</p>

 Bt proteins are active components of some pesticide products and are also found in a number of insect-resistant genetically-modified crops. In both cases the safety of residual Bt proteins in food is evaluated as part of the relevant authorisation systems. Bt proteins are of low toxicity to mammals and the safety assessment is not based on assumptions about whether or not they are absorbed into the blood supply. Nevertheless, the available data from in <i>vitro</i> tests show that Bt proteins are rapidly broken down by digestive enzymes in the same way as most other proteins in the diet. There are no current plans to sponsor such research.</p>

 The Government recognises the important contribution made by clinical nurse specialists and the value that patients place on having their specialist expertise and support. Under our proposals for reform, providers of national health service funded care will continue to be responsible for the skill mix of their workforce and for ensuring that staff, including specialist nurses, are trained and competent in their roles. Commissioners will have the freedom to commission pathways of care  <br/>

 I refer the hon.

In practice, to the extent that the rate reduction from 20% to 5% was passed on to consumers, the price of home improvements would fall, demand for them would increase, and the cost of the reduction would be greater than the conventional figure given in the earlier answer, as the expenditure on reduced rate home improvements would likely be at that expense of expenditure on standard-rated goods and services.</p>

            <p>support is available. The recent Sayce review recommended changes that will increase the number of people who are able to benefit from Access to Work and raise awareness about its availability amongst disabled people and employers. A public consultation following the review has just closed and we will be considering ideas and reactions from that consultation and publishing a statement in due course.</p>

If eligible, they are then able to print off a new Pre-Employment Eligibility Letter which will help build their confidence when applying for jobs and can be shown to prospective employers. This delivers the commitments in the coalition programme to reform Access to Work, so that disabled people can apply for jobs with funding already secured for any adaptations and equipment they will need.</p>

We estimated in the recent impact assessment, ‘Conditionality Measures in the 2011 Welfare Reform Bill’, that the change will help 20,000 to 25,000 extra lone parents into work in steady state. Table 2 shows the estimated administrative costs of the extension LPO from lone parents with a youngest child aged seven or over to those with a youngest child five or over.
