The Comptroller and Auditor General had previously reported on the Commission&#146;s expenditure in this area in his 2002-03 report, and this report includes a summary of the progress made by the Electoral Commission in implementing recommendations he made then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_416"><a name="61025w0004.htm_para1"><a name="06102568000163">The Committee is grateful to the Comptroller and Auditor General for this further report on an area to which the Electoral Commission devotes each year a significant proportion of its overall financial resources. The Committee has published it as an appendix to its first report 2006 and, as that report makes clear, will be following up the conclusions and recommendations with the Electoral Commission. The Committee&#146;s report was laid before the House on 25 July 2006 as House of Commons paper number 1581. Copies have been placed in the Library and are now available in the Vote Office.</p>

 To ask the hon.

 The effect of section 3(4) of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 is to disqualify from appointment as an Electoral Commissioner a wide range of people who have been actively involved with political parties, or held elective office, over the preceding 10 years. At its meeting on  3 May 2006, the Speaker&#146;s Committee agreed to write to the Lord Chancellor raising the issue of whether these restrictions reduced the effectiveness of the Electoral Commission in discharging its functions, and to seek to place the exchange of correspondence in the public domain.</p>

 I regularly meet my EU counterparts, and our discussions include the situation in Zimbabwe. Foreign Ministers discussed Zimbabwe at the General Affairs and External Relations Council this month. The EU Common Position on Zimbabwe remains firm. The UK will press for extension of targeted measures against members of the Zimbabwe Government, due for review next February. EU members share deep concern for the plight of Zimbabweans resulting from bad governance. This was most recently demonstrated through the statement of condemnation of the brutal handling and serious abuse of the trade union demonstrators in Harare by the Zimbabwean authorities.</p>

 Between 2001 and March 2006 DFID spent over &#163;390 million on reconstruction and development in Afghanistan. Afghanistan is DFID&#146;s fifth largest programme and we are Afghanistan&#146;s second largest bilateral donor, spending over &#163;100 million in 2005-06. We are focusing on: building effective state institutions; improving economic management and improving rural livelihoods. The best way to do this is by supporting Afghans themselves&#151;which is why over 70 per cent. of our aid goes directly to the Government of Afghanistan. Afghanistan remains one of the UK&#146;s top priorities and we have provided valuable support to the Government who have made great progress over the last five years.</p>

This programme will construct 200 wells in and around Lashkar Gah city by end March 2007, and 49km of road will be under construction by then.

The programme is evaluating at least 10 different small-scale agri-processing industries, and producing case studies of enterprises that prove to have value added. For example tomato paste.

From the total allocation, half has been committed and all will be spent by March 2007. To date, nearly fifty such projects have been funded and implemented. These funds have provided humanitarian assistance to victims of the drought, constructed permanent vehicle checkpoints to improve security, improved security around the shrine in Gereshk, reinforced the river bank walls and provided flood defences for the Bowlan bridge.

 The refrigerant to be used is R134a (HFC 134a). This is in line with my Department's policy for all major construction projects. The Department's policy is for natural ventilation for buildings whenever possible and only to install cooling systems where absolutely necessary. Where cooling cannot be avoided, designers are required to investigate systems which minimise environmental impact in terms of ozone depletion and global warming, using refrigerants with a zero ozone depletion potential (ODP) such as R134a and R66.</p>

We note the most recent assessment by the ICTY Chief Prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, relating to Serbia, delivered on 16 October, which stated that there remain grave deficiencies in Serbia&#146;s efforts, both at operational and political levels. We understand the Chief Prosecutor also feels that the authorities of the Republika Srpska within Bosnia and Herzegovina should be doing more to co-operate with the ICTY. We urge all the countries of the region to co-operate fully with the ICTY.</p>

We also strongly supported UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1591 which established a panel of experts to review the Darfur situation and submit recommendations on further sanctions to the Sanctions Committee. The panel reported at the end of September. We are considering with our UN Security Council partners whether further sanctions on any of the parties to the conflict will help solve it. Our priority is to press all parties to implement the Darfur Peace Agreement. A UN peacekeeping force, as foreseen in UNSCR 1706, is best placed to prevent further conflict. We are working at the UN to establish this force. We are, with our partners, pressing the government of Sudan to agree to it. My right hon.

 The military situation in Darfur remains critical. There has been renewed fighting between Sudanese Government forces and the non-signatories to the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) since late August, in contravention of UN Security Council resolution 1591. This fighting has had a disastrous impact on delivery of much-needed humanitarian assistance. Over 50,000 people have been displaced since the fighting began. Some 1.9 million people are displaced in Darfur and 3.6 million need assistance to meet their basic needs. There has been a major increase in rape and gender-based violence. Many humanitarian organisations are considering pulling out altogether because of the security risk. Cross-border attacks from Darfur into Eastern Chad are also continuing, with Eastern Chad now host to some 200,000 refugees from Darfur. The UK utterly condemns this fighting and stresses urgently the need for all parties to end military attacks.</p>

 Depending on their personal circumstances, carers have access to the full range of social security benefits. Those who are not gainfully employed and provide regular and substantial care of at least 35 hours a week for a severely disabled person receiving attendance allowance or the equivalent rates of the disability living allowance care component or constant attendance allowance can be entitled to carer&#146;s allowance.

 A short course GCSE in citizenship studies has been offered since 2003. This was developed to give pupils the opportunity to obtain a qualification recognizing their achievements at key stage 4. Over 54,000 candidates took the GCSE in 2006, an increase from 38,000 in 2005. It remains the fastest growing GCSE subject. Due to demand from schools we have developed subject criteria for both a full course GCSE and A level with a view to examination boards offering these qualifications.</p>

Within subject centres there is active sharing of good practice in developing employability skills within degrees and other HE provision. Individual HE institutions are taking forward a range of measures designed to improve graduates employability, for example by introducing work placements, personal development planning or helping students to develop critical and interpersonal skills.

Central Government funding on grant-maintained schools has been apportioned to under-fives, primary and secondary sectors using pupil numbers.  3. Figures from 2003-04 onwards reflect the transfer of responsibility from the Department to LEAs of costs relating to teachers&#146; pensions.  4. We only forecast expenditure figures for one year on from the outturn statements.  <i> Sources:</i>  1997-98 to 2005-06 from the Education Select Committee table 1995-96 to 1996-97 from the November 2005 Education Bulletin 1993-94 to 1994-95 from the November 2004 Bulletin 1989-90 to 1992-93 from the departmental reports.<br>

 Energy targets for school projects within BSF are set within part L of the building regulations which require that buildings that are constructed to today&#146;s standards are 40 per cent. more energy efficient (i.e. emit 40 per cent. less carbon through energy use) than those built five years ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_509"><a name="61025w0013.htm_para1"><a name="061025101000883">Part L building regulations also require that renewable energy sources and other low carbon technologies are considered, and implemented where technically, practically and economically feasible. The regulations set an overall target for carbon emissions which implies that 10 per cent. of a building&#146;s energy demand is met using renewable energy technologies&#151;where renewable energy technologies are not adopted then the overall carbon reduction target must be met in other ways (e.g. through improved energy efficiency). Many planning authorities have also introduced a specific requirement for renewable energy which is typically set at 10 per cent. of predicted energy demand, and new schools must satisfy these local planning requirements.</p>

<i> [holding answer 24 October 2006]: </i>The cost of subsidising the annual rate of interest on the stock of English and Welsh maintenance loans was &#163;355 million in financial year 2005-06. This is the amount released from the interest subsidy provision as stated in the FY 05-06 departmental resource accounts. The calculation of annual cost is based on a number of variable factors, including the closing and average values of the loan stock, the cost of capital and interest added to the loans each year.</p>

<i> [holding answer 24 October 2006]:</i> The new maintenance grant and the equivalent special support grant were introduced for new full-time English domiciled students who started their course in September 2006 or later. The grant is means-tested and my Department anticipates that around 30 per cent. of new full-time English domiciled students in 2006/07 will receive the full grant, while around 50 per cent. will receive either a full or partial grant.</p>

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what recent considerations he has given to permitting the reclamation of VAT on fundraising activities by voluntary organisations. [96615]</p>

 Under the normal rules of VAT, VAT registered voluntary organisations can reclaim the VAT that they incur, including on their fundraising costs, when this relates to taxable business activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_560"><a name="61025w0019.htm_para1"><a name="0610267000522">Charities also benefit from special VAT exemptions and reliefs on the income of certain fundraising activities&#151;such as the sale of goods and services at certain fundraising events, and the sale of donated goods. European VAT agreements entered into by successive governments mean that it is not possible to extend these fundraising reliefs and exemptions, or to introduce any new ones.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_561"><a name="61025w0019.htm_para2"><a name="0610267000523">The voluntary sector&#146;s irrecoverable VAT costs have been considered by the Government in two major reviews since 1997. In the course of these reviews it was not possible to find a VAT solution that was practical, efficient, affordable, well-targeted and based on principle. Therefore, the Government have focused their support for charitable giving outside the VAT system, for example through gift aid, under which charities can claim the equivalent of 28p for every &#163;1 donated. In 2005-06 the Government repaid &#163;728 million to charities under this scheme.</p>

It is a one per cent sample of all employees who are members of pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) schemes, but because of its sampling frame, it has difficulty capturing data on people with very low pay. It is therefore likely to under-represent relatively low paid staff earning below the tax threshold.</p>

Whilst this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.  <i> Source:</i>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The Information Centre for Health and Social Care.<br>

1. Information regarding the numbers of dentists was provided by The Information Centre for health and social care and NHS Business Services Authority (NHS BSA).<br>
2. Dentists consist of principals, assistants and trainees. Information on NHS dentistry in the community dental services, in prisons or in hospitals is not included. Dental services provided privately are also excluded from the data.<br>
3. Figures for the numbers of dentists at specified dates may vary depending on the date the figures are compiled. This is because the NHS BSA may be notified of joiners or leavers to or from the GDS or PDS up to several months, or more, after the move has taken place. Information is up to date as at 13 October 2006.<br>
4. Numbers are based on national health service dentists on primary care trust (PCT) lists. Under the previous system of GDS (prior to  1 April 2006), a dentist could provide as much or as little NHS treatment as he or she chose. Since 1 April 2006, the level of dentistry provided depends on the contract with the PCT. In some cases, an NHS dentist may appear on a PCT list but not perform any NHS work in that period. Most NHS dentists do some private work. These data do not take into account the proportion of NHS work undertaken by dentists.<br>

 Progress on reducing health inequalities in England is measured against the public service agreement (PSA) target and the 12 headline indicators set out in the national health inequalities strategy, the Programme for Action. The most recent report, the Status Report on the Programme for Action, published in August 2005, shows that the gap in life expectancy and infant mortality has continued to widen since the target baseline. The life expectancy gap has increased by 1 per cent. for males and 8 per cent. for females. The gap in infant mortality has increased from 13 per cent. to 19 per cent.

 On infant mortality, the latest figures confirm the previously reported trend for England that, despite continuing improvements in infant mortality rates among all groups, the relative gap between routine and manual groups and the population as a whole has widened over recent years since the target baseline. The latest data, for 2002-04, show the infant mortality rate for the whole population (for all those with valid social class) was 4.9 deaths per 1,000 live births, compared to 5.9 per 1,000 for those in routine and manual groups. The gap in the rate between routine and manual groups and the population as  a whole was 19 per cent. in 2002-04, compared with  13 per cent. in the baseline period of 1997-99. This gap has remained unchanged since 2001-03.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_586"><a name="61025w0022.htm_para0"><a name="0610267001064">The infant mortality target is a national target. The Department is exploring ways of interpreting historical data to try and assess progress on the infant mortality target at local level and is not routinely monitored at local level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_587"><a name="61025w0022.htm_para1"><a name="0610267001065">Life expectancy has increased for both males and females for England as a whole but it has improved more slowly in the spearhead group of local authority areas with the worst health and deprivation indicators. In England, average life expectancy for males is 76.6 and for females 80.9, in the spearhead group it is 74.6 for males and 79.4 for females. The slower rate of improvement in has led to a widening of the relative gap in life expectancy between England and the spearhead group. The latest data for 2002-04, show that the average life expectancy in the Spearhead Group was 2.60 per cent. lower than the England average for males, and 1.90 per cent. lower than the England average for females. Therefore, the relative gap has widened by one per cent. for men and eight per cent. for women since the baseline, 1995-97.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_588"><a name="61025w0022.htm_para2"><a name="0610267001066">Five of the 11 spearhead local authority areas covered by the London strategic health authority are making sufficient progress to narrow the life expectancy gap for both men and women in line with target of reducing the gap by 10 per cent. by 2010. A further four areas are on track to narrow the gap for males or females. The remaining two areas are currently off track to meet the 2010 target.</p>

1. There are a large proportion of deliveries with unknown gestation length, therefore these figures should be interpreted with caution as the percentage of unknowns vary from 23 per cent. to 50 per cent. from year to year.<br>
2. The term premature is no longer in use. Births completed before 37 weeks of gestation are defined as pre-term.<br>
<i> Finished consultant episode (FCE):</i><br>
An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>
<i> Data quality:</i><br>
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 national health service trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The information centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>

The majority of the savings are recurrent and so will be made in future financial savings while the spend on turnaround is usually entirely one-off expenditure. These estimates have been based upon a small sample group and therefore must be treated with caution.</p>

 Awareness of the Welfare Food Scheme has been promoted to pregnant women in a number of ways. The booklet entitled &#145;Free Milk for pregnant women&#146; is widely available in doctors&#146; surgeries, health clinics, Job Centre Plus offices, Citizens Advice Bureaus as well as through health visitors and midwives.

 We will consult shortly on the establishment of a Migration Advisory Committee, which would advise Government on where in the economy migration might sensibly fill skills gaps.

 Sir Michael Ogden QC was independent Assessor of compensation for miscarriages of justice from February 1978 to July 1989, succeeding Sir Walker Carter, who had discharged these duties since 1957. Sir Michael was formally appointed to the role in November 1985 and was appointed under section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 in November 1988. Sir David Calcutt QC succeeded Sir Michael Ogden on 27 July 1989, and was re-appointed in July 1994 and July 1999. Lord Brennan assumed the role on 27 July 2001. He remains in post, having been re-appointed by the Home Secretary on 27 July this year for a second five-year term. No further competition for the post is intended until Lord Brennan&#146;s appointment is due to come to an end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_645"><a name="61025w0028.htm_para7"><a name="0610267001944">The only appointment that was subject to formal competition arrangements was Lord Brennan&#146;s. This was run in accordance with the guidance issued by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments, and in partnership with Capita RAS. It was advertised in The Lawyer, The Law Society Gazette, and Counsel magazine, and on the Top Jobs and Home Office internet sites. The 57 applications were assessed against the requirements of Schedule 12 to the Criminal Justice Act 1988 and the job specification. An initial sift was undertaken by independent assessors appointed by Capita RAS, and the five shortlisted candidates were interviewed by a panel comprising Mr. David Cooke (the then Deputy Director of the Criminal Policy Group in the Home Office, who chaired the panel), Ms Petra Laidlaw (an independent member provided by Capita RAS), and Sir David Calcutt.</p>

At the request of Sir David Calcutt, an additional, special daily fee rate was introduced on 1 August 1992 in respect of more complex cases. A table showing those rates follows. On 27 July 2006 a revised fee structure was implemented, under which Lord Brennan is paid &#163;360 per case for interim assessments and advice cases, &#163;500 per case for straightforward final assessments, and &#163;1,000 per day for complex cases.</p>

 I have been asked to reply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_649"><a name="61025w0029.htm_para0"><a name="0610267002047">The need for medium secure psychiatric provision varies across England and Wales and there are no specific target numbers for units in each county. Government funding has been provided to support an increase in medium secure psychiatric beds in recent years as outlined in the NHS plan. The onus now rests with the commissioners of secure psychiatric services, who are expected to commission an appropriate number of medium secure psychiatric beds to meet the demand for such beds for the population that they cover.</p>
