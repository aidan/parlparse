<a name="70612w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Frank Cook: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is his estimate of the number of persons resident in the United Kingdom who are authorised to possess a firearm for their personal protection <i>(a)</i> under a certificate, permit or other form of authority issued in accordance with the Firearms Act 1968, <i>(b)</i> by virtue of being servants of the Crown and <i>(c)</i> by any other exemption or method of authorisation. [3295]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70612w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 I have made no such estimate. Home Office guidance to the police in England, Wales and Scotland is that they should refuse applications for the grant of a firearm certificate for the applicant's protection or that of his premises. In Northern Ireland, there are approximately 11,000 people who hold certificates for firearms needed for personal protection. Information on the number of military personnel or other Crown servants currently authorised to retain service weapons for purposes of self-protection is not readily available.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70612w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Cook: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many lives he estimates will be saved each year by the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997; and on what basis this estimate is made. [3297]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70612w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 No such estimate can be prepared. The intention of the Act is to reduce the risk to public safety of another outrage such as that committed at Dunblane primary school by someone using a lawfully held handgun.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70612w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Cook: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make it his policy to place in the Library at monthly intervals a memorandum setting out the type and number of firearms which have been surrendered in accordance with the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 but which have not been destroyed, the reasons for not destroying them, the person or body to whom they have or are to be transferred and the price which has or is to be paid for them. [3299]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70612w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 No. Police forces will retain handguns surrendered to them until compensation has been paid. We will report the overall outcome of the surrender exercise to the House but obtaining monthly reports on the lines suggested would be a time-consuming and expensive exercise which would not be justified. There will be no sales of surrendered handguns.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70612w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Cook: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is his estimate of the total cost of introducing and implementing the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 and the present Firearms (Amendment) Bill. [3296]

<P>
<a name="70612w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The estimated total cost of implementing both the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 and the Firearms (Amendment) Bill is &#163;169 million. Of this figure, &#163;138 million is the estimated cost of implementing the prohibition on higher-calibre handguns contained in the Act which includes the cost of compensation payments for these, for their accessories and the police and central administration costs. The remaining &#163;31 million is the estimated cost of implementing the prohibition of small-calibre handguns envisaged by the Bill, including the cost of compensation payments for them and their accessories.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70612w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Cook: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what arrangements have been made for the destruction of firearms surrendered to the police in accordance with the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997. [3298]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70612w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Those firearms surrendered under the terms of the 1997 Act will be destroyed in accordance with local police arrangements. These will vary from force to force. A few firearms may be retained for police training purposes, and some may be taken by museums for public display.

<a name="70612w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 It is not possible to make a direct comparison between electoral registration figures and estimates of the resident population, because they are not compiled on the same basis. The 1997 electoral register for Great Britain published in February showed the highest ever number of parliamentary electors registered to vote and saw the largest annual increase since 1987. We will seek to encourage this continuing improvement in electoral registration.

<P>
<a name="70612w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend does not plan to forbid the use of Methyl Isobutyl Ketone (MIBK) by police forces. MIBK is the solvent used as a carrying medium in CS canisters carried by officers in 17 forces in England and Wales. It has a wide range of uses, for example as a food additive and as a solvent in certain paints and varnishes. It is also found naturally in oranges, grapes and vinegar. A great deal is known about MIBK. The Department of Health has advised that it is an appropriate solvent to use in CS canisters, and it has been used by the Gendarmerie National in France for 17 years without any serious medical concerns.
<P>

<a name="70612w01.html_para0">There have been isolated reports published which suggest that at very high levels MIBK may affect unborn foetuses in lower mammals. These reports and the other available scientific evidence have been assessed by the Home Office Police Scientific Development Branch, the Department of Health and the Ministry of Defence. Their advice is that the scientific evidence does not indicate that MIBK is a human teratogen (that is to say, produces foetal abnormalities).

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if it is standard procedure for United Kingdom police forces to provide firearms training systems that include training sequences designed to train police or other security personnel to fire on unarmed demonstrators; and if he will make a statement. [2775]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70612w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 It would be entirely wrong for police forces not to train officers, or anyone else, to fire on unarmed demonstrators. The only circumstances in which police officers are trained to use a firearm against an unarmed person are training in the use of plastic baton rounds against people engaging in serious public disorder. Plastic baton rounds may be used as a last resort, where conventional methods of policing have been tried and failed or are unlikely to succeed if tried, and where the chief officer decides such action to be necessary because of the risk of loss of life or serious injury or widespread destruction of property where the damage may lead to serious risk of loss of life or serious personal injury. The police in the United Kingdom are trained to respond with the minimum force required to counter effectively any threat which they or members of the public come under. The use of force is governed by section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967 which provides that a person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime. If my hon. Friend has any evidence

of any police force in the United Kingdom using such training sequences, I shall be grateful if she will let me have her evidence straightaway.

<a name="70612w02.html_para1">The Council agreed as "A" points, among other things, the Europol Drugs Unit budget for 1998, a joint action on co-operation on law and order and security, and a resolution on unaccompanied third-country national minors. Two actions covering Europol were also agreed, one covering how data will be stored and analysed and the other with the conditions of employment for Europol staff.

<a name="70612w02.html_para2">The Commission presented proposals for a future joint action on temporary protection for displaced persons. The proposals concern possible arrangements for European Union member states to respond in a co-ordinated way to situations where large numbers of refugees seek to enter the European Union from countries where events may have placed them in danger. In the light of preliminary discussion, the proposals will now be considered in detail in the appropriate working group.

Establishment of such a mechanism was agreed in principle, although some work is still needed on the finer points of the text.

<a name="70612w02.html_para4">There was agreement in principle to a Protocol to the Europol Convention, which would lay down the extent to which Europol staff will benefit from certain privileges and immunities when carrying out their official functions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70612w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 A number of recent planning applications have related to the construction of incineration facilities for the destruction of cattle slaughtered as part of the over 30 months scheme, rather than to those which show clinical signs of BSE for which provision exists already. Planning inspectors reach decisions on the basis of submitted evidence and published Government Planning Guidance. It is not appropriate to aim guidance solely at Planning Inspectors and on a single issue. Consideration is being given currently to whether there is a need to issue planning advice, to a wider audience, on facilities required to deal with wastes arising from the over 30 months scheme.

 A key aim will be to ensure that the environment is properly protected, while providing fair and flexible arrangements for access to water resources by water companies to meet properly managed demands in a sustainable way. Amongst the possible measures which will be studied are economic instruments in relation to abstraction.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70612w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Prescott: </B> 
 We are reviewing the United Kingdom's Climate Change Programme looking at policies and measures across all sectors which could contribute to a 20 per cent. reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from 1990 levels by 2010. These include improvements in areas such as domestic and industrial energy efficiency, measures to tackle emissions from the transport sector as part of the integrated transport strategy, and a large increase in the amount of electricity generated from renewable sources and combined heat and power schemes. We shall produce a revised programme after Kyoto.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment Transport and the Regions (1) if he will bring forward a comprehensive policy for domestic waste reduction, with special reference to control of packaging, reuse of materials and recycling, developed within local authorities and voluntary groups in partnership; and if he will make a statement; [3001]

[3002]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70612w03.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Government will be looking carefully at existing practice and policy in the field of waste management, to see how the contribution from recycling and other means of recovering value from waste can be maximised. At present, only 6.5 per cent. of household waste is recycled, and only 12 per cent. of municipal waste has some value recovered from it. Local 



<P>
<P><I>12 Jun 1997 : Column: 517</I><P>
authorities, voluntary groups, households and businesses all have a vital contribution to make in improving the sustainability of our waste management practices. Reduction of waste at source has an important part to play, and we hope to see the development of imaginative and effective initiatives to encourage it.
<P>

<a name="70612w03.html_para0">Current proposals for incineration plants will be considered, in the normal way, under the existing planning framework. We will keep under review the evidence on emissions from incinerators. It is essential that both new and existing incinerators meet stringent emissions standards to protect public health and the environment.

 The Department of the Environment's Contaminated Land Supplementary Credit Approval programme, which has a budget of &#163;14 million in the current financial year, provides support for capital costs incurred by English local authorities where they are responsible for the investigation or remediation of contaminated land. The programme also is able to provide support, in the form of additional grant-in-aid, to the Environment Agency where it is carrying out works to deal with water pollution from contaminated land.

<a name="70612w03.html_para2">The programme is aimed at tackling problems on sites owned by local authorities or those where authorities or the Environment Agency have responsibility to take action and cannot recover their costs from third parties. The Department operates an assessment and prioritisation procedure to ensure that the available funding goes to projects representing the greatest threat to health or the environment.
<P>

<a name="70612w03.html_para3">Some authorities have already been notified of support, where this is to meet on-going contractual commitments for projects funded in previous years.

<a name="70612w04.html_para0">Work will shortly be under way across a number of Government Departments co-operating together which will look closely at the problem of gazumping and will lead to detailed proposals which will be in the interests of everyone involved in the sale and purchase of homes.

There have, of course, been successive cuts to the HSE's grant-in-aid over recent years. Despite considerable difficulty, HSE has sought to meet these budget reductions with least harm to its key areas of work such as inspection and other field activity. Nevertheless, this can lead to heavy workloads associated with 



prosecution, discouraging it--especially when pitifully low fines from magistrates are taken into account. We are looking closely at this.<P>

<a name="70612w04.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Kidney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will review the arrangements in place currently for claims handling in respect of claims against operators of rail services, with particular reference to the experiences of those persons submitting claims arising out of the Rickerscote rail crash at Stafford on 8 March 1996. [2862]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70612w04.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The arrangements for claims handling are governed by the Claims Allocation and Handling Agreement (CAHA), which is currently being reviewed by the Rail Industry Disputes Resolution Committee--a committee of industry representatives with an independent Chairman. Their proposals for changes to the Agreement will be submitted to the Rail Regulator for approval.
<P>

<a name="70612w04.html_para1">The Rail Regulator has initiated a separate review of third party liability insurance in relation to "privately owned rail vehicles" (defined as ones which are both owned by a company outside the licensing regime of the Railways Act 1993 and which are operated without the benefit of a lease or other agreement which transfers liability for the vehicle to a licensed train operator). He believes that it is in the interests of both the rail industry and third parties that a practical solution is found to the third party liability issues surrounding such vehicles. I understand the Rail Regulator intends to publish a consultation document later this year.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70612w04.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Kidney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what public liability insurance is required of <i>(a)</i> Railtrack plc, <i>(b)</i> licensed operators of rail services and <i>(c)</i> other operators of rail services. [2861]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70612w04.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Jackson: </B> 
 Licensed operators, including Railtrack, are required by the Rail Regulator to carry third party liability cover of at least &#163;155 million, unless the Regulator agrees a lower figure in specific circumstances. In the case of companies providing services to the rail network who fall outside the Regulator's licensing powers, the level of third party liability insurance is a matter of commercial judgment. However, in the case of unlicensed contractors and sub-contractors, the Regulator has required licensed operators to provide, in their own insurance, cover for the difference between the contractor's insurance and &#163;155 million.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="70612w04.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Jackson: </B> 
 All licensed railway operators, including Railtrack, are required by their licences to be a party to claims handling arrangements approved by the Rail Regulator. The railway industry established the Claims Allocation and Handling Agreement (CAHA) in early

<a name="70612w04.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Jackson: </B> 
 The provision of capacity for the carriage of bicycles is a matter for the Franchising Director. Franchise operators are required by their Franchise Agreements to ensure that facilities are made available for the carriage of cycles on trains, so far as is reasonably practicable and subject to the availability of appropriate space on their rolling stock.
<P>

<a name="70612w04.html_para2">The Government are keen to see proper facilities for cyclists who wish to use the railway. We are currently reviewing the Franchising Director's Objectives, Instructions and Guidance. As part of our review, we will be considering what action the Franchising Director should take to encourage increased carriage of cycles on trains.

<P>

<a name="70612w04.html_para3">The Act does not require statistics to be kept in the form requested. To do so would incur disproportionate cost. However, in order to comply with their duties under the Act, departments are obliged to make arrangements for the safekeeping of their records, with a view to their possible selection and transfer to the Public Record Office and eventual release to the public. The general arrangements for extended closure or retention of public records are set out in Chapter 9 of the White Paper Open Government of July 1993 (CM.2290).

To ask the President of the Board of Trade if she will review the decision of the last Government not to hold an independent judicial inquiry into the financial affairs of Lloyd's of London. [2962]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70612w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Roche </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 June 1997]:</i> I have given careful consideration to the question of an enquiry into the past problems of Lloyd's of London ("Lloyd's").
<P>

<a name="70612w05.html_para0">I recognise the hardship suffered by many underwriting members of Lloyd's ("Names") as a result of the losses at Lloyd's in the late 1980s and early 1990s, despite suggestions that for the most part, the losses can be attributed to a series of natural and man-made disasters. Moreover, a number of adverse rulings in the courts in the United States extended the scope of policies underwritten at Lloyd's to cover certain asbestosis and pollution risks which were never envisaged when the policies were written. The position was worsened by the so-called "LMX" spiral, where syndicates and reinsurance companies in the London Market repeatedly reinsured one another at a time of poor market conditions. The various losses have been thoroughly investigated in some 27 independent reviews. Under the circumstances, it seems unlikely that further investigations will identify any information beyond that which is already known.
<P>

<a name="70612w05.html_para1">Some Names have suggested that they were the victims of fraud. None of the independent loss reviews, or the investigations carried out by my Department and the Serious Fraud Office, has uncovered any evidence sufficient to justify the institution of proceedings. Although people have claimed to have such evidence, they have consistently refused to make it available to my Department for examination. Of course, if anyone provides any new evidence to me, I shall consider it very carefully and act accordingly.
<P>

<a name="70612w05.html_para2">There are a number of other practical considerations which I have taken into account.
<P>

<a name="70612w05.html_para3">As the Companies Acts are not relevant to the Society of Lloyd's, the only powers available to instigate an investigation are powers under the Tribunals of Enquiry (Evidence) Act 1921. This is an extremely costly procedure which cannot be justified on the basis of the hearsay evidence available to me and when previous investigations, conducted much nearer the time, failed to produce any proper evidence. I also note that, given the complexity of the Lloyd's market, it could take many years to complete the process. The alternative would be an administrative enquiry which would have no powers to 



<P>
<P><I>12 Jun 1997 : Column: 525</I><P>
require the production of evidence and would therefore have to rely on the goodwill of the people against whom the allegations have been made.
<P>

<a name="70612w05.html_para4">With regard to improved regulatory standards for the future, I note there have been substantial changes to the regulatory arrangements since the events in question. The Government will be considering further the future regulatory arrangements for Lloyd's but I am afraid I do not believe that a further enquiry into past events will materially help that consideration.
<P>

<a name="70612w05.html_para5">Under the circumstances, I do not, therefore, propose to establish a public enquiry.

 We have already announced a review of policy to see what would be necessary and practicable to achieve 10 per cent. of UK's electricity needs from renewables by the year 2010. We have also announced a fundamental transport policy review and the need to promote energy conservation. We are reviewing the United Kingdom's Climate Change Programme, looking at policies and measures across all sectors which could contribute to a 20 per cent. reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from 1990 levels by 2010.

Spending on aid to Sierra Leone in the UK financial year 1996-97 was an estimated &#163;10.3 million and &#163;1.4 million to UN organisations. Spending in the current financial year will depend on developments following the military coup on 25 May.

The definition of a consultant episode is the period that a patient spends under the continuous care of a specific consultant in a specific health care provider. A hospital provider spell can comprise one or more consultant episodes. Hospital Episode Statistics will therefore pick up cases where the diagnosis was not made at birth and the baby was subsequently re-admitted. Information prior to 1989-90 recorded discharges and deaths and is therefore not directly comparable to Hospital Episode Statistics Data.

 The report to Congress by the US Administration on the enlargement of NATO provides a useful assessment of the relevant issues. In the current and foreseeable security environment, the Alliance will carry out the collective defence of both existing and new members and other missions by ensuring the necessary interoperability, integration and capability for reinforcement. On that basis, we do not expect NATO enlargement of itself to require significant changes to the capabilities already determined collectively by the Alliance as necessary to fulfil this strategy.

However, my Department's computer records on claims for compensation show that since 23 October 1986 we have been notified of 100 claims from former service personnel suffering from an asbestos-related illness due to their time in the Armed Forces. All of these claims for compensation had to be repudiated on the basis of Section 10 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 because they related to exposure before May 1987.

 I am extremely pleased that Sir Iain Glidewell, a retired Lord Justice of Appeal, has agreed to chair the independent Review of the Crown Prosecution Service. He will be assisted by Sir Geoffrey Dear who retires at the end of this week as HM Inspector of Constabulary and (a person with management and organisational experience). Sir Iain proposes to commence work on Monday 16 June 1997. The Review will examine closely the internal structures of the Crown Prosecution Service, together with its policies and procedures. It will also consider ways to enable the Crown Prosecution Service to inform victims of crime about prosecutions decisions. The Review will have the following terms of reference:

 At 1 June 1997 there were 381 licensed red meat slaughterhouses in England. The table below gives figures for each year from 1975 to 1996. Prior to 1993 red meat slaughterhouses in England were licensed not by MAFF but by local authorities. The figures for 1975 to 1992 have therefore been derived from records of State Veterinary Service visits during each year and are approximate.

 The Over 30 Months Scheme (OTMS) provides for compensation payments to producers for animals which can no longer be taken into the food or feed chain. There are no specific offences under the scheme for which local authorities have prosecuting responsibility although the movement of animals and the handling and processing of material arising from the scheme is governed by a range of more widely applicable legislation in which local authorities may have an enforcement role. No prosecutions have been brought by this Department for offences specific to the scheme and no central records are maintained from which local authority prosecutions under other legislation but relating to OTMS material could be extracted.

 <i>[holding answer 21 May 1997]:</i> The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC), which advises Ministers on BSE, considered the issue of BSE and the environment in May last year, including the past disposal of the carcases of cattle affected, or suspected of being affected, with BSE to landfill sites. It considered that although the spongiform encephalopathy agent was not yet fully characterised, there was good evidence to believe that individual molecules were not infectious and that infectivity was associated with macro molecular agglomerations indeed possibly with tissue fragments, albeit small ones. On this basis it concluded

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
"it was unlikely that leachate from landfill sites would present a significant risk and there was certainly no justification for taking heroic measures to excavate sites, even those which had previously been used for material such as BSE-confirmed cattle".

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="70612w09.html_para0">The Environment Agencies took over responsibility for the safe regulation of landfill sites in April 1996, and under Part II of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 they monitor ground and surface water quality in the vicinity of licensed landfill sites to check for leachate contamination. The Agencies have carried out a qualitative assessment of all the sites concerned taking into account the number of carcases buried, the degree of containment and the proximity of water sources. They have also carried out a further more detailed quantitative assessment of a selection of sites which were judged from the qualitative assessment to be typical of those sites that appeared to be most vulnerable. The results show that potential risks to be very low, less than one in a million years.
<P>

<a name="70612w09.html_para1">The conclusions of the assessment are in line with the advice previously given to Ministers by SEAC. The Committee has been given the opportunity to comment on the quantitative assessment and has given it its endorsement. The Environment Agencies are now considering how best to publish the report, and related work, and aim to do so shortly.
<P>

<a name="70612w09.html_para2">A list of the locations of the sites concerned and numbers per location is below. No BSE suspects have been disposed of by landfilling since 1991, when sufficient carcase incineration capacity came on stream to process the number of cases that were coming forward:

<a name="70612w10.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 The military coup of 25 May which overthrew Sierra Leone's democratically elected government has not yet been overturned. The coup leaders have been joined by the Revolutionary United Front guerillas who have waged a long war against the Sierra Leone government. It is unclear who, if anyone, is now governing Sierra Leone. There have been no reports of fighting in Freetown since 3 June though sporadic looting continues. Food and fuel are in short supply. We have deplored the coup. We are in touch with regional powers involved in efforts to find a peaceful negotiated settlement in Sierra Leone. We shall continue to work for the return of constitutional order to Sierra Leone without further bloodshed.

 I look forward to discussing Sierra Leone with others in the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) when it meets in London on 10-11 July 1997. CMAG was created at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Auckland in 1995 and has since its inception considered events in Sierra Leone. It will report to this year's CHOGM in Edinburgh in October. Officials are in close contract with the Commonwealth Secretariat on events in Sierra Leone.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will list the subject areas to which the Dutch presidency have proposed extending the co-decision procedure in Freedom, Security and Justice (SN 539/97 c 40); and the numbers of the articles and paragraphs in which these proposals are made.

 The draft Treaty text on an "area of freedom, security and justice" proposes a period of 3 years following the entry into force of the Treaty, during which consultation with the European Parliament, rather than co-decision, should continue to apply. The presidency continues to leave open the question of whether, on the expiry of this period, co-decision should apply to certain provisions of the Title.

 None. I am aware of the concern about the APO 4 allele, which is sometimes associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. I am not aware of evidence which could justify banning those who have the APO 4 allele from participating professionally in contact sports, even were there powers to do so.

The procedure for such appeals to set out in section 56 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1979. In the absence of an appeal the Lord Chancellor has no locus in the matter.

 The Government is currently reviewing the financial position of the NHS in Wales and we will be in a better position to do so when the audited accounts have been received.

 Yes.

 We will consult the Welsh Local Government Association and Local Education Authorities in Wales in the context of the forthcoming White Paper on Education on implementation of our policy of reducing infant class sizes to 30 pupils or less. That consultation will include an assessment of costs which will vary from area to area. Reduction of all classes to under 30 is not under consideration.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland for what reasons the Registers of Scotland have increased the cost of access to <i>(a)</i> the sasine search sheets and <i>(b)</i> the on-line database for the register of inhibitions. [2571]<P>
<P>
<a name="70612w14.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 The fee contained in the Fees in the Registers of Scotland Order 1995 (S.I. 1995 No. 1945) for the searching of any Register of Sasines search sheet affecting one property is &#163;7. There has been no increase in this fee. Private searchers enjoy special arrangements whereby a "badge" fee enables each searcher to have access to the search sheet between 08.30 and 16.30 each day. This preferential arrangement permits a "badgeholder" to make multiple searches during this time. A daily "badge" fee of &#163;30 was set in 1993 and was based on the &#163;5 fee for a search of any one search sheet contained in the 1991 Fees Order. The 1995 Fees Order increased this &#163;5 fee to &#163;7 and the daily "badge" fee, as part of a catch-up exercise, has been increased, pro rata and with effect from 1 May 1997 from &#163;30 to &#163;42.

<a name="70612w14.html_para1">The fee contained in the Fees in the Registers of Scotland Order 1995 (S.I. 1995 No. 1945) for searching each group of six names or less in the Register of Inhibitions and Adjudications is &#163;7. Historically, the fee for on-line searching of this computerised Register has borne no relation to the search fee as set up in successive Fees Orders. Over the years there has been a gradual catching-up exercise underway. Prior to 1 May 1997 the fee for searching each group of six names or less was &#163;0.94, an 86 per cent. discount on the fee as set out in the 1995 Fees Order. With effect from 1 May 1997 the discount has been reduced to 50 per cent. The new fee of &#163;3.50 for searching each group of six names or less in now related to the 1995 Fees Order.

 <i>[holding answer 11 June 1997]:</i> Teams have been set up in the Royal Group of Hospitals Trust and the Belfast City Hospital (BCH) Trust to take forward the decisions arising out of the Acute Hospitals Reorganisation Project. The process of implementation has already begun but in view of the inter-relationship of many of the specialties involved and the complexities arising from this, implementation will be on a gradual basis and is likely to take a couple of years. As promised by the Secretary of State earlier, I am presently looking again at the decision to centralise maternity and associated services in the BCH Tower Block.

In addition, and in accordance with the Guidelines issued by Sir Leonard Peach, the Commissioner for Public Appointments for Northern Ireland, applications for appointment were invited by advertisements in the Northern Ireland press. As a result, the Authority widely represents the community and continuity is provided by the continuing service of several individuals for a second term.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70612w15.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 The spending plans inherited by the Government for the period up to 1999-00 assume increases in Cyclical Social Security expenditure from future inflation upratings and future growth in the number of Income Support claimants and the average amounts of benefit paid to them. They are partly offset by an assumption of falling unemployment. Beyond 1999-00 the projections allow for additional growth in expenditure above what would be expected from inflation upratings, in line with that observed in the past. The Government are currently reviewing these plans and will announce the outcome in the Budget.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what was the total cost of mortgage interest tax relief in Scotland in the years 1995-96 and 1996-97; and what it is estimated to be for 1997-98. [2532]<P>

<P>
<a name="70612w17.html_spnew12"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The cost of mortgage interest relief in Scotland was estimated to be &#163;200 million in 1995-96.
<P>

<a name="70612w17.html_para2">This estimate has been obtained by applying the regional distribution of the cost of mortgage interest relief from analyses of Family Expenditure Surveys up to 1994, to the total figure for 1995-96. It is not possible to provide reliable estimates for mortgage interest tax relief in Scotland for 1996-97 or 1997-98.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what percentage of tax returns were received by the Inland Revenue <i>(a)</i> prior to 31 October, <i>(b)</i> between 1 November and 31 January, <i>(c)</i> between 1 February and 5 April and <i>(d)</i> more than 12 months after the date of issue following the end of the tax year resulted in fines and penalties for late submission not involving fraud or wilful neglect in each of the above categories. [2130]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70612w17.html_spnew14"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Few returns submitted within 12 months following the end of the tax year were likely to attract penalties for late submission. Returns submitted later than this were more likely to be subject to penalties.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what estimate she has made of <i>(a)</i> the loss of revenue to the Exchequer and <i>(b)</i> the loss of income to retailers in the United Kingdom due to the illegal importation of tobacco, wines and spirits. [2543]<P>

 Customs' current estimate of the total revenue evaded (excise duty and VAT) in a year through the smuggling of alcohol and tobacco is set out in the table below. The table also sets out Customs' estimate of the retail value of the smuggled goods at UK off-licence prices, including excise duty and VAT. The amounts actually lost to UK retailers and the Exchequer will be less than the amounts shown below. This is because many smuggled goods, particularly alcoholic products, represent additional consumption rather than substituting for similar goods purchased in the UK.

ONS figures cover all unemployment-related benefits i.e. they include those receiving National Insurance Credits only, although these only constitute a small proportion of the total (approximately 10 per cent). JSA specific counts can be provided by Department of Social Security but not to the required geographical breakdown--only for Great Britain.
<BR>
The ONS produces two measures of unemployment. The first, derived from the quarterly Labour Force Survey, is defined on a consistent and internationally recognised basis set out by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and counts as unemployed, people who are: a) without a paid job; b) available to start work within the next two weeks and c) have either looked for work in the past four weeks or are waiting to start a job already obtained.
<BR>
ONS also publishes the monthly claimant count, which is based on the UK administrative system and includes all people claiming unemployment-related benefits at Employment Service offices on the day of the monthly count, who on that day had signed on as

<BR>
Both measures are described and compared in the ONS booklet <i>How exactly is Unemployment Measured?</i>, a copy of which is enclosed. This booklet is also available in the House of Commons Library.

ONS information is only available on the total number of people claiming all unemployment-related benefits (Jobseeker's Allowance or National Insurance Credits). In April 1997 on an unadjusted basis, people age under 25 years and claiming unemployment-related benefits numbered 245 in the Winchester parliamentary constituency and 440,028 in the United Kingdom. If specific JSA breakdowns are required these are available from the Department of Social Security.
