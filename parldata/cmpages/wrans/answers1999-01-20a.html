 We are currently involved in a number of projects setting up and strengthening credit unions and self-help groups which provide financial and other services to their members and share the co-operative principles of user-management and mutual-ownership. These range from comparatively small organisations aiming to build the financial asset base of disadvantaged communities in a specific location to self-help group federations and co-operative banks serving large parts of the countries they operate in.

 <i>[holding answer 18 January 1999]:</i> With the support of this Department, a new harmonised accommodation rating scheme for hotels and guest accommodation was launched by the English Tourist Board, the AA and the RAC last year. Hotels are given a rating of 1 to 5 stars covering the whole visitor experience and Guest Accommodation is rated entirely on quality, using 1 to 5 diamonds. Inspections against the new standards began in January 1998 and the scheme will be launched to customers later this year. It will be included in Guide Books for 2000. The scheme is available through the AA and the RAC throughout the United Kingdom.

<P>
<a name="90120w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 Nicholas Mullen was convicted at the Central Criminal Court on 9 June 1990 of conspiracy to cause explosions and sentenced to 30 years imprisonment. He did not appeal against his conviction at that stage but, on 29 January 1998, obtained leave from the Court of Appeal to appeal against his conviction out of time. Although the consent of the then Attorney-General was required for the institution of the proceedings against Mullen, neither I nor my predecessors have been a party to the criminal proceedings which have been conducted by the Director of Public Prosecutions. There have been no proceedings in the High Court. The appeal is at present the subject of consideration by the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) which has heard argument and reserved judgment. The transcripts of the trial may be obtained, in accordance with usual procedures, from the official shorthand writers. It would not be appropriate for me to make any further observations in relation to a case currently under consideration by the court.

HMS Brave will be replaced by a new Type 23 frigate in 2000 as will HMS Coventry in 2001. The remaining five Type 22 frigates have a planned service life of approximately 23 years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90120w02.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The number of technical support personnel deployed to support four or eight RAF Harrier aircraft is dependent on several factors, including the operational requirements, the flying task, the number of hours to be worked in any one day and the amount of support available from the Host Nation. However, a flight of four or eight aircraft would be likely to generate a minimum of 79 and 128 technical support personnel respectively.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. All figures are estimates and are taken from the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data set based on the Family Resources Survey (FRS). The FRS does not include Northern Ireland.<P>

2. Only benefit units with at least one employee were considered when answering this question. Benefit units containing at least one person who was either fully or part-time self-employed were excluded.<P>

3. The income bands in the tables relate to the total net earnings of the benefit unit as opposed to the individual.<P>

4. The definition of employment used is: "whether the individual was employed and at work, or employed but away from work, in the last week".<P>

5. Where both members of a couple are employed, the value taken for the number of employees in the local unit of the firm was that for the head of the benefit unit, unless they were not working, in which case that for the spouse was assumed instead.<P>

6. The concept of the number of employees in the local unit of a firm used in answering this question is different from the usual definition of a small firm (ie the number of employees of the enterprise as a whole, across all local units) which is not available from the FRS. Given this fact, in conjunction with the use of the net earnings (as defined for HBAI) rather than assessable income (as defined for the proposed Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC)), it is advised that it would not be considered appropriate to use the data supplied in any analysis of the administration of the WFTC. The exclusion of all benefit units containing the self-employed would also have a bearing on this issue.<P>

7. The figures given are rounded to the nearest 5,000 benefit units. The entries marked "*" have values of less than 5,000.<P>

8. To provide more robust estimates at such a fine level of detail, the HBAI data set was pooled over three financial years, from April 1994--March 1997.<P>

9. As the FRS does not actually collect annual earnings data from individuals, this figure was estimated from weekly earnings data. As the earnings data collected relates solely to the last pay-cheque received, it will not take into account any bonuses, pay-rises or changes of employment that may take/have taken place at other points in the year.<P>

10. The earnings bands were taken to be in April 1998 prices, and all earnings data from each of the financial years used was uprated accordingly, to April 1998 prices, using the Retail Prices Index (RPI).<P>

 Initially, the rules governing the treatment of resources will remain unchanged.

We hope to bring forward proposals later in this Parliament.

 I refer the hon. Member to the written answer I gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) on 29 October 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>266</i>. The recent change to the composition of Social Security Appeal Tribunals (SSATs) hearing All Work Test Appeals was the second phase of measures introduced by His Honour Judge Harris, the President of the Independent Tribunal Services under transitory powers afforded to him by Schedule 6 of the Social Security Act 1998.
<P>

<a name="90120w06.html_para0">This provision was introduced to give the President flexibility over the composition of SSATs during a period of substantial change in 1999. The President wanted to be able to monitor the effect of change before regulations varying the composition of tribunals are debated in Parliament. The President consulted widely within his organisation. The decision to introduce the change is a judicial matter.
<P>

<a name="90120w06.html_para1">The President's initial monitoring of the changes indicates that the new flexibility appears to be working well. Tribunal Chairmen, operating the new arrangements, are reporting overall improvements in service as a result of the change. There is no evidence to suggest that the percentage of appeals upheld has been affected by the introduction of the new arrangements. The Department has not received any representations from appellants who have had their appeals decided by a legally qualified panel member supported by a medical assessor. These are initial results and monitoring is continuing.
<P>

<a name="90120w06.html_para2">We are firmly committed to tackling the unacceptable delays in the appeals service--currently averaging seven months, with some appellants waiting over a year for the decision on their case. The flexibility to tailor the composition and expertise of the Tribunal to the issues raised by an appeal will provide appellants with good quality decisions, quicker.
<P>

<a name="90120w06.html_para3">Regulations varying tribunal composition under Section 7 of the Social Security Act 1998 will be debated shortly under affirmative procedures. Draft regulations are being discussed with the Independent Tribunal Service, the Council of Tribunals, the Office of the Social Security Commissioners and an ad hoc group of representative bodies including the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux and the Child Poverty Action Group.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what plans he has to amend the Social Security (Overlapping Benefits) Regulations 1979 to mitigate their impact on recipients of invalid care allowance who lose their benefit on reaching retirement age.  [66351]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90120w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 It is a basic principle of the Social Security system that only one benefit at a time can be paid for income maintenance. Retirement Pension is an income replacement benefit for those who have reached pensionable age. It replaces Invalid Care Allowance at pension age. Invalid Care Allowance provides a measure of financial support to those who give up the opportunity of full-time paid employment to care for a severely disabled person. It is not an "extra-costs" benefit. To pay both benefits in full therefore would duplicate provision for the same need. There are no plans to change these arrangements.

 As part of our wider programme of Welfare Reform, we have been examining the scope for modernisation of the Industrial Injuries scheme.

We have asked officials to explore with the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council, industry, trades unions and other key representative groups whether there are alternative replacement no-fault compensation arrangements which would meet those objectives.

<a name="90120w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 For 1999-2000, I am making &#163;5 million available to local authorities to support local bus services, of which at least &#163;3 million must be spent on rural services with the remainder for urban services. This grant is in addition to the provision which local authorities make in their own budgets for subsidised services. All authorities in Wales, including Flintshire, will receive a share of this money. I am currently consulting on the precise method of allocating funds to authorities, and will announce the individual allocations shortly.

In addition, I have announced that we intend to provide free concessionary bus travel for pensioners over the next two to three years.

To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department for what reason the age of 40 years was decided upon as the minimum age for current legal advisers in magistrates courts to be exempt from the requirements of the Justices' Clerks (Qualification of Assistants) (Amendment) Rules 1998; and if he will similarly exempt all postholders, irrespective of age.

<P>
<a name="90120w08.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The decision to exempt those people who are aged 40 or older strikes the right balance between the important aim of a fully professionally qualified service and the practical difficulties faced by some individuals. Considerable thought was given to the question of whether all existing court clerks should be exempted, but it was decided that this was not a reasonable option. Some of these clerks are in their early to mid-20s and can be expected to work until they are in their mid-50s. It was felt that such a long term timescale before all clerks were professionally qualified did not match the timescale for modernising the magistrates courts to meet the challenges emerging now and in the future.

<a name="90120w11.html_para9">As regards the difference between high dependency and intensive care facilities, broadly speaking, intensive care is usually reserved for patients with potential or established organ failure. An Intensive Care Unit (ICU) should therefore offer the facilities for diagnosis, prevention and treatment of multiple organ failure.
<P>

<a name="90120w11.html_para10">A High Dependency Unit (HDU) is a clinical area offering a standard of care intermediate between the acute ward and full intensive care. The HDU should not manage patients with multi-organ failure but should provide monitoring and support to patients at risk of developing organ system failure. A HDU should be able to undertake short-term resuscitative measures and may provide ventilator support for a short time (usually less than 24 hours) prior to the transfer of a patient to an ICU.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what factors underlay the delays in treatment at the orthopaedics unit at the Royal Victoria Hospital in December; and what was the average time taken to treat patients with fractures <i>(a)</i> on 21 December and <i>(b)</i> on 11 January.  [65950]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90120w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McFall </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 January 1999]:</i> The recent upsurge in the number of fracture patients treated at the Royal Victoria Hospital must be seen in the context of a 100 per cent. increase in the fractures treated in the 2 central Belfast Hospitals in the last 10 years. Additional pressures created by a surge in emergency admissions before Christmas and the general effects of the cold weather exacerbated the problems.
<P>

<a name="90120w12.html_para0">On 21 December, 6 patients were treated for fractures in the Royal Victoria Hospital. The average time waited by these patients was 4.6 days. On 11 January, 5 fracture patients were treated in the Royal with an average waiting time of 5 days.
<P>

<a name="90120w12.html_para1">I am determined to ensure that patients admitted to hospital with fractures receive the treatment that they require as soon as possible and certainly no later than the 2 days laid down by current clinical standards and I have taken appropriate steps to achieve this.

 The Government are pleased to record that regular weekly exports from Northern Ireland under the Export Certified Herds Scheme started in September 1998. The quantities involved have been small, averaging around 20 tonnes per week involving 7 European Countries. The Republic of South Africa (RSA) have also recently confirmed their willingness to take NI beef again although exports to South Africa have not yet started.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland, pursuant to the letter of 30 September 1998 from the Minister with responsibility for agriculture, the environment and fisheries to the hon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90120w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 The talks were between the water industry and the British Retail Consortium. The talks resulted in an agreement on the recycling of sewage sludge to farmland. This included ending the application of untreated sewage sludge to grass for silage and grazing by the end of 1998. It also included the phasing out of the application of all untreated sludge to agricultural land by the end of 2001. The Government have already announced they will amend the relevant regulations and code of practice to enforce the 2001 deadline.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90120w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 The Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive and our own Regulations require secondary treatment to be applied for discharges to normal waters (i.e. those not designated as sensitive or less sensitive) from communities with population equivalents above 15,000 by the end of 2000. The same standard of treatment must be applied to discharges from smaller communities by the end of 2005.
<P>

<a name="90120w12.html_para3">Compliance with the Directive is a major initiative for the Scottish Water Authorities who will be undertaking capital investment programmes costing &#163;1.5 billion, over the next three years, to modernise the water and sewage industry.

 The number of in-patients beds within the Greater Glasgow Health Board (GGHB) area in 1995 was 8,224. GGHB recognises that changes in flows of patients from Lanarkshire upon completion of the new Law Hospital will impact on the level of demand for in-patient beds, and is still in the process of discussing this, and timescales, with Lanarkshire Health Board.

<a name="90120w13.html_para2">The regulatory authorities in the United Kingdom have to access all scientific research papers and articles published in international scientific journals. These are available through abstracting services, departmental libraries and the British Library.
<P>

<a name="90120w13.html_para3">The regulatory authorities also have access to independent research through members of the Government's advisory committees on biotechnology, such as the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) and the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP). Members of these committees are leading experts in their own fields and will be aware of the latest scientific research and developments. Regulatory authorities in the EU will have access to similar sources of scientific research results and exchange information at regular meetings of the Competent Authorities.
<P>

<a name="90120w13.html_para4">My Department and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food fund independent scientific research on genetically modified crops. I refer my hon.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what conclusions he and the Secretary of State for Wales have reached following their review of the law relating to the drinking of raw cows' milk in England and Wales; and if he will make a statement.  [67090]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90120w13.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales and I have decided not to stop the sale of raw cows' drinking milk in England and Wales. However, we intend to introduce tighter checks to benefit consumers who choose to drink raw cows' milk.
<P>

<a name="90120w13.html_para6">The new measures will include increasing the frequency of official microbiological sample testing of raw cows' drinking milk at production premises to four times a year and increasing the frequency of official inspections of registered raw cows' milk production holdings to once a year. These measures will begin immediately.




<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 1999 : Column: 498</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90120w13.html_para7">Raw milk producers will continue to pay for official checks, and we will be putting in hand arrangements to extend the scope of enforcement at production holdings. In addition, we intend that on-farm caterers will no longer be exempted from the charges for microbiological sample testing, and also that the full costs of inspection and sample testing will be recovered. This will necessitate changes to the relevant regulations, and in due course we will issue draft regulations for public consultation.
<P>

<a name="90120w13.html_para8">There is already a requirement to label raw cows' drinking milk with a public health warning. We will be putting into place arrangements to ensure this is given greater prominence. In addition, these arrangements will also require that labels on retail packaging, and notices displayed at on-farm catering premises, must include the Chief Medical Officer's advice, which is that children, pregnant women, elderly people and those who are currently unwell or have a chronic illness should not consume raw cows' milk.
<P>

<a name="90120w13.html_para9">We emphasise in the strongest possible terms that the industry is responsible, and remains responsible, for the production of safe food. Producers of raw cows' drinking milk must ensure that it is produced to the best hygienic standards.

<a name="90120w13.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Paice: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how many of the study areas required by the Krebs report to investigate links between badgers and bovine TB have <i>(a)</i> been identified, <i>(b)</i> been surveyed and <i>(c)</i> been announced, and in how many study areas the study has been (i) commenced and (ii) suspended.  [66080]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90120w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Krebs report concluded that a minimum of 30, 100 square kilometre areas be used for the randomised badger culling trial as part of a wider programme including epidemiological and research work. This recommendation was supported by the Independent Scientific Group appointed to advise on the implementation of the Krebs report recommendations. The areas will be grouped into triplets each containing three areas, one subject to proactive culling, one to reactive culling and the third a control area where no culling will take place.
<P>

<a name="90120w13.html_para10">The first two triplets were designated by the Group in August 1998 and announced on 17 August. One was on the Devon and Cornwall border and the other on the borders of Gloucestershire and Herefordshire. The remaining 24 areas (8 triplets) are to be phased in over the next two years, and will be in areas where the incidence of TB in cattle is historically highest and where there is the greatest risk of contiguous and repeat breakdowns. The next triplets will be identified shortly, and will then be announced.
<P>

<a name="90120w13.html_para11">Once a triplet is identified and mapped, land holders are contacted and asked for permission to survey the land for badger activity and to remove badgers from culling areas. Although participation in the trial is on a voluntary basis, the overwhelming majority of land holders agreed to take part. Visiting and surveying in the first two triplets began on 28 August. Surveying of the Devon/Cornwall triplet was completed at the end of November, and is continuing in the other triplet.




<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 1999 : Column: 499</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90120w13.html_para12">On 4 November 1998, in accordance with prescribed procedures and in the presence of an independent witness, each area in the Devon/Cornwall triplet was randomly allocated one of the three treatments (proactive, reactive, survey only). Cage trapping of badgers in the area around Putford which had been allocated proactive culling was carried out from 2 to 13 December 1998 inclusive. Work in the area progressed as planned and was not disrupted significantly. 238 badgers were caught and humanely despatched by shooting. The carcases were subject to post mortem examination in MAFF laboratories and samples have been taken for further analysis.
<P>

<a name="90120w13.html_para13">Once the initial proactive culling is complete in a triplet the comparative study of TB incidents in cattle begins. This is the position in the Cornwall/Devon triplet where TB incidents in the three trial areas are being monitored. Where a new TB incident is confirmed in the reactive culling area, arrangements will be made to cull badgers from social groups associated with the farm involved. No culling will take place during the closed season which runs from 1 February to 30 April inclusive.
<P>

<a name="90120w13.html_para14">Work has not been suspended in any area.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what plans he has for implementing the Sure Start strategy.  [67089]<P>

<P>
<a name="90120w14.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Sure Start is a vital element in the Government's work to increase opportunity and create equal chances for young children and their families in disadvantaged areas. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment and I are taking forward the Government's &#163;452 million strategy to establish at least 250 local Sure Start programmes in England over the next three years.
<P>

<a name="90120w14.html_para4">We are announcing today the first 60 trailblazer districts for Sure Start. In identifying them we have taken into account evidence of significant local deprivation and existing good practice; and a wish to see Sure Start principles taking root quickly in all regions, in different types of area and in places where they can complement other Government initiatives to regenerate communities and tackle social exclusion.
<P>

<a name="90120w14.html_para5">The trailblazer districts will play a major role in making Sure Start a reality. Each will identify one catchment area appropriate for a local Sure Start programme, and bring together an inclusive partnership responsible for making a formal application for Sure Start funding to improve and extend services in that area. Expressions of interest from the 60 districts are invited by 9 February and full applications by 19 March. Applications will not compete against each other. We are providing a team of expert advisers to help local partners prepare them, and they will be approved if they meet various criteria, including the inclusion of all the key partners at local level and effective demonstration of the key principles underpinning Sure Start.
<P>

<a name="90120w14.html_para6">We expect the first trailblazers to be up and running later in the year. They will help develop Sure Start, its implementation and evaluation, and act as mentors for subsequent programmes. More Sure Start districts will be announced in due course.
<P>

<a name="90120w14.html_para7">Further information and guidance on Sure Start is being published today to support trailblazers in their work. Copies will be placed in the Library.

 The Department has not carried out any assessment of the activities of the Edison Project in the United States of America, although we have seen reports of some published evaluations. Officials have talked to representatives of the Project about the scope for private sector involvement in EAZs and in turning round failing schools. In all cases it has been made clear that as a matter of law the responsibility for running maintained schools rests with the governing body, which is responsible for spending the school budget in the best interests of pupils.
<P>

<a name="90120w14.html_para8">In addition, we have made it clear that "schools run schools", under the Education Act and in accordance with the new fair funding arrangements.

<a name="90120w15.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 Owing to a change by the British Council accruals accounting in April 1995, the information on investment is available on a consistent basis only for the three-year period from 1995-96 to 1997-98. In each of these years, the British Council's average gross investment in its built estate and in information technology was &#163;12 million. The equivalent figure for the present financial year is &#163;11.3 million while, as a result of the Comprehensive Spending Review, the average for each of the next three years will be &#163;15 million.

<a name="90120w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 The St. Malo Declaration on Africa agreed that both governments would explore the scope for co-location of Embassies. This would involve sharing premises in one or more sites, if there were benefits to be gained from doing so. We have done this successfully with other countries elsewhere in the world. The Declaration also included provisions for information sharing on the situation in Africa, in particular on countries where either the UK or France is not represented. We see this as a useful area for cooperation, which will be of mutual benefit and will extend our knowledge of these countries.

 Financial sanctions need to be compatible with the UK's international obligations. They are a matter for action by the European Community as a whole in accordance with the Treaty of Rome (Articles 73 (g) (1) and 228 (a)). They must also be compatible with membership of the World Trade Organisation. A mandatory United Nations Security Council Resolution would override these obligations but there is at present no consensus for such action.

 We have welcomed the proposals put forward recently by France as a useful basis for discussion on the way forward on Iraq. However, our position remains that the oil embargo cannot be lifted until Iraq has fulfilled its obligations in relation to its weapons of mass destruction programmes as set out in UN Security Council resolution (UNSCR) 687, and that other sanctions cannot be lifted until Iraq has complied with all its obligations under the relevant UNSCRs.

<P>

<a name="90120w18.html_para4">Few of the many cracks identified over the years in nuclear power plants have been judged structurally significant and so necessitated repair. Examples of cracks that have necessitated repair are those found in Magnox coolant ducts during the 1980s, cracks in AGR steam headers and pipework and cracks in the boiler shells at Sizewell A power station. Details of these have been made publicly available via either the HSE's publication of the results of NSD's reviews of the licensees' Periodic Safety Reviews (PSRs) or in quarterly NSD reports over the years to local liaison committees.

If repairs are necessary to enable a satisfactory safety case

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1) which Minister has primary responsibility for ensuring that England, Scotland and Wales do not compete against one another for inward investment;  [66137]

 <i>[holding answer 18 January 1999]:</i> The Invest in Britain Bureau--which is jointly managed by the Department of Trade and Industry and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office--is the national agency promoting the UK as the number one location for inward investment in Europe. It works in partnership, under the Committee on Overseas Promotion arrangements, with the inward investment agencies of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the English regions.
<P>

<a name="90120w18.html_para6">There is no question of one Minister having primary responsibility for ensuring that competition between different parts of the UK is not wasteful. All Ministers have a collective interest in ensuring that offers of financial assistance represent value for money for the taxpayer.
<P>

<a name="90120w18.html_para7">The Government will be strengthening the current arrangements through a Concordat on financial assistance to industry. The Government expect that they will be in a position to publish the Concordat soon.
