<a name="80323w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Brake: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 12 March 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>261</i>, if he will enable the Drinking Water Inspectorate to seek financial authorisation for water companies from Ofwat to enable water companies to carry out remedial works which will prevent a breach of standards before that breach occurs.  [35299]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80323w01.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 It is the duty of water companies to supply drinking water which complies with the Water Quality Regulations. The financial regime operated by Ofwat already allows companies money to maintain their systems at the levels required to meet current water quality standards. Allowing companies further money for such works would not be appropriate. If unforeseen circumstances arise, or new standards are introduced which result in water companies needing to carry out works or install new treatment plant, the mechanism already exists for this expenditure to be certified as necessary by the DWI and taken into account by Ofwat in the next price review.

<a name="80323w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Brake: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the Suzy Lamplugh Trust's Secure Stations Initiative; and if he will make a statement.  [35127]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80323w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Suzy Lamplugh Trust has worked with the Department in the development of the Secure Stations initiative which we will be launching shortly. We are also aware of a research project put forward by the Trust into Safety at Stations for Disabled People with North West Trains but we understand that it is not yet underway. We greatly value the work of the Trust in these and other areas of personal security in public transport.

 The report the European commission presented to its Scientific Committee included a review of the main substitutes for white asbestos such as polyvinyalcohol, para-Aramid and cellulose fibres. The Scientific Committee's interim opinion was that insufficient evidence had been provided to justify a conclusion that substitute fibres had been proven to be safer. The Committee did not conclude they were more hazardous. Nor did it argue that the categorisation of Chrysotile Asbestos as a category 1 carcinogen was wrong.

<P>
<a name="80323w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Ottaway: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) if he will make a statement on his policy on aircraft noise nuisance;  [35400]
<P>
<UL>(2) if it is his policy to continue to reduce aircraft noise after 2002.  [35399]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80323w02.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Government's policy is to minimise the impact of airports on the environment while ensuring that land use planning and conservation policies take account of the economic benefits of maintaining a strong and competitive British airline industry and providing sufficient airport capacity where it is economically and environmentally justified. This necessarily involves striking a balance between the needs of an efficient aviation industry, providing jobs and serving the local, regional and national economy and the need to minimise the impact on the environment and the communities around airports. There has been a substantial improvement in the noise climate around Heathrow over the past two decades, which has been accelerated since 1990 by the compulsory progressive phase-out of Chapter 2 jet aircraft, a process due to be completed by 31 March 2002. While this makes the securing of further improvement all the more challenging, the Government are committed to doing everything practicable to ensure that the noise climate around the airport continues to improve after 2002. We have given local people around Heathrow an additional commitment to take all practicable steps to prevent a deterioration in the noise climate after the Chapter 2 phase-out is complete.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80323w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Ottaway: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how often he meets the BAA and airline representatives to discuss aircraft noise from planes using Heathrow Airport.  [35398]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80323w02.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 DETR Ministers meet with airline representatives and BAA plc from time to time to discuss a wide range of matters, including the nuisance caused by aircraft landing and taking off at Heathrow.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what plans he has to ensure that water companies meet their water leakage targets and maintain enough water pressure for fire fighting;  [35388]
<P>
<UL>(2) what statutory obligations are placed on water companies to maintain adequate water pressure for fire fighting;  [35387]
<P>
(3) which water companies in respect of which areas have reduced the mains water pressure since 1991.  [35386]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80323w02.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Water companies continually monitor and alter the water pressures in their systems to meet prevailing circumstances in their areas. Under section 65 of the Water Industry Act 1991, water companies have a duty to ensure that water in mains which serve domestic properties or have fire hydrants fixed on them will normally be supplied at sufficient pressure to reach the top most storey of every building within their area. The Director General of Water Services has a duty to ensure that companies meet these provisions of the 1991 Act. Where water companies reduce pressure as one means of reducing leakage, they must still meet the requirements of the Act.

<P>
<UL>(2) what was the average pressure in water supplies made available by Thames Water to the London Fire Brigade in each of the last 10 years.  [35352]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80323w02.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The average pressure of water in the mains in London is between 15 and 30 static head. There has been no appreciable variation in the pressure in the last 10 years.
<P>

<a name="80323w02.html_para0">For operational purposes, the London Fire Brigade requires a minimum flow rate from a hydrant of approximately 760 litres per minute. At present, they do not have any difficulty with flow rates.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80323w02.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when plans by First Group plc to take over Great Western Holdings were submitted to the Director General of Passenger Rail Franchising; what powers the Director General has in such cases to prevent takeovers; what range of conditions he can impose on such takeovers; what are the duties of consultation of the Director General before determining such conditions; and if he will make a statement.  [35419]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80323w02.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 March 1998]:</i> The first intimations that First Group were considering the takeover of Great Western Holdings Ltd. (GWHL) were given to the Franchising Director orally in the latter part of January 1998. The Franchising Director confirmed to the First Group that any change of control would require his approval; that in considering his approval he would take into account the Objectives, Instructions and Guidance (OIG) issued to him on behalf of the Secretary of State on 6 November 1997 (a copy is in the Library of the House) which, in his view, obliged him to ensure that benefits were secured for passengers if the change of control were to be allowed; and that the Office of the Rail Regulator and the Office of Fair Trading would deal with competition aspects of the proposed takeover. He was not party to the properly private discussions between First Group and GWHL. He heard from First Group on the evening of 3 March that, in view of Press speculation, they wished to announce on 4 March that they were in advanced discussions with GWHL. On 4 March the Franchising Director met First Group to discuss the passenger benefits to be provided under the 3 franchises involved, Great Western Trains and North Western Trains (which First Group seek to acquire) and Great Eastern (which First Group already own).
<P>

<a name="80323w02.html_para2">The Franchising Director's powers are contractual. Under the franchise agreements for Great Western Trains and North Western Trains his prior consent to change of control must be obtained. He has unfettered contractual discretion to refuse or attach conditions to his consent.
<P>

<a name="80323w02.html_para3">Having taken the view that, as a result of the proposed takeover none of the terms and condition of the franchise agreements would be changed the OIG obliged him to ensure that additional benefits were secured for passengers if the takeover were to be allowed. The Franchising Director announced on 6 March 1998 various benefits on the basis of which, subject to contract, he proposes to approve the takeover. These will include additional rolling stock; station improvements, including the provision of wheelchair access and bicycle facilities; security cameras and greater bus/rail through-ticketing. He is discussing details of the package with PTEs who, as parties to the North Western Trains franchise agreement, he is required to consult on issues affecting them. The Franchising Director has general obligations under his OIG to consult and liaise with other bodies. He has no specific duties of consultation about conditions to his consent to a change of control.

 Pakistan has traditionally spent a high proportion of its national budget on defence. We understand and welcome the fact that defence spending measured as a percentage of GDP has been declining steadily in recent years. The UK's bilateral development co-operation programme with Pakistan focuses particularly on working to improve basic social services which benefit the poor.

 We contributed &#163;200,000 in November 1997 to support the work of the new UN Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict and intend to continue to work closely with him to ensure the protection, healing and rehabilitation of war affected children world-wide. We recognise that children who find themselves in the unique situation of caring for younger children, possibly because parents have died in conflict or from conditions such as AIDS, are particularly vulnerable. We are trying to address these issues in our development programmes and will highlight our concerns to Mr. Otunnu when his proposals for international action on children and armed conflict are discussed with our European partners at a ministerial meeting in London on 23 June 1998 which my Department will host.

 The arrangement for processing firearm certificates in the Metropolitan Police area is an operational matter for the Commissioner. We understand that the average time for processing routine amendments to firearm and shotgun certificates is between two and three weeks.

<P>
<P><I>23 Mar 1998 : Column: 15</I><P>
to permit them to take up new shooting sports. No fee is payable by handgun owners in respect of amendments involving replacement, rather than additional, firearms. However, the proposed acquisition of new firearms may involve the police in inspecting the applicant's security arrangements and confirming the details of his proposed shooting activities. For these reasons, the time taken to deal with amendments and return certificates to their owners may take several months. While the Metropolitan Police have confirmed that they are seeking to deal with any backlogs as a matter of urgency, this will have to depend to some extent on the urgency of competing demands.
<P>

<a name="80323w04.html_para2">As well as dealing with variations to firearm certificates recently, police firearms licensing departments have dealt with the considerable volume of work relating to the surrender of handguns and the processing of compensation claims, as well as routine licensing and firearms matters.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he plans to reply to the letter dated 17 November 1997 concerning Mr. and Mrs. Utting from the hon. Member for North Wiltshire.  [35771]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80323w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 I replied to the hon. Member on 18 March 1998. The Home Office has received a lot of correspondence on the subject of law and order in recent months; this has meant that not all letters have been answered as quickly as we would have liked. We have also put measures in hand to improve the Home Office correspondence system in order to provide speedier, high quality responses in future.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what definition his Department applies to hard and soft gambling; and if his Department defines slot machines as a form of hard gambling.  [35765]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80323w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 We regard as hard gambling those forms likely to cause problem gambling among customers--for example, because of high frequency combined with high staking.
<P>

<a name="80323w05.html_para7">We regard as soft gambling low stake, long odds forms where it is very difficult to chase losses.
<P>

<a name="80323w05.html_para8">There are various types of gaming machines. How hard and how soft they are depends on their stake limits, prize levels and, to some extent, their locations and numbers.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he intends next to publish recorded crime figures; and if he will make a statement on the methodology used to compile them.  [34686]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80323w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The next recorded crime figures for England and Wales, covering the calendar year 1997, will be published in a Home Office Statistical Bulletin on 7 April 1998.
<P>

<a name="80323w05.html_para9">The recorded crime figures are based on statistical returns provided by the 43 police force areas in England and Wales. The data are compiled using rules for classification and counting issued by the Home Office to maintain the consistency of recording some of the more complex and potentially difficult offences, such as multiple, continuous and repeated offences.
<P>

<a name="80323w05.html_para10">Periodically, the Home Office rules and police recording practices are reviewed to ensure consistency and to determine whether updates are necessary. Recently, both Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and a joint Home Office/Association of Chief Police Officers working party have undertaken such reviews. Their recommendations are being adopted in a package of measures for implementation on 1 April 1998, which were announced initially by my right hon. Friend on 1 October 1997. More detail was given by the Home Office's Director of Research and Statistics on 14 October 1997.




<P>
<P><I>23 Mar 1998 : Column: 18</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80323w05.html_para11">The main measures comprise the logical extension of the coverage of recorded crimes (or notifiable offences) to include all indictable and triable either way offences; the revision of the counting rules for certain offences to move closer to the concept of one crime per victim; a move to financial year publication; and less emphasis in publications on the overall total of recorded crime in favour of individual offence groups.

 A study conducted by the Institute of Psychiatry for the Prison Service in 1988-89 indicated that a psychiatric diagnosis, including substance dependency or abuse, could be given to 33 per cent. of sentenced male youths, wherever detained.

<a name="80323w05.html_para18">On 18 March 1998 the Mental Health Unit of the Home Office, which authorises transfers to hospital exercising the warrant of the Secretary of State, had no cases outstanding on which medical reports had been submitted by Young Offender Institutions recommending transfer to hospital under section 47 of the Mental Health Act 1983.

 Individuals who want to join the Prison Service as prison officers require five GCSEs or the equivalent.

Prison officers who will be working in Young Offender Institutions are also required to attend a specific module on the course which deals with issues related to working with young offenders.
<P>

<a name="80323w05.html_para19">The Prison Service, working with the Trust for the Study of Adolescence, has produced a specialist training pack "Working with Young People in Custody".

 It is not known what percentage of young offenders on remand in Young Offender Institutions were in the care of the local authority prior to remand in each of the last five years as this information is not held centrally. However, according to the 1991 National Prison Survey, 43 per cent. of young offenders on remand said that they had been in the care of the local authority at some time in their childhood.

<a name="80323w06.html_para0">The asteroid 1997 XF11, which was discovered last year, has an orbit around the Sun which crosses the Earth's orbit. It will pass by the Earth in 2028. Computations made by American scientists earlier this month indicated that the asteroid could come within 30,000 miles of the Earth. However, I understand that scientists from the American space agency NASA have now been able to locate pre-1997 images of the asteroid. This has enabled them to calculate a more precise orbit for 1997 XF11 which indicates that it will miss the Earth by a much larger margin of 600,00 miles (or about 2.5 times the distance to the Moon).
<P>

<a name="80323w06.html_para1">The probability of a major impact from an asteroid is extremely low, but the emergency services and the emergency planning community in the UK prepare for a wide range of disasters and scenarios and they would respond if the need arose.

 Bombardier has fulfilled the undertakings provided in relation to Shorts when it acquired the business in October 1989.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, pursuant to her speech to the Royal Geographical Society, if she will list the legal obstacles to employers recruiting directly from the long-term unemployed.  [35844]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80323w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Restricting the field of recruitment to the long-term unemployed brings with it a greater risk of the pool of potential candidates being disproportionately of one religion, gender or, possibly, race. In such circumstances a person of another religion, gender or race may have grounds for making a complaint of indirect discrimination on the basis that persons of his/her religion, gender or race in Northern Ireland were less able to satisfy the criterion of being long-term unemployed.

<a name="80323w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 I have no knowledge of any conference on policing held in the Galgorm Hotel. However a two-day workshop organised by the Northern Ireland Office took place recently elsewhere. It involved 11 RUC Officers of ranks ranging from Assistant Chief Constable to Chief Inspector and 6 Senior Officials from the Northern Ireland Office. The aim of the workshop was to explore the implications of the evolving role of the RUC in terms of the police, the public and the broader criminal justice system. "Two tier policing" was not on the agenda.

 In December 1997 fifteen RUC officers took part in a research visit to New York, which had been approved by the Chief Constable. The group of police officers, led by an Assistant Chief Constable and including Superintendents, Chief Inspectors, Inspectors and a Constable, observed a number of policing initiatives currently in practice within the New York Police Department. These included police management, performance measurement, community policing and community relations activities at both Headquarters and local precinct level. The total cost is not readily determinable.

<P>
<a name="80323w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 The Code is under negotiation. If our proposal is accepted, each partner would be obliged to consult a member state which had denied an export licence under any of the criteria elaborated in the Code, not just the provisions related to human rights, before coming to a decision on whether to authorise a licence itself for an essentially identical transaction. The decision on whether to authorise the licence would remain at national discretion.

In this respect, the Foreign Policy Centre is no different from any other non-governmental organisation. No-one employed by the Foreign Policy Centre will have access to classified information.

 The human rights situation in Turkey continues to give cause for concern. We regularly raise human rights issues with the Turkish authorities. We acknowledge the steps that the Turkish Government have taken to address such concerns, but we have made it clear that more needs to be done. We are committed to working closely with Turkey and to providing practical assistance to help Turkey fully meet its international obligations in this area. In our role as EU Presidency, we will make a series of interventions including on Turkey at the current session of the Commission on Human Rights. The detail of the interventions is still being discussed with partners.

 At its meeting on 10 March, the Administration Committee reviewed the submissions it had received from hon. Members and staff in response to an invitation on the All-Party Notices concerning smoking in general areas; hon. Members will recall that the Committee had particularly sought views on whether the existing no-smoking zones should be extended to include telephone kiosks, lavatories, private meetings in Committee, Conference and Interview Rooms, the Families' Room and corridors.
<P>

<a name="80323w09.html_para0">By the time of the meeting the Committee had received 54 responses, of which only three favoured the <i>status quo</i> being maintained; the remaining 51 favoured some extension of non-smoking zones, of which 48 supported an extension to include all of the aforementioned areas. Since the Committee's meeting, a further eight submissions, all supporting some extension, have been received, of which five favoured an extension of the no-smoking zones to include those areas specifically mentioned.
<P>

<a name="80323w09.html_para1">Based on these responses, the Committee concluded that there does indeed seem to be a general mood that the non-smoking zones be extended to the above areas, and therefore, the Committee has agreed to such an extension for a trial period from when the House returns after the Easter Adjournment until the House returns after the summer; in the autumn the Committee will review the trial.
<P>

<a name="80323w09.html_para2">However, hon. Members will wish to note that smoking will still be permitted on the Committee Corridor. This is to allow those hon. Members serving on Committees of the House to have an area to smoke during those brief periods when they are able to leave the Committee Room.
<P>

<a name="80323w09.html_para3">I understand that the Information Committee has endorsed a proposal by the Librarian that the Members' Library become a non-smoking area, and that this policy will also take effect on the return of the House after Easter; and I am advised that the Catering Committee and the Director of Catering Services are currently reviewing smoking policy in Refreshment Department outlets.
<P>

<a name="80323w09.html_para4">Finally, I wish to advise the hon.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what was the spending on care of the elderly per resident of pensionable age in each social work authority area and in Scotland as a whole in the last year for which figures are available.  [35567]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80323w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 Local authority spending on the elderly is not separately identified in full by all local authorities, some social work spending being under general headings. The actual social work spend on the elderly includes both the directly recorded spend on the elderly and a major, though unknown, part of the spend not allocated to client groups. Provisional Outturn data for 1996/97 are the most recent outturn data available. The table shows, to the nearest &#163;100, the amount recorded as spent directly on older people, per person aged 65 or over.

 There is no statutory requirement for further education colleges in Scotland to produce disability statements.

Others include the need to establish primary care groups around natural communities and ideally a population of 100,000. We shall be issuing guidance shortly on the configuration of primary care groups, including the criteria health authorities should take into account when proposing primary care groups.

 The Government attach great importance to improving the quality of teaching and management in further education. In our consultation document "The Learning Age", we propose that all new teachers in further education should hold, or within two years of appointment have begun, a recognised initial teacher training qualification. In the same document, we highlight the need for professional training of FE managers. We are working closely with the FE sector to develop national standards for professional development and we anticipate that a National Training Organisation for FE will be established by the end of the year to take forward these developments. FE staff, with qualified teacher status, will be eligible to register with the general teaching council on the same basis as school teachers.

3. BHC: Before Housing Costs; AHC: After Housing Costs.<P>

4. Numbers of pensioner units are rounded to the nearest 50,000.<P>

5. A pensioner unit is defined as a single person over State Pension Age (SPA), or a couple where the man, defined as head, is over SPA.<P>

6. Components may not sum to totals due to rounding.<P>

7. All incomes are in &#163; per week at July 1995 prices and are rounded to the nearest 10 pence.<P>

8. Estimates of median income levels are medians of the unequivalised income distribution.<P>

9. Estimates indicate broad trends through time, rather than giving a clear picture of year on year changes.<P>

10. The estimates in Table 1 differ slightly from those published in The Pensioners' Incomes Series 1995-96, owing to inaccuracies with rounding. Differences are small, up to 10 pence, except for 1979 where the difference is as large as 50 pence in some cases. A revised version of the publication will be issued as soon as possible.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="80323w14.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Field: </B> 
 We expect the Child Support Agency to provide an effective and efficient service to all its clients. The Agency is currently reorganising its resources so that back room processing work which does not require face-to-face contact with the public is done in its larger centres. This will leave remaining local staff to focus their attentions more effectively on essential face-to-face contacts. From next month lone mothers claiming Income Support will be personally assisted in completing the maintenance application form by Benefits Agency staff.

<a name="80323w14.html_para1">For customers with general inquiries, more resources are to be allocated to the Agency's National Inquiry Line from next month.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if she will make a statement on the action the Government have taken in respect of winter fuel payments for pensioners.  [34068]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80323w15.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 This is the first time any Government have been prepared to help pensioner households with their winter fuel bills. A total of &#163;400 million have been committed to provide extra help for this winter and next to eligible pensioner households.
<P>

<a name="80323w15.html_para0">Around one and a half million pensioners on Income Support have already received a payment of &#163;50. Virtually all of the payments of &#163;20 or &#163;10 to the other eight and a half million eligible pensioners have now been issued. The remaining few will be despatched in the next few days.
<P>

<a name="80323w15.html_para1">Overall, almost ten million payments will have been made to more than seven million pensioner households.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80323w15.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Spelman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security on what statutory authority the Benefits Agency Office advertises winter fuel payments to pensioners.  [35767]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80323w15.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Department's Benefits Agency does not need statutory authority to advertise winter fuel payments to pensioners.
<P>

<a name="80323w15.html_para2">The Agency advertises these payments only to the extent of providing information to the public, in line with the normal Departmental advertising strategy.
<P>

<a name="80323w15.html_para3">Any advertising carried out by the Department is done in support of its policy to explain and inform the public of the government services available to them. Any advertising is carried out in accordance with Cabinet Office guidance issued in July 1997.
<P>

<a name="80323w15.html_para4">Advertising support for the Winter Fuel Payments campaign included national television advertising by the Department. It is in support of this campaign that the Benefits Agency is displaying posters and leaflets.
<P>

<a name="80323w15.html_para5">We wanted pensioners to know what payments are coming to them and how and when, in order to make informed decisions about how to heat their homes. The most cost effective method of reaching pensioners quickly with this important information has been through a multi-media campaign involving highly targeted television advertising.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80323w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We have made clear our commitment to work towards a permanent reduction in all benefit fraud, as part of our drive to modernise the Social Security system and rebuild public confidence in it. We are conducting a series of reviews to provide reliable estimates of the level and types of Housing Benefit fraud. We are determined that Social Security will not be an easy target for fraudsters.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80323w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Field: </B> 
 We are committed to reviewing and reforming Social Security to transform it from a system of dependency to a system of opportunity which promotes work incentives, reduces poverty and welfare dependency, and strengthens family life, and we continue to review sickness and disability as part of this commitment. No decisions have been made.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what estimate she has made of the average extra cost to the members of occupational contracted-out money purchase schemes as a result of the decrease in the state earnings-related pension scheme rebate if funds are to be maintained at the same level.  [34072]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80323w15.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The reduction in the amount of rebate for individual Contracted Out Money Purchase (COMP) Scheme members is dependent on a number of factors and will vary according to age and earnings levels.
<P>

<a name="80323w15.html_para6">However, for the tax year 1999-2000 it is estimated that the reduction for an average COMP Scheme member will be &#163;74.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80323w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The pensions review that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced last year fulfils our manifesto commitment to look at the central areas of insecurity for elderly people.
<P>

<a name="80323w15.html_para7">We are carefully considering the more than 2,000 responses that we received to the first part of the review. We are also considering the more than 200 responses to the technical consultation document on our proposals for stakeholder pensions that we issued in November. We aim to publish an initial framework for change in the first half of this year. There will then be a period of further consultation before final proposals are developed.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="80323w15.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 A key objective of the Pensions Review is to ensure that resources devoted to pensions are used to maximum effect. We are therefore looking at how to encourage more of those who have access to good quality occupational pension schemes to join them. We have set up the Pensions Education Working Group which will recommend ways to improve awareness of the need to make provision for retirement.
<P>

<a name="80323w15.html_para8">We are also developing a framework for Stakeholder Pension schemes which will offer secure, flexible and value for money second pensions for people who do not have the opportunity to join an occupational scheme and for whom many personal pensions can be unsuitable.

<a name="80323w15.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The information is not available in the format requested.
<P>

<a name="80323w15.html_para9">The Department's fraud and security staff carry out a wide range of activities designed to improve the integrity of the system, to investigate and detect fraud, and to ensure that the correct amount of benefit is in payment. Records are kept of successful investigations which include cases subject to traditional investigative activity by fraud officers, as well as assurance activity on new and existing claims. There have been 813,255 successful preventive and detective activities in the period 1 May 1997 to 31 January. As a result of these activities, it is estimated that savings of &#163;1.46 billion have been made.
<P>

<a name="80323w15.html_para10">Local authorities are responsible for the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit. Data on the number of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit cases where fraud is established are collected annually. Figures for 1997/98 are therefore not yet available.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80323w15.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Field: </B> 
 The Government are committed to helping lone parents into work. The New Deal for Lone Parents shows the priority we attach to helping lone parents secure employment. The New Deal for Lone Parents offers lone parents their own tailored service, provided by Personal Advisers, to help them with jobsearch, training, childcare and in-work benefit calculations.
<P>

<a name="80323w15.html_para11">We have introduced measures to ensure that there are no disincentives in the benefit system which will deter lone parents from taking jobs. Fast-track arrangements are in place to clear claims and to secure the speedy payments of Family Credit where a lone parent has started, or is about to start, work. The target to process 95 per cent. of these claims within five days is currently being achieved. The Child Support Agency has agreed to process applications for maintenance more quickly for lone parents participating in the New Deal for Lone Parents. We will also be introducing a 12 week linking rule for lone parents in receipt of Income Support and Jobseekers Allowance before April 1998. This will mean that there is no benefit disincentive to deter lone parents who want to work from doing so.
<P>

<a name="80323w15.html_para12">Last week the Chancellor announced changes aimed at making work pay. The Working Families Tax Credit will make work pay for all families on low incomes. We will also provide extra help with childcare costs through the Child Care Tax Credit. As the next step in our National Child Care Strategy to ensure affordable, accessible, quality child care for all, the Child Care Tax Credit provides a passport to high quality childcare to all parents regardless of income.
<P>

<a name="80323w15.html_para13">We are committed to helping all parents, particularly lone parents, to balance work and family life and we are taking every opportunity to champion family-friendly employment policies which will allow parents to combine successfully home and work responsibilities. Good family-friendly policies will assist us in delivering both our National Child Care Strategy and the New Deal for Lone Parents.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how much she estimates the average extra cost will be to the members of occupational contracted out money purchase schemes, as a result of the decrease in the SERPs rebate, if they are to maintain contributions to their funds at the same level.  [32973]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80323w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 New rebate levels for contracted-out money purchase schemes (COMPS) have been set out for the year 1999-2000, 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 in a draft Statutory Instrument and laid before Parliament. These rebates are lower than those set previously to take account of the higher prevalence of larger COMPS, which have lower administrative expenses. To set these rebates at a higher level would amount to an unwarranted reduction in the National Insurance fund, especially since it could lead to salary-related schemes changing their method of contracting-out without changing their benefit provision to increase the amount they get from the taxpayer.
<P>

<a name="80323w16.html_para0">The reduction in the amount of rebates for individual COMPS members will vary according to their age and earnings levels, but the for average COMPS member in 1999-2000 it is estimated to be &#163;74.

<a name="80323w16.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The rules for the treatment of capital in Council Tax Benefit ensure that capital of &#163;3,000 or less is ignored. There is no entitlement to Council Tax Benefit if a person's capital exceeds &#163;16,000. For each &#163;250 of capital above &#163;3,000, but below the upper limit of &#163;16,000, &#163;1 per week is taken into account as income. This formula avoids the many practical difficulties that would arise if actual income were taken into account, and does not represent any assumed rate of interest.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80323w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 We sought stakeholders' views on the best means of translating our objectives for the long-term funding of supported accommodation into a modern, practical and sustainable funding system in November last year. Over 200 responses were received and are helping to inform the debate. Options for creating a more rational and effective system are presently under consideration. Whilst we are looking to implement a sustainable funding system as soon as possible, this is an extremely complex area with possible repercussions for all supported accommodation. We cannot, therefore, say when the review will be complete.

 <i>[holding answer 9 March 1998]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security announced on 31 July how we would proceed with a number of projects for the use of the private sector which were in the pipeline and which we had inherited from the previous administration. The projects were reviewed against the criteria announced in July:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>our objectives for modernising the Social Security system;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>our commitment to work within the announced spending totals for the first two years of Government;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>our aim of getting best value for public money and of reducing the burden on taxpayers;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the scope to apply private sector expertise, discipline and economies of scale in procuring public services and the ability to secure increased investment from the private sector;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the need for continuing flexibility for government to make future changes to services;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the opportunities for improving the quality of service for customers;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the implications for staff</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="80323w17.html_para1"><P>

<a name="80323w17.html_para2">When I announced on 19 February that all three contracts for BAMS were to be awarded to Sema I explained that we have established a minimum quality of service threshold against which we have assessed all bids from the private sector. There will be greater evaluation of performance against the new quality standards. We have also placed greater emphasis on the management of staff when evaluating the contracts.
<P>

<a name="80323w17.html_para3">The contract award is not part of the welfare reform programme. The responsibility for the overall service and for the determination of the entitlement to benefits remains with the Department. The award of the contract makes no change to the rules for entitlement to benefits and the rights of customers will not be changed in any way. Rigorous procedures will be put in place to ensure that we continue to receive independent, objective medical advice. We see the contract as providing an improved service to the customer and good value for money for the taxpayer.




<P>
<P><I>23 Mar 1998 : Column: 68</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80323w17.html_para4">The award of the contract will result in a saving of 10 per cent. over the cost of the present service.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what is the estimated cost to his Department of <i>(a)</i> consultants and <i>(b)</i> contractors engaged by the Department to address millennium computer compliance problems; and if he will list them.  [35425]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80323w18.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 It is not possible to separate out the costs relating to consultants as opposed to contractors engaged by the Department to address millennium computer compliance problems, or to provide an exhaustive list of them, without incurring disproportionate cost. However, the estimated cost of total external support is between &#163;7 million and &#163;8 million, primary sources on the IT side being Sema Group UK Ltd., Sherwood International Group Ltd., and Oracle Corporation UK Ltd. With regard to 'embedded chip' systems, CBG Consultants is the main source of external support.

<P>
<a name="80323w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 March 1998]:</i> MAFF inspectors are empowered to seize pesticides and destroy them under Regulation 7 of the Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986 (as amended). No pesticides were seized or destroyed using these powers during 1997.

<P>
<a name="80323w19.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 March 1998]:</i> The Pesticides Safety Directorate (PSD) maintains a list of individuals and organisations to whom all evaluation documents are sent as they are issued.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80323w19.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 March 1998]:</i> Two key types of study are used to specify maximum residue levels (MRLs) in crops. First, metabolism studies in the relevant crop are used to identify the chemical nature and fate of the residue. Second, residue trials are conducted according to Good Agricultural Practice to establish the highest residue level occurring in the crop when the pesticide product is used as intended. Cross checks are made with toxicological studies to establish that the MRL proposed is safe for consumers. If it would not, then that proposed use of pesticide would not be approved.

 <i>[holding answer 19 March 1998]:</i> In their fourteenth report on monitoring the application of Community law (published in the <i>Official Journal of the European Communities</i> ref. C332 1997) the European Commission noted that Italy had been censured by the European Court of Justice for failing to fulfil its obligation to transpose into national law various directives in the veterinary field. Failure to transpose Community law into national law does not necessarily mean that Italian producers are not complying with the veterinary requirements for intra-Community trade. Where failure to meet these requirements is identified in specific cases, they are thoroughly investigated and the necessary action is taken.

The Government wish to promote the further development of competition and continue to encourage innovation in services and technology. I wished therefore to appoint someone to this

important post who had direct experience of managing significant change and of working in a competitive business environment. I believe that Mr. Edmonds is that person and I feel sure he will do an excellent job.
<P>

<a name="80323w20.html_para5">Mr. Edmonds has combined a successful career in both business and the public sector. He began his career in 1966 as a civil servant and, having risen to Under Secretary, left the Department of the Environment in 1984 to become the Chief Executive of The Housing Corporation. In 1991, Mr. Edmonds joined the Natwest Group and was appointed Managing Director of Group Central Services in 1995. From July 1996, he also had personal responsibility for co-ordinating the Group's preparations for European Monetary Union. Mr. Edmonds is also the chairman of CRISIS, the national charity for the single homeless.
<P>

<a name="80323w20.html_para6">I would like also to take this opportunity to reiterate my appreciation of the major contribution Mr. Don Cruickshank has made over the past five years as Director General. He has developed the regulatory regime in the demanding context of a period of enormous change in telecommunications, and in so doing has played a key part in ensuring that the UK is very well-placed to benefit from the opportunities of the Information Age.

 UK exports of telecommunications equipment to China in 1996 exceeded &#163;40 million (Overseas Trade Statistics collected and compiled by HM Customs and Excise). Last year the Department was a sponsor of the Britain On-Line travelling exhibition which promoted UK telecommunications technology, products and services in China. In addition, a visit was organised under the Inward Missions Scheme which enabled Chinese industrialists and senior officials to meet UK communications companies. The Department, which has recently appointed an Export Promoter to promote opportunities in the Chinese telecommunications market, is supporting a mission to China later this year by UK companies. The mission is being organised by the China-Britain Trade Group. In the context of the negotiations over the terms of China's accession to the World Trade Organisation, the UK supports fully the strong line taken by the EU that there must be meaningful access granted to Chinese telecommunication services markets comparable to that granted by its economic peers among existing WTO Members.

 At the end of 1996, the latest year for which figures are available, the net book value of direct investment by UK firms in Oman was &#163;40 million. The value is negative because UK groups' liabilities to their subsidiaries and branches in Oman are greater than the share capital and reserves of the subsidiaries using the balance of payments methodology. During 1996, the flow of direct investment by UK firms into Oman was &#163;7 million.
