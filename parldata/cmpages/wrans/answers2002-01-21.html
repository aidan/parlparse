<P>
<a name="20121w01.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Victoria Cross is awarded for most conspicuous gallantry of the highest order during active operations <sup>1</sup> . As such it is the highest award available for operational gallantry. Lesser degrees of operational gallantry are recognised by awards of the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross, Distinguished Service Cross, Military Cross, Distinguished Flying Cross and a Mention in Despatches. Recommendations for any of these awards are initiated by the service man's or service woman's Commanding Officer and considered by Committees at various levels in the Ministry of Defence. The Committees consist mainly of senior officers of all three services who will have had considerable operational experience. Successful recommendations are passed to the Queen for her approval. The awards are then published and recipients invited to a State Investiture where they are invested by the Queen or her representative.
<P>

<a name="20121w01.html_para1">The Victoria Cross along with the other awards for operational gallantry may be awarded to all ranks of the naval, military and air forces of the United Kingdom, all members of the Merchant Navy and civilians serving under the orders of any of the above forces. All these awards may be made posthumously.
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> <sup>1</sup>  This is expanded on in the Third Clause of the Royal Warrant for The Victoria Cross which reads: "It is ordained that the Cross shall only be awarded for most conspicuous bravery, or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice or extreme devotion to duty in the presence of the enemy".</FONT></UL>

<a name="20121w01.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Export licensing decisions are the responsibility of my right hon. Friend the Secretary for Trade and Industry. The Ministry of Defence provides advice to the DTI, together with the other advisory Departments, as appropriate. Following the policy set out by previous Governments, the Government do not comment on individual export licence applications for reasons of commercial confidentiality. Details of export licensing decisions will continue to be published in the Government's annual report on strategic export controls and will be subject to retrospective scrutiny by the all-party Quadripartite Committee.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what is the projected noise footprint of the A400M; and what is the noise footprint of the Hercules C130J.  [26346]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20121w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The A400M aircraft will meet all current international noise regulations, but exact noise characteristics will not be known until the aircraft's development and flight tests have been completed. The C130J aircraft meets all relevant US Federal Aviation 



<P>
<P><I>21 Jan 2002 : Column 551W</I><P>
Authority civil noise regulations. The Ministry of Defence does not hold noise information on the C130J in the form requested. We expect the noise characteristics of the A400M and the C130J will be similar. But their overall noise impact should be less than that of the C130K aircraft they are replacing, because significantly greater usage of ground simulators for training will reduce the overall number of flights.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20121w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 January 2002]:</i> Purchases of vehicle for the Ministry of Defence Police are made on the basis of best value for money. We are pleased to procure British-built vehicles where they meet our requirements and offer best value for money. We have no plans designed to increase the proportion of British-built vehicles at the expense of these key criteria.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement about the procedure for considering gallantry awards in Operation Veritas.  [28213]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20121w01.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The procedure for considering gallantry awards for Operation Veritas will be identical to that used for all other operations. Recommendations for awards, whether they be for gallantry or meritorious service, are initiated by an individual's commanding officer and passed to the Ministry of Defence where they are considered by various Committees. Successful recommendations are then submitted to the Queen for her approval prior to publication. Lists of operational awards are published biannually each spring and autumn and notified to the press. The names of certain recipients may have to be withheld in the interests of personal security.

[28587]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20121w01.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The complement (as at 1 January 2002) of the Operational Support Unit was 50 and the strength 45, which included six female officers and one member of an ethnic minority. The budget allocated for the OSU, for the current financial year, is &#163;2.651 million. While there are no plans to relocate the OSU based at MDP Wethersfield, approval has been given to form a second OSU (of 50 personnel) based at a location in the north of England.

There will be changes to the way in which training is conducted at the remaining four sites&#151;Bassingbourn in Cambridgeshire, Pirbright in Surrey, Winchester in Hampshire and Lichfield in Staffordshire. ATR Bassingbourn will concentrate on junior entry training, and the others will conduct non-infantry adult entry training. These changes will take place during the course of this year.

In the case of the Cefn Croes application it was concluded that there was sufficient information to approve the application in principle without sending it to a public inquiry.

 In the four-year period 1997&#150;2001, the Department of Trade and Industry provided a total of &#163;61.1 million for the support of research and development in renewable energy. Over the same period, total indirect support for renewable energy provided through the Fossil Fuel Levy was &#163;374.8 million.
<P>

<a name="20121w03.html_para0">For the three-year period 2001&#150;04, provision for research and development in renewable energy is &#163;80.6 million, and for the newly introduced capital grants for renewables projects, &#163;191 million. It is estimated that indirect support to be provided through the renewables obligation, planned to come into effect on 1 April 2002, could total &#163;687 million over its first two years of operation. Some continuing support through the Fossil Fuel Levy is also expected.
<P>

<a name="20121w03.html_para1">Looking ahead, introducing the new renewables obligation, exempting renewables from the Climate Change Levy and protecting existing non-fossil fuel obligation (NFFO) contracts will together create a long-term market incentive for renewables expected to be worth over &#163;1 billion per year by 2010.

<a name="20121w04.html_para6">Details of all UK radioactive waste disposals in the north-east Atlantic have been made public and are available from a number of sources, including the "Report of the Independent Review of Disposal of Radioactive Waste in the North East Atlantic" (HMSO, 1984), copies of which are available in the Library of the House. The report contains data on the location of dumpsites, weight of material dumped, levels of activity and numbers of containers. The information on weight and numbers of containers is aggregated in the report for the whole period from 1949&#150;82 during which the UK disposed of radioactive waste at sea. We estimate that, during the 1960s and 70s, around 41,000 tonnes were dumped in the north-east Atlantic in around 75,000 containers of various sizes and types. Radioactive waste disposals were also carried out in the north-east Atlantic by a number of other countries during this period.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20121w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 New requirements for labelling of passenger cars were recently introduced into UK law, in the form of regulations implementing EU directive 99/94/EC. This had the effect of adding information on CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions to the information on fuel efficiency which was already displayed on labels in the UK. A new standardised format for labels was also introduced.

<P>

<a name="20121w06.html_para0">The directive requires member states to monitor and report on the effectiveness of these measures and the Government will be an active participant in the subsequent review by the European Commission. In order to better inform the UK position, the Department will shortly be conducting a consultation exercise on options for banded or comparative labelling.

<P>
<a name="20121w06.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 No. National Interest Mapping Service Agreement (NIMSA) funding is directed towards the support of non-commercial database maintenance and other uneconomic national mapping activities that Ordnance Survey undertakes in the national interest.
<P>

<a name="20121w06.html_para2">Aerial photography is used as part of the database maintenance process and NIMSA has always contributed to its use for uneconomic data base maintenance activities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what discussions he has had with Wiltshire county council about an interim award for 2002&#150;03; if he intends the teachers' pay award to be paid from the revenue support grant; if he will make an extra grant for Wiltshire to cover <i>(a)</i> the duties under the Education Act 1997 to provide full-time education for excluded pupils and <i>(b)</i> the new special educational needs duties in early years; and if he will make a statement on the local government settlement as it affects Wiltshire, with particular reference to education and social services.  [27893]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20121w06.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 The provisional local government finance settlement for 2002&#150;03 continues to give priority to education and social services. Provision for spending on education overall will increase by &#163;2.1 billion or 8.7 per cent. Personal social services will increase by &#163;684 million or 6.5 per cent. Wiltshire benefits from this extra money. Wiltshire's provisional education standard spending assessment increase for 2002&#150;03 is &#163;11.58 million or 6.5 per cent. We have been consulting on our proposals and have not met individual councils during this time. We have been carefully considering all representations on the provisional settlement as we take final decisions.
<P>

<a name="20121w06.html_para4">Wiltshire will also benefit from the overall increase in standards fund grant of &#163;160 million and an increase in the direct grant for schools of 2.75 per cent. The increase in the education SSA already takes account of the prospective increase in teachers' pay, the duties under the 1997 Act to provide full-time education for excluded pupils and the new special educational needs duties in early years.

<P>

<a name="20121w06.html_para5">Following the Transport Council, the Laeken European Council reaffirmed the strategic importance of Galileo. It also invited the Transport Council to continue its work on the project with a view to deciding on funding for, and management of the development phase by next March and June respectively. The council was asked to take account of a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) on the project, which the European Commission issued only on 22 November.
<P>

<a name="20121w06.html_para6">In principle the Government support Galileo, but, as my report of the Transport Council indicates, we and some other member states have outstanding concerns about cost-benefit, financial viability and management aspects of the project. Some of these issues are addressed by the PWC report. But PWC make clear that the system is likely to require more public funding than the Commission previously estimated, including ongoing support through the operational phase.

 The concept of a National Rail Academy is still at a very early stage. The Strategic Rail Authority has commissioned the Rail Industry Training Council to consult with the industry on the establishment of such an academy and what form it might take.

<P>

 The European Commission, normally acting on a qualified majority vote of member states, will decide on all derogations sought on the grounds that application of the technical specifications for interoperability would compromise the economic viability of an upgrading project on the trans-European rail network. This covers both infrastructure and rolling stock related projects.

 The following table compares the provisional standard spending assessment (SSA) for Coventry city council, as announced for consultation on 4 December, with what it would have been if based on the area cost adjustment (ACA) for 2001&#150;02. This shows the effect of updating the data underpinning the area cost adjustment between 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03. The impact of changes to the area cost adjustment is relatively small, at 0.1 per cent. of SSA.

 Decisions on the location of local LSC offices were taken by Ministers in February 2000, before the LSC became operational. Factors taken into consideration included the need to get best value for public money by using, where appropriate, premises then occupied by Training and Enterprise Councils, regard was also had to ensuring locations that would facilitate effective operation of the LSC. Since it became operational the LSC has been responsible for its local office locations and costs.

 The following table shows allocations for the Standards Fund for Hampshire local education authority in 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02. The figures include both Government and local authority contributions. The amount actually paid to schools depends on local expenditure decisions by schools and the local authority.

 We intend to consult widely on the criteria for earned autonomy before regulations are laid.

At this stage, we are not in a position to say how many schools will qualify by the end of the current Parliament.

 It is a mandatory requirement that all policies, programmes and projects are subject to environmental screening at the concept note stage. Screening aims to ensure that environmental issues are taken into consideration at the earliest opportunity and to initiate, where appropriate, more comprehensive environmental appraisal and, if necessary, a full environmental impact assessment.
<P>

<a name="20121w14.html_para1">In 1999, DFID produced an environmental guide. It emphasises that environmental appraisal is concerned just as much with identifying environmental opportunities for improving development outcomes as it is with identifying environmental risks. It also stresses that environmental appraisal is applicable at policy and programme levels as well as at the project level. The guide complements the more detailed 1996 Manual of Environmental Appraisal.

 DFID's regular environmental appraisal procedures are described in response to PQ 2127. It is mandatory within DFID that policies, programmes and projects are subject to environmental screening at the concept stage, with further environmental appraisal to identify risks and opportunities being conducted as required. This work then becomes an integral part of the project documentation, which although not formally published, can be made available to the public on a case by case basis.
<P>

<a name="20121w14.html_para2">In situations where the environmental screening reveals the need for a formal environmental impact assessment (EIA), the assessment will be undertaken by consultants for the national government of the partner country, with funding and, if necessary, additional international technical assistance from DFID.

 The estimated cost to DFID's budget of theft and fraud in the period 1 April 1997 to 31 March 2001 is some &#163;250,000 of which &#163;175,000 can be attributed to contractor fraud. Of the remaining sum, &#163;22,000 relates to the theft of assets which, in line with Treasury guidance, has been classified as involving departmental staff either directly or through collusion. Details of suspected or proven fraud are provided to the Treasury on an annual basis. The annual report that the Treasury prepares on fraud is deposited in the Libraries of both Houses.

 I visited Sudan from 6&#150;11 January and discussed the possibility of taking forward the peace process with the full range of Sudanese political leaders, north and south. I concluded that the time was right for a major international effort to help the parties resolve Africa's most costly and longest running civil conflict. All whom I met expressed their strong commitment to progress on peace, agreed that there was a window of opportunity and expressed their willingness to engage in negotiations. But all doubted they would succeed, given the legacy of mistrust, without outside help, which they thought should include major UK input. I confirmed that we stood ready to play our part. I also emphasised the potential economic benefits for all, and UK readiness to engage in development if stability can be achieved.

 Education is a precondition of development and poverty reduction and is given high priority within our development assistance programme. The Government are strongly committed to achieving the millennium development goals of universal primary education (UPE) in all countries by the year 2015 and gender equity in primary and secondary schooling by 2005. DFID's education strategy paper, "The Challenge of Universal Primary Education", sets out our overall approach and three-fold strategy for achieving these goals. Our recent paper "Children out of School" identifies the different circumstances of children who are not in school and proposes an eight-point plan of international action for accelerating progress towards the 2015 target.

We and others have urged the commission to take the steps needed to improve the handling of such payments since the delays are often excessive and cause real hardship to the organisations and individuals concerned. The commission has improved the management systems used to process those payments and we understand that the delays have been reduced but remain of concern. This is also the case with many payments for implementation of EC programmes in developing countries, where we are also promoting reform.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20121w15.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The Government are committed to the principle that primary education should be made free. No child should be denied access to a basic education because the costs, direct or indirect, cannot be met by the household. School fees are an example of a direct cost, but there may be indirect charges for books, uniforms and exams which can make education unaffordable to many.
<P>

<a name="20121w15.html_para1">The equitable financing of education is a key issue for achieving universal primary education by 2015. Governments of developing countries need to demonstrate the political commitment to abolish education charges. The abolition of primary tuition fees in Malawi and Uganda, brought about by strong political leadership, resulted in enrolment increases of up to 3 million in Uganda and 1.9 million in Malawi. The impact was greatest on the enrolment of girls. Education budgets for proving effective primary education for all should be developed within national poverty reduction strategies and factor in the costs of introducing free primary education.
<P>

<a name="20121w15.html_para2">In our dialogue with partner Governments, civil society and the international community on poverty reduction and education sector programmes, we will continue to argue for the reduction of the financial barriers that exclude large numbers of the poorest children.

The regulations, which we expect to lay before Parliament later this year, will enable the owner of any land, or a lessee with a long lease, to irrevocably dedicate that land for public access. The Forestry Commission has already announced its intention in principle to dedicate the national forestry estate under section 16.
<P>

<a name="20121w16.html_para7">I am also writing today to Green Minister colleagues about the considerable scope for dedication of land held by Government Departments and sponsored non- departmental public bodies, where dedication is compatible with the purpose for which the land is held. We will work with other Departments to explore the opportunities for dedication through the Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government Estate.
<P>

<a name="20121w16.html_para8">Copies of the consultation paper are being sent to organisations representing local authorities, recreational users and land managers, and others with an interest; the consultation paper is also being published on the DEFRA website. A copy of the consultation paper has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what representations she has received from the <i>(a)</i> Youth Hostels Association and <i>(b)</i> the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers about financial losses caused by the foot and mouth crisis; what proposals she has to compensate these organisations; and if she will make a statement.

 I have corresponded with the Youth Hostels Association and met their Chairman and Chief Executive, as has my hon. Friend the Minister for Tourism, Film and Broadcasting I have also received around 200 letters from hon. Members on behalf of constituents concerned about the impact on the YHA's income of foot and mouth disease and the measures taken to control it. The YHA estimate that they lost &#163;5 million 2001 out of an annual income of &#163;30 million.
<P>

<a name="20121w16.html_para9">I have also met representatives from the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers and discussed the impact of foot and mouth disease on their activities. I understand that the losses they suffered are in the region of &#163;250,000 out of an annual income in the order of &#163;23 million.
<P>

<a name="20121w16.html_para10">I am well aware of the impact that foot and mouth disease had on a range of charities, especially those involved in promoting countryside access.

During later stages we modified the guidelines for the

Business recovery fund to clarify that charities' individual business units may be treated as separate business entities and may receive assistance in their own right if their applications meet the fund's other criteria. Charities may also benefit from rate relief granted by local authorities (for which we raised the rate of central subsidy from 75 per cent. to 95 or 98 per cent. in rural areas) and from the deferral of tax payments due. We have also put a lot of effort into encouraging local authorities into reopening footpaths as soon as possible to attract visitors back to the countryside, and put extra resources into tourism promotion via the British Tourist Authority and English Tourism Council.
<P>

<a name="20121w16.html_para11">I accept that the help available is modest compared with the losses that organisations such as the YHA have suffered. It is not possible to provide compensation to charities for loss of income, any more than to farming or non-farming businesses affected by the disease and by the measures to control it. As explained in "England's Rural Future" published on 13 December, we are looking urgently and sympathetically at further measures to help charities&#151;especially those involved in promoting countryside access&#151;to recover from the impact of foot and mouth disease.

 National park authorities make a significant contribution to the operation of the National Rural Development Programme (ERDP), not least through participation in the national and regional consultation groups which advise on the strategic direction of the programme. National park authorities are also encouraged to work with DEFRA's Rural Development Service to ensure that effective delivery of the ERDP contributes to the aims and objectives of national parks. The national park authorities also play a positive role in encouraging uptake of the agri-environment schemes which now form part of the ERDP. In particular they can use their detailed knowledge of the parks to ensure that the Countryside Stewardship Scheme is utilised positively and appropriately within the individual parks.

However, I understand that the first new plant is likely to be operational in spring 2002.

At the same time, we have a voluntary agreement with the industry that GM crops will not be grown here commercially at least until the results of the Farm Scale Evaluations have been assessed.

 The Department has had several contacts with the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions on this issue.

Radioactive waste facilities are among the projects to which these procedures could apply.

Our Departments will therefore continue to discuss planning and radioactive waste policy issues.

 The Spending Review 2000 announced the framework for the Government's support to local authorities for the next three years up to 2003&#150;04. This included an annual increase in the revenue support to local authorities for Environmental Protection and Cultural Services (EPCS), which includes waste management services. By 2003&#150;04 this support will have risen by &#163;1.1 billion over the 2000&#150;01 provision. Consistent with the general local authority financial framework, it is for Essex county council to decide the proportion of their budget that should be directed to waste management work.
<P>

<a name="20121w19.html_para1">In addition to general support to local authority revenue expenditure, the spending review provided &#163;140 million of Government grant for waste management work and &#163;220 million for Private Finance Initiatives (PFI) resources, for waste projects.

 All local authorities in England and Wales have been set statutory performance standards, under the best value regime, for recycling and composting household waste. It is up to individual authorities to decide how best to meet these standards, according to local circumstances. However, guidance was issued in March 2001, by the then DETR, on the development of joint Municipal Waste Management Strategies (MWMS) for waste collection and waste disposal authorities to encourage all authorities to set out integrated plans for meeting their recycling/composting targets. This guidance contains some case studies of local authority waste management schemes.

 The Government look to the football authorities to act quickly to prevent any recurrence of recent crowd disorder at matches. The Football Association and the FA of Wales are conducting detailed inquiries into events at the cup ties played at Cardiff and Aston Villa on 6 January. I expect that these inquiries will consider the extent to which local police forces made use of the extensive public order powers available to them under the Football Offences Act 1991 and other legislation. I have made it clear that the Government stand ready to assist with these inquiries, and my right hon.

 The Heritage Lottery Fund's standard practice is to consult with a range of organisations and individuals, including statutory agencies and practitioners, in advance of policy developments. For example, in reaching a new policy statement on skills and training for the heritage sector, to be published later this month, the Heritage Lottery Fund commissioned a MORI survey, and discussed findings with heritage organisations and employers to inform policy making. The fund's new strategic plan is being considered against the background of extensive consultation undertaken during summer 2001. The consultation process was UK wide, and included heritage practitioners and representatives of non-heritage organisations, members of the public and community leaders. The Heritage Lottery Fund received some 315 responses to its consultation document, and took the views of nearly 600 people who attended workshops, seminars and focus groups into account. The Heritage Lottery Fund follows the Cabinet Office's Code of Practice on written consultation.

A Digital Television Action Plan was issued on 20 December 2001, following consultation on a Draft Plan with stakeholders from all sectors of the broadcasting industry, including the retail sector, and with representatives of consumers. The Action Plan sets out a series of actions to be taken by Government and industry, in partnership, to achieve the aim for the UK to have the most dynamic and competitive market for digital TV in the G7, as measured by take up, choice and cost, and to meet the criteria announced in September 1999 which must be met before analogue terrestrial transmissions could be switched off.

<P>
<a name="20121w23.html_wqn0"><B> Annabelle Ewing: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many cold weather payments have been triggered this winter as a result of low temperatures, broken down by <i>(a)</i> weather station and <i>(b)</i> nation and region of the United Kingdom.  [25948]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20121w23.html_spnew0"><B> Malcolm Wicks </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 January 2002]:</i> Cold weather payments are a key part of our strategy to tackle fuel poverty. They provide extra help towards heating costs for the poorest and most vulnerable members of our society in periods of exceptionally cold weather. They are paid to pensioners receiving the minimum income guarantee, and to people receiving income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance who have children under the age of five or who have a premium for disability or long term sickness.
<P>

<a name="20121w23.html_para0">The payments are made automatically and are triggered when the average temperature is recorded as, or forecast to be, 0 degrees Centigrade or below over seven consecutive days at the weather station linked to the customer's postcode. So far this year we estimate that payments to the value of almost &#163;16.8 million have been triggered. Available information on the breakdown of the payments is in the tables.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how the determination is made as to whether a benefit applicant faces significant difficulties such that a freecall number is provided by the Benefits Agency.  [28799]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20121w23.html_spnew1"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 In deciding whether a freecall service ought to be provided, a variety of factors are considered, e.g. the anticipated length of calls, location of the customer and their likely financial circumstances. Guidance to staff within the Department tells them to make a return telephone call to a customer in the UK on request.

<P>
<a name="20121w23.html_spnew2"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Since 1997 the Benefits Agency has provided two freecall numbers for benefit applications. Both services are available to all UK customers. The first was provided for the benefits inquiry line and the second for minimum income guarantee claims.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20121w23.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 We recognise chronic fatigue syndromes, including ME, as potentially debilitating illnesses and the Department's Chief Medical Adviser constantly evaluates the latest developments in the understanding of these conditions. The personal capability assessment which is used in determining entitlement to incapacity benefit is a functional assessment which looks at the extent to which a person's ability to carry out certain everyday activities is affected by their medical condition. In general, it is the effect of the condition that is important, not the specific diagnosis.
<P>

<a name="20121w23.html_para2">The application of the assessment to people who have a medical condition that fluctuates or varies in its severity (such as ME) is already covered in the training and guidance given to Medical Services doctors who provide advice for Decision Makers. The doctors are trained to base their advice on the level of function that the person is capable of most of the time taking into account such factors as pain, fatigue and variability of symptoms.

<P>
<P>

 To avoid duplicate provision from public funds, the Great Britain-wide social security benefit rules have always precluded payment of attendance allowance to people in residential care homes and nursing homes who receive help with the cost of their place in the home from a local authority or a health authority. Benefit spending is determined by the number of claimants who satisfy the qualifying conditions that apply to a particular benefit. A reduction in forecast benefit expenditure will increase the funds available for public expenditure as a whole, and issues regarding their allocation will be dealt

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what his estimate is of the costs that the Government will incur in servicing Post Office card accounts for <i>(a)</i> 3 million, <i>(b)</i> 4 million, <i>(c)</i> 5 million and <i>(d)</i> 6 million benefit claimants.  [28940]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20121w23.html_spnew8"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 This will depend on the outcome of contractual negotiations between the Government and the Post Office, which will remain commercially in confidence between the parties.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20121w23.html_spnew9"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Around 85 per cent. of benefit claimants have an account into which they can be paid directly. In general, we expect that they will choose to use these accounts when moving to payment by ACT.

[28942]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20121w23.html_spnew10"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Our assumption was derived from the number of benefit and tax credit recipients without bank accounts, recognising that some of these customers will open basic accounts with a high street bank. The commercial arrangements between the Government and the Post Office will provide for the possibility that the actual number of Post Office card accounts may be higher or lower than our 3 million operational assumption.

<a name="20121w26.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 This information is not available in the format requested. However, the most recent estimate of the average cost of contested Crown court proceedings is &#163;21,250 per case, falling to &#163;3,550 in proceedings where a guilty plea is entered. 15,500 defendants elected to be tried by a jury in the year to September 2001, and it is known that many who so elect later enter a guilty plea.

 The Government have taken no decisions on Sir Robin Auld's Review report. The period of comment closes on 31 January. The Government will then be considering the recommendations in detail, including assessments of costs, benefits, and associated factors such as the numbers of magistrates needed to implement them. The Government will announce their conclusions by way of a White Paper in the spring.

 The Lord Chancellor last used the railway service in connection with his official duties on 11 January&#151;the date of his most recent official visit. The journey was between Gatwick Airport and London Victoria. The Lord Chancellor will continue to use the railway for official travel as appropriate. All arrangements for official travel are made in line with the guidance set out in Chapter 7 of the "Ministerial Code", and the accompanying guidance document "Travel by Ministers", using the most efficient and cost effective mode of transport, and bearing in mind security considerations.

1. Income tax payments are calculated on the basis that the households receive no tax reliefs other than the standard allowances and only have income from employment. All earners are assumed to pay Class 1 national insurance contributions at the contracted-in rate.<P>

2. Earnings are taken to be the median gross weekly earnings of all full-time employees on adult rates with pay unaffected by absence.<P>

3. In line with the convention in the Tax Benefit Reference Manual, child benefit is treated as negative income tax.<P>

4. For the two-earner family it is assumed that earnings are split 60/40 per cent. <P>

 In 2001&#150;02, 4.3 million (four in 10) people of pensionable age are liable to income tax. Pensionable age taxpayers have a total tax liability of &#163;8.5 billion in 2001&#150;02. The mean before tax income for pensioner taxpayers in 2001&#150;02 is &#163;15,800 pa and the mean after tax income is &#163;23,850 pa.

<P>
<a name="20121w28.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 The Scottish Executive are taking forward matters regarding the distribution of moneys to members of the Scottish Transport Group pension fund, following its announcement in November 2001 on the pension fund surplus. The tax payable on payments to pensioners will depend on the nature of the payment and the personal tax circumstances of the individual.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how the Government proposes to fulfil the commitment at the 2000 G8 Summit in Okinawa that no countries seriously committed to education for all will be thwarted in their achievements of this goal by lack of resources; what information he has collated on the actions of the other G8 countries to meet this commitment; and if he will make a statement.  [27862]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20121w28.html_spnew10"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20121w28.html_para9">The international response to the resource commitment made at the World Education Forum in Dakar (and endorsed by the G8 at Okinawa) has been slow and has lacked effective co-ordination. At the Education for All High-Level Group meeting in Paris in October, I called for international action to be stepped up in a coherent, well-organised and supportive way.
<P>

<a name="20121w28.html_para10">Achieving universal primary education (UPE) can happen only through reform and action at the country level. More attention needs to be given to determining whether a country is "seriously committed" to education for all. Key indicators of commitment are the development of sound national education policies, closely linked to the country's poverty reduction strategies; the rapid abolition of user fees and other direct cost barriers to education; the resources allocated to education, and specifically to primary education; and concrete evidence of efforts to promote gender equality. Being serious about UPE means clear commitments in all of these areas.
<P>

<a name="20121w28.html_para11">Where countries are making these commitments, the international community must deliver the additional resources they require. We believe that delivering this Dakar resource commitment is best analysed and acted upon at the country level. It should be incorporated into all country level negotiations on poverty reduction strategies. It will also require a step-change in the level of international financing to support and sustain UPE, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Development agencies and the multilateral development banks, including the World bank, must increase the resources committed to helping reforming Governments deliver UPE. We also need much greater co-ordination between development agencies, working together in support of a country's own development strategy.
<P>

<a name="20121w28.html_para12">DFID's "Children out of school" paper sets out these proposals and urges much greater international energy and co-operation in taking them forward. It also calls for the 



<P>
<P><I>21 Jan 2002 : Column 650W</I><P>
response of the developed world to the Dakar resource commitment to be monitored and reported at the World bank annual meeting, and in the report on progress towards the millennium development goals provided by the multilateral developments banks for the G8.
<P>

<a name="20121w28.html_para13">The Government give high priority to the UPE goal and DFID has committed over &#163;600 million to support the development of good quality, sustainable primary education systems in developing countries since 1997. We will do more. Canada shares our strong commitment to UPE and now chairs the G8 Education Task Force, where DFID represents the UK. Information submitted to the task force indicates clearly that the priority given to primary education within other G8 members' development programmes varies significantly. We would like the task force's report to this year's summit in Canada to indicate how the G8 can deliver effectively on its Okinawa commitment, and complement other international action to accelerate progress toward the UPE goal.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make it his policy to allow United Kingdom businesses to make dual currency VAT returns to Customs and Excise where they trade in sterling and euros.  [28395]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20121w30.html_spnew0"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 No. The euro is treated for VAT return purposes as any other foreign currency.

<a name="20121w30.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Reed: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will estimate the total cost to United Kingdom businesses of additional administrative costs following the introduction of euro notes and coins.  [28396]<P>
<P>
<P>

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer for what reasons <i>(a)</i> the &#163;162 million payment due on 1 October 2001 to Renewco was classified as public sector money and <i>(b)</i> the &#163;1.2 billion loan to Railtrack administration was not classified as public sector money.  [28826]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20121w30.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 The Office for National Statistics (ONS) determined that Renewco's activities would be classified to the public sector. The decision was based on the application of internationally agreed definitions for national accounts. This means borrowing by Renewco would be public sector borrowing and add to public sector net debt. The borrowed funds are therefore "public sector money". Payments by Government to Renewco would be transfers of public sector money within the public sector and so would have no impact on the consolidation public sector statistics.

government borrowing, and so is "public sector money". The lending is expected to be repaid before the end of March 2002 and so would have no impact on the fiscal balances and expenditure measures for the financial year as a whole.

<P>
<a name="20121w30.html_spnew4"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 In his pre-Budget report statement the Chancellor stated that Gift Aid was being more widely used. This is a result of reforms he introduced from April 2000 to improve incentives for giving to charity. A larger number of donors can now use Gift Aid following the abolition of the &#163;250 million minimum limit on Gift Aid donations. This has brought into the scheme the large number of smaller donations, which were previously excluded.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to his answer of 12 December 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 891W, on child benefit, what the yield would be for 2002&#150;03 of taxing child benefit payments to <i>(a)</i> recipients paying tax at the higher rate and <i>(b)</i> higher rate tax payers in a couple where one partner receives child benefit, with child benefit rates at &#163;26.25 per week for the first child and &#163;17.60 per week for subsequent children.

 <i>[holding answer 15 January 2002]:</i> If child benefit were increased to &#163;26.25 per week for the first child and &#163;17.60 per week for subsequent children and made taxable for higher rate taxpayers, it is estimated that it would yield about &#163;0.1 billion of income tax. If it were taxable at the higher rate for any family with a higher rate taxpayer (regardless of who received the benefit) it would yield around &#163;1.0 billion of income tax.

As the levy package has only been operational since April 2001, it is too early for an assessment to be made of its impact.

 <i>[holding answer 10 December 2001]:</i> Statutory guidance issued to health and local authorities in March 2001 explained the requirement to make adequate financial provision for modernising local community equipment services. Several systems of financial and performance monitoring encourage commissioners and providers to identify and agree budgets for community equipment services for the coming financial year. These include spring and autumn monitoring exercises with senior managers of social services. Budgetary commitments agreed in local business plans by social services and national health service trusts feed into local modernisation reviews and planning for the integration of local services.

 With an incidence of oral cancer of some 2,500 new cases per year it is not possible to make significant comparisons with provision of national health service dentistry by area especially as confounding factors like use of tobacco and alcohol would need to be eliminated.

 There has been no national health service census. The acute trust patient survey is currently scheduled to take place between January and March 2002. The survey will be part of a programme that the Government are putting in place throughout England. Hospital trusts will carry out a specially designed patient survey programme to seek views on the patient experience.
<P>

<a name="20121w32.html_para0">Improving the experience of the individual patient is central to the NHS Plan. By finding out more, in this systematic manner, we will increase our knowledge of what patients need and expect from the NHS and how well the service responds to their needs and expectations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what is the latest percentage reduction of fees for community pharmacists for dispensing NHS prescriptions.  [24708]

<P>
<a name="20121w32.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 January 2002]:</i> The fees paid to community pharmacy contractors vary according to the item prescribed. The large majority of prescriptions attract a basic dispensing fee. From July 1999 to October 2001 that fee was 97.5p per prescription dispensed. In November 2001 it was changed to 87.4p. This represents a reduction of approximately 10.4 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20121w32.html_para1">The basic dispensing fee is one of a number of fees and allowances by which the global sum for community pharmacies is distributed between pharmacy contractors. The global sum is the amount to be paid to contractors overall in the year in question. The global sum for 2001&#150;02 for England and Wales is &#163;806.6 million, an increase of 3.7 per cent. over 2000&#150;01.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20121w32.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Our programme for the future of pharmacy in the national health service in England was set out in "Pharmacy in the Future&#151;Implementing the NHS Plan" published in September 2000, a copy of which is in the Library.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20121w32.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Willis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health how much was allocated to pharmacists for the dispensing of prescriptions; how many prescriptions were dispensed; and what was the unit cost allowed for each prescription in each year from 1992 to 2001.  [25536]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20121w32.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Each year, a figure (known as the global sum) is set for the remuneration to be paid to pharmacies overall in England and Wales for the national health service pharmaceutical services they provide.
<P>

<a name="20121w32.html_para2">The total remuneration to be paid in any given year is distributed through a system of fees and allowances, some of which relate directly to the number (and type) of prescriptions dispensed, some of which do not.

<sup>(28)</sup> The time spent waiting for admission is calculated for HES purposes as being the period elapsed from the initial decision to admit until the date that the patient is actually admitted. This takes no account of any periods when the patient may have been unavailable for admission, or may have been suspended from the waiting list for medical reasons. It is for this reason that this analysis apparently shows patients waiting over 15 months. The waiting time figures published by the Department of Health take these situations into account.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health which national minimum standards care homes will have to be fully compliant with from 1 April 2002.  [24183]
<P>
<UL><P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20121w33.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 December 2001]:</i> National minimum standards that will not apply to care homes from 1 April 2002 are those relating to training and environmental requirements. Specifically, existing care homes will have until 2005 to comply with the standards requiring a minimum of 50 per cent. of care staff to be qualified at NVQ level 2 or equivalent. Existing care homes will have until 2007 to comply with the standards relating to room size, shared facilities and places in single rooms.
<P>

<a name="20121w33.html_para0">However, non-compliance with national minimum standards will not lead to the National Care Standards Commission automatically pursuing enforcement action or deregistration. Instead it will seek to agree actions to be taken by homes to ensure compliance with standards within a reasonable time frame&#151;unless vulnerable service users are at serious risk as a result of non-compliance. The national minimum standards are intended to be a means of assisting care homes to improve the quality of their services as well as a vehicle to protect vulnerable people.
<P>

<a name="20121w33.html_para1">Not all of the standards relate to all care homes as some are aimed at specialist provision only.

 The appointment of members to the Citizens Council is a matter for the National Institute for Clinical Excellence.

We therefore do not consider it necessary to be prescriptive about the number of members from each country.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment his Department has made of the extent of re-use of single-use surgical instruments in hospital trusts; what action has been taken against hospital trusts found to be re-using surgical instruments designated for single use only; and which items of surgical equipment in general hospital surgical theatres are normally designated for single use only.  [24667]<P>

<a name="20121w35.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Designation of medical devices as single use is a matter for the device manufacturer. The Department has advised national health service trusts on a number of occasions that they should not re-use single use devices. Any trust found doing so during the recent comprehensive survey was advised to cease and such cessation was made part of the action plan.

<i></i>[holding answer 8 January 2002]: The Department does not routinely collect information about the details of national health service trusts' infection control policies. There is, however, a controls assurance standard dealing with infection control. This requires NHS trusts to ensure that written policies, procedures and guidance for the prevention and control of infection are implemented and reflect relevant legislation and published professional guidance, including that on decontamination and the reprocessing of re-usable medical devices.

<P>
<a name="20121w36.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The current re-organisation of the national health service involves a significant movement of staff. However, all staff are guaranteed employment until 2003. With this in mind, it is too early to indicate levels (and therefore costs) of early retirement resulting from the forthcoming structural changes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20121w36.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Strategic health authorities will not be replacing the existing 95 health authorities. Existing health authorities will be disestablished at the end of March and the vast majority of their functions transferred to primary care trusts. Strategic health authorities will have a new role: one of strategic development and performance management. However, the reductions in bureaucracy made as a result of the whole reform programme will lead over time to annual savings of &#163;100 million.

<a name="20121w36.html_para6">Our current supply projections expect an increase of around 1,320 trained specialists to be available to take up surgical consultant posts by 2009&#150;10. This reflects increases in the numbers of doctors in higher specialist training in surgery as a result of the NHS Plan. Projections to 2009&#150;10 suggest an increasing gap between supply and demand may emerge without further action. We continually review future work force needs as part of our national work force planning processes and take action accordingly to address any shortfalls. This action includes increasing numbers in training but also modernising roles and developing new ways of working for doctors alongside other staff.

<a name="20121w36.html_para10">The increase in reported violent incidents by staff is as a result of both on-going local and national campaigns to tackle violence against staff working in the NHS. The reduction in reported violence in 2001 is however a more meaningful comparison, indicating an actual reduction in violent incidents over that 12 month period.

 Guidance on car parking charges was issued to national health service hospitals in March 1996.

 The figures requested are not available. The Medical Research Council's recently completed review of the Epidemiology and Causes of Autism notes that differences in definitions used in the past make comparisons problematic.

<P>
<a name="20121w38.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 When the General Medical Council's Professional Conduct Committee has found a doctor guilty of serious professional misconduct, it can issue a reprimand to the doctor, impose conditions on a doctor's practice for up to three years, suspend the doctor's registration for up to 12 months, which may be renewed, or erase the doctor's name from the register. At present the Professional Conduct Committee has no other powers. The GMC has made proposals for dealing with less serious charges and the Government will be considering how these might be implemented.

 The Department issued (Disciplinary Procedures for Hospital and Community Medical and Dental Staff) Health Circular(90)9 in 1990, a copy of which is in the Library. This sets out the procedures for handling disciplinary issues for medical and dental staff on nationally negotiated terms and conditions of service. These arrangements are now under review to make sure they meet the needs of the modern national health service.

 In our recently published agreement with the statutory and the independent social care, health care and housing sectors&#151;"Building Capacity and Partnership in Care"&#151;we make clear that contract fees should not be set mechanistically but should take into account the legitimate current and future costs faced by providers as well as the planned outcomes for people using services.

 <i>[holding answer 15 January 2002]:</i> All councils received additional funding through the Building Care Capacity Grant. The 55 councils of the highest rates, and the most severe problems, of delayed discharge received extra funding. The extra funding to these councils reflected the rate of delayed discharge in that council's area in summer 2001. These councils will, therefore, be subject to tighter conditions and closer monitoring.
<P>

<a name="20121w39.html_para0">The same criteria were used to distribute the &#163;190 million available for councils through this grant in 2002&#150;03.
