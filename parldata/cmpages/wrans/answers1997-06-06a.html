 I see no case for additional dissemination of Orders in Council. Over 600 Orders in Council, including those recording the admission of new Privy Counsellors and Ministerial appointments, are made each year. Statutory Instruments are published, in many cases following Parliamentary consideration and are thereafter available in the Library. A number of Orders, which include all those relating to the Civil Service, 



<P>
<P><I>6 Jun 1997 : Column: 256</I><P>
together with Royal Proclamations, are published in the <i>London Gazette</i> of which the Library holds copies. Proposed revisions to the Statutes of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge and their colleges are laid before the House of Commons before approval by Her Majesty. Other categories of Order, including those confirming some 200 Schemes made each year by the Church Commissioners, those approving Channel Islands legislation, those approving the reports of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and those approving the grant of Royal Charters and allowing amendments to the Charters of Chartered bodies, are already in the public domain and copies can always be made available on request.<i></i>

 DFID representatives will be meeting with WHO to discuss yellow fever issues in June. We are a significant contributor to the work of WHO to improve disease surveillance and to ensure effective control during outbreaks. Through our support we aim to improve national infrastructures and the capacity for detection. We are also funding the revision of the International Health Regulations, which cover yellow fever.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70606w01.html_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Professional advice is that the risk of importation of yellow fever through an infected individual is real and could result in a focused outbreak. However, such an occurrence is unlikely to lead to the disease becoming endemic. The risk is reduced by the application of international travel regulations regarding yellow fever and the increasing use of vaccine in countries where yellow fever is endemic.

<a name="70606w02.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The only statutory powers which the London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) have and which it is necessary to return to the local authorities are those concerned with LDDC's responsibilities as planning authority. Local authorities already have a range of powers enabling them to pursue the kind of general regeneration remit which LDDC has undertaken.
<P>

<a name="70606w02.html_para0">Since 1994 the LDDC have been pursuing a phased programme of withdrawal from the Docklands Urban Development Area (UDA) leading to complete withdrawal and dissolution of the organisation in March 1998. Those phases of the withdrawal programme successfully completed to date are:--

<P>

<i>Bermondsay Riverside</i> (LB Southwark)--Area removed from the UDA and planning powers returned to Southwark council on 31 October 1994.

<a name="70606w02.html_para1">Apart from transitional powers, enabling completion of certain projects and activities underway at the time of the removal of these areas from the UDA, the LDDC ceased to have any powers to operate in the dedesignated areas after the dates set out.

<a name="70606w02.html_para2">It is intended that the Isle of Dogs, Leamouth and South Poplar (LB Tower Hamlets) will be removed from the UDA and planning powers returned to LB Tower Hamlets byu the end of this year.

<BR>
The Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions has asked me to reply to your recent question about the criteria used to determine that sound-reducing barriers should be erected alongside the A20 Swanley Bypass.

Those barriers were erected under discretionary powers in the Highways Act, in accordance with a policy announced in March 1979 to provide noise barriers alongside trunk roads, subject to the availability of funds and if appropriate, where properties exposed to high noise levels had not benefited from the Noise Insulation Regulations 1975. The barriers at Swanley were provided because they offered an effective shield to a sufficient number of properties exposed to traffic noise at or above the level at which they would have qualified for insulation under the Noise Insulation Regulations and the cost did not exceed the notional cost of providing insulation.

 The Government are aware of employers' use of vouchers as (part) payment of wages. In 1994-95, about &#163;40 million was paid through such practices to approximately 160,000 employees whose earnings, including benefits in kind, were &#163;8,500 per annum or more, and to directors. The available information does not distinguish between shopping vouchers and other forms of voucher.

 The State Veterinary Service (SVS) introduced a feed sampling programme in February 1996. Samples of feed and feed ingredients are taken from feed mills, farms using on-farm feed mixers and any site where feed, or ingredients for feed, are produced or stored. Feed samples are tested for the presence of ruminant and porcine protein using the compound feed ELISA test. Results of this surveillance activity are published in the monthly BSE Enforcement Bulletin and copies are available in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="70606w05.html_para4">In June last year, the feed recall scheme was launched to ensure that residual stocks of mammalian meat and bonemeal (MBM) were removed from farms, feed mills and feed merchants before the ban on possession came into effect last August. In all, over 11,000 tonnes of material was collected in the UK. This material is now in secure storage awaiting destruction. This material is not known to be contaminated with BSE--the controls on Specified Bovine Materials, requiring all tissues known to harbour BSE infectivity to be destroyed, were in place before the feed recall scheme was undertaken, considerably reduce the possibility of infectivity being present in the recalled feed.

The labels of authorised synthetic pyrethroid dips already carry clear warnings about the dangers to fish and other aquatic life. The labels also warn that it is an offence to pollute any stream or watercourse and advise farmer to contact the Environment Agency or the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency as appropriate, where there may be any doubt.

US veterinarians will not authorise export health certificates for poultry meat and exports cannot therefore take place.

However, estimates suggest that the area occupied by individual wind turbine towers can range between five and 20 square metres. For a wind farm consisting of twenty 500kW turbines, each covering an area of approximately 10 square metres, the total footprint would be about 200 square metres. Access tracks where required would occupy further land. The turbines might be placed within an area of about 1-2km <sup>2</sup>  but the bulk of the site would be unaffected and could continue in its original use.

 The Government attach great importance to co-operation with other members of the European Union in the field of scientific research. UK participants play an active role in the EU's Fourth Framework Programme (FP4) for Research and Technological Development which covers a wide range of scientific, technological and medical research. Negotiations concerning the content and organisation of the EU's Fifth Framework Programme, due to start in 1999, have recently begun. The UK has already played, and will continue to play, an active role in the shaping of this

<P>

<a name="70606w06.html_para1">Medical research is well provided for in the Commission proposals for FP5, particularly in the programme "Unlocking the Resources of the Living World", which is specifically aimed at improving the quality of life and for example, includes research: on the control of viral and other infectious diseases; the development of new antibiotics and anti-cancer agents; and the health effects of pollution.

 The Joint Nature Conservation Committee provides an assessment of the potential impact of hydrocarbons exploration and development on the environmental resources of areas before they are offered for licensing. On the basis of its advice, some areas may not be offered while others may have conditions applied to any licence to ensure that possible adverse impacts are minimised. These conditions may also require the provision of an environmental assessment by the licensee when preliminary work has identified the preferred location of a well or development and the probable characteristics of the project.

 The Convention on Nuclear Safety was ratified by the United Kingdom on 17 January 1996 and entered into force on 24 October 1996. As a contracting party under the Convention, the United Kingdom will be required to produce a national report on how nuclear safety obligations are met in this country. These obligations include establishing a legislative and regulatory framework and ensuring that sufficient numbers of qualified staff are available throughout each nuclear installation's life. Steps must also be taken to ensure that design, construction and operation of civil nuclear power plant are safe, that safety assessments are carried out throughout the life of a nuclear installation and that emergency plans are routinely tested. In view of the stringent safety regime that the Government requires of the industry, we anticipate that the United Kingdom will have no difficulty in meeting these obligations.
<P>

<a name="70606w06.html_para2">National reports will be reviewed and discussed in detail by contracting parties at periodic review meetings, to be held at intervals of not more than three years. The first review meeting will be held at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna in April 1999.

<a name="70606w06.html_para3">Projects covering the seven programme areas are undertaken in collaboration with industry, universities and a number of overseas organisations. The results are disseminated via published project summaries and technical reports, including seminars, workshops and conferences. An annual report and newsletter is also published on developments in all the programme areas. The present phase of the programme is due to be completed in 1998.
<P>

<a name="70606w06.html_para4">A mid-term evaluation of the programme by an international panel of experts was undertaken in 1996 and a report of the evaluation published in July 1996. Industry provided evidence to the international panel which indicated that the programme benefits are a mixture of gross and net effects ranging from firm export orders and potential future sales of components, innovative mechanisms to reduce NOx emissions, techniques to use more UK coals in steel making, etc., they do show the programme has been of significant value to UK industry. We are examining what other options there may be to support clean coal technology.

 From 1996-97 the funding rule was replaced by a target to finance the Central Government Borrowing Requirement (CGBR) plus maturing gilts and any net increase in the foreign exchange reserves through debt sales. The latest estimate of the 1996-97 financing requirement is &#163;39.4 billion, of which &#163;25.1 billion is to finance the CGBR, &#163;12.4 billion is to finance gilt redemptions, and the remaining &#163;1.9 billion is to finance the net change in foreign reserves and financing carry-over from 1995-96. Gilts sales in 1996-97 amounted to some &#163;38.8 billion, sales of National Savings products &#163;4.8 billion, and there was negative financing of &#163;0.4 billion from sales of other public debt. Overall there was therefore a &#163;3.9 billion excess of gilt sales relative to the final gilt sales requirement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70606w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 Sunderland District General hospital was recently renamed Sunderland Royal hospital to reflect its royal designation. The change reflects the hospital's links with Sunderland Royal Infirmary, which closed in 1995 when services were transferred to more modern buildings at the District General Hospital. We understand from City Hospitals Sunderland National Health Service Trust that the costs of the title transfer were at around &#163;1,000 and were paid from non-exchequer funds.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what representations he has received concerning the situation of ethnic Albanians who have fled Kosovo and Montenegro and sought asylum in the United Kingdom; and if he will make a statement. [1213]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70606w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="70606w09.html_para4">Various representations have been made, primarily in the context of individual asylum applications. Each asylum application is considered individually on its merits, in the light of the current situation in Kosovo and Montenegro, and asylum is granted where appropriate.
