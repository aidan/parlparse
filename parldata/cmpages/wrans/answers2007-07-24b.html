 DFID has not made its own assessment as it relies on the assessment of the IMF and World Bank, which administer HIPC. According to the Annual Report of the World Bank and IMF Boards in May 2006 the Republic of Congo&#146;s overall progress in the necessary reforms has been limited and slow. There have been improvements in the management of forestry, the social sectors and health, as well as in developing a poverty reduction strategy. However, there has been limited progress in procurement, debt management, the oil sector and civil society involvement in reducing corruption.

This means that the requirement for the provision of social housing will need to be negotiated and agreed with the local planning authority. The Government have implemented a number of initiatives to assist with land supply for housing. A Register of Surplus Public Sector Land held by central Government bodies has been established. English Partnerships review the sites on the register to identify those which could have the potential for housing development. As of June 2007 there were over 700 sites on the register. Sites are continually being added as they are identified as surplus by landowners and removed once expressions of interest are received after a site has been marketed.</p>

 Information on cost details of Service Education Allowances that have been spent by Service parents to help provide education for their children at independent schools is not held. When an eligible Service parent claims a Service Education Allowance, it can be used to help provide continuity of education for their child(ren) in either the independent or state maintained school sector; this is the parents' choice. The allowances can also be used at independent or state maintained education establishments that offer professional or vocational qualifications for the post-16 age group.

<i> [holding answer 19 July 2007]: </i>There has yet to be a pilot of the identity cards scheme. However, there is provision in section 44(4) of the Identity Cards Act 2006 that will enable provisions of the Act to be brought into force in stages so as to allow for a trial in a particular area or relating to a particular category of persons. It also allows for transitional provisions following any such trial.</p>

<i> [holding answer 23 July 2007]:</i> There have been a number of meetings, both at ministerial and official level, with operators and their representatives since October 2006 about the future of the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme (SAWS). Those discussions have centred on the implications of the Government's obligations regarding EU Community preference, restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian nationals and the future role of the Migration Advisory Committee.</p>

<i> [holding answer 23 July 2007]:</i> The Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme (SAWS) allows farmers and growers in the UK to recruit overseas workers to undertake work that is both seasonal and agricultural. The scheme helps to meet any shortfall in the supply of seasonal labour from within the UK and those EU states with access to our labour market.</p>

The preliminary view is that there may be opportunities to consolidate storage at some NDA sites using facilities that are already in site baseline plans, as well as opportunities for minimising waste generation. There are currently no plans for new stores located off NDA sites. The outcomes of these studies will inform the review of the NDA&#146;s Strategy, which it expects to begin during 2008.

<i> [holding answer 23 July 2007]:</i><i> </i>Our continued investment in the National School Sport Strategy, jointly delivered by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Department for Children, Schools and Families, will help us to achieve a sustainable legacy of sporting participation for children and young people now and beyond the Games in 2012. There is a PSA target to increase the percentage of 5-16 year olds participating in a minimum of two hours high quality PE and school sport each week to 85 per cent. by 2008. The 2005-06 annual survey of schools in school sport partnerships showed that 80 per cent. of children and young people were already doing so.</p>

On 13 July 2007 the Prime Minister announced an additional &#163;100 million funding to increase this offer to five hours per week of sport for children and young people aged 5-16, plus three hours per week for young people aged 16-19, by 2010.</p>

 Buildings account for 45 per cent. of total UK carbon emissions&#151;27 per cent. from homes and 18 per cent. from non-domestic buildings&#151;so reducing emissions from buildings will be a vital contribution to delivering our overall target of reducing UK carbon emissions by 60 per cent. on 1990 levels by 2050.</p>

These programmes have already had a significant impact on the existing building stock. The latest annual report on the English House Condition Survey, published in June this year, found that the average energy efficiency rating of the housing stock had progressively improved from 1996.</p>

The draft RSS (South East Plan) affordable housing policy proposes that the future provision of affordable housing in the region should have regard to the overall regional target that 25 per cent. of all new housing should be social rented accommodation and 10 per cent. other forms of affordable housing. The policies contained in the draft RSS, including those relating to future plans for affordable housing provision were the subject of an Examination in Public by an Independent Panel. The Panel are due to hand their report to Government on 31 July 2007. The Panel Report will be published by the Government as soon as practicable following that date.

where there are persistent sales of alcohol to children. Prior to this, we carried out four national Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaigns (AMECs) between 2004 and 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_506"><a name="70724w0014.htm_para5"><a name="0707256000112">As a consequence of these test-purchase campaigns, retailers have strengthened their procedures and training of staff in relation to alcohol sales. Most retailers have now adopted the &#145;Challenge 21&#146; policy, whereby anyone appearing to be under 21 is asked to produce a valid form of identification prior to any sale of alcohol. Test-purchase failure rates have dropped accordingly, indicating that it is increasingly difficult for under-18s to purchase alcohol illegally. During AMEC one in 2004, the overall test-purchase failure rate was 50 per cent. By AMEC four in the summer of 2006, it had reached 29 per cent. and 21 per cent. for the on and off-licence trade respectively, and 18 per cent. for supermarkets. In addition, the Licensing Act 2003 also increased penalties for selling alcohol to children with the maximum fine increasing to &#163;5,000 on conviction, and the possibility for courts to suspend or order forfeit of personal licences on a first offence as opposed to a second conviction, as was previously the case.</p>

Special care: care given in a special nursery, transitional care ward or postnatal ward, which provides care and treatment exceeding normal routine care. Some aspects of special care can be undertaken by a mother supervised by qualified nursing staff. Special nursing care includes support for and education of the infants parents. 2. Level 2 intensive care: (high dependency intensive care): care given in an intensive or special care nursery, which provides continuous skilled supervision by qualified and specially trained nursing staff who may care for more babies than in level 1 intensive care. Care includes support for the infant's parents. 3. Level 1 intensive care: (maximal intensive care): care given in an intensive or special care nursery, which provides continuous skilled supervision by qualified and specially trained nursing and medical staff. Care includes support for the infant's parents. 4. Definitions of general and birth episodes General episode: A general episode is any episode which is not covered under other episode types. Other episode types include birth episodes, delivery episodes, patients formally detained under the provisions mental health legislation or long term psychiatric patients, other birth events and other delivery events. 5. Birth episode: A birth episode is the hospital episode that commences at birth. If a baby is transferred from another episode or re-admitted to hospital after discharge this new episode will not be classified as a birth episode, regardless of the age of the baby. 6. FCE An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year. 7. Data quality Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 national health service trusts and primary care trusts in England. The Information Centre for Health And Social Care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. 8. Ungrossed data Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed). <i> Source:</i> HES, The Information Centre for health and social care.<br>

 From October 2008 we will have established an Information and Support Service where both parents can easily access free information and guidance in relation to child maintenance. To inform the design of this service we are actively engaging with voluntary sector organisations that have expertise in this area. The Department is also in the process of undertaking an assessment of the market capacity to deliver an information service from 2008 onwards. This assessment is necessary to inform our decision making regarding how the services can be most effectively delivered. We will not begin our procurement processes until this assessment is complete which we envisage will be late autumn 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_573"><a name="70724w0028.htm_para6"><a name="07072533000095">Support staffs, including teaching assistants, play an important role in schools, often working closely with pupils with special educational needs (SEN) and disabilities. In recognition of this, the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA), which has responsibility for the training and development of the whole school workforce, has developed national occupational standards for teaching/classroom assistants. These contain elements relevant to working with pupils with SEN or particular educational needs. National Vocational Qualifications at level 2 and 3 are based on these standards.</p>

They also receive a school development grant which they are able to use to support improvements in any aspect of teaching and learning. This can include sending teaching assistants on specialised training courses. Local authorities may retain a proportion of this grant, in certain circumstances, to provide specific training and development in relation to SEN and disabilities. The TDA also provides local authorities with grant funding to support candidates through the HTLA training and assessment process.</p>

 Certain aspects of sex and relationship education (SRE) are a statutory requirement as part of national curriculum science. This stipulates the issues that schools are required to cover at each of the four key stages. Beyond this, the Department's &#145;Sex and Relationship Education Guidance&#146; outlines how schools can deliver a broader programme of SRE using the framework for Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE). The guidance provides information on the issues to be covered in both primary and secondary schools, but it is for individual schools to determine their own SRE policy, including how SRE is delivered and when. The Department does not collect information on this.</p>

 One of the three overarching objectives in the National Languages Strategy, published in 2002, was an entitlement that by 2010 all 7 to 11-year-old pupils will be able to learn a language at least in part in class time. Already some 70 per cent. of schools are providing primary languages within class time, so are making excellent progress towards this goal. We have backed this by action on a range of fronts including: training over 2,000 primary teachers with a languages specialism and aiming to train 6,000 by 2010; committing &#163;49 million over 2006-07 and 2007-08 to support the introduction of primary languages; developing new schemes of work for French, German and Spanish; and setting up the Primary Languages Training Zone, an interactive website for teachers, school leaders and trainers involved in the delivery of primary languages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_584"><a name="70724w0030.htm_para0"><a name="07072533000721">In October 2006, we commissioned a languages review, which was chaired by Lord Dearing and which reported in March 2007. We have accepted Lord Dearing's recommendation that languages should become a compulsory part of the primary curriculum when it is next reviewed. This will mean that all pupils will learn languages for seven years. We hope that learning languages earlier will inspire children with a love of languages and motivate them to continue learning languages post-14.</p>

To begin to realise our aim that every primary pupil who wants to should have an opportunity to learn a musical instrument the Government have invested &#163;30 million in primary instrumental and vocal tuition over the last two years. We are putting a further &#163;10 million this year into a national singing programme aiming to make singing an integral part of every child's school day. The Government are investing &#163;36.5 million this year in the creative partnerships programme which promotes schools working with creative artists.</p>

 The Department for Children, Schools and Families has advised all local authorities and fire brigades that we expect new schools to be fitted with sprinkler systems in future. However, the decision as to whether or not to install sprinkler systems will be based on a risk analysis and there may be a few cases where new schools are at a low risk of fire and where sprinklers would not represent good value for money. The risk analysis and cost benefit analysis tools we have recently published to help clients decide whether or not to install sprinkler systems in schools can also be used to determine whether or not an existing school should have sprinklers fitted, as part of a refurbishment project.</p>

We are aware of the valuable support that organisations such as the British Red Cross offer individual schools or groups of schools at a local level to enrich curriculum work in this area.</p>

 In Angola there is an independent press and a few radio stations that are free to voice criticism of the Government. However, in the provinces the Government-run media largely dominates media coverage. There is only one independent nationwide broadcaster, Radio Vorgan (run by the main opposition party, União Nacional para a Independência Total de Angola (UNITA).</p>

Our embassy in Luanda has sponsored three projects in conjunction with the Bar Association of Angola to assist in the development of the judiciary. We welcome the Government&#146;s introduction of a new press law, which is currently in preparation and will provide more scope for independent reporting. Both the Constitutional Law and the Penal Code are also under review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_628"><a name="70724w0033.htm_para14"><a name="07072533001359">There is complex legislation relating to the registration of political parties which is rigorously enforced. There are 12 opposition parties represented in Parliament. The UNITA congress is currently under way in Luanda and has received coverage in the independent and Government-run media. Representatives of other smaller political parties and members of the Diplomatic Corps have also attended the congress. We welcome the Government&#146;s announcement that legislative and presidential elections will be held in 2008 and 2009 respectively and continue to monitor the political landscape closely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_629"><a name="70724w0033.htm_para15"><a name="07072533001360">The Government of Angola have taken several steps to improve transparency in public financial management. Internationally qualified auditors conduct rigorous cost and fiscal audits for all oil companies, including the national oil company, Sonangol. A new procurement law is being drafted. A Court of Auditors was created in 2001, which helps to review and audit public expenditure allocations and has handed down embezzlement sentences. However, much still needs to be done, not only on transparency of public financial management, but also on strengthening Government accountability to the people. We continue to encourage the Government of Angola to sign up to the principles of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.</p>

 It is a condition of employment that members of the Diplomatic Service must be prepared to serve anywhere in the world at any time during their career, sometimes at very short notice.
