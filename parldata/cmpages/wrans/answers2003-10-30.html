 The Treasury's administration costs expenditure is set out in successive Departmental Reports (most recently for 2003, Cm 2922) and Resource Accounts (most recently for 2002&#150;03, HC 999).

<P>
<P>
<a name="31030w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Gardiner: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether HM Customs and Excise has responded to the requests by the United Nations Security Council for information on violations of arms embargoes in Rwanda by UK companies discussed in the United Nations Security Council document, "Third Report of the International Commission of Inquiry (Rwanda)", (S/1997/1010).  [135132]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31030w01.html_spnew1"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 I am advised that Customs investigators had met with officials from the International Commission of Inquiry (Rwanda) on 10 January 1996 to discuss Customs investigations and had also responded to a request from the UN International Tribunal on 21 March 1996. The Third Report of the Commission was published on 1 November 1996.
<P>

<a name="31030w01.html_para0">There had been some earlier confusion over letters from the Commission which were never received by Customs, but the Commission accepted that the requests in those two letters had been answered in the course of the above meeting.
<P>

<a name="31030w01.html_para1">HM Customs and Excise responded on 14 November 1996 to the Commission's requests for information about Customs investigations into arms supplies to Rwanda and exiled Rwandans.
<P>

<a name="31030w01.html_para2">I understand that Commission officials expressed complete satisfaction with the co-operation received from the UK Government of the day.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31030w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Djanogly: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what the aggregate charge in taxation paid by UK business was from 1997 to 2002.  [134867]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31030w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 Figures on receipts from individual taxes are available in tables 2.1A to 2.1E in Financial Statistics published by the Office for National Statistics, which is available in the Library of the House.




<P>
<P><I>30 Oct 2003 : Column 316W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31030w01.html_para3">It is not possible to apportion receipts between business taxpayers and others. This is due to a number of taxes (for example fuel duty) being paid by both business and individuals, and because markets adjust to shift the incidence of taxation throughout the economy.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Estimates in the following table are produced from the Office for National Statistics' analysis "The effects of taxes and benefits on household income" produced by the ONS and published on the National Statistics website on October 21st 2003. The analysis can be obtained from the House of Commons library or from the National Statistics website at http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits. It includes measures of income inequality for the United Kingdom as a whole based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The table shows, for 2001&#150;02, the average net council tax paid for all households in London and for each income quintile group where households are ranked by equivalised disposable income. Equivalisation is a standard methodology that takes into account the size and composition of households and adjusts their incomes to recognise differing demands on resources. The net council tax figures are gross council tax less reported council tax benefits and discounts. The table also shows the boundaries between equivalised disposable income quintiles, which have been calculated separately for London households. For example, the 1st quintile boundary is the income level below which one fifth of those households are estimated to lie. The results are subject to a degree of uncertainty due to increased sampling variability arising from small sample sizes.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<P>
<a name="31030w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="31030w01.html_wqn5"><B> Bob Spink: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what representations he has received on the cancellation of continuing debt incurred by the UK <i>(a)</i> during and <i>(b)</i> in the aftermath of the Second World War.  [135255]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31030w01.html_spnew5"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 No specific representations concerning the cancellation of the debt incurred by the UK as a result of the Second World War have been received in recent years. However successive Governments have undertaken to meet the obligations under the terms of the debt incurred by repaying the United States and Canadian Governments in full the amounts lent in 1945.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31030w01.html_wqn6"><B> Tim Loughton: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how much has been paid to the United States in settlement of military equipment provision during World War II in each year since 1973.  [134946]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31030w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 From 1973 to 2000, the UK made annual repayments of principal and interest of around US$153 million, made up of a US$138 million scheduled repayment of principal and interest plus US$15 million of interest on the six deferred payments, to the United States in respect of its Second World War Loans. In 2001 and 2002, the repayments were US$152 million and US$150 million respectively.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31030w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Gardiner: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer pursuant to his answer of 6 October, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1087W, on employment disincentives, if he will make such an assessment.  [135110]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31030w01.html_spnew7"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Existing survey data would not provide sufficient information to make an assessment of the disincentive for those on low incomes to change jobs because of short-term cash flow problems. The creation of a new survey, or extension of an existing one, to generate this information would entail disproportionate cost and therefore the Government have no plans to make this assessment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31030w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer pursuant to the answer of 20 June, <i>Official Report</i>, column 458W, on the euro, if he will list the events attended by ministers to campaign for a pro-European consensus; which Government ministers were in attendance at these events; when each event took place; if he will list the events planned for ministers to campaign for a pro-European consensus; which Government ministers will be in attendance; and what were the dates of these events.

 The Chancellor and other Ministers have held a variety of meetings to discuss the euro in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In addition, Treasury officials have held more than 150 meetings with opinion formers in Britain and Europe since the Chancellor's statement on 9 June.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31030w01.html_spnew9"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 UK growth forecasts will be updated in the forthcoming Pre-Budget Report. The Government do not publish forecasts for England and the English regions. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) does not produce estimates of real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for England and the nine English regions. However, the ONS does produce estimates of nominal Gross Value Added (GVA) for these regions, which can be found on its website (www.statistics.gov.uk).

<P>
<P>
<a name="31030w02.html_spnew0"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 There is no reliable measure of the total tax and other duties lost to evasion. In his report, published in March 2000, Lord Grabiner QC commented on the scale of the hidden economy and said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"By its nature, the size of the informal economy is hard to measure.

 The installation of energy-saving materials in residential accommodation and certain charity buildings is liable to VAT at the reduced rate of 5 per cent. This helps to keep homes warm and contributes to achieving the energy saving targets we are committed to as a result of the Kyoto summit. The Government is currently negotiating hard for an amendment to the European Sixth VAT Directive which would permit the reduced VAT rating of the purchase of energy-saving materials for do-it-yourself installation.

 Judicial training is the responsibility of the Judicial Studies Board (JSB), an independent body chaired by Lord Justice Keene.

There are no arrangements to allow private garages in Northern Ireland to carry out MOT tests on private cars, as is the practice in Great Britain. In light of the on-going difficulties with MOT test waiting times, there have been some calls for the GB arrangements to be introduced in Northern Ireland. However, following the recent programme to refurbish and re-equip DVTA's 15 test centres, under a &#163;57 million private finance initiative contract, and on completion of the current project to introduce telephone, and subsequently internet, test booking, I expect the Agency to return to its previously high levels of performance and customer service. I believe these arrangements best suit the circumstances in Northern Ireland and I have no plans at present to review them.

The provision of these new theatres will increase theatre capacity, increase capacity for fracture services, stabilise and reduce waiting lists, and facilitate the mix of elective, trauma and out-patient work of consultant orthopaedic surgeons.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many people around Gatwick airport fell within the 54 leq and 57 leq contours for aircraft noise in 2002; and how many he estimates would fall within these contours in 2030 if a new wide spaced runway were built, assuming no change to aircraft noise standards other than those recently agreed in the International Civil Aviation Organisation.

<P>
<a name="31030w07.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The populations within the 54 and 57 dBA daytime leq contours in 2002 were around 8,400 and 3,500 respectively. The Stage Three SERAS report gave figures for Gatwick with an additional wide spaced runway. In 2030, the populations in the 54 and 57 dBA contours were projected to be 39,800 and 20,900 respectively. The noise projections assume no changes to ICAO noise standards beyond those recently agreed, but do not rely solely on the minimum standards required by ICAO. They incorporate realistic assumptions about replacement of older, noisier aircraft by more modern and less noisy types.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what estimate he has made of the number of cars used by air passengers which would travel to Gatwick airport on average each day if a new wide spaced runway were built and used to full capacity, assuming that flights operated for 16 hours each day, the proportion of passengers using public transport was the same as currently and that of the remaining passengers half parked at the airport, and half were delivered and collected.  [135188]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31030w07.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The information is not available in the form requested. The SERAS Stage 3 report included an assessment of the demands for surface access to the airport in 2030 with the addition of a wide-spaced runway in 2024 (i.e. after expiry of the planning agreement between BAA plc and West Sussex county council). Table 2.10 of the report shows that with passenger demand of 76 million passengers per annum in 2030 (and assuming enhanced rail infrastructure and services), the share of air passenger trips by car would be about 51 per cent. (about 30 million road trips per annum).

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport pursuant to his answer of 1 July 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 194W, on transplant vehicles, whether he has reached conclusions on whether an amendment to legislation is necessary to allow transplant vehicles to be covered by the speed limit exemption for ambulances.  [134267]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31030w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The current speed limit exemption legislation grants an exemption for vehicles used for ambulance purposes, but it does not provide a definition of ambulance purposes. It is therefore for the courts to decide whether, in any particular case, a vehicle used for carrying human tissue is being used for an ambulance purpose.
<P>

<a name="31030w08.html_para3">The Government acknowledge that there may be a requirement to amend speed limit exemption legislation in order to clarify the status of such vehicles. However any exemption to speed limits needs to be considered with the utmost care in order to safeguard the interests of all road users. We are currently considering the wider impacts of such an amendment before reaching a conclusion on whether any amendment would be both necessary and justified.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31030w08.html_spnew2"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 There is no evidence that licensed marine minerals dredging has an impact on the rate of coastal erosion but, as a precaution, each environmental statement that accompanies an application to dredge must include a coastal impact assessment. This is subjected to close scrutiny to ensure that the results are satisfactory before a licence can be given. Most licences are subject to monitoring conditions and no licence has been terminated because of adverse impacts on the coast.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31030w08.html_spnew3"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has not commissioned studies into the impact of offshore dredging on coastal erosion. Every marine minerals dredging proposal is subjected to environmental impact assessment. Every dredging licence application is therefore accompanied by an environmental statement that includes a specific coastal impact study. This is subject to wide consultation and publicity. It is carefully scrutinised by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Sciences on behalf of Defra to determine whether the proposal is environmentally acceptable. Only if the proposal is acceptable is a licence for dredging issued. The licence is normally subject to conditions requiring environmental monitoring and is time limited so that account could be taken of unforeseen environmental impacts if any were to occur.

Each local authority will be required subsequently to submit subsidy claims, calculated in accordance with the Determinations and using a new internet-based system currently undergoing trials with a number of authorities. Where the claim shows that the authority is in deficit and an amount is due to it, subsidy will be paid on-account in 10 monthly instalments starting in May 2004. The amount claimed on account will be subject to audit and, if necessary, adjusted after the end of the year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31030w09.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Sudden reductions in electricity are handled by National Grid and the Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) using the procedures set out in Operating Conditions 6 of the Grid Code (www.nationalgrid.com/ukindinfo code/).
<P>

<a name="31030w09.html_para5">Generally, demand reductions of up to about 10 per cent. will be handled by voltage reductions. Most consumers would be unaffected&#151;lights may flicker or dim for the period necessary. Some sensitive industrial equipment, such as alarms, may be affected.
<P>

<a name="31030w09.html_para6">If immediate demand reductions above that figure are needed, it is likely that customers would be cut off. The speed with which action has to be taken, and the loads involved, means that isolations are made in local areas at primary sub-station level. This action reduces the likelihood of incidents such as cascade tripping, which were seen recently in the US and Italy. However, discrimination between customers in those areas cannot be implemented.

 Through the New and Renewable Energy Programme, the DTI has funded a number of assessments of the benefits of distributed generation, i.e. smaller generation, which is connected to the distribution networks. Some of the most recent include a study of the impact of distributed generation on network security by UMIST and an investigation of the benefits of "islanded" generation operation by PB Power. Both these studies were undertaken in 2002. Currently, the DTI is funding work through the Distributed Generation Coordinating Group to produce guidance on the potential contribution of distributed generation to the security of the distribution networks, to be used in the design and operation of those networks.
<P>

<a name="31030w09.html_para7">Many of the projects relating to distributed generation initiated by the New and Renewable Energy Programme can be accessed via the DTI's website and a complete list of completed and on-going projects can be provided on request. Details of projects commissioned through the Distributed Generation Coordinating Group can be viewed on the Group's website at: distributed-generation.gov.uk

 The Weights and Measures (Liquid Fuel carried by Road Tanker) Order 1985 regulates the delivery of motor fuel by oil suppliers to retailers. There are no systems specifically prescribed for these measurement purposes in the UK. The suppliers' fuel distribution terminal meters, often known as 'gantry meters', are controlled by HM Customs and Excise. These are not subject to type examination or individual verification.

 NWML commissioned a report by NEL (National Engineering Laboratory) on 'Temperature Compensation of Liquid Fuels' in 1999. In response to the report NWML included five separate projects in its current work programme (2000&#150;05). These projects comprise an investigation into possible legislative changes based on standard temperature accounting, the inclusion of sight gauges on road tankers, accuracy of service station stock records, sources and quantities of delivery losses including vapour recovery, and accuracy and legal tolerances of the meters in the supply chain.

<a name="31030w11.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Timms  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 28 October 2003]:</i> The income of sub-postmasters is derived firstly from payments made to them by Post Office Ltd. for carrying out work on its behalf, and secondly, from the sales made by any private retail business, which they run alongside the post office.
<P>

<a name="31030w11.html_para8">Payments from Post Office Ltd. are typically split into two parts: a fixed payment irrespective of volumes of work handled, and product payments which are directly driven by volume of work in their branch.
<P>

<a name="31030w11.html_para9">The income a sub-postmaster receives therefore will be dependent not simply on rate increases, but also on volumes of Post Office Ltd. work handled and by the turnover of any private business.

<a name="31030w12.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Under the current national general medical services (GMS) contract, all general practitioners are responsible for the care of their registered patients for 24 hours each day of the week. Regulations now allow GPs to transfer this responsibility during the out-of-hours period to accredited providers or to delegate it to other GPs. Under the new GMS contract, which is to be introduced from April 2004, GPs will be able to opt out completely from responsibility for care during the out-of-hours period. Primary care trusts are currently working with their local GPs to establish how many intend to exercise this option.

 There is a legal obligation on dispensing doctors and pharmacists to supply appropriate information to patients when dispensing medicines in the form of patient information leaflets or information included on the packaging itself. Since 1 January 1999, all licensed medicines in the United Kingdom have approved leaflets and labels and there has been a range of developments in recent years which have helped to ensure patients receive appropriate information. These include guidance for hospitals on dispensing medicines in original packs at the outset of a patient's stay that will be sufficient for discharge.

Graduates will only start making repayments on their student loan once they are earning over &#163;15,000, and then at a rate linked to their income.
<P>

<a name="31030w13.html_para7">We will continue to provide a means-tested grant to cover the standard tuition fee (&#163;1,125 in 2003/04), and propose to introduce from 2004 a new additional grant of up to &#163;1,000, as part of a package of measures to ensure that more young people continue to take up higher education opportunities. Access Agreements will focus on what institutions are doing to encourage more people from disadvantaged backgrounds to apply: they will be required to say how they will recycle a proportion of their additional fee income into bursaries and other financial support to students from poorer families.

<a name="31030w14.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Survey evidence suggests that, three years after graduation 65 per cent. of employed graduates are in jobs for which their academic qualifications are a prerequisite. A further 14 per cent. of graduates undertake jobs which do not necessarily require a degree but nevertheless make use of their graduate level knowledge or skills. Therefore, around 80 per cent. of employed graduates utilise their undergraduate degrees to a greater or lesser extent three years after graduation <sup>1</sup> .
<P>

<a name="31030w14.html_para2">Although around 20 per cent. of graduates are employed in non-graduate jobs at this point, research following earlier cohorts of graduates up to seven years after they have graduated <sup>2</sup>  suggests that the proportion falls to around 10 per cent. for men and 15 per cent. for women, as graduates settle further into the labour market.

In general there have been fewer security problems in the north of Afghanistan than in the south. But there have been long-standing tensions between various factions, most notably between the leaders of the two biggest factions. The Afghan Government moved quickly to defuse the most recent flare-up between them earlier this month, supported by the UN and the UK-led Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) based in Mazar-e Sharif. The Afghan Interior Minister then brokered a comprehensive peace agreement covering five northern provinces. Implementation of this is being monitored by the UN and the UK PRT. The Afghan Government have now reached agreement with the two commanders on merging their factional forces under neutral and central government command. A number of senior personnel in local civilian and police posts have been replaced by new appointees, which will contribute further to weakening local power bases.

 The British embassy in Managua will close by the end of March 2004. This decision was as a result of budgetary constraints which led us to review how we could maintain our diplomatic presence in Central America in a more cost-effective way.

 Despite a number of difficulties, there have been some positive outcomes to the Somalia reconciliation talks, including a ceasefire agreement and significant dialogue among the parties. The United Kingdom, through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development, has provided support to the conference running costs, to the African Union ceasefire monitoring process, to satellite broadcasting of the proceedings, and to other facilitation activities.

 Various agencies, including the World bank and United Nations, do maintain audits of destruction and damage to Palestinian infrastructure resulting from Israel Defence Forces (IDF) action. The Office of the Special Co-ordinator in the Occupied Territories (UNSCO) estimates that 2,986 Palestinian homes have been destroyed, and 29,197 homes partially destroyed or damaged, in the West Bank and Gaza Strip between October 2000 and August 2003. These figures do not take into account the demolition or destruction of other civil and private Palestinian property, or infrastructure, including water supplies, roads and cultivated land. Reliable figures for this year are not yet available. It is also difficult to give an accurate figure for the total cost of repair to Palestinian infrastructure.

DFID and High Commission staff also make regular field visits as part of this process. A senior London-based DFID official visited a feeding scheme between 20 and 23 October 2003, and High Commission staff and a senior visiting FCO official plan to visit another scheme later this month.

 The UK has made use of its discretion under Article 11(1)<i>(b)</i> of the Waste Framework Directive (75/442/EEC as amended by 91/156/EEC) to provide an exemption from the licensing requirements of Article 10 for composting operations. Licence exemptions are a less onerous form of control than licences and are provided to encourage the recycling of waste.
<P>

<a name="31030w17.html_para2">The current composting exemption restricts the location of composting operations either to the place where the waste is produced or where the final composted material is to be used. We have recently carried out a consultation exercise on the revision of this exemption. The proposed revision would allow waste to be collected from numerous sources and, after composting, to be distributed. We also propose to widen the current exemption to include screening, chipping, shredding, cutting, pulverising or storage of the waste as part of a composting operation. One of the aims of the review is to encourage the recycling of waste by composting by ensuring that the regulatory controls are applied to communal and other composting operations in a way which is proportionate to the risk to the environment and human health.

<P>
<a name="31030w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The EU Emissions Trading Scheme is due to start on 1 January 2005 and is one of the policies being introduced across Europe to tackle emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in order to combat the serious threat of climate change.
<P>

<a name="31030w18.html_para14">The Directive requires members states to implement the Scheme by 31 December 2003. We have consulted publicly on the UK's draft Implementing Regulations and will be continuing work on these in the coming months.

<a name="31030w18.html_para15">All member states are also required by the Directive to let the Commission have their National Allocation Plan by 31 March 2004. In order to meet this deadline we are intending to publish the first draft of our plan for consultation in early December 2003. The Plan will set out the overall cap on emissions for installations within the traded sector and the way that we propose to allocate this cap between industry sectors.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what <i>(a)</i> time limits there are and <i>(b)</i> timetable is in place for her Department's decision-taking relating to the (i) process of licensing GM crops and (ii) releases of genetically modified seeds into the environment.  [135138]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31030w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Case-by-case decisions on applications to release GM crops for commercial cultivation are governed by EC Directive 2001/18. This sets out clear timescales for each stage of the decision-making process. Before a GM crop can be granted consent for commercial importation or cultivation, its release is subjected to an assessment by all EU member states to ensure that it poses no significant risk to human health or the environment. If the UK is the lead competent authority, then it has 90 days to assess the application for compliance with the requirements of the Directive. If the UK is not the lead competent authority, then it has 60 days to forward any comments on applications where another member state has forwarded a favourable opinion to the Commission. As decisions are subject to collective EU agreement, it is not possible to say when a decision on a specific application might be taken, but we do not expect any final decisions before early 2004.
<P>

<a name="31030w18.html_para23">For releases into the environment (i.e. for purposes other than placing on the market), the Directive requires the relevant competent authority to assess applications and respond to the applicant within 90 days. The 90-day

<P>
<a name="31030w18.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 With regard to <i>(a)</i>, ACRE'S advice on the results of the Farm Scale Evaluations will inform our assessment of the relevant crops as each application for consent is considered. To assist its deliberations, ACRE will be holding two open meetings to take evidence from other experts and stakeholders. The first of these will be in London on 25 November 2003 and the second in Edinburgh on 4 December 2003. Details are on the Defra website. There is separate provision in Directive 2001/18/EC for the public to be consulted on applications for the marketing of GM crops.

<P>
<a name="31030w18.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 As decisions are subject to collective EU agreement under Directive 2001/18, it is not possible to say when decisions might be taken. There are currently 21 Part C marketing applications being processed across the EU, 12 of which include cultivation. The UK is not the lead member state for any of the applications for cultivation and nor are we presently considering any such applications on which other member states lead. 10 of the 12 applications are still at the initial stage of being assessed by the lead member state. Positive assessments were forwarded on the other two applications earlier this year and the UK submitted reasoned objections. The UK will be required to respond to any favourable assessments provided by other member states as they are received. We do not expect any final EU decisions on any application before early 2004.

<a name="31030w19.html_para0">When contemplating changes to other legislation the Government consider carefully how best to achieve their aim while protecting other sports from damage that may result from any legal precedent set. However, there may be relatively minor changes that occur indirectly following amendments to certain related legislation. For example, the Environmental Protection (Restriction on the Use of Lead Shot) (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2003, introduces minor changes to the list of sites in Schedule 1 to The Environmental Protection (Restriction on the Use of lead Shot)(England) Regulation 1999. Specifically the New Forest, Avon Valley (Hereford) and River Derwent and Tributaries (Cumbria) and Stanford Training Area, are removed from the list of sites as not being important to waterfowl; the Tweed Estuary is reinstated to the list because it has significant importance for these species. These changes come into force on the 31 October 2003. From this date it will be legal to use lead shot in the New Forest providing people are not shooting species listed on Schedule 2 of the 1999 Regulations, such as ducks and geese.

 The waste recovery operations that require a licence are set out in Article 10 of and Annex IIB to the Waste Framework Directive (75/442/EEC as amended by 91/156/EEC) and have been in force in the UK since May 1994. Composting is included in Annex IIB to the Directive.
<P>

<a name="31030w19.html_para7">Member states have discretion under Article 11(1)(b) of the Directive to adopt "general rules" providing exemptions from the licensing requirements of Article 10. The Department has recently carried out a consultation exercise in England and Wales on the revision of the current licensing exemption for composting. A regulatory impact assessment was published as part of this consultation exercise and is available on the Department's website. Licence exemptions are a less onerous form of control than licences and they are provided to encourage the recycling of waste and the attainment of recycling targets.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what her policy is on <i>(a)</i> the incineration of hazardous waste in cement kilns and <i>(b)</i> the importation of such waste for that purpose.  [133106]<P>

 Cement kilns and other co-incineration plants can play a significant role in the treatment of hazardous waste. Evidence given to the House of Commons EFRA Select Committee inquiry on hazardous waste last year suggests that cement kilns have capacity to deal with significantly more hazardous waste than at present. I am keen to ensure that all treatment options for hazardous waste are considered, and that there should be a diversity of management options available. The UK Management Plan for Exports and Imports of Waste sets out Government policy in relation to the export and import of hazardous waste, including for the incineration of waste in cement kilns. The plan is currently under review in the light of recent European case law, and the on-going review of the Council Regulation (EEC) No. 259/93 on the supervision and control of shipments of waste within, into and out of the European Community.

 The Government have set challenging targets (Statutory Performance Standards) for recycling and composting for all local authorities in England and Wales. It is up to each authority to decide which 



<P>
<P><I>30 Oct 2003 : Column 385W</I><P>
materials to collect, and in what manner, in order to meet those targets, based on local conditions. Their decision will be informed by the strength of the market for each material in the local area, and any quality requirements imposed by processors.
<P>

<a name="31030w19.html_para8">We are committed to reviewing the recycling and composting targets in 2004, in light of the progress made by local authorities in meeting their 2003&#150;04 Statutory Performance Standards.

<P>
<a name="31030w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Water Bill, currently before Parliament, contains a range of measures to advance water conservation. I have also asked Ofwat and the Environment Agency to review jointly the current and potential contribution that water efficiency can make to balancing the supply and demand for water. In addition to this more strategic work, Government are already engaged in a number of activities to encourage water efficiency in different sectors. Envirowise provides advice and guidance to businesses to promote water minimisation, and the Enhanced Capital Allowance scheme has recently been extended to include sustainable water use technologies. I am also considering the feasibility of introducing a product labelling scheme to help domestic consumers identify water efficient fittings and appliances. This will complement the existing duty on water undertakers to promote the efficient use of water by their customers.

 Under section 106 of the Water Industry Act 1991, anyone wishing to make a connection to a public sewer must notify the relevant sewerage undertaker. If a sewerage undertaker is not informed of a proposal to connect, and a connection is subsequently made, the undertaker can, under section 109 of the Water Industry Act 1991, close the communication and recover any reasonable costs incurred.

<P>

<a name="31030w20.html_para2">The Environment Agency's role is to grant consents for discharges from sewers and to monitor pollution incidents. Where pollution from sewers is detected, the Agency can take action either against the sewerage undertaker or in co-operation with the undertaker against an illegal discharger to the sewer as appropriate. Normally the Agency would expect the sewerage undertaker to take appropriate enforcement action using its powers under the Water Industry Act 1991. The environmental impacts of unlawful connections to public sewers are a matter for the Agency.
