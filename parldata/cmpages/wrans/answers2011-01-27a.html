 Financial inclusion programmes supported by the Department for International Development (DFID) demonstrate the positive impact that microfinance can have on women's empowerment. For example, DFID supports the Kashf Foundation in Pakistan, which provides financial services to women from low income communities. An assessment of the programme found that: 60% of clients took out loans to start new businesses; 34% of long-term clients experienced improvement in their economic situation; two-thirds increased their savings; and women's increased ability to contribute to the family income improved their status within the household.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Justice (1) what his Department's policy on target searching within the prison estate <i> (a)</i> is and <i> (b)</i> was in May 2010; [36253]</p>

 Prisons have always been required to examine specific security risks in their establishments and to set out a local strategy for dealing with those risks. Intelligence-led, targeted searches of specific prisoners or prison areas is one important and productive aspect of this strategy that has always been encouraged in prisons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="110127w0001.htm_para24"><a name="11012772000096">Since May 2010 the National Offender Management Service has removed the requirement for prisons outside of the High Security Estate to conduct routine searches in certain areas of the prison. By doing this, in appropriate circumstances, prisons are able to set more effective local searching strategies by moving away from routine searching, which can be predictable and unproductive, and instead concentrate resources on more targeted searches driven by intelligence or other local need. Prisons are required to carry out a local risk assessment to determine if a programme of routine cell searching is required and if so the extent of this. Local searching strategies are documented by each prison and agreed with the regional manager.</p>

 The cost of providing television sets in prison cells is met from the revenue generated by the weekly charge paid by prisoners for the rental of television sets from the prison service. There is therefore no cost to the prison service.</p>

For example, users might expect that a qualification in French would include ail four of the skill areas: speaking, listening, reading and writing. This inclusion is a requirement at GCSE but not a feature of all IGCSE qualifications. Such differences may be confusing to users.

 Good discipline and regular attendance at school is essential to ensure that all pupils can benefit from the opportunities provided by education. It is this Government's intention to restore the authority of teachers and head teachers so they can establish a culture of excellence in their school. School should be a place where there is good behaviour in the classroom, where pupils feel safe, give respect and are respected in turn, and want to come to school to learn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="110127w0001.htm_para35"><a name="11012772000917">There has been no change to the regulations that govern the amount of family leave that can be granted. The Education (Pupil Registration) (England) Regulations 2006 state that a pupil may be granted leave of absence from school to enable them to go away on holiday but that, save for exceptional circumstances, they should not be granted more than 10 school days leave of absence in any school year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"><a name="110127w0001.htm_para36"><a name="11012772000918">Head teachers and local councils already have powers to issue penalty notices (fines of £50 to £100) to parents who fail to ensure their children's regular school attendance, which includes taking them on holiday during term time without the school's permission. Alternatively, local councils can prosecute parents under section 444 of the Education Act 1996. If parents are found guilty of the offence the Act provides for heavier sanctions where the parent condoned their children's absence from school, as in the case of taking them out of school on an extended family holiday without permission. The court can fine parents up to £2,500 and or give a prison sentence of up to three months. The parent will also get a criminal record. Prosecutions should be used as a last resort by local councils as in most cases a penalty notice will be a sufficient sanction to deter parents.</p>

throughout UK seas we are working at a European level to radically reform the common fisheries policy (CFP). However the UK is not awaiting the results of this reform to take action. There have been a number of initiatives aimed at reducing discards, including trialling an alternative "catch quota" management system which is based on managing and monitoring what is caught-not just what is landed. This trial had positive results; reducing discards, increasing selectivity and allowing fishermen to land more and will provide useful evidence for the reform of the CFP.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="110127w0002.htm_para0"><a name="11012772001106">While landing by-catch that would otherwise be discarded would reduce the problem of discards it would not avoid by-catch in the first instance. Our preference has always been to make fishing more selective, thus tackling the root of this wasteful practice and reducing mortality of non-target fish. Project 50%, a collaborative project between fishermen in the south-west and Government, has led to improved selectivity of fishing gear and less by-catch.</p>

 The information requested is as follows:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="110127w0002.htm_para1"><a name="11012772001109"><i> (a)</i> The total discard estimate in 2009 (the latest period for which figures are available for those fisheries sampled in UK) is 51,179 tonnes. There are many reasons explaining these discards; however, the current system for recording catch and discard data does not allow us to differentiate (year on year) why each fish is discarded. Despite this, CEFAS analysis, conducted in 2010 on the 2008 English and Welsh discard data, estimated that:</p>
<a name="110127w0002.htm_brev0"><a name="11012772001218"><ul><p class="tabletext">54% (13,230 tonnes) of total discards were discarded for reasons relating to weak/absent markets (i.e. non-quota species).</p>
</ul><a name="110127w0002.htm_brev1"><a name="11012772001219"><ul><p class="tabletext">Quota constraints were estimated to account for 22% (5,390 tonnes) of discards (i.e. quota species above the legal minimum landing size).</p>
</ul><a name="110127w0002.htm_brev2"><a name="11012772001220"><ul><p class="tabletext">24% (5,880 tonnes) of total discards were quota species below the legal minimum landing size (MLS) and were too small to land.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="110127w0002.htm_para2"><a name="11012772001110">High grading is another type of discarding where fishermen try to optimise the value of their catches by keeping the good value fish and discarding the poorer value ones. This creates a financial profit for fishermen but is still a waste of fish. A European high grading ban is in place in waters around the UK to prevent this behaviour. Other types of discarding, such as unmarketable species, over quota and under MLS may represent a loss of value to the fishermen and from the fishery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="110127w0002.htm_para3"><a name="11012772001111">Estimates of the financial impacts of discards for the British fleet in specific areas are unreliable. To simply use the average market value of all fish species as a multiplier would give an inaccurate estimate of the financial impact of discards. We do, however, have a more robust study under way looking at the economic impact of discarding fish.</p>

In the North sea, discarding is estimated to account for up to 10% of the overall annual food consumption of scavengers. This level of contribution is probably sufficient to allow larger populations of these scavenging species to exist than would otherwise be possible. For instance, seabirds are estimated to consume 50% of discarded material; enough potentially to support over six million birds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="110127w0002.htm_para7"><a name="11012772001115">Several seabed dwelling species also utilise discards but evidence for expansion of these populations, as a response to discards, is weak. In general, the full impacts of discarding on marine communities are not well understood, and neither are the consequences of reducing the amount of discarded material. However, it is recognised that removing non-marketable marine organisms from the ecosystem will reduce its health, and is therefore not consistent with good ecosystem management.</p>

Eight of these trips were aboard vessels based in the Sussex ports of Rye and Shoreham. Overall, 67% by number of the fish caught were discarded, with the corresponding figure from the Sussex trips being 63%. During these trips, 62 different species of fish were caught.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="110127w0002.htm_para8"><a name="11012772001118">Many of these were discarded because there is no market for the species.

1. These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data sourced from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). This uses disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD equivalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br>
2. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br>
3. The reference period for HBAI figures is single financial years. For countries and regions within the UK, three survey years have been combined as single year estimates are subject to volatility.<br>
4. Weekly incomes are presented in 2008-09 prices and have been rounded to the nearest pound sterling.<br>
5. Families are defined as a single adult or couple living as married and any dependent children, including same sex couples (civil partnerships and cohabitees) from January 2006. A household is made up of one of more families and is defined as a single person or group of people living at the same address as their only or main residence, who either share one meal a day together or share the living accommodation (i.e. a living room). In line with the wording of the question, analysis has been carried out at the family level.<br>

 Local authorities have powers, under the Housing Act 2004, to assess the risks and hazards in residential properties using the Housing Health and Safety Rating System. If a property is found to contain serious (category 1) hazards, the local authority has a duty to take the most appropriate action. This could range from trying to deal with the problems informally at first to prohibiting the use of the whole or part of the dwelling. This system provides an important safety net, ensuring that homes are safe and decent. This Government are satisfied that the current legislation achieves the right balance between the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants and have no plans to introduce further regulation in this area.</p>

 The existing legislative framework for private renting provides safeguards to ensure both landlords and tenants take their responsibilities seriously. Where a private tenant has legitimate concerns, they can obtain help and advice from local authorities who also have extensive powers to tackle poor quality stock or poor management standards in the private rented sector. Tenants can also seek advice from a range of free independent advice organisations-most notably the citizen's advice bureaux, many of which receive funding from local authorities. My Department supports these sources of help through the funding it provides to local authorities.</p>

Where appropriate, a right of appeal will be given if the application is refused. When an application is made after the expiry of an individual's permission to remain in the UK, the application is made out of time and the applicant is an over-stayer. The UK Border Agency will also consider applications from those whose stay here has lapsed but in the event that the application is refused, there will not be a right of appeal and the person will be considered for removal if they fail to leave voluntarily.</p>

 We have not estimated a date on which global production of crude oil will peak. However, we do look at a variety of sources that assess oil demand and oil depletion including the IEA, industry and other research organisations. In 2010, DECC's chief scientist sent out a call for evidence on the prospects for future oil supply to a range of experts. A number of responses received argue that a supply 'crunch' (a tightness in the oil market), if not a peak in oil production, is very likely before 2020. We are very grateful for the excellent responses and will use the results to help ensure that our analysis is informed by all relevant factors and further develop energy policies that reduce the risks inherent in a resource constrained future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_416"><a name="110127w0003.htm_para15"><a name="11012779000064">In response to Dame Carol Black's Review of Health of the UK, a UK wide programme jointly sponsored by Department for Work and Pensions and Department of Health is running 11 pilots to address long term sickness absence across all sectors. The pilots combine a personalised service tailored to the needs of the individual with employment support to address long-term sickness absence. These will run and be evaluated until at least 2011.

 The new registration system for private and voluntary healthcare and adult social care providers was set out in the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (the 2008 Act). It came into effect from 1 October 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_462"><a name="110127w0003.htm_para61"><a name="11012780000452">The 2008 Act does not set minimum inspection frequencies for services. Instead, it enables the Care Quality Commission (CQC) to adopt a proportionate approach to inspection. Discussions about when to inspect are based on ongoing intelligence gathering and an assessment of risk. This means CQC targets its resources on providers where the risk is highest, while reducing the regulatory burden on providers where the risk is low.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_463"><a name="110127w0003.htm_para62"><a name="11012780000453">CQC implements its approach to inspections in two ways. CQC carries out planned and responsive reviews of a provider's compliance with the registration requirements. A planned review of compliance is a scheduled check of compliance with all of the 16 key essential safety and quality requirements. A responsive review of compliance is carried out when information, or a gap in information, raises concerns about people not experiencing the outcomes they should. Unlike a planned review of compliance, a responsive review is not a full check of compliance with all 16 key essential requirements; it targets the area(s) and outcomes that the specific concerns or gaps relate to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_464"><a name="110127w0003.htm_para63"><a name="11012780000454">In terms of staffing, CQC is an independent body and it is therefore for CQC to determine the appropriate staffing complement in order to carry out its functions efficiently and effectively.</p>

 General practitioner (GP) consortia working with other health and care professionals will commission the great majority of NHS services for their patients, including stroke care services.

 In line with other areas of the Ministry of Defence (MOD), the Defence Vetting Agency (DVA) is currently examining what reductions can sensibly be made as a result of the strategic defence and security review and the spending review. The outcomes of the both of these are being developed through the MOD's annual planning round. This is expected to conclude in spring 2011. The final decisions on funding for the DVA will ensure that the MOD can continue to provide an effective level of security vetting for its staff and contractors.</p>

 The Technology Strategy Board supports technology innovation by UK businesses in those areas which offer the greatest scope for boosting UK growth and productivity on the basis of business and academic strength. To deliver this goal it works with partners across Government including, importantly, the research councils, as this ensures that investments in research are more closely informed by business, and that businesses will more readily adopt innovations that stem from excellent research.</p>

 The last Government consulted on this issue in 2009, and found that there were mixed views. There was a strong feeling that regulation of debt recovery companies should be looked at in the context of the personal insolvency regime as a whole. Our call for evidence "Managing Borrowing and Dealing with Debt" (published October 2010) invited comments on the personal insolvency framework, including debt management aspects. We have received a large number of responses which are currently being analysed and will be published in due course.</p>

 The Council for Mortgage Lenders have advised that a student loan is very unlikely to materially impact on an individual's ability to get a mortgage. However the reduction in net income may result in a commensurate reduction in the amount a mortgage lender is willing to lend.</p>
