 Although an Impact Assessment is not required where a predetermined formula, such as the rate of inflation, changes the rate of a tax, the Government have recognised that managing cash flow is a key concern for businesses in the current economic climate. This is why the Chancellor announced on 31 March that businesses will be allowed to pay just 2 per cent. of the RPI-linked 5 per cent. increase in their business rates bills in 2009-10. The remaining 60 per cent. can be deferred until 2010-11 and 2011-12.</p>

 Information about English local authorities&#146; actions under the homelessness legislation (Part 7 of the Housing Act 1996) is collected quarterly at local authority level, about households rather than individuals. Information is not collected at constituency level. Therefore, data is provided at the Birmingham city council area, but not for the Hall Green constituency. Data collected includes the number of households accepted by local housing authorities as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need, and therefore owed a main homelessness duty (to secure that suitable accommodation is available). If a settled home is not immediately available, the authority must secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available.</p>

The figures include: those households which have been accepted as owed the main homelessness duty; those for which inquiries are pending; those being accommodated for a limited period because they have been found intentionally homeless and in priority need; those being accommodated pending possible referral to another authority, and those being accommodated pending the outcome of a local authority review or county court appeal.</p>

There were 452 households in temporary accommodation on the 31 December 2008, reported by Birmingham city council, of which 362 were households with dependent (and expected) children and in total 1,068 children (and expected children) within these households.</p>

 Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a notifiable disease. The epidemic in Great Britain peaked with 37,056 clinical cases in 1992. In 2008 there were 33 BSE cases detected either as clinical cases or through the testing programme, a 38 per cent. decline compared to 2007.

Animal Health continues to implement other BSE controls including the killing and disposal of animals which may have consumed the same feed as a BSE case and of the recent offspring of female BSE cases. The Food Standards Agency is responsible for ensuring the removal of specified risk material from the food chain, which is the key public health control for BSE.</p>

 The EU animal by-products regulation requires fallen stock to be disposed of without undue delay. Pending collection for disposal carcases should be held in such a way that domestic animals (including farmed livestock) and wild animals cannot gain access to them. In practice, it would be reasonable to expect them to be held securely, such as in an enclosed building, or an area away from livestock under a suitable cover, such as a tarpaulin. For the future, the Government support research into bioreducer systems which, if accepted as an alternative method of containment for fallen stock under the above regulation, may make it possible to contain and treat fallen stock on farm safely for a longer period pending its eventual collection for disposal by rendering or incineration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_435"><a name="90421w0008.htm_para7"><a name="09042279001453">CERT is operated and funded by the six major energy suppliers, which are required to meet targets by encouraging households to take-up energy efficiency measures, including insulation and high-efficiency lights and appliances. Ofgem, the scheme administrator, does not collect data on energy supplier spend. However, based on the costs of the measures promoted by suppliers, we estimate that the overall spend by suppliers on delivering their CERT obligations across Great Britain will exceed &#163;3 billion over the period 2008-11.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment his Department has made of the effect on <i> (a)</i> patient care and <i> (b)</i> clinical priorities of the four-hour waiting time target for accident and emergency departments. [267698]</p>

<p><a name="st_248"><a name="09042279001698"><a name="90421w0011.htm_spnew0"><a name="09042279006627"><b>Mr. Bradshaw:</b>
 In 2007-08, 72 per cent. of trusts achieved the 4 hour standard of 98 per cent. of patients being seen, diagnosed and treated within 4 hours of their arrival at accident and emergency (A and E). As shown in the latest Healthcare Commission emergency department patient survey (2008), the percentage of respondents rating their overall care as excellent, very good or good was high at 88 per cent. It is important that patients have access to high quality timely care in A and E. However, we recognise that there are still areas for improvement and would encourage all trusts to examine their results and use these as a means to continue to improve patients' experience of A and E services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_467"><a name="90421w0011.htm_para0"><a name="09042279001699">Investment and reform is working. Our drive to eliminate long waits in A and E has made local health services work in new and better ways resulting in faster access to treatment for patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_468"><a name="90421w0011.htm_para1"><a name="09042279001700">There are occasions when, for clinical reasons, patients may need to remain in A and E for longer than four hours&#151;but it is for clinicians to make that judgment. That is why the minimum operating figure of 98 per cent. was introduced in 2003, following discussions with clinicians, to allow for the minority of patients that clinically require more than 4 hours in A and E.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_469"><a name="90421w0011.htm_para2"><a name="09042279001701">It is a local matter for national health service trusts to ensure that they meet the A and E four hour operational standard while not compromising patient care and clinical priorities. In cases of underperforming trusts it is for the primary care trusts and strategic health authorities (SHAs) to ensure that there are plans in place for improvement so all patients can expect the same high quality service. Where there is sustained underperformance, the Department seeks assurances via the SHA that NHS trusts have robust plans in place for improvement in A and E performance, in providing high quality, timely care to patients.</p>

1. Includes activity in English national health service hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.<br>
2. <i> Alcohol-related admissions:</i><br>
The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO). Following international best practice, the NWPHO methodology includes a wide range of diseases and injuries in which alcohol plays a part and estimates the proportion of cases that are attributable to the consumption of alcohol. Details of the conditions and associated proportions can be found in the report Jones et al. (2008) Alcohol-attributable fractions for England: Alcohol-attributable mortality and hospital admissions.<br>
Figures for under 16s only include admissions where one or more alcohol-specific conditions were listed. This is because the research on which the attributable fractions are based does not cover under 16s. Alcohol-specific conditions are those that are wholly attributed to alcohol&#151;that is, those with an attributable fraction of one. They are:<br>
Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (142.6)<br>
Alcoholic gastritis (K29.2)<br>
Alcoholic myopathy (G72.1)<br>
Alcoholic polyneuropathy (G62.1)<br>
Alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing&#146;s syndrome (E24.4)<br>
Degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol (G31.2)<br>
Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (F10)<br>
Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol (X45)<br>
Ethanol poisoning (T51.0)<br>
Methanol poisoning (T51.1)<br>
Toxic effect of alcohol, unspecified (T51.9)<br>
3. <i> Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis:</i><br>
These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br>
4<i> . Ungrossed data:</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
5. <i> Finished admission episodes:</i><br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
6. <i> Primary diagnosis:</i><br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br>
7. <i> Secondary diagnosis:</i><br>
As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 19 (13 from 2002-03 to 2007-08 and six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>
8. <i> Data quality:</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
9. <i> Assessing growth through time:</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
10. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
11. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
12. <i> Assignment of Episodes to Years:</i><br>
Years are assigned by the end of the first period of care in a patient&#146;s hospital stay.<br>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
1 NHS organisations are identified by Group 85.1, 'Human health activities' (but exclude Subclass 85.11/2, 'Private sector hospital activities'. These are determined according to Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). This system is used in UK official statistics for classifying businesses by the main type of economic activity they are engaged in, and is the responsibility of the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The latest version is 'SIC 2003'.<br>
2 The Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR) 1995, under which a requirement is placed on the appropriate 'responsible person' to notify the relevant enforcing authority of a reportable event arising from work activity. The 'responsible person' may be the employer of an injured person, a self-employed person, or someone who is control of premises were work is carried on.<br>
3 The annual basis is the planning year from 1 April to 31 March.<br>
4 Information available under regulation 3(1) of RIDDOR includes three categories of severity of injury to employees and self-employed people (workers): fatal injuries, defined major injuries and other injuries leading to more than three days absence (over-three-day). There are two categories of severity for members of the public: fatal injuries and non-fatal injuries that cause a person to be taken from the site of the accident to hospital. The same regulation includes a list of specified dangerous occurrences; these are events which do not necessarily result in a reportable injury, but have the potential to cause significant harm.<br>
5 Regulation 5 of RIDDOR requires the 'responsible person' to report cases of certain diseases which are linked with specified work activities. In most cases this involves written diagnosis from a registered medical practitioner.<br>
6 Regulation 6(1) of RIDDOR places a requirement on distributors, fillers, importers or suppliers of flammable gas to report any incident in connection with its supply and use which results in a fatality, major injury or condition. An incident can cause more than one fatality or injury. Regulation 6(2) of RIDDOR requires registered installers of gas appliances to provide details of any dangerous gas appliances or fittings to the relevant enforcing authority.<br>

 Stroke is included as a priority for the national health service in the operating framework. The stroke strategy recommends that everyone who can benefit from urgent stroke care should be transferred to an acute stroke centre that provides 24-hour access to scans and specialist stroke care. All hospitals now provide computed axial tomography scanning and most provide magnetic resonance imaging and carotid doppler too. The Department published an imaging guide in 2008, to help ensure that imaging services develop in line with the quality markers in the national stroke strategy. A copy has been placed in the Library. The guide has been welcomed by the profession. The latest National Sentinel Audit of stroke from the Royal College of Physicians shows that the number of stroke units providing thrombolysis is increasing. However, provision of these services out of hours remains a challenge. Local stroke networks have been established to assist in reviewing and organising the delivery of improved stroke services. This includes ensuring access to scanning and the provision of thrombolysis where appropriate.</p>

 The Government believe that it is right to explore the potential of xenotransplantation in a cautious stepwise fashion. It could be a potential solution to the ongoing shortage of human organs and tissues for transplantation, but also raises concerns for the safety of the individual and the wider public for the efficacy of the procedures and for the welfare of the animals involved.

As much of the technology and operational processes needed to implement identity cards is also required for the implementation of these new passports, this is the most cost-effective way to deliver these initiatives.</p>

<sup>(1)</sup> The statistics relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences the principal offence is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.<br>
<sup>(2)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>
<sup>(3)</sup> Data included in the table are from sections within the 2003 Sexual Offences Act which identify the victim as a minor.<br>
<sup>(4)</sup> The Sexual Offences Act 2003 came into force on 1 May 2004, and supersedes previous Acts.<br>
<sup>(5)</sup> Proportion of those proceeded against who were found guilty.<br>
<sup>(6)</sup> Staffordshire police force were only able to submit sample data for persons proceeded against and convicted in the magistrates courts for the year 2000. Although sufficient to estimate higher orders of data, these data are not robust enough at a detailed level and have been excluded from the table.<br>
<i> Note</i>:<br>
The found guilty column may exceed those proceeded against, as it may be the case that the proceedings in the magistrates court took place in the proceeding year and they were found guilty at the Crown court in the following year, or the defendants were found guilty for a different offence to the original offence proceeded against.<br>

<sup>(1)</sup> The statistics relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences the principal offence is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.<br>
<sup>(2)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>
<sup>(3)</sup> Data included in the table are from sections within the 2003 Sexual Offences Act which identify the victim as a minor.<br>
<sup>(4)</sup> The Sexual Offences Act 2003 came into force on 1 May 2004, and supersedes previous Acts.<br>
<sup>(5)</sup> Proportion of those proceeded against who were found guilty.<br>
<i> Note</i>:<br>
The found guilty column may exceed those proceeded against, as it may be the case that the proceedings in the magistrates court took place in the proceeding year and they were found guilty at the Crown court in the following year, or the defendants were found guilty for a different offence to the original offence proceeded against.<br>

<sup>(1)</sup> The statistics relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences the principal offence is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.<br>
<sup>(2)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>
<sup>(3)</sup> Data included in the table are from sections within the 2003 Sexual Offences Act which identify the victim as a minor.<br>
<sup>(4)</sup> The Sexual Offences Act 2003 came into force on 1 May 2004, and supersedes previous Acts.<br>
<sup>(5)</sup> Proportion of those proceeded against who were found guilty.<br>
<i> Note</i>:<br>
The found guilty column may exceed those proceeded against, as it may be the case that the proceedings in the magistrates court took place in the proceeding year and they were found guilty at the Crown court in the following year, or the defendants were found guilty for a different offence to the original offence proceeded against.<br>

 Travel document standards, including those relating to the minimum security features of such documents are set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) in their Document 9303.

<i> [holding answer 10 March 2009]: </i>Following the review by Sir Ronnie Flanagan, the Government have cut the amount of unnecessary bureaucracy to allow the police to focus on local priorities, including:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_528"><a name="90421w0019.htm_para2"><a name="09042279003587">In order to reduce the bureaucracy on officers still further the Government have also abolished the need for police officers to complete the annual police activity analysis form, which asked them to account for their activity for each 15 minute working period of their shifts over a two week period&#151;a step which alone frees up the equivalent of 150 extra officers and staff. Therefore the figures requested will not be produced in the future, as to request them would take police officers away from the front line. The information requested is in the following table.</p>

 In January 2009 the Government appointed Ms. Sara Payne as Victims&#146; Champion to ensure that the views of victims and those bereaved by homicide are heard.

 Disability living allowance is designed to provide extra help for those disabled relatively early in life who have had limited opportunities to earn and save.

Attendance allowance must be seen in the context of the interlocking nature of the social security scheme and the fact that the cut-off age will tend to coincide with a time when a person becomes entitled to a range of other benefits and services.</p>

Estimates are presented in net terms reflecting that the estimated savings from reduced income related benefit payments (pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit) have been deducted from the cost of increasing the basic state pension. The proportions of additional expenditure saved through reduced income related benefit payments have been estimated using the Department's Policy Simulation Model and are assumed to remain constant overtime.<br>
In the baseline costing for the financial year 2009-10 Treasury Economic assumptions consistent with the pre-Budget report 2008 have been used to model basic state pension uprating.<br>
Estimates are in 2008-09 prices and have been rounded to the nearest &#163;100 million.<br>
