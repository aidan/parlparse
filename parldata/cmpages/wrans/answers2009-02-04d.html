<i> </i><i> [h</i><i> olding answer 3 February 2009]:</i>We are supporting the provision of rural bus services by means of Rural Bus Subsidy Grant (RBSG), which is now paid to local authorities as part of their area-based funding. Since its introduction in 1998, over &#163;500 million has been made available for the support of rural bus services in this way; &#163;57 million has been allocated this year.</p>

This scheme has encouraged the development of innovative solutions to meeting rural transport needs. Many of the 300 projects initially supported by RBC funding are now continuing with mainstream funding from local authorities and other sources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_366"><a name="90204w0002.htm_para3"><a name="09020484000151">The rules for the route registration of local bus services have been amended. This has enabled the introduction of flexibly routed, demand-responsive bus services. We also extended to these services eligibility to receive Bus Service Operators Grant (BSOG) from the Department for Transport. BSOG eligibility has also been extended to include community transport operators, with over 1,000 operators, many in rural areas, now claiming BSOG.</p>

This policy aims to bring together the efforts of the train operating company, Network Rail (NR), the local authority and also local communities to put local or rural services on a steady footing by working together to promote and support local rail operations, increase patronage and awareness of the service. In each individual case, the route is assessed and designated as a &#145;Community Rail&#146; route, supported by a Community Rail Partnership.</p>

The PRT combines the efforts of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), the Department for International Development (DfID) and the Ministry of Defence (MoD) in a comprehensive approach to development. Accordingly, the PRT delivers reconstruction and development projects from a tri-departmental budget managed jointly by FCO, DflD and MoD. &#163;7.04 million was spent in 2006-07 and &#163;9.99 million in 2007-08 from the Global Conflict Prevention Pool. To date, &#163;14.08 million (of a Stabilisation Aid Fund budget of &#163;34.41 million) has been spent in 2008-09.

We held detailed discussions on disability and mental health issues, and the role of the prosecutor in the UK and China in upholding defendants&#146; rights. We welcomed the decision to make permanent more liberal regulations on foreign journalists, but also raised our concerns about the continued detention of a signatory of charter 08. We handed over a list of 50 other individual cases and asked for further information about these. We urged China to implement the recommendations of the UN Committee Against Torture and to issue open invitations to UN Special Rapporteurs to visit China. With reference to Tibet, we made clear that we remain concerned about the apparent lack of due process for those in detention in Tibet, restrictions on freedom of religion and lack of transparency. We urged renewed dialogue between the Chinese Government and representatives of the Dalai Lama to resolve the underlying issues, and pressed for agreements on visits by foreign journalists and diplomats.</p>

One of the consequences of proscription is that the resources of the organisation are defined as &#147;terrorist property.&#148; The definition of &#147;terrorist property&#148; is money or other property likely to be used for the purposes of terrorism, including any resources of a proscribed organisation. As such, there are a number of provisions, also contained in the Terrorism Act 2000, which make it unlawful to carry out specified fundraising activities if the person intends or has reasonable cause to suspect that the money or property may be used for the purposes of terrorism. The specified activities include inviting another to provide money or other property, receiving money or other property, providing money or other property, or possessing money or other property.</p>

<i> [holding answer 19 January 2009]:</i> The Government have excellent links with the incoming Administration. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has met President-elect Obama twice in 2008, and spoken to him on other occasions. We have long standing ties with Vice-President-elect Biden as well as the nominees for Secretaries of State, Defence and Treasury, as well as with nearly all other prospective Cabinet Secretaries. These strong Cabinet relations are mirrored at all levels, thanks to the work of our embassy in Washington and our other US posts in establishing, cultivating and building strong links with officials who will work in the White House and across the incoming Administration.</p>

NESTA estimates that universal super-fast broadband in the UK could directly create 600,000 new ICT jobs and add &#163;18 billion to GDP over four years with even larger indirect benefit.

<i> [holding answer 12 January 2009]:</i> Sport England has announced that the England and Wales Cricket Board will receive nearly &#163;38 million of 2009 to 2013 Whole Sport Plan funding to deliver its plan for cricket. This represents the largest award made to any of the 46 national governing bodies receiving Whole Sport Plan funding. The final breakdown of these awards is still being finalised with NGBs. It will also be open to the ECB to supplement this further through bidding for the significant extra funding streams which will be available, as they currently do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_442"><a name="90204w0009.htm_para4"><a name="09020492000970">In answer:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_443"><a name="90204w0009.htm_para5"><a name="09020492000971"><i> (a)</i> Sport England is responsible for getting 1 million more people playing sport&#151;three times 30 minute sessions of at least moderate intensity per week&#151;and will measure this through the Active People Survey. As part of their Whole Sport Plan funding, national governing bodies will be responsible for increasing one times 30 minute weekly participation in their sport as a contribution towards the global target. Given this, the varying intensities of longer duration sports, and the emphasis on the sustain strand of the Sport England strategy, the one times 30 measure represents an effective gauge of a sport&#146;s contribution to Sport England&#146;s participation objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_444"><a name="90204w0009.htm_para6"><a name="09020492000972"><i> (b)</i> Therefore three times 30 minute participation in Cricket was not a contributory factor in the assessment of the ECB's funding submission. Sports were asked to demonstrate how they could increase one times 30 minute participation as part of the funding process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_445"><a name="90204w0009.htm_para7"><a name="09020492000973"><i> (c)</i> It is the ECB's responsibility to manage the sport of Cricket, creating opportunities for all. The ECB submission contains specific interventions for women and girls, and disabled cricket. Sport England's investment into the ECB will seek to encourage the grow, sustain and excel outcomes for these priority groups, and funding for these areas of work will be allocated to the ECB accordingly.</p>

 One of the key outcomes in our National Domestic Violence Reduction Delivery Plan is to reduce the prevalence of domestic violence, particularly in high incidence areas and/or communities. We are revisiting our delivery plan to ensure a greater focus on prevention. An example would be exploring how to change attitudes and behaviours of key audiences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_484"><a name="90204w0012.htm_para1"><a name="09020492001257">One initiative which is currently being promoted through the school curriculum provides scope for education on addressing the underlying causes of violence and abuse relationships. One example is SEAL (social and emotional aspects of learning), which helps children develop their capacity to empathise, show respect and form positive relationships with other people. This can be expected to apply to any form of violent behaviour and thus prevent future incidences of domestic violence.</p>

 The National DNA Database is designed to match DNA taken from crime scenes with that taken from individuals.

Service patients requiring such prostheses are transferred to the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC) at Headley Court when they are medically stable. Within typically two days of arrival they are seen by a prosthetist in order to cast a bespoke socket that will cover the stump and allow attachment of the prosthetic limb itself. The limb is then typically supplied within five days of admission to Headley Court and fitted when it is clinically appropriate. The patient is also given a second limb as a spare and additional limbs or fittings as are required to improve functionality. In cases where a simple replacement of a component is appropriate, individual patient data held at DMRC enable the new item to be manufactured and supplied without necessarily requiring the patient to attend Headley Court in person.</p>

 At the time of the 2008 pre-Budget-report, the Government published a new integrated strategy for HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and the UK Border Agency (UKBA); &#145;Tackling Tobacco Smuggling Together&#146;. The strategy document is available in the Commons Library. This sets out the Government's plans to build on the considerable progress that has already been made in driving down tobacco smuggling and reducing revenue losses. The strategy takes full account of work being done at EU level and at international level through the World Health Organisation's framework convention on tobacco control. As a party to the convention, the UK is committed to seeking an agreement on an illicit trade protocol under article 15 by 2010. The strategy also sets out a clear framework for co-operation between law enforcement bodies, regulatory authorities and the public health sector. It also reinforces co-operation with the tobacco industry, which remains crucial to tackling smuggled and counterfeit tobacco.</p>

 The Government take all aspects of homelessness very seriously. We have allocated over &#163;200 million to local authorities and voluntary organisations over the next three years (2008-11) to tackle and prevent homelessness in their area. This is the biggest ever cash injection for homelessness services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_571"><a name="90204w0025.htm_para0"><a name="0902055000935">Over recent months Government have announced a series of measures and new funding that will help homeowners remain in their home wherever possible. This help includes the &#163;200 million Mortgage Rescue Scheme which should enable up to 6,000 of the most vulnerable households to avoid repossession; the Homeowner Mortgage Support Scheme which will allow households to defer payment on their mortgage for up to two years; and substantial changes to Support for Mortgage Interest by reducing the waiting time from 39 weeks to 13 weeks, and increasing the capital limit to &#163;200,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_572"><a name="90204w0025.htm_para1"><a name="0902055000936">In addition, my Department has provided &#163;2.5 million funding to the National Homelessness Advice Service (NHAS) which is a partnership between Shelter and the Citizens Advice Bureaux (CABx) providing high quality advice on homelessness prevention through the network of participating CABx and other voluntary agencies across England. The funding will also help to strengthen NHAS responses to support those people facing repossession. This will involve training 1,000 front line advice workers in Shelter and CABx which NHAS will also roll out to local authorities.</p>

 Part 7 of the Housing Act 1996 provides one of the strongest safety nets in the world for families with children and vulnerable people who become homeless through no fault of their own. It provides a consistent, national statutory framework for the provision of homelessness assistance across England. The Secretary of State has issued guidance to which all local authorities in England must have regard to when exercising their functions relating to homelessness and the prevention of homelessness. Extensive data about local housing authorities&#146; activities under the relevant legislation are collected and published quarterly. These data are monitored by a team of homelessness specialist advisers, located within the Department of Communities and Local Government, who work closely with local authorities to help them tackle and prevent homelessness effectively.</p>

The Government&#146;s policy is to avoid inappropriate development in areas of risk of flooding, and to direct development away from areas at highest risk. However it is not always possible to find a location at low flood risk. In parts of the country where virtually all land is within high flood risk areas and there are few, if any, low risk sites for development PPS25 imposes new requirements on planners to show that the need for development outweighs the flood risk, and to ensure that homes that have to be built in higher risk areas are safe and less susceptible to flood damage.</p>

2. The data in the table are based on records received from Ordnance Survey up to June 2008, consistent with the October 2008 update of LUCS.<br>
3. Figures may not add up due to rounding.<br>
4. The definition of high flood risk areas used by Communities and Local Government is the high risk zone mapped by the Environment Agency as being at a probability of flooding, excluding the presence of flood defences, of at least one in one hundred each year for river flooding and at least one in 200 for coastal flooding. High flood risk areas account for about 10 per cent. of land in England, including parts of major cities such as London.<br>

 In 2006, we commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers to evaluate the impact of Building Schools for the Future (BSF) on educational attainment. This is in line with HM Treasury &#147;Green Book&#148; requirements for independent evaluation of major new programmes. PricewaterhouseCoopers has now delivered its second annual report on this evaluation, which we published on 20 January 2009. I will make this report available in the House Library.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_653"><a name="90204w0033.htm_para0"><a name="09020517000325">Although 50 BSF schools are now open, the pupils have only been in the new schools for a short time. So it is still too early for pupils' results in tests and exams to tell us about the benefit the pupils are deriving from the new schools. The report therefore concentrates on management of the programme. It shows that BSF is gaining momentum, and that as schools and authorities progress through it, there is increasing sharpness of focus on achieving educational transformation. The majority of head teachers view BSF as educationally transformational and believe that it will allow their schools to deliver better outcomes for pupils, that teachers will be able to focus more on personalised teaching and learning, and that it will increase the range of services offered to support learners and their families.</p>

 The independent individual budget evaluation was not designed to examine the outcomes for specific groups of service users, but for broad categories of people: older people, people with learning disabilities, people with physical disabilities and people with mental health problems. It was a randomised controlled trial, in which all those people potentially eligible for individual budgets within each pilot site were allocated at random to an individual budget or a comparison group. Sites varied in the groups of service users for whom they intended to pilot individual budgets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_738"><a name="90204w0043.htm_para0"><a name="09020517004472">However, analysis undertaken by officials on a sample of PFI schemes showed that the provision of &#145;soft&#146; facilities management (FM) services (e.g. catering, cleaning, portering) made up on average 26 per cent. of the unitary payment; &#145;hard&#146; FM services (building maintenance) on average 20 per cent. Costs to the private sector in management fees (administering the special purpose vehicles or &#145;project companies&#146;) and taking out insurance on the new facilities account for another approximately 4 per cent.

Under a &#145;variation of services&#146; clause in the contract, trusts can also require a change to the contract, for example, to increase capacity, which is charged for through an increase to the unitary payment.</p>

 We have no plans to change the conditions which determine who receives organs from deceased donors, including those who carry a donor card. The system of allocation differs according to the type of organ, whether it is a heart, lung, kidney, or liver. Patients waiting for a heart or liver who are classified as urgent are given priority. This is because their life expectancy without a transplant can be measured in days or even hours. If there are no urgent patients on the waiting list, the organ is offered for patients on the non-urgent list who are nearest in age and blood group to the donor. The location of donor and recipient is also considered to minimise the delay between retrieving and transplanting organs.</p>
