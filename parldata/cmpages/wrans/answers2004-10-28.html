<p><a name="41028w02.html_spnew3"><b> Charlotte Atkins: </b> 
 The Single European Sky (SES) Regulations, which came into force on the 20 April 2004, require the development of a common charging scheme for the recovery of the costs of air navigation services provided to airlines and other airspace users.

 The Government has undertaken no research on this matter. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has produced a discussion paper outlining the flaws in the existing en-route charging system and presenting a number of key principles against which reform should be judged.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w02.html_para5">
More generally, ECAC States succeeded in their aim of keeping open market-based options to tackle the climate change impacts of aviation. The new Assembly Resolution gives us flexibility to continue to pursue the policies set out in the Air Transport White Paper&#151;to press for the inclusion of intra-EU aviation in the EU emissions trading scheme; as well as to explore and discuss options for the use of other economic instruments.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will introduce legislation to address overbooking of flights by commercial airlines.  [193459]</p>




<p><a name="41028w02.html_spnew6"><b> Charlotte Atkins: </b> 
 On any particular flight there is likely to be a proportion of passengers, mainly from those holding flexible tickets, who do not check in. On the basis of statistical evidence from previous flights, airlines estimate the probable number of no-shows and overbook accordingly. On the great majority of flights no passengers are denied boarding, and by reducing the number of empty seats overbooking keeps fares lower than they would otherwise be. This practice is widely accepted by passenger organisations and by regulators as being in the best interests of consumers generally.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w02.html_para7">
In the comparatively small proportion of cases where denied boarding occurs, existing Community legislation requires Community air carriers to provide prescribed minimum levels of financial compensation, in addition to offering passengers a choice between re-routeing and reimbursement. On 17 February 2005 a new EC Regulation is due to enter force, which will increase the minimum levels of compensation payable to those affected by overbooking and extend cover to passengers on both scheduled and non-scheduled flights.

On transport, the Government Offices assist in accelerating the delivery of the Secretary of State&#039;s national objectives for transport, including delivery of PSA targets in the region, through partnership with DfT and relevant national, regional and local bodies. The Government Offices do not have direct responsibility for the provision of transport infrastructure, but they assist in the development of such infrastructure, for example by:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">advising local authorities on the development of major transport schemes, helping to ensure that these support local transport plan objectives and the wider objectives of regional planning guidance;</p>

Should the Magnox reprocessing plant be unable to reprocess fuel, and there were significant quantities of wetted fuel remaining, one option could be to encapsulate intact fuel elements in drums for interim storage. Ongoing research has concentrated on the thermal and corrosion effects of a range of potential encapsulants and the durability of the resultant encapsulated package.

<p><a name="41028w04.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 Heavy monsoon rain in Bangladesh and surrounding countries in July, led to major flooding over Bangladesh. This was exacerbated by a localised monsoon depression, which swept over Bangladesh in September, bringing three limes the normal rainfall and causing flooding in Dhaka, the southwest and central areas of the country, including several districts, which had not been affected by the previous flood.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w04.html_para2">
Damage assessments, including that undertaken on behalf of the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), estimate that over 33 million people have been affected by the floods, over two million dwellings damaged and some four million inhabitants displaced. Homes, schools, clinics, roads, bridges, small-scale enterprises and crops have been damaged. Many people were forced to sell off their livestock and many days employment, hence income, lost. Tube wells and other water sources were contaminated and up to three million latrines 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Oct 2004 : Column 1315W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
damaged or washed away, leaving the population with limited or no access to safe water and sanitation, increasing the risks of diarrhoea and other waterborne diseases. An Asian Development Bank (ADB)/World Bank (WB) mission in September estimated total damage to assets and output losses at $2.2 billion (&#163;1.1 billion), representing 3.9 per cent. of GDP.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w04.html_para3">
The monsoon season is now nearly over and the flood situation continues to improve. All emergency flood shelters are now closed. However, there remain some rises in the Brahmaputra-Jumuna river water level, with two out of 86 monitoring stations remaining above danger level.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w04.html_para4">
When the floods commenced in July, the UK Government led the international donor community to ensure immediate emergency needs were met. The UK was the first to announce bilateral support for the flood-affected people of Bangladesh. On 26 July the UK Government allocated &#163;10 million through DFID to meet immediate flood emergency needs. &#163;5 million of this was channelled through United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and &#163;5 million through World Food Programme (WFP). Supporting these two organizations ensured that both food and non-food emergency needs of those affected by the flood were met. This initial &#163;10 million has now been fully utilised to provide food packages of rice, pulses, oil, salt and nutritionally fortified high-energy biscuits; and non-food support, including shelter and agricultural support (such as provision of seedlings) to over 900,000 families (4.5 million people) affected by the floods. In particular, the relief was targeted on the six worst affected districts&#151;Brahmanbaria, Habiganj, Kishoreganj, Netrokona, Sirajganj and Sunamganj.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w04.html_para5">
This assistance was delivered by 22 national and international non-governmental organisations with a strong track record in effective relief delivery in Bangladesh. These included Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC), Save the Children Fund (SCF) (UK), Oxfam, CARE, Islamic Relief, Concern, Christian Aid, United Nations Food and Population Fund (UNFPA), Action Aid, International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases and Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR-B), Gonoshasthaya Kendra, and Handicap International.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w04.html_para6">
The UK Government then turned its attention to the extensive recovery and rehabilitation needs of Bangladesh. On 12 August, the United Nations launched its Consolidated Appeal for $210 million (&#163;117 million) to meet relief and recovery needs for the next 6 months. Again, the UK Government acted swiftly to meet the need. I announced on 18 August an additional &#163;15 million through DFID, for Bangladesh to support the repair, replacement and maintenance of roads and bridges; to provide food, shelter, clean water, sanitation, medial supplies; and to provide funds for cash-for-work programmes to give people affected by the floods the opportunity to earn income to help recover from the floods.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w04.html_para7">
From this &#163;15 million, &#163;1 million has been channelled to the World Food Programme to support their provision of food to those affected by the floods and &#163;2 million has been channelled through UNDP to provide temporary and longer-term shelter to 194,000 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Oct 2004 : Column 1316W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

DFID&#039;s support is contributing to UNICEF&#039;s efforts to help up to 30 million people in 40 out of Bangladesh&#039;s 64 districts.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w04.html_para8">
The final &#163;4 million will support the Government of Bangladesh&#039;s request for emergency financing for roads, bridges and culverts damaged by the recent floods. &#163;3.9 million is for financial aid for emergency repair and reconstruction; and a further &#163;0.1 million for technical assistance to provide oversight to the Roads and Highways Department response.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w04.html_para9">
DFID has also lobbied the EC to increase the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO)&#039;s contribution of &#8364;2.9 million (&#163;2 million). The UK Government&#039;s support to Bangladesh to ensure it is better able to cope with the impact of disasters, will not stop with the end of this year&#039;s floods. The UK Government, through DFID, is providing &#163;6 million over five years to the Comprehensive Disaster Management Programme which is strengthening the Government of Bangladesh&#039;s capacity to deliver long-term sustainable risk management practices as an integral part of national development planning, and to increase the effectiveness of the Government&#039;s emergency responses and post recovery management.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w04.html_para10">
The UK Government are aware that even this generous support may not be sufficient to ensure Bangladesh can recover quickly and rebuild after the floods. That is why I have approved another &#163;4 million today for the World Food Programme&#039;s Emergency Response Programme (EMOP), which is currently only 20 per cent. subscribed. This will enable the poorest flood victims to have continued access to food during the period of scarcity, which has followed the floods and may last up to February 2005.

<p><a name="41028w05.html_spnew7"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 DFID undertakes a large number of projects and programmes involving policy, most of which involves knowledge and research. This ranges from acquisition of knowledge to implementation of programme objectives. In reply to the hon. Member&#039;s question of 21 October 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 850W, a list of contracts including those involving knowledge and research, issued by DFID over the last five years is being placed in the Library. This includes consultants contracted for the purpose of knowledge and research. The project title in those cases provides an indication of the objective of the activity but to set out the purpose and risk level of each would involve disproportionate cost. In addition to these contracts, much of DFID&#039;s policy formulation is carried out in-house through the work of DFID&#039;s Policy Division.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w05.html_para2">
Over the last 3 years, DFID has spent &#163;540 million on Knowledge and Research. Of the above total, expenditure on centrally funded research (that is research more concerned with global rather than country issues) is around &#163;85 million per year rising to at least &#163;100 million per year in 2006&#150;07.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w05.html_para3">
DFID funds research, on a wide variety of policy issues. A Research Funding Framework has just been published which is available on the DFID website. www.dfid.gov.uk. This identifies four major themes, which will take some two-thirds of research funding: sustainable agriculture, especially in Africa; killer diseases; climate change; and work to identify policy options in situations where states do not work for the poor. Some research&#151;such as that relating to an HIV vaccine&#151;is high risk, but worth supporting because the potential benefits are also very high.

 The Spending Review 2004 provides &#163;7.2 billion more in general grant for local government programmes by 2007&#150;08 over 2004&#150;05. Part of these resources will support the achievement of significant diversion of waste from landfill during the SR04 period. The Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme is designed to reduce the amount of biodegradable municipal waste that is sent to landfill in England in the most cost-effective way. The Government recognises that certain authorities facing above average population growth may find the implementation of the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme challenging and there are a range of 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Oct 2004 : Column 1324W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister which local authorities have <i>(a)</i> started and <i>(b)</i> completed their consultation with tenants on (i) arm&#039;s length management organisations (ALMOs), (ii) use of the private finance initiative and (iii) use of stock transfer in relation to ownership of housing; which of those authorities have held ballots with their tenants on ALMOs, PFI and stock transfer; when those ballots were held; and what percentage was (A) in favour and (B) against each option in each such ballot.  [193887]</p>




<p><a name="41028w06.html_spnew5"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 Consultation with tenants occurs throughout the Options Appraisal process. Local authorities are all required to go through this process, but an Options Appraisal will not be signed off unless the Government Office is satisfied that tenants are properly consulted. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister would normally consider a ballot to be the most formal type of consultation with tenants. These are normally only undertaken for transfer and Arm&#039;s Length Management Organisations (ALMOs). Although ballots are not generally undertaken for PFI schemes, tenants are required to be consulted and section 27 consent must be given.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w06.html_para2">
Tabled is a detailed breakdown of the figures requested. It covers all ballots since the Decent Homes Programme began in 2001, including partials, and shows that 73 ballots have taken place for transfer, while 18 have balloted tenants successfully for Arm&#039;s Length Management Programmes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w06.html_para3">
42 local authorities have had their Options Appraisals signed off by Government Offices. 150 local authorities have not had Options Appraisals signed off, and so are either engaging with tenants or about to do so.

<p><a name="41028w07.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Jenkin: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister pursuant to his answer to the hon. Member for North Essex on 20 October 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 879&#150;80, on local government administration in the North-East after the referendum, whether he intends to reduce the number of councils regardless of the outcome of the referendum.  [194201]</p>




<p><a name="41028w07.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 There are at present no plans to introduce changes to the structure of local government except in those areas where an elected regional assembly is established. Under the Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Act local government change can only be introduced if a referendum has been held and an elected regional assembly is to be established as a result.

<p><a name="41028w07.html_spnew1"><b> Keith Hill: </b>

country park and made specific reference to the need to safeguard reserved land for the road proposals. The county council is working closely with Swale borough council and Medway Swale Groundwork who are progressing the country park. As part of the planning application for the new road, an Environmental Statement is being produced and this will cover all the environmental aspects and mitigation measures.
</p>





<p><a name="41028w07.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Wyatt: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assessment has been made of the second section of the Northern Distributor Road&#039;s proximity to local housing at Kemsley, near Sittingbourne.  [194160]</p>




<p><a name="41028w07.html_spnew2"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 As part of the planning application for the new road, an Environmental Statement is being produced. This will make an assessment of the traffic noise and visual intrusion on properties.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what public consultation there has been on the second section of the Northern Distributor Road in Milton.  [194161]</p>




<p><a name="41028w07.html_spnew3"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 An exhibition has been recently held in the area and comments on the proposal were invited. The responses will form part of the normal consultation undertaken by the planning authority in consideration of the Planning Application about to be submitted.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on the average time taken to process planning applications.  [193238]</p>




<p><a name="41028w07.html_spnew4"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The performance of authorities in handling planning applications is measured both against targets set for the proportion of decisions taken within set time limits, and targets for average determination times. The Government&#039;s PSA6 target for planning delivery states that English local authorities taken together will process an average of 65 per cent. of major applications in 13 weeks, 72 per 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Oct 2004 : Column 1329W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
cent. of minor applications in eight weeks, and 87 per cent. of other applications in eight weeks by 31 March 2007.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w07.html_para0">
The latest available data for the year ending June 2004, shows that planning authorities determined 53 per cent. of major applications in 13 weeks, 66 per cent. of minor applications, and 82 per cent. of other applications, in eight weeks. This is an improvement on previous years and these figures show that the Government is on target to meet it&#039;s PSA6 target for Planning Delivery by 31 March 2007.
</p>




<a name="41028w07.html_sbhd3"><h3 align=center>Police Funding</h3>


<p><a name="41028w07.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Boswell: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what adjustments in the <i>(a)</i> police funding formula and <i>(b)</i> capping regime he plans to make to take account of strategic development plans for expansion in the South-East and East Midlands.  [193638]</p>




<p><a name="41028w07.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 The Police funding formula estimates relative need for police resources. Formula grant allocations are currently subject to floors and ceilings.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w07.html_para1">
Decisions on the floors and ceilings for 2005&#150;06 have not yet been taken. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is actively considering the effects of the ceiling policy on rapid population growth areas in advance of the 2005&#150;06 allocation. Looking further ahead, we are committed to delivering three-year settlements for local government, and will be addressing Kate Barker&#039;s recommendation to make the grant system more forward looking.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w07.html_para2">
No decisions on capping in 2005&#150;06 and beyond have been made. But the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has made it clear that we expect to see significantly lower council tax increases next year and will take even tougher capping action in 2005&#150;06 if that proves necessary.

<p><a name="41028w07.html_wqn6"><b> Jeremy Corbyn: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what advice is given to London Boroughs on <i>(a)</i> disposal of property assets and <i>(b)</i> meeting the need for social housing in London; and if he will make a statement.  [194011]</p>




<p><a name="41028w07.html_spnew6"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 Section 123 of the Local Government Act 1972, gives authorities discretion to dispose of land in any manner they wish although it is generally expected that local authority property should be sold for the best consideration reasonably obtainable (usually open market value). Consent of the Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister is required to dispose of land if it falls outside the scope of the General Disposal Consent given in Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s Circular 06/2003.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w07.html_para3">
The revised General Disposal Consent that came into effect on 4 August 2003 gave local authorities greater freedom and flexibility to make decisions about land disposals which will contribute to the promotion or improvement of the economic, social or environmental well-being of an area at less than best consideration, providedthat the undervalue does not exceed two million pounds.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Oct 2004 : Column 1330W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w07.html_para4">
For the disposal of housing land and property, whether by sale of the freehold or on leasehold, terms local authorities require the consent of the Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister under Section 32 of the Housing Act 1985. The General Consents for the disposal of Houses and Land 1999, issued under Section 32, cover the most common types of small disposal of untenanted stock or disposals to sitting tenants, and includes a commentary giving guidance to local authorities. However, where a proposed disposal falls outside the terms of these General Consents, a local authority may apply to the Secretary of State, my right. hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister for a specific consent under section 32.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w07.html_para5">
Local authorities have both housing and planning responsibilities, and are required to produce local housing strategies and local development frameworks. Planning Policy Guidance Note 3: Housing (March 2000), paragraph 13, states that assessments of housing need that underpin local housing strategies and local plan policies are matters for local authorities to undertake in the light of their local circumstances. Advice to assist local authorities in preparing local housing needs assessments is set out in &quot;Local Housing Needs Assessment&quot;: &quot;A Guide to Good Practice (Department of the Environment Transport and the Regions, July 2000)&quot;. It is intended to publish an updated PPG3 in the Autumn.

<p><a name="41028w07.html_wqn7"><b> Mr. Drew: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how many complaints against councillors he has received in each year since the inception of the Standards Board, broken down by local authority; and whether the complaint <i>(a)</i> was proven, <i>(b)</i> was unproven or rejected for lack of evidence and <i>(c)</i> is pending in each case.  [194279]</p>




<p><a name="41028w07.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has no remit in the consideration of allegations of misconduct against local authority members. The investigation of such allegations is a matter for ethical standards officers appointed by the Standards Board for England.
</p>

<a name="41028w07.html_para6">

<p><a name="41028w08.html_spnew0"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not monitor individual Supporting People services but does have a rigorous system for monitoring the level of service provision in each administrative authority. This includes capturing information on all reviews carried out on individual Supporting People services, the number of services provided for each client group and we will soon be collecting data on positive outcomes delivered for vulnerable people.

<p><a name="41028w08.html_spnew1"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has grant conditions that govern the use of the Supporting People grant by administering authorities. On the basis of these conditions, all administering authorities enter in to a legally binding contractual relationship with service providers, and these service providers therefore have a legal obligation to provide housing related support services to vulnerable users until the contractual relationship expires.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what independent right of appeal exists for individuals disappointed with the service from Supporting People projects.  [194204]</p>




<p><a name="41028w08.html_spnew2"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 Administering authorities are responsible for commissioning and overseeing Supporting People services. Individual Supporting People services should have in place a robust complaints procedure which all service users can access and understand easily. They can also appeal to the administering authority if they are disappointed with the service. The views of service users, 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Oct 2004 : Column 1332W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

<i>(a)</i> The budget for the programme for the next three years was decided as part of the Spending Review 2004 negotiations.

<p><a name="41028w08.html_spnew4"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 The Supporting People Programme makes funding available for the provision of housing-related support services to enable individuals to maintain or improve independent living. It is for individual Supporting People Commissioning Bodies and Administering Authorities, operating at the top-tier level of local government, to decide what services should be provided in their area. This can, however, include services for people fleeing domestic violence, including services provided at or through women&#039;s refuges. The national Supporting People budget for 2004&#150;05 is &#163;1.8 billion, and Administering Authorities forecast that &#163;56.97 million of this will be spent on housing-related support services for women fleeing domestic violence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w08.html_para2">
Public funds are also available in the form of housing benefit where appropriate, to assist with rental costs. Refuges working in partnership with registered social landlords (RSLs) can also apply for the Social Housing Grant, to assist with repairs and refurbishment costs or new development.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w08.html_para3">
As children are not regarded as being capable of maintaining an independent tenancy, Supporting People does not directly provide support to them. However, they will be able to benefit from relevant housing-related support services aimed at their parents.

In addition, the Department further commissioned a report on the biocompatibility of the Silzone heart valves by a leading United Kingdom professor of toxicology.

The Minister stated that simple and complete deregulation was not a realistic option and therefore not the way forward for Northern Ireland.

<p><a name="41028w16.html_spnew5"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 The Government are determined to improve opportunities for people of all backgrounds. The Aimhigher programme helps young people in disadvantaged areas to gain the qualifications and aspire to university. Our reforms to student finance will broaden access and help poorer students. And the Office for Fair Access will ensure that universities charging higher fees encourage applications from all backgrounds through their plans for outreach and financial support. Admissions, however, are a matter for universities and must be based on merit.

Our advanced apprenticeship programmes for young people offers training to technician and skilled craft level. And as resources allow, we have committed to expanding training programmes for adults as well at that intermediate level, particularly in those areas that employers tell us are their priorities by region and by sector. To support younger adults up to age 30 to get these higher level qualifications, we are piloting financial support of up to &#163;30 a week through a new Adult Learning Grant. The new grant has been piloted since September 2003 in over 80 further education providers across 10 Learning and Skills Council areas. From September 2004 Adult Learning Grant has been extended right across the North East and South East regions alongside trials of the new entitlement to free tuition to reach a first level 2 qualification.

 This information is not routinely collected centrally. The General Sure Start Grant distributed to local authorities includes funding to provide for new childcare places. Local authorities currently receive &#163;642 for each newly created place in a disadvantaged area and &#163;342 for places created in other areas.

 For 2004&#150;06, we have given &#163;129.9 million to local authorities in England to help them recruit, train and develop their early years and child care workforce. We have also worked closely with the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) nationally to raise the profile of the child care sector, so that all local LSCs and local authorities now have shared targets for training child care workers to levels 2 and 3. We also support this local activity with our national child care recruitment campaign that has been running since 2000 and has generated over 25,000 responses to our national campaign order line. The new National Professional Qualification for Integrated Centre Leadership (NPQICL), launched September 2004, aims to foster the highest calibre of leadership in children&#039;s services.

<sup>(11)</sup> The gross expenditure and income figures for 1998&#150;99 to 2001&#150;02 are taken from the home to school/college transport and the transport related parental contribution lines of the section 52 Outturn Statement Table 3 (1998&#150;99 figures are from the corresponding lines of the R01 form submitted to the ODPM) respectively. In 2002&#150;03 home to school transport was recorded separately from home to college transport for the first time and consequently both home to school transport and the combined home to school/college transport figures are provided. 2002&#150;03 figures are taken from the respective gross, income and net columns of the section 52 Outturn Statement Table A.<br>

<sup>(12)</sup> Total transport income and expenditure includes that incurred in relation to pre-primary, primary, secondary and special school education as well as in education out of school, continuing education and the management and support elements.<br>

<sup>(13)</sup> The DfES do not collect data on the number of pupils using home to school transport and as such we are unable to calculate the cost of home to school transport per child . However in 2002&#150;03 the Department conducted a survey with Confed which provided a snapshot of the number of pupils using home to school transport (including sixth form) and these have been used to provide a unit cost for 2002&#150;03.<br>

 The aim of the QinetiQ study was to investigate the effects of modafinil, the generic name for Provigil, on nocturnal sleep, and on subsequent performance in 12 healthy male volunteers. The effects studied included sustained attention, reaction time, digit symbol substitution, tracking, memory, sleepiness and fatigue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w19.html_para1">
QinetiQ concluded that the effects on nocturnal sleep depended on the dose. In the study, 100 mg of modafinil had no affect on nocturnal sleep. At higher dose levels of 200 mg and 300 mg, total sleep was reduced. The alerting activity of modafinil was observed the following day, although at the highest dose, increased sleepiness was reported within 24 hours of ingestion.

 Even before the introduction of pension credit, the Government&#039;s basic strategy of getting more money to pensioners, particularly the poorest, was making significant inroads into tackling pensioner poverty. The latest figures available show that by 2002&#150;03 absolute pensioner poverty (the number living below the 1996&#150;97 low-income threshold) had fallen by two-thirds, or 1.8 million.

Since its introduction in October 2003, pension credit has had an impact on pensioner incomes by giving around 1.94 million households (2.36 million individuals) an average &#163;16.33 a week more money (figures to the end of August). This represents 74 per cent. of all households receiving pension credit at the end of August 2004.

1. Costs are in 2004&#150;05 prices to the nearest &#163;1 million and show the combined increase in expenditure on basic state pension and additional state pension.<br>

2. It is assumed the policy would be introduced from 2005 onwards.<br>





3. We are unable to estimate the costs net of income related benefits and tax reliably as the numbers involved are small and there are limitations in our ability to model the impact of the change.<br>

The child care element of WTC is payable to lone parents and to couples where both partners work at least 16 hours per week and provides up to 70 per cent. of costs up to certain limits. Finally, the tax credits system disregards income rises from the previous tax year of up to &#163;2,500, so tax credit recipients whose family income increases by up to this amount will not see any reduction in their current year&#039;s award.

 There are three principal areas of disagreement, all concerning Iraq&#039;s nuclear programme:
</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w23.html_para4">
The Iraq Survey Group (ISG) report concludes that there is no evidence to suggest that Iraq sought to procure uranium from Africa in the 1990s. The Government continues to believe that credible evidence exists to support the assertion made in the September 2002 dossier. Lord Butler of Brockwell&#039;s review upheld that belief. The UK was not in a position to share all the intelligence on this issue with the ISG.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w23.html_para5">
The ISG also expressed doubt that the aluminium tubes referred to in the September dossier were evidence of a resumption of Iraq&#039;s nuclear programmes. Again, Lord Butler&#039;s review assessed this, and concluded that the Joint Intelligence Committee were right to include reference to the tubes in the dossier and that it properly reflected doubts about the use of the tubes in the caution of its assessments. The Government fully accepts the findings of Lord Butler&#039;s review.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w23.html_para6">
The ISG also report that they found no evidence to support the claim in the dossier that Iraq &quot;is almost certainly seeking an indigenous ability to enrich uranium&quot; based on gas centrifuge technology. They do, however, admit that elements of useful and relevant technologies were being developed.

<sup>(19)</sup> Hospitality figures relate to the cost of providing refreshment for non-civil servants and for limited hospitality provided by civil servants for business purposes. Details of such expenditure have been held only since 1997&#150;98, for which the figure is &#163;37,747.<br>

Due to the nature of the Home Office&#039;s work, a large number of employees are involved in dispersed operations, which necessitate the use of mobile phones on a regular basis. Some organisations, like the National Probation Service, have also become part of the Home Office since 1997, and their costs are now included. The Department has contracts with major mobile phone companies to get the best deal for the tax payer.

<p><a name="41028w25.html_spnew4"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Responsibility for the provision of public mortuaries is covered by section 198 of the Public Health Act 1936, which states that local authorities may, or shall if directed to do so by the Minister, provide a public mortuary. This does not explicitly cover temporary mortuaries. The Civil Defence (General Lead Local Authority Functions) Regulations 199 set out a responsibility on local authorities for dealing with fatalities in emergencies. Responsibility for funding is covered by section 27 of the Coroners Act 1988, which

sets out that county councils and lead boroughs in metropolitan areas are responsible for providing support to coroners.

<p><a name="41028w26.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 Judicial appointments are made solely on merit. To encourage lawyers from all backgrounds to apply for judicial appointment, we run workshops around the country, sometimes in conjunction with the Bar Council and the Law Society, to give an overview of the appointments process. Officials from my Department also attend conferences and events, such as the Minority Lawyers Conference and run a very successful work-shadowing scheme, whereby individuals can shadow a circuit or district judge for up to five days. This can help them to decide whether to pursue a judicial career.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w26.html_para1">
In 2001, salaried part-time working for new district judge and tribunal appointments was introduced and from April 2005, this will be extended to all new and existing salaried appointments below the High Court unless the nature of the office or business needs dictate otherwise.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41028w26.html_para2">
The establishment of the new Judicial Appointments Commission will further inspire a more diverse range of applicants through a more transparent, accountable and accessible appointments process. In addition, on 13 October 2004, we published a consultation paper 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Oct 2004 : Column 1394W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
entitled &quot;Increasing Diversity in the Judiciary&quot;.
