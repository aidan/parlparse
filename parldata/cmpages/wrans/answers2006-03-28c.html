 Desalination not been previously used as an option for water supply in the UK. Costs and emissions will be determined by the particulars of the operation concerned, for example, each will depend on whether brackish or sea water is involved; the source of energy used; and whether or not the plant is used continuously or to meet peak demands.

<a name="60328w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">Projections from South East Water, who are constructing a small desalination plant on the Southcoast, point to an energy consumption around 4.5&#150;4.7 kWh per cubic metre of water produced, using energy from a combined heat and power plant. The company has also estimated, in its business plan for the Periodic Review of water prices in 2004, that the cost will be around 47 p per cubic metre.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Mar 2006 : Column 845W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
options. This showed that switching to alternative water charging systems created not only winners but also a large numbers of losers.

<a name="stpa_13">In December 2004 Defra published the &#039;cross-Government review of water affordability report&#039;. That report showed the scope and scale of the water affordability issue, including the effects on lower income groups and pensioners. Following the recommendations of the report Defra is currently working with Ofwat, the Consumer Council for Water, and water companies to look at the effects on types of households of alternative methods of measured charging as part of a range of measured and unmeasured tariff options.

The strategies indicated that a national water grid would suffer a number of drawbacks. These include that pipelines for long distance transfers are large and their construction may be disruptive, and that pumping can consume much energy and add to carbon emissions.

The Office of Water Services (Ofwat), the economic regulator of the water industry, collects information on the household and non-household charges made by the water and sewerage undertakers. This information is based on the areas that the companies serve rather than administrative counties.

Most non-household customers pay a charge calculated via a volumetric rate. Most water and sewerage undertakers also levy a fixed charge on their non-household customers according to the size of the meter that the customer has. This fixed charge varies from company to company.

 We have monitored the distribution of DFID aid to those affected by the December 2004 tsunami. We did learn of some problems in India, where there was some reluctance by the authorities to allow aid to reach certain castes. This was overcome through representations made to the authorities. More recently, however, we have seen the January 2006 report of a five-country study by a group of international charities reporting internal discrimination. Although we manage and monitor DFID humanitarian aid very closely and have found no evidence of discrimination in the distribution of DFID aid in tsunami-affected countries, we take such reporting seriously and are prepared both to discuss this with the international charities and to intervene again, if necessary, with the national authorities.

A group of non-governmental organisations (NGOs), jointly funded by DFID and International NGOs, initiated a Social Equity Audit process in response to claims that some Dalits in India and other groups were being excluded from some post tsunami humanitarian efforts. A group of independent auditors have been trained by experts identified by the International NGOs. The International NGOs will submit their programmes to these auditors to assess how inclusive their post tsunami activities have been in order to improve their programmes and identify ways to make their humanitarian efforts more inclusive in the future. TheUnited Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Children&#039;s Fund have signed up to the initiative and a Social Equity auditing manual is likely to be produced which DFID will disseminate to NGOs and agencies.

<a name="stpa_85">The Department ceased sending publications automatically to schools in England on a phased basis between April and December 2004. Discussions with Head teachers and detailed research showed that schools wanted to be able to choose the printed publications they needed, when they needed them, and to be able to order multiple copies.

<a name="stpa_86">The online ordering system enables schools to choose whether to download electronic copies or order the paper based publications they need at the right time for them and in the multiples they require.

 To encourage employers to participate in training, we have established an employer-led training infrastructure that puts their needs centre stage.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_103">At the end of 2005 we published the LSC&#039;s Statement of Priorities for 2006/07, a copy of which I enclose.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_105">First, we are building on the success of the Employer Training Pilots (ETP) and from April 2006 we shall roll-out Train to Gain nationally to deliver a range of high quality training for employers with an emphasis on level 2 qualifications and skills for life. A key element of Train to Gain will be a network of skills brokers giving advice to companies on their training needs.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_106">As you will know West Yorkshire is a pilot area for ETP and of the total number of employers engaged in ETP in West Yorkshire, 12.2% (180) are in Wakefield.

Unfortunately we do not have figures for Normanton.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many 16 to 19 year olds were unfunded as a consequence of further education colleges exceeding their recruitment targets agreed with the relevant local Learning and Skills Council in <i>(a)</i> 2004&#150;05 and <i>(b)</i> 2005&#150;06 in (i) each local learning and skills council area and (ii) each college.

<p><a name="st_122"><a name="60328w14.html_spnew2"><b> Bill Rammell  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 2 March 2006]:</i> The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) agrees plans with most further education (FE) colleges which they guarantee to fund. The guarantee that college plans will be fully funded has been widely welcomed by the sector as ensuring stability and providing confidence for colleges to make commitments for the year based on assured levels of funding. The guarantee means that colleges recruiting above agreed plans cannot expect to receive additional funding above the level agreed with the LSC. However, there is an expectation that where colleges have delivered higher volumes in priority areas then this should be reflected in their planning for the following year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328w14.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_95">It is only possible to determine the amount of learning delivered above agreed planned levels following detailed analysis of the actual level of delivery in the academic year compared to the agreed planned levels. It is not possible to complete this analysis for 2005/06 until we have full academic year data on delivery, which will not be available until later this year. For 2004/05 the LSC estimate that colleges delivered 9,624 16 to19 Full Time Equivalent (FTE) learner numbers above the planned levels agreed with the LSC.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills whether it is her intention that parents be permitted to represent their children in the appeal process regarding moves to secondary schools under the provisions of the Education and Inspection Bill; whether she expects changes to be made to the appeals process by provisions in the Bill; and if she will make a statement.

 Admissions legislation already gives parents the right of appeal to an independent appeal panel, against an admission authority&#039;s decision refusing their child admission to a school. The appeal process already allows parents the opportunity to appear in person and make oral representations themselves, or be accompanied, or represented, by a friend. Legal representation will not usually be necessary, but parents are free to have such representation if they wish.

The Bill will strengthen this role by giving Forums the power to object to the Schools Adjudicators about the admission arrangements of any maintained school in their area. It will also give them the power to publish an annual report for the Schools Commissioner about how well admission arrangements are working in their area.

<i>[holding answer 6 December 2005]:</i> It will not be open to any organisation to set up a school trust. It will be for the governing bodies of individual schools to decide whether to form partnerships with trusts, following consultation with parents and other stakeholders. All such trusts will be charities and the consultation will need to set out who the members of the charity will be. In deciding whether to acquire a particular trust, governing bodies will need to take account of the impact of the trust on driving up standards and promoting the well-being of pupils and the wider community. The school would be inspected against the contribution it makes to the five outcomes, including being healthy&quot;. As part of this, inspectors would assess the school&#039;s success in promoting healthy eating. Where there are concerns about the nature of a proposed trust, the local authority will be able to refer the case to the schools adjudicator for determination.

<sup>(30)</sup>Includes planned expenditure on the provision for pupils with statements and the provision for non-statemented pupils with SEN, support for inclusion, inter authority recoupment, fees for pupils at independent special schools and abroad, educational psychology service, local authority functions in relation to child protection, therapies and other health related services, parent partnership, guidance and information, the monitoring of SEN provision and inclusion administration, assessment and co-ordination. Also included is the funding delegated to nursery, primary and secondary schools identified as notional SEN&quot; and the individual schools budget (ISB) for special schools.<br>

<sup>(31)</sup>The ISB for special schools will include some general education costs for pupils with SEN in addition to those costs specifically for SEN while the figures recorded against notional SEN&quot; are only indicative of the amount that might be spent by schools on SEN. In 2005&#150;06, Lancashire also budgeted &#163;13.2 million for SEN transport expenditure but this is not included in the budgeted net expenditure on SEN as figures are not available prior to 2005&#150;06.<br>

<sup>(32)</sup>Total Education Revenue Expenditure is the combination of the total schools budget and the total local authority budget. For the first time in 2005&#150;06 Threshold and Performance Pay costs were recorded gross in the Section 52 Budget Statement which has had the effect of increasing Lancashire&#039;s 2005&#150;06 total education revenue expenditure by over &#163;24 million. Consequently, for comparison with earlier years, the adjusted budgeted net expenditure on the provision of education for children with SEN as a percentage of total education revenue expenditure in 2005&#150;06 is 16.1 per cent. and this figure is included in brackets.<br>

<sup>(33)</sup>The data are drawn from Lancashire local authority&#039;s Section52 Budget Statements (Tables 1 and 2) submitted to the DfES.<br>

 There are two student loans schemes. Mortgage-style loans were introduced in 1990. Income-contingent loans were introduced for new students from 1998, while continuing students remained eligible for mortgage-style loans.

<a name="60328w16.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_100">The first cohort of students on three year courses with income-contingent loans entered repayment status in April 2002. However, borrowers only make repayments when they are earning over &#163;15,000 and those earning less are not required to make any repayments. Most income-contingent loan repayments are collected by employers through the tax system and current policy ensures that deductions keep pace with earnings so borrowers do not become overdue on their accounts.

 The Ministry of Defence has never operated an UFO Project. UFO sightings reported to the MOD are examined solely within the context of controlling the integrity of the UK&#039;s airspace. The MOD does not attempt to identify the precise nature of each sighting, unless there is evidence of a risk to this integrity. Examination of UFO sighting reports is a task performed by desk officers within the directorate of air staff.

 The data is not available in the form requested. Antisocial behaviour is not measured by incidents but through a measure of perceptions using the British Crime Survey (BCS). The latest figures available at police force area level are for 2004&#150;05. The design of the BCS means that data for individual months is not available. The measure of antisocial behaviour used is based on a scale constructed from seven questions on problems due to noisy neighbours or loud parties, teenagers and young people hanging around, rubbish and litter, vandalism, people using or dealing drugs, people being drunk or rowdy and abandoned cars. In the 2004&#150;05 BCS 14 per cent. of people in South Wales perceived there to be high levels of antisocial behaviour in their local area, compared with 17 per cent. of people nationally. Between 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 there was no change in the proportion of people perceiving high levels of antisocial behaviour in South Wales.

<p><a name="st_178"><a name="60328w20.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) conducts an annual survey into the level of opium poppy cultivation and production in Afghanistan. UNODC figures for 2005 show that the level of opium cultivation decreased over 2001 figures in Kabul, Logar and Paktya provinces. However, comparing current levels of cultivation with 2001 figures does not represent an accurate picture of total progress to date. This is because the base year coincided with the Taliban&#039;s prohibition on opium cultivation. While the ban was effective in reducing the area of land under poppy cultivation in 2001, the Taliban did nothing to provide alternatives to poppy farmers who consequently suffered considerable hardship. Furthermore, the ban did not apply to trafficking or processing activities and the Taliban regime manipulated the drug trade to benefit from the rise in prices, which resulted from the reduction in cultivation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328w20.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_119">Since the fall of the Taliban, the Government of Afghanistan has, with the support of the international community, made considerable progress in fighting narcotics. Last year UNODC reported a 21 per cent. reduction in poppy cultivation from 131,000 hectares (ha) in 2003&#150;04 to 104,000 ha in 2004&#150;05, with decreases recorded in a total of 19 provinces. More recently, the Government of Afghanistan has updated its National Drug Control Strategy to ensure the downward trend is sustained over time and that progress is also made in targeting the trafficker, developing legal rural livelihoods, reducing domestic demand and developing strong and effective institutions. Sustainable drug elimination strategies take time, but I believe that the National Drug Control Strategy represents the best means of making a sustainable impact on the trade in the medium term.

 The Mujahedin-e Khalq Organisation (MEK) is a proscribed terrorist organisation in the United Kingdom. The MEK appears on the list of persons, groups and entities which are subject to restrictive measures with a view to combating terrorism under Council Regulation 2580/2001-EC. The Court of First Instance of the European Communities is currently scrutinising the process by which the MEK was included on that list, and the UK has made representations to the Court. Judgment in that case is awaited.

 A full council tax bill assumes that there are at least two adults living in a dwelling. Where there is only one adult living in the dwelling the overall bill is reduced by 25 per cent. Certain people are disregarded for the purposes of calculating the household&#039;s bill. In the case of apprentices the disregard is in part dependent on their earning less than a prescribed level of income. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will shortly be consulting on whether the apprentice earnings limit should be increased and, if so, by how much.

 The terms picocell, microcell and macrocell are industry terms to distinguish different types of radio base stations. However, there is no industry standard or agreement on the specific types of base station to which each term applies and therefore these terms are not helpful for determining whether planning permission is required or not.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Mar 2006 : Column 925W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328w24.html_para0">
In general terms a picocell is typically smaller than a microcell, although the distinction is not always clear. Picocell base stations are usually used to extend coverage to indoor areas where outdoor signals do not reach well, or to add network capacity in areas with very dense phone usage, such as train stations. The planning system cannot extend to changes inside a building unless there are internal features which have been listed. Other picocells antenna and small microcell antenna might be considered de minimis&quot;, i.e. it does not have a material effect on the external appearance of the building or structure on which it is installed and therefore will not require planning permission.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60328w24.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_140">Otherwise all electronic communications development will require planning permission unless it is development permitted by Part 24 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995&quot;, as amended.

Some &#163;495m has been invested in revenue activities, including maintenance, with a further &#163;240m on capital. Over the next 10 years the Investment Strategy for Northern Ireland envisages that some &#163;1.9 billion will be invested in road improvements subject to the availability of resources in future budget rounds, economic appraisals and statutory approvals.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_118">You may be aware that the Minister for Regional Development, Shaun Woodward MP recently met with your colleague Margaret Ritchie MLA and members of the local Quarry Products Association (QPA) to discuss the outcome of the Budget and Priorities 2006&#150;2008 and the impact on the structural maintenance budget.

<a name="stpa_170">Our reforms include the state second pension, which helps more future pensioners build up better pensions, especially carers. Pension credit, introduced from October 2003, provides a contribution to a guaranteed minimum income for those aged 60 and over and, for the first time, rewards people aged 65 and over who have made modest provision for their retirement. As of August 2005, around 4,500 pensioners in Islington South and Finsbury are receiving pension credit, with an average award of &#163;62.27 per week.

The Family Resources Survey (FRS)<br>

Notes to all tables:<br>

1. Real income growth is shown by the changes in decile income medians which have been adjusted for inflation.<br>

2. The Before Housing Costs and After Housing Costs income deciles are consistent with methodology used in DWP&#039;s National Statistics<sup>(42)</sup> series, Households Below Average Income.<br>

3. Comparisons for the bottom decile should be treated with more caution. Decile medians for the bottom 10 per cent. are more volatile as they are affected to a greater extent by the composition of that decile, particularly by changes in the proportion of people who report very low incomes.<br>

4. Caution should be exercised when interpreting changes over shorter time periods.<br>

5. The Family Expenditure Survey (FES) data covers selected years from 1979 until 1995&#150;97 where information are available. The Family Resources Survey (FRS) data is for all financial years 1994&#150;95 until 2003&#150;04.<br>

6. Comparisons of estimates between the two sources should be treated carefully:<br>

FES figures are for the United Kingdom, FRS figures are for Great Britain.<br>

The reference period for FRS figures is single financial years. FES figures are single calendar years from 1979&#150;87, two combined calendar years from 1988&#150;89 to 1992&#150;93 and two financial years combined from 1993&#150;95 to 1995&#150;97.<br>

The FRS was established by the then Department of Social Security in order to meet the Department&#039;s analytical requirements.<br>

A review, available on the internet, into the differences in income values between the two surveys concluded that the differences in monetary value estimates across surveys were too large to justify publishing direct comparisons. Furthermore, large fluctuations in the difference between surveys for overlapping years mean that, in many cases, an adjusted, or a spliced time series may be no more accurate than the unadjusted series.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Latest confirmed spend figures are to March 2005.<br>

2. Cost per person into work figures are calculated on confirmed spend data to March 2005 and the number of individuals into work to March 2005.<br>

3. Number of people into work through all new deals to March 2005:1,429,000; number of people into work through new deal for young people to March 2005: 620,000.<br>

4. Spend data include all new deal programme costs and allowances paid to participants apart from the 50 plus element of the working tax credit. As this is not included in the figures, new deal 50 plus costs reduce after 2002&#150;03.<br>

5. Spend data exclude administrative costs as it is no longer possible to identify the costs of administering each new deal separately from the costs of other labour market activities.<br>

6. Spend on new deal for partners in 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 was less than &#163;0.5 million and is thus not recorded as figures are rounded to the nearest &#163; million.<br>

7. Spend data are rounded to the nearest &#163; million; the average cost per person into work is rounded to the nearest pound.<br>

8. Start dates for each new deal programme are: new deal for young people: January 1998; new deal 25 plus: July 1998; new deal for lone parents: October 1998; new deal 50 plus: April 2000; new deal for disabled people: July 2001; new deal for partners: April 1999.<br>

 Between January and November 2005, 62 per cent. of participants had not been on the new deal programme before and 38 per cent. had. In a dynamic labour market it is inevitable that some individuals who find work through the new deal will become unemployed again at some point in the future and at some stage qualify for the new deal again. It is also the case that some individuals have complex barriers to work and will find it difficult to maintain employment over a long period.

 This information is not held centrally.

 Mental health services are not currently included in patient choice at referral under the choose and book service.

These findings informed the detailed work carried out to formulate the Government&#039;s choice at referral policy and led to the decision to exclude mental health services from choice at referral In the light of the national choice consultation&#039;s findings, the Department commissioned the choice in mental health programme, which is being run by the National Institute of Mental Health in England.

<p><a name="st_297"><a name="60328w35.html_spnew4"><b> Jane Kennedy  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 20 March 2006]:</i> The calculation is based on the information, supplied by stakeholders, that the cost of independently investigating a complaint of a complex nature such as a clinical negligence case is on average approximately &#163;2,500. At present, the number of claims settled for under &#163;20,000 represents approximately 75 per cent. of settled claims. We expect a similar proportion to be covered by the new scheme. Exact numbers are hard to predict. However, as the scheme aims to make seeking redress more straightforward we expect more people to come forward. Modelling work within the Department, based on patient survey data, suggests that improved access to justice under the scheme may cause claims to rise by anything from 2,200 to 19,500 a year. In total, therefore, we expect the number of cases falling within the scheme to range between 5,800 and 16,600 in year one. If each case was subject to independent investigation, this would result in a total cost of between &#163;14.5 to &#163;41 million in year one.

The median replaces the mean as the headline statistic. The weighted mean is the sum of the weighted values divided by the sum of the weights. The median is the value below which 50 per cent. of employees fall. It is preferred over the mean for earnings data as it is influenced less by extreme values and because of the skewed distribution of earnings data.<br>

The Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) replaced the New Earnings Survey (NES) in 2004. The main difference between the ASHE and NES is that estimates are now weighted to population totals from the Labour Force Survey, and imputation is carried out for missing information. 2005 ASHE figures also include supplementary surveys to increase coverage. For these reasons ASHE figures show a small discontinuity when compared with NES statistics.<br>

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what proportion of the estimated payments under private finance initiative contracts contained in Table C19 of the Budget of March 2006 are included in Departmental Expenditure Limits and fall within the Barnett Formula; and what percentage of such payments will be allocated to the Welsh Assembly budget under the Barnett Formula calculations for comparable expenditure.

<p><a name="st_320"><a name="60328w38.html_spnew2"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 All central Government unitary charge payments made under the private finance initiative are included in Departmental Expenditure Limits. Further, revenue support grants to local authorities, which fund a proportion of local government unitary charge payments, are also in Departmental Expenditure Limits. The devolved Administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland receive block budgets. Changes in these budgets and revisions to Departmental Expenditure Limits feed through to devolved Administrations through the Barnett Formula. The devolved Administrations allocate their block budgets to services in accordance with local needs and priorities and it is a matter for the devolved Administrations to decide whether to purchase services through direct spending or via PFI schemes. Therefore all unitary charge payments from PFI projects signed by the devolved Administrations are paid for from the budgets of those administrations, as would be the case for an English Department.
