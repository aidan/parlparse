To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list those contracts, awarded to <i>(a)</i> British companies and <i>(b)</i> British research facilities under the US Strategic Defence Initiative and their total value in each year since 1985.  [94430]<P>

<P>
<a name="91020w02.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 So far as contracts awarded to British Companies are concerned, I refer the right hon. Member to the answer given on 19 July 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>424</i>.

<P><I>20 Oct 1999 : Column: 584</I><P>

<P>

<a name="91020w02.htm_para0">So far as contracts awarded to British research facilities are concerned, the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the UK and US Governments in respect of the Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI), provides for contracts to be placed directly with the other Party's universities, which could include research facilities. As with contracts established directly with British companies, no central or comprehensive record is maintained.
<P>

<a name="91020w02.htm_para1">It is believed, however, that most research has been undertaken on a Government to Government basis under an arrangement known as Letters of Offer and Acceptance (LOAs). In such cases research has been undertaken by 



<P>
<P><I>20 Oct 1999 : Column: 585</I><P>
the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) or its forerunners. The total value of LOAs entered into since 1985 is approximately $150 million. While expenditure on an annual basis is not available in detail, work commenced at approximately $2 million per annum in 1986, building to $12 million over a seven-year period, then falling away to some $5 million currently.

of his Department's research relevant to the health effects of organophosphates and carbonates, including nerve agents, organophosphate pesticides and nerve agent pre-treatments.  [95072]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91020w02.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The initial phase of the research programme involving a preliminary toxicological study of the effects of the co-administration of vaccines and nerve agent pre-treatments (NAPS) in guinea pigs has recently been completed at CBD Porton Down. An outline of the study's findings was presented at a conference on research into Gulf veterans' illnesses in Washington DC in June. This initial stage of the overall research programme, which was primarily designed to help inform the design of more sophisticated longer-term studies, does not report any remarkable findings on the administration of the combination of vaccines and nerve agent treatments examined.
<P>

<a name="91020w02.htm_para3">The results of the study were reviewed by the Independent Panel, which oversees the vaccine interactions research programme, at a meeting earlier this year. The Panel agreed that the researchers should proceed with publication of the results of this initial study through the appropriate scientific channels. The Panel also agreed to more extensive rodent studies, to be carried out at the National Institute of Biological Standards and Controls, and further studies at CBD Porton Down which will include sophisticated techniques to examine any subtle long-term neurophysiological and cognitive effects of the administration of vaccines and NAPS.
<P>

<a name="91020w02.htm_para4">I have arranged to have a copy of the information presented at the Washington meeting placed in the Library of the House. A more detailed paper is being prepared for submission to a peer-reviewed scientific journal and will be published as soon as possible. This information will be placed on the Gulf veterans' illnesses page on the MOD website in due course.
<P>

<a name="91020w02.htm_para5">I am also today placing in the Library of the House copies of the Defence Scientific Advisory Council's Working Party Report on the Long Term Neurotoxicity of the Anticholinesterases, together with the Ministry of Defence's response to the Report. I am also placing in the Library three previously unpublished studies by CBD Porton Down, and one already published, which are referred to in the Report.
<P>

<a name="91020w02.htm_para6">The Report, which is a review of existing literature and research, concludes that there is robust evidence that high doses of organophosphates may have long term toxic effects on the peripheral nervous system; that there is more limited information about the long term toxic effects of low doses of organophosphates on the central nervous system; and that there is little evidence that the prophylactic use of carbamates (such as NAPS) is associated with any long term adverse health effects, although this should be further explored. We hope that it will be a useful source of information on the long-term effects of these compounds. The Ministry of Defence welcomes the Report. We accept the recommendations for further research.
<P>

<a name="91020w02.htm_para7">As the MOD's response to the Report makes clear, we continue to carry out a range of research into the health effects of organophosphates and carbamates, including nerve agents and nerve agent pre-treatments. In addition to the research set out there, work is underway at CBD

This work, which is following up research reported in the open literature, is in its very early stages and we cannot yet say whether there is any such effect, or what the implications of that might be. We intend to make public the findings of this work as soon as possible, as each part of it reaches scientific maturity.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the progress of the Colchester Garrison PFI project.  [95211]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91020w03.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 I am delighted to announce that, following a thorough evaluation of detailed proposals from three short listed bidders, we have now selected RMPA Services, a consortia comprising Sir Robert McAlpine, Primary Management and W.S. Atkins, as the preferred bidder for the redevelopment of Colchester Garrison.
<P>

<a name="91020w03.htm_para0">Detailed contract negotiations will now commence with RMPA Services with the aim of achieving contract signature towards the end of next year.
<P>

<a name="91020w03.htm_para1">The benefits which we see flowing from this deal are the replacement of an estate which is mainly old and substandard, poorly laid out and significantly underscale, with one which will provide high quality barracks and facilities which conform to the appropriate accommodation scales, are flexible to use and are capable of further development. Furthermore this will be achieved very much more quickly under the PFI route than would be possible using our own internal procedures. For example, once the contract is signed we expect the redevelopment to be complete within four years compared to the 15 years it could have taken using a conventional, staged approach. It will also free up land for redevelopment close to Colchester town centre and therefore be of benefit to the local community.
<P>

<a name="91020w03.htm_para2">Finally, this is a good deal for the taxpayer. As a result of the competitive bids received, we believe that from RMPA Services will offer the MOD excellent value for money resulting from design efficiencies, economies of scale in development and a more cost effective delivery of the support services.

 As part of the Parliament-wide Information Technology Convergence Programme, which has been endorsed by the Information Committee, all personal computers linked to the PDVN are being converted to a new e-mail system, Microsoft Exchange and Outlook 98. Some older computers linked to the PDVN will need to be upgraded or replaced if they are to continue to use the parliamentary e-mail system. The old e-mail system, Groupwise, will be closed down on 16 November 1999, prior to the beginning of the next Session on 17 November.

<a name="91020w03.htm_para3">The Parliamentary Communications Directorate (PCD) has sent to all Members and their staff information about the computer specifications required to run the new e-mail system and can advise Members and their staff about new central purchasing arrangements through which Members may purchase new equipment which meets those specifications. Members whose staff are linked to the PDVN from their constituencies are being sent a disc and information about remote conversion to use Outlook. Members and their staff based in the parliamentary precincts whose computers have not yet been converted to Outlook can arrange a date for their conversion and for a short training course by contacting PCD on extension 0899. Courses are being arranged for each weekday in October and November.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91020w03.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The vessel when adrift, was never within six miles of the coast or within the designated six mile "area to be avoided" navigational zone around Fair Isle. The vessel fully complied with the MCA requirement to accept a tug and the Anglian Prince was despatched to the scene. A tow was accepted and the vessel taken to Sullom Voe, Shetland as a port of refuge, keeping outside of the "area to be avoided" as per MCA instructions.
<P>

<a name="91020w03.htm_para5">Following the Port State Control Inspection of the vessel at Sullom Voe, MCA investigated why six hours had elapsed before the tanker reported to the Coastguard that she was in difficulty.
<P>

<a name="91020w03.htm_para6">The Master's response was that he wished to check the problem to see if it could be fixed without assistance. He maintained that the vessel's drift was monitored carefully to ensure that the ship remained outside the area to be avoided.

 Pay rates and other conditions of service for locally engaged staff are set by reference to comparable employers based locally. These comparators are usually drawn from other diplomatic missions, private companies, and the local Civil Service. UK missions are also required to follow the terms of local employment law, including legislation on national minimum wage levels.

 We welcomed the signature on 7 July of the Lome Peace Agreement between the Government of Sierra Leone and the Revolutionary United Front. Our objective now is to help the Government and people of Sierra Leone to implement the peace agreement, and thus build a framework for lasting peace and security.
<P>

<a name="91020w06.htm_para3">We have implemented the &#163;10 million package of assistance which my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary announced on 2 March 1999. This has included: UK military advisers helping to train the new, democratically accountable Sierra Leone Army; a range of equipment for the new Army including uniforms, vehicles, and light weapons; logistical support and equipment for the ECOMOG peacekeeping forces; and support for civil society and Government participation in the negotiation of the peace agreement. The ECOWAS Secretariat confirmed that the weapons could be imported as an exemption to the ECOWAS Small Arms Moratorium; and the UN Sanctions Committee was notified of these exports. We are working with the United Nations to support the early deployment of a UN peacekeeping force to Sierra Leone.

<a name="91020w07.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The high level performance indicator set supports a comprehensive assessment of the performance of the National Health Service across the range of its activity, including services that are provided alongside social services. The current set was the first to be published and we are committed to making improvements over time. The Department is currently reviewing the content and presentation of figures for the next publication of performance indicators.

 The cost of establishing the National Institute for Clinical Excellence was in the region of &#163;734,000.

 Clinicians are expected to take National Institute for Clinical Excellence guidance fully into account when exercising their clinical judgment. Such guidance represents the views of an eminent body of senior practitioners who have had the opportunity of carefully considering the available evidence. However, NICE guidance does not override a doctor's individual responsibility to exercise his or her clinical judgment in determining what treatment is appropriate and necessary for a patient.

 The Health Act 1999 provides for the replacement of the Professions Supplementary to Medicine Act 1960 by an Order and the eventual repeal of the 1960 Act when replacement arrangements are in place. We are committed to full and wide ranging consultation on the proposals for new legislation as well as the three month statutory consultation on the draft Order, with a Report to Parliament on the outcome, when the Order is laid.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91020w08.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Swayne: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what representations he has received regarding loss of clinical freedom by clinicians consequent upon the establishment of the Commission for Health Improvement; and if he will make a statement.  [93921]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91020w08.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The aim of the Commission for Health Improvement was clearly set out in the consultation document "A First Class Service" (July 1999). This was to work with clinicians to assure, monitor and improve the quality of care provided by the NHS. Clinicians will remain responsible for their clinical judgment in relation to individual patients, although they will be expected to take account of national clinical guidance and of the evidence on which it is based.
<P>

<a name="91020w08.htm_para0">Most responses to "A First Class Service" were supportive of the proposals for the Commission for Health Improvement and the Government's quality strategy as a whole.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91020w08.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Swayne: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate his Department has made regarding the additional manpower required for the Commission for Health Improvement.  [93920]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91020w08.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Commission will be an independent body and it will therefore be for the Commission itself to decide its manpower requirements. In doing so, it will need to be aware of its duty to carry out its functions effectively, efficiently and economically.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91020w08.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Swayne: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement regarding the powers of the Commission for Health Improvement to criticise individual doctors.  [93922]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91020w08.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 It is not the aim of the Commission for Health Improvement to assess or publicise the performance of individual clinicians. The Commission will look at organisational systems to assure and improve the quality of services.
<P>

<a name="91020w08.htm_para1">The Commission's powers to disclose confidential information about individuals is strictly limited in the Health Act 1999. In line with these restrictions, if the Commission does find evidence of individual poor performance it will draw this to the attention of the employing organisation for them to take action. It may also, if appropriate, draw this to the attention of the professional regulatory body concerned.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate he has made of the annual running costs of <i>(a)</i> the National Institute for Clinical Excellence and <i>(b)</i> the Commission for Health Improvement.  [93919]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91020w08.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The National Institute for Clinical Excellence's total budget is &#163;9.8 million. NICE will determine its own running costs. However, we expect them to maintain their running costs at a reasonable level to ensure that as much funding as possible is made available for its work programme.
<P>

<a name="91020w08.htm_para2">The Explanatory Notes for the Health Act 1999 cited the estimated annual running costs for the Commission for Health Improvement for 2000-01 at around &#163;7 million.

<a name="91020w08.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Drugs are added to Category D of Part VIII of the Drug Tariff when community pharmacies are having difficulty obtaining supplies of generic drugs at Drug Tariff price. The closure of a significant manufacturer of generics last December, combined with the relocation of some manufacturing facilities at the beginning of the year, and the transfer of products from bulk to smaller packs has meant that a wider range of products than normal have been in short supply, and hence an unusually large number of products have been included in Category D.
