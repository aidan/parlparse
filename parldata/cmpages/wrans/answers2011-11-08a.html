 We are aware that the Algerian authorities have closed some places of worship which had not been registered, including those of Christian groups, since new regulations governing religion in Algeria came into effect in May 2007. I discussed the situation with a delegation of Algerian Christians when I met them on 26 October. The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond (Yorks) (Mr Hague), discussed the importance of reform with the Algerian authorities during his recent visit, although he did not raise religious freedoms specifically.</p>

Following a recent visit by Mr Stefan Füle, European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood policy, the EU and Algerian Government have increased dialogue on these issues, by establishing a sub-committee on political dialogue, security and human rights. Freedom of religion, including for Christian groups, was discussed at the first meeting which was held last month.</p>

 I met with representatives from the Baha'i community in the UK to discuss this campaign and the wider issues of repression against the Baha'i minority in Iran on 15 September. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has so far received, and replied to, over 2000 emails expressing concern for the closure of the Baha'i Institute of Higher Education. The closure of the Baha'i Institute of Higher Education and arrest of members of its staff form part of a wider pattern of harassment of Baha'is in Iran, including the imprisonment of Baha'i leaders. We regularly raise these issues with the Iranian authorities, including when I met the Iranian chargé d'affaires in August this year. We will continue to press the Iranian Government to accord all their people the right to freedom of religion. With our EU partners, the UK has taken co-ordinated action to address Iran's human rights record, imposing travel bans and asset freezes on over 60 Iranians responsible for human rights violations, including Government Ministers and members of the judiciary.</p>

The British ambassador to Tel Aviv most recently raised the issue on 26 October during his visit to the Israel Prison Service complex, at the invitation of the Public Security Minister, where there are around 4,500 security detainees. He raised concerns over visitation rights and the treatment of minors, particularly cuffing and shackling.

 As in many parts of the Middle East and North Africa, Yemenis have been energised by popular protests starting in Tunisia which have pressed for democratic change. From late January 2011 we have witnessed the growth of widespread protest movements across Yemen. On the anti-Government side these have been largely made up of students, some politically affiliated and civil society and have received the support of the official opposition grouping JMP, and elements of the armed forces. At the same time we have also seen large pro-Government demonstrations in support of President Ali Abdullah Saleh.</p>

               <a name="11110880000118"> The anti-Government protest movement across Yemen has made plain its principal demand, that President Saleh step down. The Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) Initiative meets this demand in its outline of a staged plan for a formal transfer of power leading to the formation of a National Unity Government and early presidential elections. The Joint Meeting Parties (JMP) supports the aims of the Initiative and has already signed the GCC Initiative, as have representatives of the ruling party (GPC). The protest movement, representative of large numbers of Yemen's students and civil society, is diverse and lacks a single voice. In meetings with its members British embassy officials have seen a range of views, some aligned with the JMP and its support of the GCC Initiative, others not. A major theme is concern with accountability and justice for those suspected of human rights abuses and corruption.</p>

 In meetings with the leaders of the official opposition and judging from public statements by leaders of the protest movements there is widespread support for the UN in maintaining, through its adoption of Resolution 2014, pressure on president Saleh and his government. The Yemeni regime has also welcomed the resolution and undertaken to respond positively to it. Tawakkol Karman, Nobel prize winner and civil right activist, referred to it as a “good start”. There is a sense among protestors that the UN can do more, but the resolution with its clause on reviewing the situation after 30 days sends a strong message to the Yemeni leadership and opposition of global concern about the deteriorating situation in Yemen and the urgent need for a political settlement. In particular it sends a clear message to President Saleh that he should sign the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative without delay.</p>

 The UK Border Agency does not routinely collect statistics relating to the number of asylum applicants who are given permission to work. This is because an application for permission to work is not recorded as a separate case type on the agency's case information database. Any application of this nature is instead dealt with by the case owner as part of the application for asylum with the outcome being recorded within the case notes. To provide the complete set of data requested it would be necessary to look at each individual application for asylum that has exceeded the 12 month point in the last five years and record whether an application for permission to work has been made and if so granted. The cost of doing so would be disproportionate.</p>

 Although the Home Office and UK Border Agency have made grant payments to fund charitable organisations over the past five years, and may continue to do so in the future, it would not be possible to fully answer this question to the level of detail required without incurring disproportionate cost. Our systems record payments to not for profit organisations which includes charities but also other philanthropic institutions and social enterprises. Hence, to do so would require investigating more than 300 not-for-profit recipients, identifying whether they make payments to charities as a lead partner.</p>

 Risk of harm to the public is an important consideration when deciding whether or not to detain under immigration powers a foreign national offender who is liable to deportation, but it is not the only consideration. There will be circumstances in which it will be legitimate to detain even where there is no identified risk of re-offending, for example where there is a significant risk of the individual absconding or where the individual's own lack of co-operation is a determinative factor preventing removal.</p>

For example the detention review template and guidance have been revised to better support caseworkers in making evidence-based detention decisions and demonstrating progress since the last 28 day review. The UK Border Agency will also review the template and guidance for making the initial detention decision to ensure that all detention decisions are based on a sound consideration of the evidence.</p>

 The cost to the House of holding the meeting of the Welsh Grand Committee in the Guildhall, Wrexham, on 20 October is estimated at £7,600. This figure includes sound recording and transmission, interpretation, accommodation, subsistence and travel, and a small amount of overtime. It does not include Members' travel costs, which fall to be reimbursed by IPSA, nor staff salary costs that would have been incurred anyway. It also includes costs of an earlier visit to Wrexham by staff to plan the arrangements for the meeting.</p>

 The PAYE system collects tax on account of an individual's liability for the year using code numbers based on the information available at the start of the tax year. For those who move in and out of work, have fluctuating income, or have expenses and benefits, in year PAYE deductions do not always equal the tax due. For this reason at the end of each tax year, HMRC checks that customers have paid the right amount of tax—usually around 85% of people have paid the right amount. This is part of the normal PAYE cycle of work and has happened each year since PAYE was introduced in 1944.</p>

Generally, these advocate an immediate permanent cut in VAT because other EU member states have reduced rates of VAT for hospitality, and on the basis of some economic modelling. Therefore, they take no account of the significant benefit to the hotel industry of the holding the Olympics in London in 2012.</p>

It is also possible that some cases involving human rights claims may have been included as “Other” cases even though they were judicial review cases. In each case this is because it would result in disproportionate cost to determine whether the cases were or were not JR cases.

The medical condition of severe disablement allowance claimants is recorded using a grouped version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD10), and the only codes that specifically indicate chronic pain are those for ‘Chronic intractable pain’ and ‘Other chronic pain’, both of which come under the general heading of ‘Pain not elsewhere classified’.</p>

 When providing advice for personal independence payment, trained independent assessors will consider individuals' ability to carry out a series of key everyday activities, set out in regulations. This advice will inform decisions on benefit entitlement, taken by departmental decision makers who are ultimately responsible for ensuring appropriate evidence has been obtained and taken into consideration.</p>

               <a name="1111094000359"> Assessors will need to ensure that they have sufficient evidence on which to base their advice. This evidence will be gathered from a range of sources, partly provided by the claimant and the remainder requested by the assessor. In most cases we envisage that this will also involve information gathered from a face-to-face consultation between the claimant and the assessor. However, such consultations may not always be necessary or appropriate—especially where there is already sufficient evidence available, such as from the claimant themselves or from individuals involved in supporting the claimant, such as their GP, specialist or social worker. Decisions on whether sufficient evidence has been gathered will be based on the circumstances of the case and guidance will be provided to support such decisions. The assessment criteria for the benefit are still being developed.</p>

 The information requested is provided in the following table for <i>(a)</i> the state pension and <i>(b)</i> benefits. The table shows the cost of increasing the benefits, by the given rate in April 2012 compared to a baseline of no uprating in April 2012. 'Other benefits' only includes those benefits uprated by CPI. It therefore excludes pension credit as the standard minimum guarantee is uprated by average earnings.</p>

1. Caseload figures are rounded to the nearest 100.
2. The figures assume that pension credit is available when one partner reaches age 60. However, the qualifying age for pension credit is increasing in line with the increase in women's state pension age. At February 2011 the qualifying age for pension credit was between 60 and four months and 60 and five months. Current data do not allow analysis that takes account of the increase in qualifying age.
3. Jobseeker's allowance is payable until state pension age. Income support is payable until a person reaches the pension credit qualifying age, so these data include those who are over 60 who have not yet reached the pension credit qualifying age.
4. Data are not available for partners of employment and support allowance or incapacity benefit claimants.
5. The best statistics on benefits are now derived from 100% data sources. However the 5% sample data still provide some detail not yet available from the 100% data sources. The proportions from the 5% sample data have been used and applied to the overall 100% total for the benefit to determine the total number of couples.
6. Figures are not available for couples who may be entitled to this support, but do not claim it.

 As UK Fisheries Minister I attended the Council meeting on 21 October. We had a useful exchange of views on the important EU-Norway negotiations and secured the Fisheries Commissioner's agreement that fishing quotas should not be subject to an automatic cut for those stocks for which data is considered incomplete; instead, total allowable catches will be decided on a case-by-case basis. Though this year's negotiations will be challenging, the removal of the threat of a blanket cut for data-incomplete stocks is a positive development.</p>

 There are a number of factors that affect food prices in the shops, the largest driver being world commodity prices, but with exchange rates and oil prices also having an impact.</p>

However, there will be interactions with other drivers of retail food prices, and the modelling shows that larger persistent shocks have a greater effect than smaller one-off shocks.</p>

No substantive issues were raised, no confidential information was disclosed, and there was no follow-up to the meeting. After the meeting had taken place Mr Howarth informed his office in accordance with the Cabinet Secretary's guidelines. The two social events that both Mr Howarth and Mr Werritty attended took place in Wiltshire on 16 July and in London on 24 September 2011.</p>

 Personal health budgets are currently being piloted across England. Over 2,700 people have been recruited into an independent evaluation programme. Around half of them will have personal health budgets; the remainder are in a control group. The evaluation does not include a specific cohort of people with learning disabilities. So, although it is likely that many people with learning disabilities are involved in the pilot, we do not yet know how many, or to what extent their needs are being supported through a personal health budget.</p>

                     <i>Notes</i>:
1. The ESR Data Warehouse contains monthly snapshots of the live ESR system, which is a payroll and human resources system containing staff records for national health service employed staff in England. It contains records on all NHS staff except for those in the following groups:
general practitioners (GPs), GP practice staff and other primary care providers e.g. dentists;
two foundation trusts (Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and Chesterfield
Royal Hospital NHS Foundation Trust); and
those staff groups affected by Transforming Community Services where the service is now provided by a non-NHS organisation.
2. Pension membership rates are estimated by considering the proportion of ESR's, across staff groups, with recorded employer pension contributions. Aggregate estimates are then produced using published NHS Information Centre work force census data collected annually each September. Data cleaning processes are also applied to the ESR extracts before use.
3. For non-medical staff, estimates are generated by Agenda for Change (AfC) pay band. Medical staff are not employed on AfC terms so estimates are provideo1 by broad staff groups.

 Public Health England will be established as an Executive Agency of the Department of Health on 1 April 2013, and will work in an open and transparent way. It will be managed by a chief executive who will be solely responsible for the day-to-day operation of the agency. Public Health England will receive its own budget to deliver its services. It will have scientific committees that will provide rigorous and impartial advice on public health issues. This operational freedom will be supported by a framework agreement between the Department and Public Health England which will set out the roles and responsibilities of both organisations.</p>

1. Estimates are based on the impact assessment supporting the consultation on FITs for solar PV and take a midpoint of the projected impacts of the two options for energy efficiency requirements set out in the consultation.
2. Estimates are uncertain and depend on a number of factors including final decisions following the current consultation on FITs, how the market responds to any resulting changes in tariff levels, the future profile of costs of PV panels and the average size of installation for different tariff bands.
3. Estimates rounded to nearest 5,000.

The number of installations are expected to be between 70-95% less for different tariff bands than under the “Do Nothing scenario”.

It has developed a new reproductive health policy and strategy to run from 2011 to 2013.

 The business case for the St Helena airport agreed by Ministers has rigorously reviewed the value for money case for an airport. The value for money case builds on a number of economic and financial assessments which have been completed since 2005. All of these reports have come to the same conclusion, namely that the best long-term solution from an economic and financial perspective for both HMG and St Helena is to construct an airport. Building and running a new ship for St Helena would consign the island to long-term isolation, increase the island's dependence on UK aid indefinitely and therefore would cost the UK taxpayer more in the long run.</p>

 A full feasibility study was undertaken in 2005 which looked in detail at the impact on the economy of introducing air access to St Helena. This was reviewed in 2010. These studies show that an airport provides the best chance to reduce St Helena's dependence on UK aid. St Helena Government is currently reviewing its tax, investment, immigration and land policies and is enacting reforms in these and other areas. This is being done to encourage investment and private sector activity so that St Helena can take full advantage of the opportunities an airport will bring.</p>

 The majority of St. Helenians, those living on the island and the diaspora living and working in Ascension, the Falklands, and in the UK, have long called for an airport to be built on St. Helena. These views are underlined by the results of recent referenda on the island which showed a clear majority in support of an airport. Many others connected with St. Helena have campaigned for opportunities for economic growth and development that only an airport can bring to the island.</p>

 This Government set out four conditions for the construction of an airport in July 2010, and these have now been met. The decision to fund an airport in St Helena is entirely consistent with the Government's vision for the overseas territories as vibrant and flourishing communities, generating wider opportunities for their people so they become less dependent on UK aid. It also brings to a close the uncertainty the British citizens of St Helena have been experiencing over their future since the airport project was approved in 2005 and 'paused' in 2008.</p>

 The decision to end the Participation Fund was taken as part of the emergency Budget which was published on 22 June 2010. One of the main reasons for the decision was the under-use of the fund. In its last full year only £427,190 —17.1% of the total available—was claimed by electoral registration officers. The Government have made no assessment of the effects of closure on electoral registration levels, but as part of the transition to individual electoral registration is funding research on the current state of the electoral register and under-registered groups.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 21 October 2011]:</i> Pupil funding for each free school is based on the Academy Trust's estimate of pupil numbers at the opening date following the enrolment process. The Young People's Learning Agency (YPLA) then compares each trust's estimate of pupil numbers for the current academic year against actual pupil numbers in census returns. This comparison is used to make adjustments (either additional or clawed back grant) to pupil funding in subsequent years if any shortfall or increase in pupil numbers exceeds the threshold percentage set out in the funding agreement.</p>

 Food education (also known as “food technology”), is currently part of the design and technology curriculum. It is compulsory for all pupils in maintained primary schools, at key stages 1 and 2. Although it is not currently a compulsory part of the secondary curriculum, most secondary schools in England are teaching practical cooking to 11 to 14-year-olds, including food education, at key stage 3, as it is one of two topics within the design and technology curriculum that must be taught. The National Curriculum Review which is currently under way will advise the Government as to which subjects should remain in the national curriculum and at what key stages they should feature. Our proposals for the content of the new national curriculum will be published early in 2012.</p>

 We will shortly publish a National Plan for Music Education, which will reform the delivery and funding of music education. It will ensure that all pupils have the opportunity to learn an instrument, learn to sing, have opportunities to play in ensembles and have access to musical progression routes regardless of where they live and their family circumstances. The needs of the pupil will be at the heart of the plan. Through it, the Government will signal their commitment to ensuring that all pupils have access to high quality music education.</p>

 As with all grants of this nature, officials considered NSN's performance and compliance regularly. There were no breaches of the grant agreement. The Department has not provided any financial or other support to NSN in addition to that provided under the terms of the grant agreement. The Department has not provided any specific pre-application support since 30 September although we are aware NSN, in its role as an independent charity, has been available to offer support to free school proposers. No interviews have been carried out by the Department in connection with the recent competition to award a grant to provide support for the free school pre-application process. Ministers and Special Advisers have met NSN on several occasions since May 2010; officials have met NSN frequently. Providing information on the exact number, and type of events, and meetings could be done only at disproportionate cost.</p>

 There is a range of evidence suggesting that young people like to access advice in a variety of ways including face-to-face, in groups or online. Schools are best placed to know what support their pupils need. The Government recognises that many young people can benefit from a face-to-face discussion of their skills, abilities and interests to help them think through future education and career options. We will highlight this important issue to schools through statutory guidance in advance of the new duty to secure access to independent careers guidance commencing in September 2012, subject to the passage of the Education Bill. The guidance will place a clear expectation on schools that they should secure face-to-face careers guidance where it is the most suitable support, particularly for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Schools may choose to work in partnership with providers engaged in delivering the National Careers Service, or with other providers, as they see fit. The National Careers Service will be required to meet a robust, high quality standard and all providers involved in the service will be expected to be accredited to the standard by April 2013. It was recently announced that this quality standard will be the revised matrix standard. The standard will assist schools in making well-informed decisions about which providers to work with.</p>

                     <i>Notes:</i>
1. UCAS tariff score was used to assess candidates from 2002/03 onwards.
2. UCAS introduced the tariff score to take account of curriculum 2000. It was designed to make different qualifications comparable. It is based on a number of qualifications including A/AS levels. Grade A* at A level scores 140 points; grade A at A level scores 120 points; grade B scores 100 points; grade C scores 80 points; grade D scores 60 points and grade E scores 40 points. Tariff scores cover those entrants for whom data are collected. Tariff score data are not collected for some qualifications, including access courses, OND/ONC, HND/HNC, GCE, A/SCE, Higher, GNVQ/GSVQ, NVQ/SVQ level 3.
3. Coverage is undergraduate courses in universities and other higher education institutions.
4. Includes both bachelor of education courses and BA/BSc with qualified teacher status courses as they are combined in the data source.

 This Department is leading the cross-Government Employment Law review and is looking at all evidence about the operation of the underpinning legislative framework and burdens on business, including from the British Chambers of Commerce, other business representative groups, trade unions and other stakeholders. A key objective of the review is making it easier for a business to take on staff. The review will also consider ideas that emerge from the Red Tape Challenge aimed at facilitating the recruitment of employees by businesses.

 To combat persistent late filing of accounts Parliament introduced, in addition to the existing penalties for filing accounts late, a double penalty for companies who file late in successive years; Companies House, which is responsible for issuing late filing penalties, has issued 16,832 of these double penalties between April and September this year. When companies fail to file accounts at all, Companies House contacts the company to investigate if it is still in operation; if it is not they will take action to remove the company from the register, and in the financial year ending 31 March 2011 53,550 companies were removed for this reason. If the company is still required Companies House will, as a last resort, prosecute the company directors for failing to file the accounts. During the financial year ending 31 March 2011 Companies House prosecuted over 3,000 directors for this reason.</p>

<sup>(1)</sup> Persons aged 16 and over.
<sup>(2)</sup> Coefficients of Variation have been calculated for the latest period as an indication of the quality of the estimates. See Guide to Quality below.
Guide to Quality:
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV—for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220
Key:
* 0 = CV&lt;5%—Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered precise
** 5 = CV &lt;10%—Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered reasonably precise
*** 10 = CV &lt;20%—Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered acceptable
**** CV ? 20%—Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered too unreliable for practical purposes
CV = Coefficient of Variation

               <i>[holding answer 27 October 2011]:</i> The 2010 spending review committed the Department to a 25% real-terms reduction in our budgets by 2014-15 to make our contribution to the Government's deficit reduction targets—a challenge BIS is already meeting through significant reductions in staff and the streamlining of our partner organisations.</p>

These included tight controls over pay and recruitment, advertising and marketing spend, consultancy, ICT, estates and procurement. In particular the Department:</p>

The exception to this was cases where Departments had any legally-binding contractual commitments. BIS has been unable to create a single pay system as a result of the freeze and the pay arrangements of the legacy Departments apply. Staff on former BERR terms have a contractual pay arrangement and so received an award during the pay freeze. Staff on former DIUS terms did not.</p>

 Earlier this year, the Government launched the ‘Resolving Workplace Disputes’ consultation, a significant step in the employment law review. This consultation sought views on measures to encourage the early resolution of disputes and ensure that, where parties do need to come to an employment tribunal, the process is as swift, user friendly and effective as possible. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, my right hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr Osborne), has already confirmed the Government's intention to proceed with one of these measures; to extend the qualifying period for unfair dismissal claims from one to two years and we will be publishing our Government response in the coming weeks, setting out other measures that we are intending to take forward, to deliver reform across the employment tribunal system.</p>

 On 19 October 2011 the joint liquidators of Farepak issued reports to both creditors and agents on the progress of the liquidation. These reports refer to ongoing work being undertaken towards bringing legal proceedings against third parties with the objective of securing more money for creditors. Given the nature of the intended action I understand that it is not possible to provide an estimate on when the liquidation will be concluded.</p>

 The Government have previously announced that we would consider the case for updating section 233 of the Insolvency Act 1986 and the wider issue of termination clauses. We are aware of the problems that can be caused for those seeking to rescue a struggling company by such clauses. We are currently looking into the merits of any change, and have been discussing this with interested parties.</p>
