Notes on methodology:<br>

1. Learner numbers pre-2001 are taken by DfES from TEC management information. TEC Ml is aggregagated data and does not contain information on sector. Individual learner data held on the trainee database contains information on sector, but we know the database did not accurately record the total number of learners. For each year, the percentage of learners studying engineering apprenticeships in the West Midlands from the trainee database has been applied to the total number of learners in the West Midlands from the TEC Ml to estimate the volume of learners studying engineering apprenticeships in the West Midlands. The number of achievements was not collected prior to 2001.<br>

2. Learner numbers and achievements from 2001 onwards are taken from the individualised learned record (ILR) collected by the LSC. Figures include all apprenticeships in the engineering area of learning.<br>

3. Definitions of &#039;engineering&#039; pre- and post-2001 may not be directly comparable.<br>

 The sizes for both the protection zone (a minimum of 3 km radius from an infected premises) and the surveillance zone (from the edge of the protection zone to a minimum of 10 km radius from an infected premises) have been set in European legislation for avian influenza since 1992.

<a name="50404w02.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>Environmentally Friendly Farms</h3>





<p><a name="50404w02.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what her Department&#039;s strategy is for encouraging farmers to make their farms more environmentally friendly.  [222616]</p>









<p><a name="50404w02.html_spnew0"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Government are acutely aware of the link between agriculture and the environment and agreed the role of farmers as custodians of the countryside to be basic. The strategy for sustainable farming and food was launched in England in 2002 and sets out the basis for a new relationship between Government and the farming industry in England. At its heart is a drive to enable farmers to focus on their market, rather than on subsidies, while managing their businesses in more environmentally and socially responsible ways.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w02.html_para0">
The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform deal of 2003 is central to the strategy. Farmers are now encouraged to meet the demands of the market, and there is no incentive to over-produce, because the link between subsidies and production has been broken. This will benefit society as a whole by reducing the negative environmental and animal welfare impacts of intensive farming.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 Apr 2005 : Column 1083W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w02.html_para1">
The cross compliance element of the CAP single payment scheme provides a new basis for agricultural subsidies, by linking them to delivery of important environmental and animal health and welfare standards. This will contribute to a number of strategy objectives by protecting soils, wildlife habitats and the landscape.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w02.html_para2">
Further to this is the launch of environmental stewardship this spring which builds on cross compliance and replaces existing agri-environment schemes (environmentally sensitive areas, countryside stewardship and organic farming schemes). The aim of environmental stewardship will be to tackle countrywide environmental problems such as diffuse pollution, loss of biodiversity and landscape character, and damage to the historic environment. For the first time every farmer in England will be eligible to earn payments for undertaking environmental management on the land.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w02.html_para3">
Environmental stewardship has three elements:
</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w02.html_para4">
<i>(i) Entry Level</i>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">A whole farm scheme open to all farmers and land managers who agree to carry out basic environmental management. Farmers will be able to earn up to 30 per hectare annually for delivering straightforward, yet effective, work.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w02.html_para5">
<i>(ii) Organic Entry Level</i>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">A similar whole farm scheme, which offers organic management options to farmers with land registered as fully organic or in conversion to organic farming, with an organic inspection body approved by Defra. It provides payments of up to 60 per hectare annually for land entered into the scheme.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w02.html_para6">
<i>(iii) Higher Level</i>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Rewards more ambitious environmental management.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w02.html_para7">
Together with the new CAP single payment scheme and cross-compliance, the new scheme will mark a watershed in the way England is farmed, and will continue to improve and build on the successes achieved through almost two decades of experience with the countryside stewardship, environmentally sensitive areas and organic farming schemes. There are a number of wide-ranging objectives, which go beyond those of the earlier schemes and include the protection of water and soil and flood management.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w02.html_para8">
The Department is also committed to encouraging greater production of organic food, and has set out its strategy for achieving this in the action plan to develop organic food and farming in England, published in July 2002, and the Two Years On report, published in August last year.

<p><a name="50404w02.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw </b> 
<i>[holding answer 24 March 2005]:</i> The information is not available in the form requested and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the lowest charge quoted to the National Fallen Stock Company is for the collection of a <i>(a)</i> beef, <i>(b)</i> sheep and <i>(c)</i> horse carcase in each county of England.  [223837]</p>








<p><a name="50404w02.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bradshaw </b> 
<i>[holding answer 24 March 2005]:</i> The information is not available in the form requested and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. Information on prices charged by fallen stock collectors in particular areas are provided on an individual postcode basis to farmers and horse owners who join the National Fallen Stock Scheme. This is not only on the basis of the species but different categories within species (e.g. bovines 6&#150;12 months, 12&#150;24 months etc.).


</p>







<p><a name="50404w02.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Andrew Turner: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what evidence she has collated of the pollution of <i>(a)</i> watercourses and <i>(b)</i> groundwater by on-farm burials of fallen stock in each year since 1999.  [223838]</p>








<p><a name="50404w02.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 24 March 2005]:</i> None. However, the Environment Agency is often involved with carcases found in or near to watercourses and it has no direct evidence to show that on-farm burial in the past has caused reportable pollution problems.


</p>







<p><a name="50404w02.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Andrew Turner: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what records she has kept of trends in the costs of <i>(a)</i> incineration and <i>(b)</i> rendering of fallen stock in each year since 1999; and if she will make a statement on the cost of disposal of (i) beef, (ii) sheep and (iii) horse carcasses.  [223839]</p>








<p><a name="50404w02.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw </b> 
<i>[holding answer 24 March 2005]:</i> The Department does not keep records of trends in costs of incineration and rendering of fallen stock. This is a commercial matter for the fallen stock disposal industry. The Government contribution to the National Fallen Stock Scheme has assisted farmers, but not horse owners, who have joined the Scheme with the costs of collection and disposal of fallen stock since November 2004.


</p>







<p><a name="50404w02.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Andrew Turner: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the effect of changes in the over-30-month scheme on <i>(a)</i> demand for incineration capacity between March 2005 and March 2007 and <i>(b)</i> the cost of incineration of (i) beef, (ii) sheep and (iii) horse carcases.  [223840]</p>








<p><a name="50404w02.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw </b> 
<i>[holding answer 24 March 2005]:</i> My officials met with representatives of the disposal industry in January 2005 to discuss the likely effects of the forthcoming OTM rule change.

Notes:<br>

1. Figures prior to 2000 show main holdings only. From 2000 minor holdings are included. A holding is defined as a minor if it meets all of the following conditions:<br>

the total area is less than 6 hectares<br>

the labour requirement is estimated to be less than 100 standard person-days<br>

there is no regular full-time farmer or worker<br>





the glasshouse area is less than 100 sq m<br>

the occupier does not farm another holding.<br>

2. Due to the introduction of new questions in 1998 figures prior to this year are not directly comparable with earlier years&#039; results.<br>

3. Due to a register improvement exercise in 2001 labour figures prior to this are not directly comparable with later results.<br>

 We are committed to using the UK&#039;s Presidency to take forward the Action Plan on Non-Proliferation agreed by G8 Leaders at the Sea Island Summit in June 2004. In particular, we are working to ensure that new measures are put in place to limit the spread of sensitive nuclear technology to states that may seek to use them for weapons purposes, or allow them to fall into terrorist hands. Another priority is to promote co-ordination between governments and international organisations to counter the threat of bioterrorism. At the same time, we are working to ensure that the commitment of both G8 partners and other countries to the Global Partnership against the spread of weapons and materials of mass destruction leads to the continued effective implementation of collaborative projects to address legacy proliferation risks in partner countries in the Former Soviet Union.

The drop in registrations between 1997 and 2004 is mostly attributable to the reduction in the re-registration period for patients from two years to 15 months. The figures also exclude patients treated in dental access centres (DACs) who are not registered. In 2004, there were some 375,000 episodes of treatment in the 48 DACs then in operation in England.

</p>


<p>

During 2004, there was a large switch to personal dental services (PDS) in the PCT area. For patient registrations (or for where registration does not apply, patients seen in the past 15 months), the PDS number rose from 1,900 at the end of December 2003 to 47,200 at the end of December 2004.

PCT funding for dentistry will increase by 19.3 per cent., from 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06. Consequently, over &#163;250 million of additional resources will be provided by 2005&#150;06.

A NHS support team has been created to work with those PCTs which are experiencing most difficulty in terms of access.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment his Department has made of the impact of holocaust memorial day in increasing awareness of and drawing conclusions from the holocaust; and what plans he has for future commemorations.  [223021]</p>








<p><a name="50404w15.html_spnew0"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 Home Office quantitative polling research included four questions about holocaust memorial day (HMD) in the August 2004 and February 2005 surveys. The February 2005 research findings show a significant increase in awareness with 77 per cent. of those interviewed having heard of HMD (compared with 53 per cent. in August 2004) and 66 per cent. agreeing that events like HMD have an important part to play in combating racism and discrimination (compared with 51 per cent. in August 2004).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w15.html_para0">
To give a comparison, in February 2004 a BBC survey revealed only 55 per cent. of the UK&#039;s population had ever heard of Auschwitz. A new BBC survey conducted in January 2005 has shown that now 94 per cent. of the population in the UK has heard of Auschwitz. This awareness is not just superficial, with half of the UK population feeling that they now know quite a lot about the holocaust, compared to only 30 per cent. last year. In establishing HMD the Government wanted to drive up awareness and understanding of the holocaust. The televised national event in January, preceded by a reception for survivors at St. James&#039;s Palace in the presence of Her Majesty the Queen and supported by other media programming about the holocaust, has succeeded in this aim. Understanding the continuum of

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on levels of violent crime.  [216757]</p>








<p><a name="50404w17.html_spnew0"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 According to figures from the British Crime Survey (BCS), which are the most reliable indicator of long-term trends in violence in England and Wales, there were an estimated 2.52 million violent incidents in the 12 months to September 2004. Levels of violent crime are now stable after significant falls since the latter part of the 1990s&#151;36 per cent. down from a peak in 1995 and 26 per cent. down from 1997. The fear of violent crime has also fallen steadily since 1998, with the proportion of adults with a high level of concern about violent crime down from 21 per cent. in 2002&#150;03 to 16 per cent. in 2003&#150;04.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w17.html_para0">
Half of all violent incidents reported to the BCS in 2003&#150;04 did not result in injury to the victim. However, this does not mean that public concern about violent crime is unjustified or that the ordeal of victims is not traumatic, even if injury has not occurred.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 Apr 2005 : Column 1134W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w17.html_para1">
Recorded violent crime has risen since 1997, reaching 1.1 million incidents in 2003&#150;04, but these data are affected by changes in reporting and recording practices. The Home Office Counting Rules for Recorded Crime were amended in 1998 to include a large number of offences particularly in the less serious violence categories. The introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) in April 2002 also resulted in an increase in recorded crime. The effect of the change on the reported level of violent crime was estimated to be an increase of 20 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w17.html_para2">
In addition, more violent crimes are being recorded by the police as public tolerance of violence in the family or by acquaintances diminishes. Along with a more proactive response from the police, more crimes that would have previously been unreported are finding their way into the official figures.

 It is for Brentwood borough council to assess the need for Gypsy and Traveller sites in its area.

<p><a name="50404w19.html_spnew3"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 Local strategic partnerships (LSPs) are non-statutory, non-executive bodies which bring together public, private, voluntary and community interests to work together more effectively. They are not designed to replace local government, but are a vehicle through which councils can exercise their community leadership role by facilitating effective partnership&#151;working to produce a strategic direction for a locality.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w19.html_para2">
Elected officials who sit on LSPs also have a responsibility to scrutinise them, therefore maintaining a clear link to the democratic decision making process.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister to whom local strategic partnerships are accountable.  [223313]</p>








<p><a name="50404w19.html_spnew4"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 Within a local strategic partnership (LSP), individual partners will remain responsible and accountable for decisions on their own services and the use of their own resources. Accountability to the partnership, therefore, cannot override these individual commitments. The LSP partner organisations already have established lines of accountability, to their own customers and the wider community. LSP accountability arrangements need to build on these frameworks.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w19.html_para3">
While local authorities are legally required to prepare community strategies, in the community strategy guidance they are encouraged to see LSPs as the vehicle to determine and deliver these.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w19.html_para4">
For the 88 areas receiving neighbourhood renewal fund (NRF) resources, although the local authority remains the accountable body, ultimately it is the responsibility of the LSP to determine their allocation with the aim of meeting the partners&#039; strategic priorities, improving public services in the most deprived neighbourhoods, and contributing to the achievement of public sector agreement (PSA) targets to narrow the gap between deprived areas and the rest.

<p><a name="50404w19.html_spnew5"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 A local strategic partnership (LSP) is a non-statutory, non executive organisation which brings together public, private, voluntary and community interests to work together more effectively to improve the quality of life in their area. There is no one model for the structure of a LSP nor is an area obliged to set one up; what works in one area may not work in another. As such this information is not held centrally by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister but the Government Offices (GOs) would have this information.

<p><a name="50404w19.html_spnew6"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 Local strategic partnerships (LSPs) are a collaborative partnership where each member is an equal partner. Partners are not appointed by any one person or any one organisation. They join on a voluntary basis to help organise the delivery of local services more effectively. Each partner has a different contribution to make to secure the economic, social and environmental well being of an area for those who live and work there.

 Local strategic partnerships (LSPs) are voluntary bodies and have no statutory responsibilities. They rely on the goodwill of their partners to operate. Therefore they are not required to develop any formal performance management mechanisms.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w19.html_para5">
However, LSPs in receipt of neighbourhood renewal funds resources have all now developed performance management frameworks. This is primarily a self-assessment process. To ensure the process is robust, since 2004 Government offices have undertaken an annual review, with the outcomes of performance management forming the basis of these reviews. Government offices provide the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister with a report on each of the 88 LSPs in September each year.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what plans the Government have to <i>(a)</i> recruit more ethnic minority teachers and <i>(b)</i> encourage more people from ethnic minorities to become school governors.  [223879]</p>








<p><a name="50404w21.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </b> 
 The Teacher Training Agency&#039;s commitment to increase the recruitment of trainees from minority ethnic backgrounds to 9 per cent. of the allocated training places has been a priority since 2000.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w21.html_para10">
In 2004, the provisional figures for entry to initial teacher training show that 2,934 trainees (9.1 per cent.) were from a minority ethnic background. This is an increase of 759 (35 per cent.) additional trainees recruited since 2002. Despite meeting the 9 per cent. target, it remains a priority for the agency to further increase recruitment of trainee teachers from a minority ethnic background.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w21.html_para11">
There are approximately 350,000 school governor places at maintained schools in England. 12 per cent. of serving governors are from a minority ethnic background.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w21.html_para12">
Responsibility for the recruitment and appointment of school governors is shared between local authorities, schools themselves and any relevant body&#151;such as a faith organisation&#151;for schools with foundations. These local organisations are best placed to identify the most successful ways to recruit good quality, suitable candidates. The Department supports the recruitment activities of schools and LEAs by providing the generic Help Schools Help Children recruitment leaflets, available in 11 minority languages, and a recruitment toolkit. Additionally, since November 1999, the Department has funded the School Governors&#039; One Stop Shop (SGOSS) to recruit school governor volunteers with transferable skills from the business world. Since their establishment SGOSS have identified 6,437 candidates. Of these candidates 3,047 have already been appointed to governing bodies, with 18 per cent. coming from a minority ethnic background.

<a name="50404w23.html_para3">
The Clackmannanshire study is a valuable piece of research which highlights the importance of having a well structured and direct programme of synthetic phonics teaching in schools. It lends further weight to the approach to teaching reading and spelling advocated by the National Literacy Strategy which has at its heart early and direct instruction in synthetic phonics, very similar to the teaching methods trialled in Clackmannanshire.

While the pupils who took part in the Clackmannanshire study made significantly faster gains than pupils in the control group, their attainment in reading comprehension was broadly the same as that achieved by an average 11-year-old in an English school who would be taught using the National Literacy Strategy.

 From 6 April 2006 there will be a facility for pension scheme members to commute trivial pensions and take the pension as a lump sum, where pension benefits have a total capital value of less than 1 per cent. of the lifetime allowance. The lifetime allowance will be &#163;1.5 million at its introduction in April 2006, rising to &#163;1.8 million by 2010. So, at the introduction of the simplified tax regime, the trivial commutation threshold will be &#163;15,000. People in this position will be able to choose a year falling between their 60th and 75th birthdays in which all trivial pensions may be commuted.

The trivial commutation rules ensure that members will not be forced to purchase an annuity with very small amounts of pension savings which could prove to be uneconomic and disproportionately bureaucratic for both schemes and members.

Figures are cumulative. This table shows marginal deduction rates for working households in receipt of income related benefits or tax credits, where at least one person works 16 hours or more a week, where the head of the household is not disabled, and where higher earnings would lead to reduced benefits or tax credits.

<p>
<a name="50404w28.html_para7">
This analysis does not take into account the way in which the new tax credits will respond to rises in income. The new tax credits only respond to rises in income in the current year of more than &#163;2,500, disregarding the first &#163;2,500 of any rise. This means that recipients will not see their tax credits reduced as soon as their income rises, so reducing the effective marginal deduction in any one year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w28.html_para8">
As a result of the Government&#039;s reforms, around half a million fewer low-income households now face marginal deduction rates in excess of 70 per cent. than did so in April 1998. The increase in the number of households facing marginal deduction rates of between 40 and 70 per cent. is primarily due to the introduction of tax credits, and more recently the extension of support to workers aged 25 or over without children. The number of heads that face an excess of 70 per cent. has fallen. This is because administrative data suggests a reported fall in the number of families on multiple tapers, i.e. non-disabled persons working more than 16 hours in receipt of tax credits and housing benefit and/or council tax benefit.

<p><a name="50404w31.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The joint World Health Organisation (WHO) and World Bank &quot;World report on road traffic injury prevention&quot; focused attention on the global impact of road accidents on low and middle income countries. The Department for Transport also welcomes the UN resolution on improving road safety. The resolution noted the recommendations of the World Report and invited the WHO to act as co-ordinator on road safety issues.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w31.html_para0">
The Global Road Safety Partnership (GRSP) was founded in 1999 to increase awareness of road safety and promote reductions in deaths and serious injury resulting from road traffic accidents in developing and transition countries. GRSP is a partnership between businesses and governments and is sponsored by the Department for International Development.

<p>
<a name="50404w31.html_para1">
Department for Transport officials support the activities of WHO in this area and are presently participating in work on child injury prevention. We recognise the problems faced by developing countries and have provided support where we are able, including sponsoring a conference on driver training and testing, held in India in 2002.

 A study report was produced in 1998&#150;99 which recommended measures to reduce congestion at the M4/M5 Almondsbury Interchange. Of these recommendations two schemes, to improve the M4 westbound to M5 slip road diverge and the M5 south to M4 east slip road, have been completed.

Prior to July 2000 the Government provided funding to improve access to public transport through the Transport Policies and Programme (TPP) system. Local authorities were allocated funding for individual schemes on an annual basis. This system was replaced by the Local Transport Plan (LTP) process which takes a more strategic approach. Local transport authorities in England outside London produce 5-year LTPs, and report on progress against these plans in Annual Progress Reports (APRs). The first 5-year plans were submitted in 2000. The following table details the funding for bus grant schemes since their introduction in the 1998&#150;99 financial year, allocated nationally and to the Central Leicestershire Local Transport Plan area, which includes Leicester, South.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s recently published Five Year Plan, &#039;Sustainable Communities: Homes for All&#039; set out our proposals for housing, including expenditure plans for the next two years, in the context of our longer term Sustainable Communities Plan. This takes a co-ordinated approach to the provision of affordable housing, including not only additional financial resources&#151;expenditure of &#163;2 billion in 2007&#150;08, more than double the 1997 level, for new social rented housing and home ownership initiatives, plus more for PFI&#151;as well as changes to the planning system so that it can help authorities deliver more affordable housing. All these policies apply fully to rural areas, where we are committed to addressing housing needs and have already more than doubled the provision of affordable housing in small settlements funded through the Housing Corporation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w33.html_para3">
The provision of affordable housing in high demand areas, including rural areas and market towns, is one of the priorities identified in the current Regional Housing Strategy for Yorkshire and the Humber and its accompanying Investment Framework. The Regional Housing Board&#039;s current two year investment plan for affordable housing delivered by the Housing Corporation includes 45 dwellings in the Vale of York. The board is also helping to fund the extra care housing scheme at Easingwold, Hambleton district council&#039;s Young Single Homeless scheme and affordable housing initiatives in the &#039;Golden Triangle&#039; high demand, high price area including north Leeds, Harrogate and York. These priorities continue into the board&#039;s revised draft strategy, which is currently out for consultation. Sub-regional housing partnerships are currently working on their investment proposals for 2006&#150;08 for submission to the board and subsequent approval by me later this year, and I would expect to see them appropriately reflect the needs of the Vale of York. Recently completed research into &#039;Rural Housing in the Yorkshire and Humber Region&#039; for the Housing Corporation and the Countryside Agency will help in addressing rural housing needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w33.html_para4">
However, it is important to make full use of all opportunities to provide additional affordable housing where it is needed. There are already good achievements

by Vale of York authorities in using the planning system to deliver affordable housing, and I hope that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s recent changes to Planning Policy Guidance Note 3 will help them to do more. I was also pleased to recently give approval to North Yorkshire county council to implement an affordable housing scheme using their share of the proceeds from the flexibility that we gave local authorities to reduce the council tax discount for second homes. The first phase comprises a proposed county-wide programme with an investment of almost &#163;12 million, including 15 dwellings in the Vale of York.

 The Bretton Woods institutions confirm that most areas of off-budget spending in Angola decreased in 2004. However, much more progress has to be made to eradicate this practice completely. The next mission of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to Angola is expected in early April. The purpose of this mission is to conclude negotiations on the start of a Staff Monitored Programme (SMP) which will, among other things, focus on bringing all revenue and expenditure into the annual budget process in a transparent fashion. Fiscal discipline is another area which the Ministry of

As regards transparency of oil revenues, including taxes from the oil industry, Angola has taken several significant steps forward. These include full annual financial audits of Sonangol, the state oil company, and publication of up-to-date oil revenues by production blocks on the website of the Ministry of Finance. The UK continues actively to encourage the Government of Angola to make progress on the remaining components of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). One other important issue which the IMF will be raising during its forthcoming mission is how the Government intends to use the windfall resulting from higher than expected oil prices. The first step will be to declare how much additional revenue has accrued and then to ensure that these funds are incorporated transparently into the annual budget system.

<p><a name="50404w35.html_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn </b> 
<i>[holding answer 24 March 2005]:</i> Animal husbandry is dominant in the rural economy of much of Darfur. Animals are raised for sale outside the state, traded and consumed locally, used as beasts of burden and, less frequently, to provide traction for farm equipment. So livestock is central to prospects for economic recovery in the state.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w35.html_para1">
In Darfur, DFID support includes &#163;1 million to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), who provide veterinarian support for livestock. This includes the provision of feed and health care to donkeys, small ruminants, and chickens both in camps and outside. In addition the programme includes provision for the training of community animal health monitors. We are continuing DFID support of these projects into the next financial year 2005&#150;06 through a $4.5 million (approximately &#163;2.3 million) contribution to the FAO under the UN Workplan.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w35.html_para2">
However, before there can be any economic progress in Darfur, either livestock-based or otherwise, there will need to be an end to the conflict. The crisis in Darfur is caused by the conflict between the Darfur rebels and the Sudanese Government and can end only through a political, negotiated settlement in line with the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed in January this year.

<i>[holding answer 24 March 2005]:</i> The latest UN&#039;s Humanitarian Needs Profile covers a conflict affected population of 2.1 million people and indicates that 93 per cent. of this population is not receiving assistance for agriculture and livestock.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w35.html_para4">
This gap is explained by the fact that funding is prioritised against immediate needs such as food, water, primary health care, and sanitation. In Darfur, assistance towards medium-term concerns is compromised by the scale of emergency needs and the degree of armed insecurity on the ground.

The poor security situation hampers access to arable land and progress on community development programmes. These include agricultural and livestock assistance.

As such they have built up a good professional relationship based on mutual trust and responsibility.

DFID has supplemented this with an additional contribution of $4.5million (&#163;2.3 million) to the FAO, as part of DFID&#039;s contributions to the UN Workplan.

This year DFID is piloting in Sudan some of the reforms to the International System that I have proposed on humanitarian reform supported by the Organisation for Co-ordination Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), notably empowering the UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator (UNHC). The aim is for the UNHC to take the lead on responsibility for needs assessments, planning, and resource allocation. DFID funding to UN agencies this year is being channelled through the UNHC who is responsible for allocating funds to UN

In the Emergency Assistance project cereal seed is being procured locally (59.5 metric tons), some of which has already been delivered. The FAO is responsible for delivering the seed to the three regional capitals of the Darfur region where it is handed over to the INGOs. INGOs have identified a number of specific vulnerable groups totalling 261,000 families who have access to land at the moment. This equates to over 1,000,000 direct beneficiaries. These INGOs are then responsible for delivering directly to the families.

<a name="50404w35.html_para11">
Overall monitoring and evaluation is the responsibility of the FAO who have to ensure appropriate performance of their implementing INGO partners. Co-ordination of these activities is carried out by the Food Security Co-ordination meeting, which is held bi-weekly in each of the Darfur regional capitals. The FAO will be reporting on their performance this year to both DFID and the UNHC. In addition, through DFID&#039;s humanitarian and livelihoods advisers in Khartoum and London, we will be undertaking monitoring of this programme during the course of this year.

The FAO has a Letter of Agreement (LOA) with each of its INGOs to purchase fodder in the local market. The implementing partner then agrees a sub-contract with a private contractor to deliver the fodder to them, which is then distributed direct to the beneficiaries and again monitored by the CAHW. This component is strongly linked to issues on protection. Women are usually required to go out and gather fodder, but have been subject to rape and violence when moving outside of camps.

 Rwanda is the most densely populated country in Africa with 90 per cent. of a population of over 8 million people earning their livelihoods from the land. Most families operate at the level of subsistence agriculture, producing almost entirely for their own consumption. Tenure of some 90 per cent. of the arable land in Rwanda is currently based upon customary rights, with no formal written title. Rwanda faces the challenge of trying to promote economic growth and reduce poverty in an economy largely dependent upon unsustainable, low productivity subsistence agriculture, while at the same time addressing a historical legacy of land disputes in the interests of national reconciliation.

 The Ministry of Defence does not own land in every county in the United Kingdom and thus does not record or retain information on that basis.

 Through the Distributed Generation Coordinating Group (DGCG), the Government have funded a report by Jade Energy on the accrual of renewables obligation certificates (ROCs), levy exemption certificates (LECs) and renewable energy guarantees of origin (REGOs). The report, which was published in February 2005, addresses concerns on the part of the microgeneration community (which includes domestic consumers who install microgeneration technologies) about access to the benefits of these schemes. The report makes recommendations on bulk processing of applications, meter data provision and &quot;sell and buy back&quot; contracts as well as recommendations to streamline the schemes and make them more user-friendly.

<i>[holding answer 14 March 2005]:</i> Plants which handled plutonium waste drums at Sellafield operate under safety cases.

Both the safety cases and the substantiation process comply with industry standards and are subject to inspection by industry regulators.

<p>
<a name="50404w41.html_para7">
It is normal for safety cases to require instrument systems to add to the reported plutonium figures an allowance for reasonable measurement uncertainties. The margin by which the results are overestimated depends on the specifics of the particular instrument system and upon the physical properties of the waste within each drum. In some cases this margin can be a significant fraction of the reported figure.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what her most recent estimate is of the number of wild bird deaths from each wind farm; what advice she gives to wind farm operators to protect birds; and what assessment she has made of experience from wind farms in other countries in respect of the protection of birds from wind turbines.  [224530]</p>








<p><a name="50404w41.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Mike O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 We do not have estimates for the number of wild bird deaths from each wind turbine in the UK. However, we are not aware of any UK wind farms that have been associated with substantial adverse impacts on birds. As part of the planning process for wind farms in the UK, developers have to provide environmental assessments of their proposals which consider impacts on a range of factors, including those related to birds. The assessments are considered by the nature conservation agencies (English Nature and the Countryside Council for Wales) and are made available for public scrutiny so other organisations such as the RSPB and local bird clubs can offer comments on the suitability of wind farm locations. The DTI advises wind farm developers to make early contact with these organisations as part of their preparatory planning for wind farm projects.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w41.html_para8">
Experience from other countries shows that badly sited wind farms can have impacts on birds, for example, Altamont Pass in California where there is extensive wind development and also a high year-round raptor use which has led to high bird mortality rates. This should be kept in the context of the existing background bird mortality from collision with, for example, buildings and vehicles which is far greater.

<p>
<a name="50404w41.html_para9">
I understand that research from Denmark suggests that birds, by day or night, tend to change their flight route some 100&#150;200 metres before a turbine and so pass above it at a safe distance.

<p><a name="50404w48.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The procurement of pork and bacon within the English national health service has to comply with the European Union Procurement Legislation, as the value of meat and poultry consumed by the English NHS is in excess of the threshold values contained within the legislation. The framework agreements covering these products, developed by the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency (NHS PASA), influence approximately 70 per cent. of the requirements of the NHS in England and aim to deliver best value for money in terms of price, quality and service from contracted suppliers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w48.html_para2">
The specifications employed by NHS PASA were created with the Meat and Livestock Commission and Louchry College in Ireland. For the pork and bacon products, the specifications call for all suppliers to comply with the NHS code of practice for the manufacture, distribution and supply of food, ingredients and food related products; additionally, along with a wider range of criteria, the specifications call for pigs to be slaughtered and processed on European Commission, or equivalent, approved premises and the labelling must include the country of origin. Provided that it satisfies the NHS code of practice, NHS PASA would purchase pork, bacon and ham carrying the British Pig Executive&#039;s quality standards mark if it represented value for money.

<a name="50404w48.html_para3">
Over the past 12 months, in excess of 86 per cent. of the pork joints, chops, mince, loin steaks etc. procured against NHS PASA&#039;s framework agreements were sourced from pigs originating from the United Kingdom. In terms of bacon, approximately 50 per cent. of the bacon sourced from NHS PASA&#039;s contracted butchers was of UK origin. The remaining countries of origin were mainly Holland and Denmark.

<p><a name="50404w50.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The Human Tissue Act 2004 makes clear that where an adult has, while alive and competent, given consent for one or more of the scheduled purposes to take place following their death, then that consent is sufficient for the activity to be lawful.

The Human Tissue Authority will be responsible for preparing codes of practice that set out what is lawful and the procedures to be followed to implement the Act.

<p><a name="50404w50.html_spnew5"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The standard for an integrated, community-based paediatric continence service is defined in the children&#039;s national service framework (NSF). National health service primary care trusts (PCTs) are expected to ensure that accessible, high quality continence assessment and treatment is provided. This process will be informed by &quot;Good Practice in Paediatric Continence Service-Benchmarking in Action 2003&quot;. The Department has also set out principles for needs-based local target setting for health and social care as part of its three-year planning guidance, &quot;National Standards, Local Action&quot;. PCTs must agree appropriate local targets with their strategic health authority, whose responsibility it is to ensure that local health services are of a high quality and are performing well. The guidance states that organisations will need to be guided by the NSFs, the standards of which will be inspected and reviewed by the Healthcare Commission over a 10-year implementation period, for the children&#039;s NSF.

 Strategic health authorities (SHAs) and primary care trusts (PCTs) have all received the national service framework for children, young people and maternity services (children&#039;s NSF). This promotes the development of integrated, community-based paediatric continence services. It states that service provision should be informed by the NHS Modernisation Agency&#039;s 2003 publication &quot;Good Practice in Paediatric Continence Services&#151;Benchmarking in Action&quot;, which is available on the clinical governance support group&#039;s website at www.cgsupport.nhs.uk/PDFs/articles/Mod Agency Good Practice.pdf.

<a name="50404w50.html_para8">
The Department has also set out principles for local target setting for the national health service and social care as part of its planning guidance, &quot;National Standards, Local Action&quot;.

In the case of the children&#039;s NSF, the Healthcare Commission will inspect and review progress towards achieving the standards over a 10-year implementation period.

This Government&#039;s priority when it came to office was to tackle the legacy of pensioner poverty. We continue to do this by targeting help on today&#039;s poorest pensioners and by encouraging all pensioners to receive the benefits they are entitled to.

Income-testing of benefits has existed since before and after the creation of the Welfare State in 1948. With the introduction of pension credit, and the ease by which it can be applied for, we have moved away from the stigmatising weekly means tests of the past.

<a name="50404w54.html_para0">
<i>Letter from David Anderson to Mr. David Willetts dated 4 April 2005:</i>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question about the number of offices we have and the number that will close due to the roll-out of the new service and the centralisation of benefit processing. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">When Jobcentre Plus was formed in 2002 we inherited the infrastructure of the former Employment Service and those parts of the Benefits Agency delivering services to people of working age. The estate comprised some 1,100 Jobcentres and 450 social security offices and was entirely unsuitable for delivering the new service and operating the new processes. Over a four year period we are introducing the new, integrated service across the country and we are acquiring, building and refurbishing premises to enable us to deliver the new service. Once the roll-out is completed nationwide the total number of outlets from which our services can be accessed is likely to be around 1000.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">A full list of sites already closed or planned for future closure as part of the Jobcentre Plus rollout programme can be found in the Library. This list includes a number of sites which are closing through merging with co-located offices. While the majority of these sites will be disposed of in due course, a number will be retained by Jobcentre Plus to accommodate non-customer facing activity.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">I should stress that this is a snapshot of our plans based on the best information available. The list of offices will inevitably change as we progress through rollout of the new, integrated service and continue to refine our plans for centralising benefit processing in Jobcentre Plus. For example, a significant number of the site closures are dependent on construction of new buildings or acquisition of new premises and these are often subject to delays and other issues.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">We continue to review the plans for our network, and will ensure that local stakeholders are kept informed of progress and any changes to our plans.</p>

 Home Office rules provide for the reimbursement of extra expenses &quot;necessarily&quot; incurred in carrying out official duty and in certain other specified circumstances. The overriding principle is that: where no extra expense is incurred no reimbursement is due. Overall expenditure on travel and subsistence is controlled through devolved budgets that enable managers to keep under review both the need for official travel and the economy of the travel arrangements. Managers are required to satisfy themselves that, for instance, regular travel commitments or programmes cannot be curtailed or reorganised, that meetings involving costly travel are really necessary, that the venue is appropriate, that only the necessary numbers of staff attend; and consider the desirability of requiring their staff to declare their forward visit proposals for prior approval. Where staff undertake necessary official travel, managers are required to ensure that they do so by the most efficient and economic means, taking all costs into account.

<p><a name="50404w58.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The Home Office Identity Fraud Steering Committee, a collaboration of Government Departments and private sector organisations, has produced a website (www.identitytheft.org.uk) which offers advice on how individuals can protect their identity. This includes keeping personal information secure, keeping plastic cards safe and being careful when giving out card details, looking after important documents and destroying unwanted documents, and advice on use of passwords.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w58.html_para0">
In the longer term, the introduction of ID cards issued on a more secure basis than current passports and driving licences will provide people with a highly effective way of protecting their identity from misuse.

<p><a name="50404w58.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 It is not a criminal offence for a person simply to use another identity. However, false identities are often used to facilitate criminal activity such as deception, fraud, theft and money laundering. The Identity Cards Bill currently before Parliament includes 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 Apr 2005 : Column 1280W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
a new offence of being in possession or control of false identity documents, including a genuine document that relates to someone else, without reasonable excuse. The proposed maximum penalty for this offence is two years imprisonment. It will also be an offence for a person to possess these documents with the intention of using the document for establishing registrable facts about himself, or allowing or inducing another to use it for establishing, ascertaining or verifying registrable facts about himself. The proposed maximum penalty for this offence is 10 years imprisonment.

<p><a name="50404w58.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) continues to encourage the Iranian embassy to issue Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) at the earliest opportunity through regular reviews of all cases with the Consul.

The purpose of each review with the Consul is to secure the issue of an ETD for a subject. The Iranian embassy requires the submission of specific evidence of nationality and identity including expired passports, birth certificates, identity cards and other original official Iranian documentation.

<p><a name="50404w61.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Beggs: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what arrangements the South Eastern Education and Library Board made to educate a child at a private school as a consequence of a false sexual abuse allegation by the pupil against a teacher; whether a grant was paid to <i>(a)</i> the family and <i>(b)</i> a school; what the consequences were for the teacher who was falsely accused; whether the Department of Education or the Board have taken steps to rehabilitate the teacher; whether he will be paid compensation; and if he will make a statement.  [221824]</p>








<p><a name="50404w61.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Gardiner: </b> 
 In the case to which the hon. Member refers, the teacher concerned pleaded guilty to assault of a pupil but not, I understand, a sexual assault. I am told by the South Eastern Education Board that, having considered a range of options and looked at what was in the best interests of the child, the decision was taken to 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 Apr 2005 : Column 1292W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
secure a place in a privately operated school. The Board is paying the fees for the pupil&#039;s attendance at the school.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w61.html_para0">
While the teacher will not receive compensation, I can assure the hon. Member that his rehabilitation was a major consideration and that the Terms of Settlement of this dispute contain a section relating specifically to the teacher and his needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50404w61.html_para1">
As a matter of principle I acknowledge the need to protect teachers from false allegations made against them. While we must of course listen to children and give primacy to their needs and welfare, the position of teachers also needs to be given due consideration in any investigative process. I am very much aware of the hugely damaging and lasting effect that false allegations can have on a teacher&#039;s professional and personal life. Our procedures must recognise teachers&#039; rights to be heard, and to be protected against false allegations.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The screening plant at Briggs Rock originally comprised two automatic rotating screens which removed most solids and materials from the sewage before the effluent liquor was discharged to sea. Over the past two to three years, due to difficulties in sourcing replacement parts, the screens became increasingly difficult to maintain and repair, and more expensive to operate. The condition of the screens continued to deteriorate and they were removed in late 2004. As an interim measure, pending the provisions of a new automatic screening plant, the screens were replaced by fabricated bar screens. These screens have to be cleaned manually twice per day and are not as effective as the automatic rotating screens.</p>
