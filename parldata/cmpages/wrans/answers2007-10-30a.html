 There is no authoritative source recording the extent of cross border movement. According to the UNHCR there are no officially registered Zimbabwean refugees or asylum seekers in Mozambique. However the International Office for Migration (IOM) estimates that between 3,000 and 10,000 Zimbabweans have left Zimbabwe to enter Mozambique. They are largely entering Mozambique under the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Facilitated Movement Protocol. Under this arrangement there have always been large cross border movements between Mozambique and Zimbabwe, mainly due to cross border trade and a large cross border common ethnic community. The IOM, Save the Children and UNICEF are undertaking an assessment of official and unofficial cross border flows in late November and their results will be made public later this year.</p>

 DFID has recently undertaken a desk based review of the economic impact of HIV and AIDS epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. Evidence of impact is difficult to assess due to the lack of robust data and complexities of long term inter-generational effects of HIV and AIDS. However, the data available indicates that higher HIV prevalence leads to lower economic growth, lower household income levels, and can increase poverty. International Monetary Fund published research on the economic impact of HIV and AIDS suggests that where HIV prevalence is greater than 20 per cent. among the working age population, growth declines per annum by up to 1.5 per cent. and that per capita incomes will fall by 67 per cent. over a 20 year timeframe compared to the scenario without HIV and AIDS.</p>

 All prosecution decisions are taken in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors.

This includes considering whether the evidence can be used in court and whether it is reliable. Prosecutors will review all the evidence, including any forensic evidence, in accordance with these principles. Only if there is sufficient evidence, will prosecutors then consider the second stage, which is whether a prosecution is required in the public interest.</p>

 The 2012 Olympic games and Paralympic games will have a great effect across the UK, including the North West region, through social, economic and sporting benefits. The North West launched their regional plan to maximise the impact of the games in their area on 11 May 2007. Further details can be found on the North West Regional Development Agency website. The main legacy ambitions for the region are: to increase participation through sport and active recreation; maximise links with Liverpool Capital of Culture as a key element of the launch of the Cultural Olympiad; build capacity in the volunteering infrastructure and promote volunteering opportunities. Another key priority for the region is targeting information and support for North West businesses. To date over 600 businesses have signed up for business e-alerts for 2012 opportunities.</p>

These opportunities include hosting pre-games training camps; participation in the 2012 Torch Relay; being one of the 70,000 volunteers needed for 2012 and winning business contracts.</p>

Rural proofing is a technique which aims to ensure that the impact of policies on rural communities is taken fully into account in their development.

However, we are acutely aware of the difficulties facing the industry at this time and my right hon.

However, the applicability of this target depends on whether Departments in their energy procurement strategy have alternatively secured 100 per cent. renewable electricity.

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="71030w0012.htm_para7"><a name="0711014000556">Waste disposal authorities (WDA) may not carry over surplus allowances in target years into the following year.

 Further to the answer given to question 147174 on 4 July, the other prompts which the National Strategies used during 2006-07 to assess whether a school needed additional support with its anti-bullying work were: <i> (a)</i> strategies to improve attendance; <i> (b)</i> the effectiveness of leadership and management; and <i> (c)</i> schools' effective use of the range of local authority (LA) support services to reduce low level disruption.

Although much of this information has been provided before I should make clear that there have only been two commissioning authorities, namely Keith Munns and Nick Pascoe (the former and current Area Managers for London).

 Measuring violence in prisons is imprecise. Acts of violence first have to be recognised as violence, secondly reported and thirdly recorded consistently.

A wide range of measures are in force to prevent absconds including rigorous intelligence systems to identify prisoners likely to abscond.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government what plans she has to increase the take up of the different Homebuy options. [109683]</p>

<p><a name="st_322"><a name="07110121000527"><a name="71030w0023.htm_spnew0"><a name="07110121008241"><b>Yvette Cooper</b>
<i>  [holding answer 18 December 2007]:</i> Since 1 April 2006, over 20,000 households across all regions have been helped into home ownership through Open Market Homebuy, New Build Homebuy (shared ownership) and Social Homebuy, the shared ownership and shared equity products funded through the Housing Corporation. The Housing Corporation is on course to meet their overall target for 2006-08.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="71030w0023.htm_para0"><a name="07110121000528">To increase overall take up of Homebuy and particularly to increase new build shared ownerships schemes the Government will invest through the Housing Corporation to fund at least 25,000 low cost home ownership homes a year from 2008-09. In addition the Government are promoting other ways to increase investment in the affordable housing industry though use of public sector land and piloting local housing companies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"><a name="71030w0023.htm_para1"><a name="07110121000529">Open Market Homebuy, which enables purchasers to buy with the help of an equity loan, aims to build a market for private sector involvement in shared equity which could ultimately stretch grant funding further. Currently four lenders are participating and offering shared equity mortgages under the scheme, though these products only suit some groups of first time buyers. In order to extend this to provide products suitable for a wider range of first time buyers we want to promote further private sector involvement in shared equity mortgages, to make products more competitive, and to widen choice and access. Therefore we will launch new shared equity products next year based on the competition being run by the Housing Corporation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="71030w0023.htm_para2"><a name="07110121000530">We have also appointed Brian Pomeroy to advise us on development of the private shared equity market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="71030w0023.htm_para3"><a name="07110121000531">In the meantime we agreed in the Green Paper that Government will provide an additional 17.5 per cent. shared equity product in the interim from July 2007 in order to widen access and choice and provide more flexibility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="71030w0023.htm_para4"><a name="07110121000532">The provision of new shared ownership housing continues to rise and is helping purchasers to get on the housing ladder with shares from 25 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="71030w0023.htm_para5"><a name="07110121000533">Social Homebuy is running as a voluntary pilot scheme until March 2008. The pilot scheme enables tenants of nine local authorities and 77 housing associations to purchase a minimum 25 per cent.  share in their rented home at a discount. The Government are reviewing the operation of the pilots in order to look at more ways to help social housing tenants own assets.</p>

<i> [holding answer 19 October 2007]:</i><i> </i>Ministers have received no request from Peterborough city council to hold discussions on the impact of EU migration on the provision of social housing in Peterborough.

Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes.

In 2005 the guidance was published in draft for consultation by the then Department for Education and Skills (DFES), now the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF). A report on the consultation was published in February 2006. (A copy of the report has been place in the Library of the House). The majority of respondents welcomed the guidance and believed it clearly defined the roles and responsibilities of all professionals in working together to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. A number of issues were raised by respondents including the length of the guidance; issues about the breadth of the role of new Local Safeguarding Children Boards (LSCBs); the removal of the Child Protection Register; and the clarity of draft guidance on child death reviews.</p>

 In March 2001, the Department published the &#147;National Service Framework (NSF) for Older People&#146;s Services&#148;. The NSF is at the centre of the Government&#146;s response to meeting the health and social care needs of an ageing population in England. Standard one of the NSF stated that, national health services will be provided, regardless of age, on the basis of clinical need alone. Social care services will not use age in their eligibility criteria or policies, to restrict access to available services.</p>

These include work force development, information technology to implement electronic personal care records, independent inspection of health, social care and council services, the publication of evidence based guidelines, further research and local champions committed to improving the health and care of older people.</p>

 From Q2 2005-06 onwards there has been a change in the way the referral to treatment figures are calculated at trust level. Where two national health service organisations (Cancer Unit and Cancer Centre) are involved in the care of the patient this is taken into account by recording half the activity against the unit that initially sees the patient and half against the centre that provides the first definitive treatment. In the past all the activity was recorded against the centre that provided the first definitive treatment.<br>
This change means that figures for trusts on referral to treatment in Q1 2005-06 are not comparable with Q3 2005-06 figures. However the national figures are still comparable.<br>

2. More accurate validation processes in 2006 have resulted in the identification and removal of 9,858 duplicate non-medical staff records out of the total work force figure of 1.3 million in 2006. Earlier years&#146; figures could not be accurately validated in this way and so will be slightly inflated. The level of inflation in earlier years&#146; figures is estimated to be less than 1 per cent. of total across all non-medical staff groups for headcount figures (and negligible for full-time equivalents). This should be taken into consideration when analysing trends over time.<br>
3. SHA totals 1997 to 2005 have been calculated using previous health authority (HA)/SHA configurations. HAs were reconfigured to become the 28 SHAs in 2002 and were subsequently reconfigured in to 10 SHAs in 2006. Due to overlaps in the HA/SHA<br>
reconfigurations, parts of West Pennine HA and North Derbyshire HA were split over Trent SHA and Greater Manchester SHA. These figures were included in the Trent SHA total to give the figure for the new East Midlands SHA.<br>

The audit also shows that in 2006, around two thirds of stroke patients were treated on a stroke unit. This is a significant improvement since 2004 when the figure was less than half. Length of stay in hospital for stroke patients is falling from 34 days in 2001 to 28 days in 2004. The results of the RCP audit also show that the proportion of trusts with a stroke unit meeting five or six of the audit&#146;s criteria has increased from 33 per cent. to 41 per cent. between 2004 and 2006.</p>

For people under 65, the three year average death rate from stroke has fallen by 23 per cent. over the period from 1993-95 to 2002-04. For people aged 65-75 the death rate has dropped by 30 per cent. over the same period. We have made greater progress in reducing premature deaths from coronary heart disease than from stroke. This is because we have begun by focusing on coronary heart disease, the biggest killer in the country. However, because of the significant progress we have made in this area we are now able to redouble our efforts in addressing the challenge of stroke. This is why the Department launched a stroke strategy document for consultation on 9 July 2007. It followed an 18-month programme of work, setting out the views of six expert working groups who represented a wide range of key stakeholders. The strategy aims to accelerate the emergency response to stroke, by setting out a framework for care of stroke patients, and raising awareness about stroke symptoms and risk factors. It is due for publication by the end of 2007.</p>

The report makes the clinical case for reconfiguring stroke services. In particular, it emphasises the need to treat stroke as an emergency, including the delivery of thrombolysis at specialist centres and a possible &#145;hub and spoke&#146; model for stroke services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_471"><a name="71030w0042.htm_para21"><a name="07110121004906">Last year the Department also launched &#147;Action on stroke services: an evaluation toolkit&#148;, (ASSET ) to help health care providers compare their performance with others.

An additional version, ASSET 2 for commissioners has also been introduced which uses analytical modelling to advise hospitals and primary care trusts of what the impact of making specific changes to their services would be.

 The Young Potential project is a respected youth initiative primarily funded though local arrangements e.g. the Nottingham Local Strategic Partnership. Together with 26 other schemes, the project participated in the Department's funded three-year pilot Young People's Development Programme (YPDP). The intention of YPDP was always to embed the lessons learned into mainstream activity. YPDP has become recognised as meeting the needs of the new targeted youth support arrangements being taken forward by the Department for Children, Schools and Families. Over the last year, the National Youth Agency and the Department has supported the participant projects in making the case for funding for this aspect of work from their local authority areas, which is what we would now expect to happen.</p>

<i> [holding answer 23 October 2007]:</i> There is no current data available on the number of individuals who are arrested each year. Information on arrests published in the Statistical Bulletin &#145;Arrests for Recorded Crime (Notifiable Offences) is based on an &#145;arrest event&#146; i.e. a person will be counted more than once if arrested on more than one occasion during the year.</p>

This would represent around 576,250 individuals, taking account of the estimated subject sample profile replication rate which is currently 13.7 per cent.</p>

<i> [holding answer 9 July 2007]:</i> The Border and Immigration Agency is committed to keeping children safe from harm and believes that it is vital that there is a closer relationship with children in the immigration process. The Agency is developing a programme of work to underpin this principle. Part of this includes a recently completed consultation exercise on better planning and support for unaccompanied asylum seeking children. The findings from this exercise will be published soon. Among the proposals will be plans to ensure that UASC are in future placed with &#147;specialist&#148; local authorities who can demonstrate that they have the expertise to deal with the children's particular needs. It will be especially important to ensure that measures are in place to monitor and deal effectively with children who go missing from local authority care, including those who have been trafficked.</p>

West Sussex has reported that in the years 2004 to 2006 50 such children went missing or left care without explanation. Hillingdon has reported that in 2006 74 children went missing or left their care placement without informing their carers where they were going to live. It has advised that figures for 2004 and 2005 are available only at disproportionate cost.</p>

 In each of the last three years no Border and Immigration Agency (BIA) staff were disciplined as a result of mistreating those being removed from the UK. With regards to those working under contract for BIA and its agencies, our records show that two people were formally warned, two people were dismissed and two people faced other disciplinary action during 2006 only. The figures relate to contracted staff involved in the escorting of individuals being removed from the UK.</p>

 The Government initiated in 1998, a 10 year national Drug Strategy which introduced a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach to tackling the harms caused by drugs through a focus on prevention, education, early intervention, treatment and strong enforcement.

A national target to double the number of users in treatment by 2008 has already been achieved two years earlier than anticipated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_496"><a name="71030w0046.htm_para8"><a name="07110121005808">New innovative approaches to tackle the link between drugs and acquisitive crime and promote treatment including new legislation, new sentencing measures and the Drug Interventions Programme (DIP) have been introduced. Over 3,000 drug misusing offenders per month are now entering treatment through the programme. Since the introduction of DIP recorded acquisitive crime&#151;to which drug-related crime makes a significant contribution&#151;has fallen by 20 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_497"><a name="71030w0046.htm_para9"><a name="07110121005809">Tough legislation has also been introduced to reduce the incentives for individuals and organised criminal groups to become involved in dealing and trafficking.

 The information requested has been placed in the Library. The figures given are the number of subject sample profiles retained on the National DNA Database (NDNAD) at 25 October 2007 which were taken by forces in England and Wales only. They include over 26,000 subject sample profiles taken from volunteers. The data is based on the current age of the subjects as at 25 October 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_500"><a name="71030w0050.htm_para0"><a name="07110121006911">It is currently estimated that 13.7 per cent, of profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates, i.e. that a profile for a person has been loaded on more than one occasion (one reason for this is that the person gave different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests). Thus, the number of individuals on the database is approximately 13.7 per cent. less than the number of subject profiles. The presence of these replicate profiles on the NDNAD does not impact on the effectiveness and integrity of the database. Nonetheless, a long-term exercise is under way to identify issues associated with the removal of all such redundant replicate profiles.</p>

In 2003-04 provisional outturn was &#163;303 million less than final provision, largely due to the Highways Agency improved methods of making provision for future land and property liabilities, and in 2006-07 &#163;183 million less, mainly due to lower than projected capital expenditure by London and Continental Railways.</p>

important that we explore road pricing seriously. Congestion charging, backed by investment in public transport, has a role in tackling urban congestion. While it is possible that road pricing could have the potential to be extended to include parts of our national networks, that is a decision for the future, informed by the development of local schemes, including London. We need to find clear answers to the technological and system challenges. The Department is working with industry to explore the role that more advanced technologies and systems could play in supporting schemes. Any road pricing system would need to be robust and trusted by road users. It is important that we demonstrate, for example, how we would deliver safeguards on privacy and against fraud before taking any decisions in the future. The Demonstrations Project was announced by the then Secretary of State on 10 May 2006.</p>

Latest Army statistics state that 10.3 per cent. of the Army is spending more than 415 days away from home base in a 30-month period, down by 3.1 per cent. since 1 January 2007, which equates to around 9,935 Army personnel exceeding harmony guidelines.</p>

This guarantees individuals a minimum of 435 days at the home base over 3 years&#146; harmony time. Due to the proactive management of individuals there is currently &lt;1 per cent. of Naval Service personnel breaching the harmony guidelines of 660/3.

 Approximately 1,000 personnel drawn from the Royal Navy and Royal Marines, the Army and the Royal Air Force were involved during the recent flooding emergency in southern England, although only about 350 personnel were deployed at any one time. All personnel were deployed at the request of the Environment Agency, and undertook tasks such as search and rescue, construction of emergency flood defences and the distribution of bulk and bottled water. This armed forces deployment did not impact on either pre-deployment training or support to current operations.</p>
