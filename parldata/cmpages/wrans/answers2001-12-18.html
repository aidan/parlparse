<P>
<a name="11218w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Our military training and assistance programme continues to make good progress towards its goal of developing a professional, accountable and effective Sierra Leone army, able to protect the security and integrity of Sierra Leone on its own. I announced in September that, following the completion of the work of British short-term training teams, our military presence would reduce to 360 shore-based personnel by January 2002, remaining at that level until April. Since then, it has been announced that presidential and parliamentary elections in Sierra Leone are to be held on 14 May 2002. I have therefore decided to maintain our presence at the force levels announced in September over the period of the elections. The International Military Advisory and Training Team will continue the military training and assistance task with the Sierra Leone army.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many Joint Strike Fighters the United Kingdom is planning to buy; what the projected cost and final delivery date is; and if he will make a statement.  [23226]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11218w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Our current planning assumption is that 150 Joint Strike Fighters will be purchased to meet our requirement for a Future Joint Combat Aircraft. Final numbers will depend on the choice of variant and on the outcome of work to confirm future UK fast jet requirements. The estimated procurement cost would be up to &#163;10 billion, dependent on numbers of aircraft required, variant selected and how it is to be supported through life. Under current planning assumptions, the last of the 150 aircraft would be delivered by the end of 2024.

The order for the first tranche of aircraft, placed in 1998, includes 55 for the United Kingdom. Orders for the remaining aircraft are expected to be placed during 2003 and 2007. These orders will include 89 and 88 aircraft, respectively, for the United Kingdom, bringing our total purchase to 232 aircraft.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer 9 April 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 364W, on Porton Down, if former service volunteers invited to visit Porton Down to view the original record books and discuss their experiences with current members of Porton Down staff are refunded for their travel expenses by his Department.  [22875]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11218w01.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 It is not Ministry of Defence policy to do so. However, some travel expenses were refunded when the Porton Down helpline was established in February 1998. Since November 2000, MOD policy has been to not refund volunteers' travel expenses on the ground that visiting Porton Down to view original records is a matter for the individual concerned and adds no further information to that previously communicated in writing.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 15 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 824W, on Porton Down, if he will place in the Library copies of the <i>(a)</i> minutes, <i>(b)</i> agendas and <i>(c)</i> papers of the meetings between his Department's staff and the Medical Research Council on 2 and 3 August to discuss the epidemiological study into volunteers who took part in experiments at the Chemical Defence Establishment, Porton Down.  [22873]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11218w01.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 These meetings were not of a kind to require formal documentation of this type. The only formal document relating to either of these meetings is a note of the meeting of 3 August which was included in the pack of papers distributed in advance of the Medical Research council seminar on 9 October to those who had shown an interest in putting forward proposals for research into the health of Porton Down volunteers.

[22931]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11218w01.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 There is no definitive list of the number of the volunteers who have received copies of technical reports. Volunteers who visit Porton Down are given copies of records that refer to them personally and copies of other documentation, including technical reports, where they add relevant information to that already located in the volunteer record books. This is decided on a case-by-case basis. In addition, copies of reports are included with the letter sent to the volunteer, detailing their attendance, where deemed appropriate.

 While there are normally no formal discussions, as part of the decision making process for the closure, partial sale or move of a military base officials consider, where appropriate, the views of other Government Departments. However, as such decisions are primarily determined by operational requirements, the final decision rests with the Ministry of Defence.
<P>

<a name="11218w02.html_para0">Officials are fully aware of the impact of such changes on local communities and it is the MOD's policy to initiate an early and close dialogue with the local authorities and the regional government offices concerned. While it is for local authorities to deal with local concerns, officials seek to take local aspirations into account as far as possible in identifying alternative uses.

 Royal Ordnance Chorley passed from Government ownership in 1988 and now forms part of Royal Ordnance Defence (ROD), itself a division of BAE Systems. The Chorley site presently provides ROD with munitions sub-component manufacture, assembly and testing facilities. Although the future use and utilisation of any ROD site is a matter for the company, I can confirm that ROD is currently reviewing its overall manufacturing strategy and I understand that the company has recently made an announcement to this effect to its employees.

<a name="11218w02.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The RAF police use a Skyguard radar system to undertake covert monitoring of military low flying aircraft and to record their heights and speeds. The results of this monitoring show that military aircrew operate in a professional manner. Data from the Skyguard deployment to the Minehead area between 3&#150;7 December are still being evaluated.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the operational welfare package for servicemen and women not based at camps South and Sha'ata during Exercise Saif Sareea II.  [21743]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11218w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 We have completed a First Impressions Report into the conduct of Exercise Saif Sareea II, which noted that there were some difficulties in delivering the Operational Welfare Package (OWP) to isolated detachments and to some units during the manoeuvre phases of the exercise. The report concludes that we should examine the requirement for a more mobile operational welfare capability but that, because there will always be limitations imposed by the essential nature of operations and exercises we should aim to deliver an OWP that can be provided within these constraints.
<P>

<a name="11218w02.html_para1">Work to address these issues is under way and the conclusions will be incorporated into an evaluation and review of the OWP, which starts in February 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement about the Quinquennial Review of the Ministry of Defence Police Agency.  [24370]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11218w02.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 I announced terms of reference for Stage 1 of this review on 26 April 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 307&#150;08W, to my hon. Friend the Member for Regents Park and Kensington North (Ms Buck). The conduct and outcome of the review have not been connected with proposals relating to the MDP's jurisdiction in the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Bill.
<P>

<a name="11218w02.html_para2">In line with central guidance on Quinquennial Reviews (QQRs), the central question for the review to date has been how far the Ministry of Defence continues to require the services of an in-house civil police force. The clear conclusion from Stage 1 of the review is that the MOD has a strong need for the MDP's services. Following careful analysis of the spectrum of crime risks facing the MOD, it is clear that the MDP provides by far the most cost-effective means of dealing with the most serious threats, of armed attack, public disorder, major theft and financial fraud. The study has clarified that the core role of the MDP is to apply civil police training and constabulary powers to combat these risks.
<P>

<a name="11218w02.html_para3">The MDP will, however, continue to provide other policing services both within MOD, and as now to external customers on repayment terms. They will also continue for the foreseeable future to provide a source of trained police manpower to deploy overseas, where required, in support of foreign policy objectives, as currently in Kosovo.
<P>

<a name="11218w02.html_para4">Although the new articulation of the MDP's core role focuses on specific categories of crime, this does not in any sense preclude the involvement of its officers in dealing with other types of offences on the Defence Estate, where it makes sense for them to do so.
<P>

<a name="11218w02.html_para5">We have also concluded that the MDP should remain an Agency within the MOD, in view of the benefits of improved management and increased visibility and accountability which this has already delivered. Important work continues in Stage 2 of the QQR, including an 



<P>
<P><I>18 Dec 2001 : Column: 177W</I><P>
examination of the role of the MDP in providing policing support to MOD married quarters, the number and day-to-day employment of officers held in reserve to deal with unforeseen contingencies, and the operation of the Ministry of Defence Police Committee.
<P>

<a name="11218w02.html_para6">The QQR has underlined very clearly the vital importance of the MDP in helping to counter the risks to MOD of public disorder and armed attack. Sadly, the need for both these outputs has been highlighted recently by increased protest activity at certain Defence sites, and of course by the events of 11 September. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the officers of the force, and civilians who support them, for the crucial work they are doing during these challenging and dangerous times.

 When the scheme was announced on 7 November 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 159&#150;70W, I advised the House that it was estimated that up to 16,700 people might be eligible for the ex-gratia payment for

<P><I>18 Dec 2001 : Column: 178W</I><P>
former Far East prisoners. This figure was the best estimate available and was based on an assessment of the numbers of those who had been held captive in each of the groups covered by the scheme and of the likely number of surviving members of those groups or surviving spouses where the former prisoner had subsequently died. The data were gathered from official records and from the associations representing former Far East prisoners. The estimate made for the number of surviving civilian internees and surviving spouses of deceased internees was 3,700 based on data provided by the Association of British Civilian Internees&#151;Far East Region.

 Safety at the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE), Aldermaston is paramount, and we are confident that it has not been compromised by the incident to which my hon. Friend refers. The decommissioning activities in this case related not to nuclear weapons, but to a redundant building. None the less, work was halted pending the outcome of a Ministry of Defence police investigation into allegations relating to drugs. This is now complete. No drugs were found during searches and no evidence emerged to support either further investigation or legal proceedings. AWE plc expect to resume the decommissioning shortly.

 It is a condition of structural fund programmes that grant recipients meet a proportion of their project costs, in addition to the grant provided by the European Commission. This "match funding" does not all come from the Assembly budget but can be found from a wide range of different sources, for example, local authorities, voluntary organisations, lottery funding, colleges and training organisations and other public and private sector bodies.

<a name="11218w04.html_para6">Nevertheless, the Government have allocated an additional &#163;1.4 billion to the Assembly budget over the three year spending review period from 2001&#150;04 to ensure that the Assembly has sufficient funds to provide match funding for the portion of objective 1 projects which require Assembly support. It is for the Assembly to decide how this additional funding is allocated among its programmes, but the First Minister has assured me on numerous occasions that no other Assembly budget has suffered to provide match funding for the objective 1

 British and European Community (EC) assistance in Burma is provided for a wide variety of humanitarian needs including the needs of refugees. DFID also provides funding for HIV/AIDS interventions.

This includes funding for the needs of refugees/returnees and the war-affected, including ethnic minorities in the Thailand border areas. Last year we spent &#163;0.2 million on HIV/AIDS; our commitment for this financial year is &#163;1.6 million.

Some assistance is provided to Burmese refugees in Thailand and for the protection of detainees in prison. The UK EC attribution for 2001 is 19 per cent.

 United Nations agencies, particularly the World Food Programme (WFP) and UNICEF, the Red Cross movement and NGOs continue to make good progress in transporting essential relief supplies into Afghanistan. Over the past month, WFP has delivered over 68,000 tonnes of food, exceeding its monthly target.

<P>
<a name="11218w05.html_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 It is difficult to say which countries "allow" the use of soldiers. Where non-state actors use children in armed conflict, this is usually in opposition to the Government of that country. Other countries may state that they do not use children, yet there are reports of children being used.
<P>

<a name="11218w05.html_para7">The UK provides development assistance to countries that are committed to poverty reduction and who will use our assistance effectively. The protection of children caught up in armed conflict is an important aspect of our development assistance programmes, which can include, among other things, working with Governments to improve their human rights record. DFID is contributing, over a three-year period, &#163;3 million to UNICEF to build its capacity to implement programmes which will prevent children becoming involved in, or otherwise being affected by, conflict, and &#163;3 million to the UN Secretary General's Special Representative for Children to support his work in reducing the impact of conflict on children, including the involvement of children in armed conflict. The work of these two institutions spans a wide range of countries in Africa, Asia and Europe.

 DFID's humanitarian mine action strategy is directed towards widening support for the anti-personnel land mines ban and helping developing countries to develop their own capacity to meet their Ottawa Convention obligations; supporting mines awareness and clearance programmes including, in particular, encouraging practical innovation to enhance safety and efficiency in operations; and strengthening international systems for co-ordination.

<a name="11218w06.html_para0">DFID has allocated &#163;10 million in the current financial year on humanitarian mine action. Additional resources are available for unforeseen emergency responses such as Afghanistan, for which we have committed a further &#163;2 million for mine action. DFID funding is channelled increasingly towards international organisations (core funding as well as country-specific programmes). Additionally we fund projects bilaterally through NGOs and to a limited extent commercial demining organisations. The profile of expenditure in 2001&#150;02 is expected to be:

 Entitlement to the new tax credits proposed by the Tax Credits Bill will be governed by income measured over a tax year, rather than, as with existing tax credits, by the income of a much shorter period. The new tax credits will also be more flexible and responsive to change. There is therefore no direct comparison between the way in which the existing and the new credits treat income derived from capital. The detailed definition of the income to be taken into account for the purposes of the new tax credits will be set out in regulations under clause 7(8) of the Bill which will be laid before Parliament in due course.

Since then, the House has not only invested in its catering premises, but also in the training and development of the staff and management of the Refreshment Department. The management task has increased over this period in order to maintain and improve the standard of catering provided in a larger number of outlets, while modern business management techniques have required the employment of managers with specialist skills, such as IT, training, and procurement expertise.

The UK Immigration Service held a meeting with the head of security for the French railways on 3 December to investigate the scope for speeding up the implementation of additional security measures at the Frethun freight yard, and to offer assistance and advice on those security measures.

 Every railway operator is required to have a railway safety case setting out the arrangements for its management of health and safety across the board. These are lengthy and detailed documents covering a wide range of health and safety issues including those relating to passenger rolling stock. They are available for public inspection at the relevant operators' premises.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11218w15.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Our policy in PPG3 on Housing and in Regional Planning Guidance for the South East (RPG9) is clear that applications for housing should follow a search sequence, starting with the use of previously developed land and buildings within urban areas identified by the use of housing capacity, the urban extensions, and finally new development around nodes in good public transport corridors. It is for local authorities, in their development plans, to identify sites to be allocated for housing in accordance with the guidance in PPG3 and RPG9.
<P>

<a name="11218w15.html_para1">Our policy in PPG2 on green belts continues to place a presumption against inappropriate development such as housing in the green belt. We consider that green belts in the south-east are important in preventing urban sprawl, in preventing the coalescence of settlements and in protecting the countryside. Indeed RPG9 recognises that there is no regional case for reviewing the boundaries of green belts.

 DTLR has a very wide range of policy responsibilities and therefore publishes a large number of publications. The cost of tracing and listing the total costs of each individual publication would thus be disproportionate. A list of the titles of the main publications produced through DTLR's Directorate of Communication between June 2001, when the Department was created, and November 2001 has been placed in the Libraries of the House.

<P>
<a name="11218w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Local authorities are asked, as part of their Local Transport Plans, to examine whether individual major road schemes would be suitable for PFI procurement. Based on this information, the Department has identified a number of schemes which appear to be suitable for PFI procurement. In these cases, we expect each of the local authorities to evaluate whether the scheme would demonstrate better value for money as a PFI deal. Advice and assistance is available from the Department to help local authorities carry out this evaluation. Conventional funding would not be available as an alternative source of funding for schemes that demonstrate better value for money through PFI. At present, a number of existing schemes are undergoing, and new ones have been asked to carry out, such an evaluation. Final decisions on the most appropriate procurement route will be taken when those evaluations are complete.

In concert with the Government Office, statutory advisory bodies and regional partners, the Agency will carry out such additional work as may be required to establish these schemes' feasibility.

<a name="11218w16.html_para1">On 30 September 2001 total police numbers, including secondments, in England and Wales were 127,231 an increase of 2,645 or 2.1 per cent., compared with the end of September 2000. This is the largest annual increase in police numbers since 1980&#150;81.
<P>

<a name="11218w16.html_para2">Between 30 September 2000 and 30 September 2001 the number of civilian support staff increased by 2,788, or 5.2 per cent., to 56,644.
<P>

<a name="11218w16.html_para3">In total, there were 183,875 police officers and civilian support staff compared with 180,169 in March 1997.
<P>

<a name="11218w16.html_para4">The substantial investment we are putting into the police service is delivering the improvements that we promised. We are on track to meet our target of record police numbers by April 2002 and 130,000 officers by spring 2003.
<P>

<a name="11218w16.html_para5">Following concern about the quality of data in previous police personnel statistics publications, we established a task force to review the data requirement. The report of the task force proposes a comprehensive revision to the current requirements on police personnel statistics. Following consultation with the police service we will implement the necessary changes from September 2002.

<a name="11218w17.html_para0">We are working closely with the British Council, which is designated as our cultural arm overseas. The council has developed a programme called "Open Minds", with proposals to build mutual understanding between young people of different cultures. These include school links and other youth exchanges, and networking between young professionals, future leaders and journalists. The project will focus initially on ten countries with large Muslim populations (Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Palestinian Territories, Saudi Arabia and Turkey). It will also involve Muslim communities in the UK.

 Such acts are covered by the definition of terrorism in Part One of the Terrorism Act 2000. Following the attacks of September 11 we decided to take stock and review our laws to see where they might need further strengthening. The Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Bill contains proportionate and targeted measures which will ensure and safeguard our way of life against those who would take our freedom away. The Bill takes account of the threat from those helping to organise, fund or facilitate global terrorist acts, including the structures and systems needed by those prepared to undertake suicide attacks.

 The assisted prison visits scheme for England and Wales exists to help prisoners maintain contact with their close family. To qualify for assistance the visitor must be in receipt of a low income or one of a number of benefits as set out in the rules of the scheme. Visitors who meet the qualifying criteria are eligible for assistance without regard to the nationality of the prisoner whom they wish to visit. The scheme provides financial assistance to meet the cost of visiting prisoners who are held in prisons in England and Wales but there are reciprocal arrangements in place with the prison services in Scotland, Northern Ireland, and the Channel Islands.
<P>

<a name="11218w17.html_para7">The opening budget for the assisted prison visits scheme for 2001&#150;02 is &#163;2.6 million.

 "Making Punishments Work", the report of a review of the sentencing framework (and known as the Halliday Report), was published on 5 July. One of the key recommendations in the report is that prison sentences of 12 months or more for 'dangerous' (violent and sex) offenders should be subject to special provisions which provide for discretionary release, subject to risk assessment, from the halfway point until the end of the sentence, coupled with the possibility of extended supervision.

With the creation of a national service on 1 April 2001 there is greater need for consistency in service delivery and the opportunity to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of probation services through benefiting from economies of scale.

 <i>[holding answer 10 December 2001]:</i> All prisons must provide a core curriculum of basic skills, life and social skills and information technology skills. The main thrust of education in prisons is to provide opportunities for offenders to attain a range of nationally recognised qualifications up to level 2, which will enhance their employability on release. We are encouraging the integration of basic skills across prison regimes in areas such as physical education, kitchens, vocational training (VT) workshops and arts and crafts classes. Provision is also made for those with higher levels of ability, for example through distance learning.
<P>

<a name="11218w20.html_para0">Prisoners are employed in a range of work-related activities which include: industry workshops supplying goods and services for the Prison Service and outside commercial contractors and catering, cleaning, works and garden parties providing services within each establishment. Industries and training workshops offer prisoners opportunities to learn job skills and to achieve nationally recognised qualifications, such as NVQs (National Vocational Qualifications) and construction awards. VT courses cover a wide range of learning areas such as, catering, industrial cleaning, construction skills, motor mechanics, engineering, hairdressing, and manufacturing.

 Blantyre House only accepts prisoners with a minimum length of four years, and all its prisoners are therefore classified as long-term. This was also the case in 1999 and 2000.
<P>

<a name="11218w20.html_para3">It may be, however, that the hon. Member is interested in any change in periods prisoners have left to serve when coming to Blantyre House. To maximise the numbers of prisoners who can benefit from the resettlement opportunities available at Blantyre House, the establishment is now accepting prisoners with a minimum of two years left to serve, which is shorter than was formerly the case. In order to maintain a balance in the population, however, the number of life sentence prisoners held there is being increased. Historical data on the lengths of sentence remaining to prisoners at Blantyre House are not available.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11218w21.html_spnew2"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Reoffending rates are not normally measured as they rely on the self-reporting of offending by offenders. Such an approach can lead to questions over the reliability of data based on individuals' recollection and willingness to impart their offending behaviour to an official source.
<P>

<a name="11218w21.html_para1">Reconviction rates for all prisoners are published annually in Prison Statistics England and Wales, copies of which are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="11218w21.html_para2">It is not appropriate, as a matter of routine, to publish reconviction rates by establishment. This is because the data source which enables prison reconviction rates to be measured only identifies the establishment from which an offender is finally discharged; a prisoner may have spent the majority of their time in custody in other establishments. The number of offenders finally discharged from individual establishments can be so small that any results produced would not be statistically robust.

<P>
<a name="11218w21.html_spnew3"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Government are committed to tackling child pornography on the internet. We are determined to ensure that there are effective measures to combat this exploitation of children. In January 2001 we raised the maximum penalties for taking, making, distributing or showing indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs of children to 10 years (from three years), and the maximum penalty for simple possession of such material to five years (from six months).
<P>

<a name="11218w21.html_para3">We have made substantial investment in law enforcement to enhance the capability of the police to investigate serious and organised crime committed via computers or computer networks, such as the internet. In April, the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit was established, within the National Crime Squad, to investigate or support the investigation of such serious criminal activity, including the production and distribution of child pornography.

<P>

<a name="11218w21.html_para5">We support the work of the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which was set up in 1996 by internet service providers to enable members of the public, via a hotline, to report child pornography and other potentially illegal material in a newsgroup or website. If the material is considered illegal, the foundation passes details to the United Kingdom police to initiate action against the originators and asks British internet service providers (ISPs) to deny access to the sites concerned. If the originators are abroad, the foundation passes the report to the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) who liaise with the enforcement agencies of the countries concerned. Since it was established, the IWF has asked United Kingdom internet service providers to remove nearly 30,000 illegal items from the internet.

<a name="11218w21.html_para6">Internationally, the Government actively support efforts within the European Union, and more widely, to combat child pornography on the internet.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will give <i>(a)</i> the reasons for the projected change in net provision of money for police and crime reduction in 2001&#150;02, <i>(b)</i> details of those areas of action which have received less funding than was provided for at the commencement of financial year 2001&#150;02 and <i>(c)</i> examples of measures which are funded under Request for Resources 1-A.

 <i>[holding answer 10 December 2001]:</i> The projected change in net provision of &#163;23,746,000 for policing and crime reduction in 2001&#150;02 arises from:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the transfer of provision to other parts of the Home Office and to other government departments that administer policing, crime reduction and anti-drugs initiatives on behalf of the Home Office's Policing and Crime Reduction Group;
<P>

the uptake of End Year Flexibility in respect of the Crime Reduction Programme and the Confiscated Assets Fund;
<P>

the transfer from the Cabinet Office to the Home Office in June 2001 of responsibility for the UK Anti-Drugs Co-ordination Unit; and
<P>

a transfer of provision from the Prison Service in support of police scientific development work.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="11218w21.html_para11">The projected change in net provision for policing and crime reduction does not represent a reduction of available funding for any particular initiative, but rather a transfer of provision to areas undertaking these initiatives.

<a name="11218w21.html_para12">Request for Resources 1-A is intended to meet the cost of delivering a wide range of policing, crime reduction and anti-drugs initiatives. Examples include:

 Like any organisation, the civil service benefits from people coming in at all levels. Since the beginning of 1999 well over half of the vacancies at permanent secretary level have gone to open competition and a number of external appointments have been made.
<P>

<a name="11218w22.html_para0">It takes an outstanding individual to come in at the very top of any organisation without previous experience of that sector. There is, however, an increased use of open competition at other levels in the senior civil service, which should broaden the future field of permanent secretary candidates. Last year 202 SCS posts were advertised, and almost two-thirds were won by candidates from outside the civil service.

 Many of the UK's controls on the export of military and dual use items are derived from international commitments that apply equally to competitors from the EU and the US as they do to British companies.
<P>

<a name="11218w24.html_para7">We have no evidence to suggest that British manufacturers face any more difficulties in obtaining export licences than their EU or American competitors. The provisions of the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports applies equally to all EU member states. In addition I would refer my hon.

 In order to assist the Export Control Organisation to process an application for an individual export licence as quickly as possible, exporters are advised to submit at the outset a completed application form together with all relevant supporting documentation at the earliest opportunity before a contract has been signed.

 It is important to recognise that Enron's current situation was not caused by any problems in the UK electricity market, but by the collapse of its US parent company. The wholesale electricity market coped well with the circumstances surrounding Enron's administration. The new electricity trading arrangements have provisions within them to deal with companies going into administration. It is difficult to identify the precise impact of any one event within the wholesale markets. There were however no significant increases in the level or volatility of prices over the past four weeks. Liquidity, particularly on the power exchanges, did however increase as market participants sought to offset any potential counterparty risk exposure.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11218w25.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The most recent ONS data shows that in 2000, UK productivity on both a "per worker" and "per hour worked" basis was lower than in France, Germany and the US. However, since 1997, the productivity gap on both a per worker and per hour basis has closed slightly with France and Germany. The gap with the US has remained broadly the same on a per hour basis, but has widened on the per worker measure. This is largely the result of the exceptional growth experienced by the US during the second half of the 1990s. The productivity data is available from the December 2001 ONS publication "Economic Trends", available from the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="11218w25.html_para3">The Government's aim is to close the productivity gap through policies to encourage enterprise, innovation, investment, competition and the acquisition of skills. The policies have been designed to correct long-standing problems and so we should not expect to see results immediately. However, the slight narrowing of the productivity gap with our European competitors is encouraging.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health when he will bring forward the draft Bill for reform of the Mental Health Act 1983.  [22957]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11218w26.html_spnew8"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 We published the White Paper "Reforming the Mental Health Act" in December 2000. The White Paper made clear our intention to reform mental health legislation and bring it into line with the contemporary patterns of care and treatment including the changes and new investment set out in the NHS Plan, and to improve the provisions for high risk offenders, including those who are dangerous and severely personality disordered.
<P>

<a name="11218w26.html_para2">This is a high priority for the Government. New legislation will be introduced as soon as Parliamentary time allows.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11218w26.html_spnew9"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="11218w26.html_para3">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) has a duty to secure the provision of proper facilities for the education and training of 16 to 19-year-olds including those who may have missed out on education due to prolonged illness.
<P>

<a name="11218w26.html_para4">The Connexions Service also provides integrated information, advice, guidance and personal development opportunities for all young people aged 13 to 19 in England, including giving more in depth support to those who are at greatest risk of not making a successful transition to adulthood.




<P>
<P><I>18 Dec 2001 : Column: 275W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11218w26.html_para5">In addition, the DfES published in November this year, new statutory guidance "Access to Education for children and young people with Medical needs" which sets out minimum national standards for the education of children who are unable to attend school because of medical needs. The guidance advises that all agencies should try to enable a pupil to continue any course being taken on entry to hospital or while ill or injured at home. Local education authorities (LEAs) also have the power to provide suitable education otherwise than at school for young people over compulsory school age but under the age of 19. A local education authority (LEA) should normally arrange continuing education for young people over compulsory school age but under 18 where he or she is a "year behind" if they need to study for a further year to complete an examination course.
<P>

<a name="11218w26.html_para6">From April 2002, local LSCs will allocate resources to LEAs for provision delivered in school sixth forms and LEA maintained 16&#150;19 institutions. I expect this to ensure a genuinely coherent approach to post-16 provision.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) when she issued guidelines on the proximity of landfill sites to housing; and if they are retroactive;  [22659]
<P>
<UL>(2) if she has powers to require the closure or containment of a landfill site which is closer to housing than the guidelines require; what discussions she has had with the European Commission about changes to those guidelines; and if the proposed EU Directive would be retroactive.  [22660]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11218w27.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) Order 1995 requires a local planning authority to consult the Environment Agency before granting planning permission for development within 250 metres of land which is or has, at any time in the 30 years before the relevant planning application, been used for the deposit of refuse or waste. Guidance to the Agency in Waste Management Paper 27 on Landfill Gas published in 1991 contains guidelines on the proximity of new housing developments to landfill sites. These guidelines do not arise from European legislation and we have had no discussions with the European Commission about changes to the guidance.




<P>

<a name="11218w27.html_para0">In addition, under section 42 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, the Environment Agency must take the steps needed to ensure that:

<P>

<a name="11218w27.html_para1">Following implementation of the Landfill Directive, the Environment Agency will be required to exercise its functions under the Directive in order to prevent, or reduce as far as possible, negative effects from the landfilling of waste on the environment and any resulting risk to human health during the whole life cycle of the site. The Directive also requires local planning authorities to take into consideration the distance from the site boundary when considering the location of a new landfill site. This requirement has applied to all new landfill sites from 16 July 2001 but is not applied retrospectively to existing landfill sites.
<P>

<a name="11218w27.html_para2">The Environment Agency can suspend, vary or revoke a waste management licence or, in future, the permit issued under the terms of the Landfill Directive, where it appears the continuation of activities would cause pollution of the environment or harm to human health or where the conditions of the permit or licence are breached.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what is the legal basis for the current closure of livestock markets; and when that legal basis has to be reviewed.  [19739]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11218w27.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 December 2001]:</i> The Foot-and-Mouth Disease Declaratory (Controlled Area) (England and Wales) (No.3) Order 2001, as amended, was made under section 17 of the Animal Health Act 1981 and declares the whole of England and Wales to be an infected area to which the provisions of Part IV of the Foot-and-Mouth Disease Order 1983 as amended apply (a controlled area). Part IV imposes certain restrictions on the area, including the provisions of article 35 which prohibit the use of premises for a fair, market, show or other gathering of animals.
<P>

<a name="11218w27.html_para3">When the chief veterinary officer is of the opinion that England and Wales is no longer infected with foot and mouth disease, consideration will be given to revoking the Declaratory Order. Once this order is revoked, the restrictions in article 35 on the holding of livestock markets will no longer apply. There are other powers available to Ministers under the Animal Health Act 1981 to regulate markets even in the absence of an FMD controlled area. However, the Government are minded to permit the resumption of cattle and some sheep markets in the new year, provided no further cases of FMD come to light. The Government are in close consultation with representatives of auctioneers and farmers abut the biosecurity rules to apply when markets resume.

<a name="11218w27.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Department will continue to seek to improve the energy efficiency of domestic appliances, including white goods, through a combination of policy measures including product information (energy labels), minimum standards and the promotion of best practice.
<P>

<a name="11218w27.html_para4">These policies will continue to be taken forward by the Market Transformation Programme (MTP), jointly sponsored by the Department and the Department of Trade and Industry, which aims to encourage products that do less harm to the environment, using less energy, water and other resources. The MTP will continue to have a strong focus on improving the delivered energy performance of domestic and non-domestic products, especially energy consuming appliances, equipment and components. This will include all major domestic energy consuming appliances (heating, cold, cooking and wet appliances, consumer electronics and lighting) as well as traded goods in the commercial sector.
<P>

<a name="11218w27.html_para5">The Department will also continue to work closely with stakeholders and other member states to conclude a review of Council Directive 92/75/EEC on the indication by labelling and standard product information of the consumption of energy and other resources by household appliances; to reach agreement on a Framework Directive for Minimum Energy Efficiency Requirements for End-Use Equipment; to develop voluntary measures where appropriate; and to support the work of the Energy Saving Trust in promoting more efficient products.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11218w27.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Sayeed: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what progress the Government have made to date in improving the energy efficiency standards of white goods.  [22599]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11218w27.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government have made some good progress in improving the energy efficiency of household appliances, including white goods, in recent years. This has been achieved through a combination of policy measures including product information (energy labels), minimum standards, industry agreements and the promotion of best practice. The Market Transformation Programme (MTP), jointly sponsored by my Department and the DTI, works closely with business and other stakeholders to produce the analysis supporting these measures and suggesting future strategies for action at UK and EU level.
<P>

<a name="11218w27.html_para6">As an example of progress in the energy efficiency of white goods, the combination of energy labelling since 1995 and minimum standards from 1999 has helped to bring about the situation where new efficient fridge- freezers now use only half the electricity of existing older appliances.
<P>

<a name="11218w27.html_para7">While in general the unit energy consumption of white goods has been decreasing for a number of years, overall energy savings have tended to be offset by increasing numbers of appliances in use as the number of households and demand for new services such as digital electronics, in the UK have increased.

<P>
<a name="11218w27.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government's Market Transformation Programme, jointly sponsored by the Department and the DTI, has been working over the last three years to reach consensus on the potential to reduce the energy consumption of a range of products and appliances. The programme addresses 27 key product types so far, representing about 75 per cent. of UK electricity consumption. From that on-going research and consultative process, the current indications are that the energy used by domestic electrical appliances left in standby mode accounts for about 7 TWh, which is equivalent to about 6 per cent. of total electricity consumption in the domestic sector.

<P>
<UL>(2) for what reasons there have been delays in subsidy payments to farmers by the Rural Payments Agency.  [22614]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11218w27.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 December 2001]:</i> Most IACS (integrated administration and control system) schemes are subject to regulatory payment windows determining the earliest and latest dates for payment to be made. Progress in processing claims for individual schemes varies from year to year and is influenced in particular by the workloads faced by the offices handling the claims and by the extent of any regulatory changes. This year claim processing on all schemes has been affected by the diversion of staff to foot and mouth disease duties and by industrial action. In addition livestock claims have had to be cross-checked with FMD slaughter records and bovine scheme claim processing has been delayed because new computer software had to be developed to reflect regulatory changes.
<P>

<a name="11218w27.html_para8">The percentage of IACS subsidy claims sent for payment within the first three weeks of the opening of the payment window in 2000 and 2001 was as shown in the table.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11218w28.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Todd: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many responses she has had to the consultation on the proposed 



<P>
<P><I>18 Dec 2001 : Column: 279W</I><P>
regulations concerning environmental impact assessments on uncultivated land; what research she has commissioned on how other EU member states implement these regulations; and if she will make a statement.  [22460]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11218w28.html_spnew0"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The Government gave a commitment in the Rural White Paper in November 2000 to consult on the implementation of the uncultivated land provisions of the EIA Directive. Two public consultation exercises have been carried out this year; the first in May on the options for implementation elicited 42 responses; the second in September, with detailed proposals, received 32 responses.
<P>

<a name="11218w28.html_para0">It has not been necessary to formally commission a report on how other EU member states have implemented the regulations, as the Commission has shown a willingness to take any member state to the European Court of Justice should they fail to implement the Directive properly or correctly. Information is also available through agricultural attach&#233;s.
<P>

<a name="11218w28.html_para1">The Environmental Impact Assessment (Uncultivated Land and Semi-natural Areas) (England) Regulations 2001 (S.I. No. 3966), come into force on 1 February 2002. They will require any project to bring uncultivated land and semi-natural areas into intensive agricultural use to be assessed for the likelihood of significant environmental effects. Only where there is a likelihood of significant effects will an environmental statement be required. In case where a project raises environmental concerns, officials will be as helpful as possible to farmers and will seek to agree a way forward which takes account of business needs as well as environmental factors.
<P>

<a name="11218w28.html_para2">Guidelines are to be introduced which explain further the types of land that can be regarded as uncultivated, and an indicative list of the types of projects on that land which will be subject to the regulations. These guidelines will also explain how the scheme is to be administered. The Government are looking for a collaborative approach with farmers, land owners and environmentalists so that the regime can protect the most environmentally significant land without bearing disproportionately heavily on the farming industry.

<P>
<a name="11218w28.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Wray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what financial support there is for farmers who grow organic crops; and if she will make a statement on organic farming.  [22864]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11218w28.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Support for organic farmers in England is provided in the main through the Organic Farming Scheme, which offers payments to farmer over a period of five years totalling from &#163;50 to &#163;450 per hectare according to land type. Supplementary payments totalling &#163;600 per beneficiary are made towards the cost of training. The budget for this year's payments is &#163;18 million, rising to &#163;20 million in the next financial year.
<P>

<a name="11218w28.html_para3">Direct payments to organic farmers in other regions of the UK are a matter for the devolved Administrations. Organic farmers are also entitled to other payments under the common agricultural policy in the same way as their conventional counterparts.




<P>
<P><I>18 Dec 2001 : Column: 280W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11218w28.html_para4">In addition, the Department's Research and Development programme includes a large component dealing with research on organic farming. And there is a programme of free, on-farm advice to prospective organic farmers.
<P>

<a name="11218w28.html_para5">We wish organic farming to succeed and to this end have already committed &#163;140 million under the England Rural Development Programme which should triple the organic farming area by 2006. To build on this, we intend to product a strategy for the future direction of organic farming when we have the report of the Commission on the Future of Farming and Food, taking account of any recommendations made by the Commission for this sector. The strategy will assess potential growth both for UK production and for the organic market, and will need to take account of the large variation between different products.

<P>

<a name="11218w28.html_para10">The average total debt for Metropolitan districts is about &#163;368 million and for Shire districts is about &#163;14 million.
<P>

<a name="11218w28.html_wqn6"><B> Malcolm Bruce: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, pursuant to her answer to the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), 27 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 859&#150;60W, on the Rural White Paper, what examples of good practice in rural policing the Government recommend should be followed.  [20035]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11218w28.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 December 2001]:</i> I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="11218w28.html_para12">The operational deployment of officers is a matter for individual chief officers of police, but we do know that police forces are tackling rural crime in innovative ways. The additional &#163;30 million per year for rural police forces is to assist them in this, to enable them to increase both the visibility of the police in rural communities and the public's access to them.
<P>

<a name="11218w28.html_para13">In addition, we set out our proposals for increasing the police presence in the community, including through development of the extended police in the White Paper "Policing a new century", published on 5 December. We believe these proposals will be of particular importance to rural communities.
<P>

<a name="11218w28.html_para14">Examples of existing good practice include: mobile police stations, established within specific communities, such as a local village, shopping centre or housing estate; establishment of a permanent local 'blue light' police presence&#151;whether by reopening small police stations on a part-time basis, or by sharing accommodation with other emergency services, or community centres, libraries, village halls or schools; the use of rural community beat officers to patrol clusters of villages or neighbourhoods to build strong relationships with the local community; dedicated parish or neighbourhood special constables; and intelligence-led patrols; focusing on local crime hot-spots, to provide a visible presence to deter criminals and troublemakers.

 The level of support available to students in 2002&#150;03 will be 2.4 per cent. higher than for 2001&#150;02, in line with forecast price increases. I am today placing a Memorandum in the Library giving details of the new loan, grant and fee rates for 2002&#150;03. These rates will be incorporated in the Education (Student Support) Regulations, which cover support for eligible students under the current arrangements, and in the Education (Mandatory Awards) Regulations and Education (Student Loans) Amendment Regulations, which cover the small number of students who are still eligible for support under the previous arrangements. These regulations will all be laid before Parliament in due course.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11218w29.html_spnew1"><B> Margaret Hodge </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 December 2001]:</i> The following table shows for 1996&#150;97 and 2000&#150;01 the assessed parental contributions for dependant students normally resident in England and Wales at illustrative levels of income. The maximum assessed contribution will depend on the level of support available to the student. This will depend on whether the student is living in the parental home or, if living away from home, if they live in London or elsewhere. In addition it will depend on whether they are entitled to any of the additional allowances. For illustrative purposes the table shows the assessed contributions for a single student eligible for the basic rate of support for students living away from home outside London.
<P>

<a name="11218w29.html_para0">In 2001&#150;02 there were a number of changes to the calculation of assessed contribution including a significant rise in the lower income threshold. The table therefore includes the assessed contributions for this year also.

 <i>[holding answer 19 November 2001]:</i> Total FEFC cost of administration (taken from the FEFC published accounts) was &#163;23.3 million in 1998&#150;99 and &#163;25.5 million in 1999&#150;2000. Final FEFC accounts for 2000&#150;01 are not yet available.

<P>

<a name="11218w29.html_para3">Also, we estimate that in total TECs spent in the order of &#163;240-&#163;250 million on administration of the activities that have now passed to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC).
<P>

<a name="11218w29.html_para4">As well as the activities previously carried out by the FEFC and TECs, the LSC has also taken on additional activities such as greater involvement and intervention at local level to raise Basic Skills, and managing a 9 per cent. real terms increase in the overall programme budget allocated to post-16 education and training compared to plans for 2000&#150;01. It takes on further responsibilities in 2002&#150;03 such as the funding of school VI forms and local decisions about the allocation of funds on key youth and adult learning programmes.
<P>

<a name="11218w29.html_para5">In the light of these responsibilities, and the different VAT regime to which the LSC is subject compared to TECs, the Secretary of State has agreed a revised LSC administration budget of &#163;213 million in 2001&#150;02 and &#163;218 million in 2002&#150;03.
<P>

<a name="11218w29.html_para6">This is significantly lower than the &#163;270-&#163;280 million estimated in total to have been spent by its predecessors, and delivers the commitment given to Parliament during the passage of the Learning and Skills Act that there would be administrative savings of at least &#163;50 million compared to previous arrangements.

<a name="11218w30.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Hodge </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 November 2001]:</i> All 47 local Learning and Skills Councils include representatives with relevant experience from the school sector. In total, there are three teachers (0.4 per cent.) and 17 head teachers (2.4 per cent.&#151;this figure includes one headteacher who has just retired from the profession but is still on the council) represented on local Learning and Skills Councils (LSC) and one head teacher represented on the LSC's Young Peoples Advisory Committee. In total 2.8 per cent. of members are teachers or head teachers. However 20 per cent. of all LSC members have an interest in and particular experience of school education either as school governors (14 per cent.), LEA officials (four per cent.) or members (one per cent.). Also eight local Executive Directors (1 per cent.) have either previous LEA or headteacher experience.
<P>

<a name="11218w30.html_para0">Almost all LLSCs have other local authority representatives (often at council leader or chair of education level).
<P>

<a name="11218w30.html_para1">There are also 45 FE heads and three FE lecturers who are local council members.
<P>

<a name="11218w30.html_para2">In April 2002, the LSC assumes responsibility for school sixth form funding, and in recognition of this we will encourage the LSC to appoint further representatives from the school sector as and when council vacancies arise.

 The set up figure for the Learning and Skills Council is 4,757 posts. At the end of November, it employed 4,575 people. This figure equates to 4,444 full time equivalents and gives a profile of 93.4 per cent. of posts filled.

<a name="11218w30.html_para4">The total projected spend by LSC on staff costs in 2001&#150;02, included in the above figure, is &#163;138 million.

<a name="11218w30.html_wqn4"><B> Paul Holmes: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills on what date her Department received the LSC request for an increase in its administration budget.  [23929]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11218w30.html_spnew4"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Officials from the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) have been in contact with officials from the Department for Education and Skills for many months, to discuss the LSC's running costs.
<P>

<a name="11218w30.html_para6">The original administration budget for the LSC was set a couple of years ago, based on the then best estimates of the costs of the previous arrangements. The LSC became operational in April 2001 and inherited the majority of its costs from its predecessors (in particular Training and Enterprise Councils, and the Further Education Funding Council). It was always going to be the case that the actual running costs of the LSC would not be clear until it was up and running.
<P>

<a name="11218w30.html_para7">We now have more up-to-date and accurate estimates of the administration costs of the previous arrangements, which are significantly higher than the earlier estimates. We announced a &#163;25 million increase in the LSC's administration budget on 10 December, which delivers the commitment given to Parliament of at least &#163;50 million savings compared to the previous arrangements.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many teachers are receiving threshold pay; and how many are expected to be eligible in 2002&#150;03.  [19353]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11218w31.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 About 195,000 teachers in England were assessed as meeting the threshold standards in the first (2000) round, which entitles them to be paid on the upper pay scale while they are employed as a classroom teacher in the maintained sector. Applications for the second round of the threshold (November 2001) have not yet been assessed.
<P>

<a name="11218w31.html_para0">We estimate that about 250,000 teachers in England were eligible to apply for threshold assessment in 2000 and that about 20,000 teachers will become newly eligible to apply for threshold assessment in September 2002.

 As part of the review of local government funding we have set up two working groups, with local government and schools partners, to develop proposals for a new LEA and school funding system.

 We are the first Government to introduce a non-statutory framework for Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) that provides the opportunities for pupils to receive the health support and advice they need to live confident, healthy and independent lives. Through PSHE, schools deliver a range of programmes that include, for example, drug, alcohol, tobacco and sex and relationship education. Schools receive Standards Fund money directly to support these programmes.

We also run an online forum for small businesses that offers direct access to my Department for all small businesses; the forum is at www.business.dfes.gov.uk.

<a name="11218w32.html_para0">The figures include recurrent and capital Standards Fund grants. The Standards Fund includes Government grant and local authority contributions, which have both been included in the calculations. The amounts for 2000&#150;01 will not reflect the full level of expenditure as not all local authorities have yet submitted outturn expenditure details, once they have done so the allocated figure and the expenditure figure will move closer together. In addition, &#163;144 million of Devolved Formula Capital funding for schools was allocated to schools late in the financial year, which meant most schools decided to carry expenditure over into 2002&#150;03. We have reallocated the capital budget underspend in 2001&#150;02 to accelerate spend on improving the condition of school buildings.

 <i>[holding answer 13 December 2001]:</i> My Department does not collate any data regarding spending on education in other countries. Information regarding the proportion of total expenditure on education and higher education met by both private and public funding in other countries is available in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) publication, "Education at a Glance", 2001 Edition (Chapter B3&#151;Charts B3.1, B3.2, Table B3.1). A copy of this publication is to be found in the House of Commons Library (POLIS Accession Number: 944669349). No figures are published in the UK on public and private shares of expenditure on student support in these countries.

 <i>[holding answer 17 December 2001]:</i> On Friday 23 November the ILA website experienced heavy traffic, with 22,481 successful hits. As a result access may have been difficult at any time. From 5.00 pm on 23 November work was carried out to enable the website to be closed at 6.30 pm. During this process access to the system was restricted.

 As part of the workshop on 25 July the specific details of the new learning provider agreement were discussed and providers were asked to comment on what additional guidance they felt would help them comply with the principles of the agreement. We also advised providers of our intent to introduce a learner leaflet to help individuals make a more informed choice about the learning they undertook.
<P>

<a name="11218w33.html_para1">An initial draft of new learning provider guidance incorporating, where possible, suggestions made by providers at these workshops was produced on 5 October. The final draft of this document was put on hold due to the early closure of the ILA programme. The learner leaflet was completed and from the end of August was issued to all individuals who opened an ILA.

<a name="11218w33.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Government have set authorities in England a target in delegating percentages of the local schools budget (LSB) to schools. In 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02, the Government's target for delegating the LSB to schools was 80 per cent. and 85 per cent. respectively; the average delegation actually achieved by LEAs was 84.2 per cent. and 86.5 per cent. Although there was no national target set in 1999&#150;2000, the average delegation rate actually achieved by LEAs in England was 82.4 per cent. Next year, 2002&#150;03, the national delegation target is 87 per cent. We expect authorities to reach this target, prior to the proposed introduction of the new local authority funding system in 2003&#150;04 when we will be moving towards the publication of separate schools and LEA budgets.

 In England we are consulting on a new special grant to help schools fund the cost of performance points, including points on the upper pay scale. The grant&#151;worth &#163;250 million over the next two financial years&#151;will be allocated to local education authorities using a formula that takes account of the number of teachers on the upper pay scale. Local authorities will be expected to allocate the money to schools in the same way. Schools will be free to decide how much to invest in performance points, taking account of all the resources available to them including special grant.

 In accordance with the Government's policy of conducting quinquennial reviews of all non-departmental public bodies, my Department is today beginning a review of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA). Following Cabinet Office guidelines, the terms of reference for the first stage of the review will be:
<P>

<a name="11218w34.html_para1">to review the role and functions of QCA as outlined in its remit letter, the efficiency and effectiveness with which they have been carried out and how these functions contribute to the delivery of wider DfES and Government objectives;
to consider the likely need for these functions in the future and whether there is a need for any reduction or expansion in the functions undertaken by QCA;
to consider what QCA's customers and other interested parties think about its role, performance and responsiveness to their needs;
to consider whether continued NDPB status is the best way of delivering these functions or whether some, or all, of the functions could be delivered more efficiently and effectively within an alternative organisational framework, including by another private, public or voluntary body or otherwise within Government; and
<P>

<a name="11218w34.html_para2">to consider the powers, remit, objectives and status of QCA and the membership and role of the Board.
<P>

<a name="11218w34.html_para3">We should welcome comments on those matters to be covered by the review from all those with an interest in the work of QCA. Comments, which may be made public unless respondents specifically request otherwise, should be sent by 28 February 2002 to:
