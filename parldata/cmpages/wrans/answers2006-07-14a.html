it will have a positive impact on the peace building process. The
Colombian government announced on 18 April the completion of the formal

Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Lord
Triesman of Tottenham, raised the issue of engaging with civil society
with Colombian Defence Minister-designate Juan Manuel Santos when they
met on 5 July with Colombian Foreign Minister Carolina Barco in the
fringes of the EU/Latin America and the Caribbean summit on 12 May. In
April, our embassy staff in Bogota met with the Vice President of the
National Union of Hospital and Health Workers and with the Human Rights
Director of the Central Union of Workers in May. We also regularly meet
British and Colombian trade unionists and other civil society groups,
in the UK and Colombia, to hear their views and discuss how the
Government can best support them. My noble Friend Lord Triesman met a
British trade union delegation on 6 March to discuss their recent visit
to Colombia and hear their concerns about human rights. In February, we
also funded a working visit to the UK by eight senior Colombian trade
unionists to demonstrate our support to civil society in Colombia and
the important role it has to play in helping find
solutions.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06071458000084">Departmental

tackle abuses of those rights throughout the world, is in place,

Organisation (ILO), the UN specialised agency responsible for
developing, promoting and monitoring labour standards. The ILO&#146;s

NHS Cancer Plan, published in 2000, stated that we would extend
invitations for breast screening to women aged 65 to 70 and introduce
two-view mammography at all screening rounds. Thanks to the efforts of
the staff in the screening programme, these targets have now been
achieved in all local breast screening units. The expansion is already
showing an effect, with nearly 12,000 cancers diagnosed by the
programme in 2004-05, an increase of 40 per cent. on 2001 when the
expansion
began.</p><p><a name="06071458001553">However, the
changes together represent a 40 per cent. increase in the workload of
the programme. We are aware that this has had an impact on some

taking steps to bring all screening intervals back to three
years.</p><p><a name="06071458001554">The

of contracts rejected and to expand service
provision.</p><p><a name="06071458001591">The recent
reforms are designed to support PCTs in improving access to services in
a number of ways. First, the resources now devolved to PCTs represent
a&#163;400 million increase in investment compared with
2003-04. Second, when a dentist chooses to stop providing national
health service services locally, the

is spent on commissioning new services from other dentists to replace
lost capacity. Third, the new contractual arrangements are based on the
expert clinical guidelines produced by the National Institute for
Health and Clinical excellence. These recommend that dentists recall
patients at intervals of between three and 24 months depending on their
oral health needs. In our view, this is likely to mean that many
patients with good oral health who have traditionally attended at
typically six-monthly intervals will not need to attend as frequently
as they have done in the past. This will free up additional capacity
and enable dentists to treat a greater range of
patients.</p><p><a name="06071458001592"><b><a name="06071458003343">Mr.

concept of registration no longer forms part of the remuneration

monitoring the number of patients covered by national health service
dental services, but the transition to the new arrangements has meant
that it will be some months before the new measure is

Secretary of State for Health what factors account for the difference
between the forecast national expenditure on the National Programme for
Information Technology, as stated in paragraph <i> (a)</i> on page 25 of
the National Audit Office Report the National Programme for IT in the
NHS, HC1173, published on 16 June 2006, and the figure given by her

Flint:</b> The figure given to the Health
Select Committee as the value of the core national procurement
programme contracts placed in 2003 and 2004 was &#163;6.2 billion.
This figure has not increased since the contracts were let, and is
confirmed in the National Audit Office (NAO) report. The forecast
national expenditure figure of &#163;9.2 billion referred to by the
NAO includes this sum, but in addition includes other elements, some of
which are costs not directly associated with the national programme for
information
technology.</p><p><a name="06071458001990">The other
elements are made up of &#163;382 million for contracts and projects
added to the original scope of the programme; &#163;239 million for
additional services beyond the scope of the core national contracts;
and a further &#163;337 million pro rata extrapolation of the cost of
the core contracts to cover the period to 2013 to 2014. This last
figure is a purely notional sum to allow total expenditure to be
projected over 10 years, and needed because two contracts (choose and
book, and the new national broadband network&#151;N3) reach the end
of their life before the end of 10 years, requiring further provision
to take forward the services.</p><p><a name="06071458001991">In addition, a further
&#163;1.9 billion represents centrally managed expenditure on
centrally managed projects and services within the national programme,
and the cost of running the Department's NHS Connecting for Health
agency. Some of these costs relate to agency responsibilities other
than the national programme, including all of the information
technology service delivered by the former NHS Information Authority
(NHSIA). The NHSIA spent some &#163;219 million in its last year. NHS
Connecting for Health will be spending relatively less centrally and
doing much more over 10
years.</p><p><a name="06071458001992">We
expect that actual expenditure will be very significantly less than
&#163;1.9 billion since, once the initial stages of system
development and deployment are complete, the role and size of the
agency will reduce
accordingly.</p><p><a name="06071458001993">All of

Flint:</b> No such decision has been taken. The strategy for
the national programme for information technology requires the
integration of multiple systems and applications operating together to
functional and technical interoperability standards. Interoperability
standards are shared with existing suppliers who are required to
demonstrate
compliance.</p><p><a name="06071458001996">We have
always said that general practitioners would have the option of an
alternative system to that supplied by the local service providers
(LSP), providing the system meets the necessary compliance standards.
Under the proposed &#145;GP systems of choice&#146; initiative, and
subject to the same compliance requirements, general practitioners
(GPs) will in future have an even wider choice of systems from approved
existing GP system providers as an alternative to that provided by
their LSP.</p><p><a name="06071458001997">The aim of
the new initiative is to enable GPs to either choose to upgrade their
current clinical system, or migrate to an LSP-provided system in order
to continue on the path to integration with the NHS Care Records
Service. Providing GPs with this wider range of choice, and a clear
roadmap to future integration with the NHS Care Records Service has
been widely welcomed by the
profession.</p><p><a name="06071458001998">The
commercial and organisational models chosen for delivering the national
programme have produced exceptional value for the taxpayer by avoiding
multiple procurements and significantly reducing unit costs for
applications and systems. The National Audit Office report acknowledges
an independent evaluation that confirms that &#163;4.5 billion has
been saved by central rather than local procurement and also

funding several studies aimed at identifying the prevalence of
individual food allergies, including nut allergy. These projects should
also give clues as to the possible reasons for the apparent rise in

out over the course of the year an agreed number of units of dental

therefore no longer has to submit data on the individual items of

Gardiner:</b> The need to maintain, and
improve where necessary, the health and vitality of trees is integral
to the Government&#146;s approach to sustainable forest management.
We have set this out in the UK Forestry Standard and its supporting
literature, which contain many specific measures for protecting
woodland and improving tree health. All woodland management by the
Forestry Commission is consistent with this standard and we expect
private woodland owners that receive grant aid from the Forestry
Commission to also meet the standard. The Government have encouraged
the development of the voluntary UK Woodland Assurance Standard that
provides an independent verification of compliance with good practice
and measures to ensure the continuing good health of woodland. We shall
continue to ensure compliance with the UK Forest Standard in those
woods managed by the Forestry Commission and encourage it in the
private sector.</p><p><a name="06071458002584">We
will also continue to improve, through research, our knowledge of
factors affecting tree health and we shall maintain a vigilant guard
against the establishment of non-native pests and
diseases.</p><p><a name="06071458002585">The prospect
of changing climate is a threat to the continuing good health of
long-lived organisms like trees. We have a number of long-standing
research programmes the results of which are being fed into adaptation
policies for woodland. plans are well advanced for instituting more
such research. Mindful of the changing potential risks from non-native
pests, we have taken the steps necessary to make the UK a
&#145;protected zone&#146; within Europe for a number of pests and
diseases, most recently for a fungal blight of sweet chestnut. We are
planning to implement measures, in accordance with an EU Commission
decision which will apply throughout the community, against an insect
pest of the same species, the oriental chestnut gall
wasp.</p><p><a name="06071458002586">In
improving tree health, we are conscious that the use of chemicals
against pests and noxious weeds may itself be a less than perfect
solution. Therefore in 2004 we published guidance on reducing pesticide
use in forestry and support moves to find other means of control.
Examples are the recent deployment of a predatory beetle to control
