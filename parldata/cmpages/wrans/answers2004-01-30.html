<P>
<P>
<a name="40130w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Secretary of State has no plans to visit Birmingham airport in the near future. Ministers regularly visit all parts of the country, including the West Midlands and I visited Birmingham airport last summer.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what action the UK is taking to comply with EU Quick Start programme objectives in transport projects.  [151497]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40130w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The EU Quick Start programme comprises key projects, within existing Community programmes, that meet a set of criteria including readiness to start by end 2006 and impact on economic growth. There are two UK transport projects included in the programme. We are reviewing whether there are others that meet the criteria for inclusion.

<P>
<a name="40130w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Allan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what cost savings have been made in his Department since the introduction of the Information Technology Procurement Centre of Excellence; and how these were calculated.  [151045]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40130w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 A Centre of Excellence was established within the Department for Transport in June 2003 to integrate the essential functions which underpin the successful delivery of all types of acquisition-based programmes and projects. As cost benefits will not accrue until improvements start to take effect, it is too early to measure cost savings. All Centres of Excellence are currently developing future plans and as part of this process measurement of savings will be defined.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will list the public inquiries into applications made under the Transport and Works Act 1992 held in each of the last five years; how soon after the inquiry the inspector made his report to him in each case; and how long it took him to reach a decision in each case.

 The following table shows the information requested in respect of applications made under the Transport and Works Act 1992 (TWA), with the exception of a few applications that will fall to be decided by the First Secretary of State, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry or the National Assembly for Wales. The variable periods for reaching a decision can partly be attributed to differences in the complexity of the cases. But in many cases this has been for reasons outside our control, such as the need to obtain more information from an applicant or the inspector, or the need for a related consent from another Department.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40130w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The risk of a particular organism escaping from a laboratory is not directly affected by its infectivity. Defra classifies animal pathogens in different groups for containment purposes, according to the risk they pose to the health of farmed livestock and poultry. The assessment of risk takes account of a number of factors, including the infectivity of the pathogen and the nature and seriousness of the disease it causes. The higher the level of risk posed by an animal pathogen, the higher the level of laboratory containment required for its safe handling. The following animal pathogens are currently classified as Defra group 2 pathogens:

 Under Article 9 of the Rabies (Importation of Dogs, Cats and other Mammals) Order 1974, which covers Great Britain, quarantine premises are required to be authorised by a licence issued by a Defra Minister.
<P>

<a name="40130w02.html_para0">In order to maintain their authorised status, quarantine premises for companion animals are required to be inspected by the State Veterinary Service. If the inspections are satisfactory, the premises are issued with an authorisation licence by Defra. The target for inspections is quarterly visits, that is four visits annually, two of which are pre-notified and two which are unannounced. Pre-notified visits are usually arranged two to four weeks in advance. There are normally, at least, three visits a year to authorised premises, and for some, there may be more than four annually.

<a name="40130w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Following the report in September 1998 by the Advisory Group on Quarantine (the Kennedy Report), "Quarantine and Rabies: A Reappraisal", the Government undertook a radical reform of the UK quarantine regulations. On 28 February 2000, the Pet Travel Scheme (PETS) was introduced, which allows cats and dogs from specified

countries, and which comply with certain conditions, to enter the UK without going into quarantine. The Scheme has now been operating successfully for four years. We have no plans for any further major changes to quarantine law.
<P>

<a name="40130w02.html_para3">However, between December 2000 and March 2001, MAFF undertook a consultation exercise on proposals for legislation to update the law governing quarantine premises. Agreement of new EU rules on the movement of pet animals will also require some changes to the national quarantine legislation. We therefore expect to review the detailed rules on quarantine during 2004.

 The Department is responsible for authorising quarantine premises for dogs, cats and all other rabies susceptible animals. These include zoos, research establishments and quarantine kennels and catteries.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40130w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Routine, or incidental, sightings are rarely suitable for estimating animal abundance, although such sightings can be useful for establishing the presence of a species in a locality&#151;especially in the case of rare animals.
<P>

<a name="40130w02.html_para6">Badger sightings have been used to estimate densities, but only as part of planned surveys following a scientifically robust methodology (Heydon, M. J., Reynolds, J. C. and Short, M. J. (2000); <i>Journal of Zoology</i>; 251, 253&#150;264). Furthermore, sighting-based surveys of badgers are carried out at night rather than during daylight hours, as this is when badgers are most likely to be observed above ground.
<P>

<a name="40130w02.html_para7">By far the most widely used method for estimating badger density is based on signs rather than sightings of badgers. During the national surveys carried out during the 1980s and 1990s badger numbers were extrapolated from the density of setts (taking account of their size and level of activity) and the average size of badger social groups.

 I do not plan to seek permission from the European Commission to pay compensation for consequential losses due the cessation of culling in reactive areas of the randomised badger culling trial.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what level of TB in badgers is sufficient for the disease to be considered as epidemic in the population; and how in this context the term endemic differs from the term epidemic.  [150508]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40130w02.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Bovine TB is endemic in badgers in the UK; i.e. it is constantly present in badgers within this geographical area. An epidemic occurs where the occurrence of an infection increases clearly beyond normal expectancy. There is currently no evidence to suggest that levels of bovine TB in badgers have increased substantially in recent years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40130w02.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Factors that increase the susceptibility of cattle to disease following exposure to <i>M. bovis</i> include general health, nutritional status and immunological capability.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many badger setts that have been sticked have subsequently been found to have been recolonised; and what action is taken in the event that such recolonisation is observed.  [150544]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40130w02.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Sticking of a Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT) sett is a method used to indicate whether the sett is in active use. The team carrying out the post-cull survey will note the sign and use this information to inform their report. It may be difficult to identify whether a sett has been recolonised or whether there are badgers remaining from the original colony which were not captured during the trapping operation.
<P>

<a name="40130w02.html_para14">RBCT design requires culling operations to be repeated annually in Proactive areas to maintain badger numbers as low as possible. During such operations, traps are placed on active setts on premises consenting to culling and additionally at locations indicating the movement of badgers from any adjoining non-consent land.

<P>
<a name="40130w02.html_spnew24"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Krebs report advised that in reactive areas all badgers, including lactating sows, should be removed from all social groups with territories including the breakdown farm. In the proactive areas there should be total removal of complete badger social groups from localised areas at high risk of breakdown, before herd breakdowns occurred. It also recommended that the use of stop-snaring should be explored as an alternative to trapping, and that an expert group should be established to oversee the detailed experimental design and operation of the trial.
<P>

<a name="40130w02.html_para19">The group which was established, the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB, considered the possible use of snaring.

<a name="40130w03.html_para5">Defra has funded a survey of wildlife in the south-west of England by the Central Science Laboratory. The first phase established whether <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> (<i>M. bovis&#151;</i>the causative organism for bovine tuberculosis) was present in a number of wild mammal species, including deer. <i>M. bovis</i> has been confirmed in five of the six established wild and feral species of deer in GB. The second phase of the survey (due to end March 2004) is to estimate prevalence of <i>M. bovis</i> in those species where it is found, by carrying out a more targeted and extensive sampling.

<P>
<UL>(2) how many farms were affected during the Krebs trials by a partial clearance of the badger population which was subsequently stopped; how many partial clearances were undertaken after a delayed start; and how the incomplete clearances affected <i>(a)</i> the conduct of the trials and <i>(b)</i> their outcome.  [150575]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40130w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 There has been a level of illegal activity and interference with the operation of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial which is certainly undesirable and could be considered significant. The cost of replacing stolen, lost and damaged traps is estimated to be approximately &#163;400,000. Other costs relate chiefly to the loss of staff time, which cannot be provided at proportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="40130w03.html_para6">At the time of cessation of the reactive strategy one premises was in the process of being trapped and the operation was concluded with only half the number of trapping nights completed. A number of other operations have been stopped early for a variety of reasons, for example bad weather or activity by animal activists. If an operation is not able to start as scheduled, it is extended to ensure that the standard period of two weeks' trapping is maintained.
<P>

<a name="40130w03.html_para7">Standard Operating Procedures take account of the possibility of interruption to trapping operations. Although interference varied across trial areas, the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB found that the increase in the incidence of TB in reactive culling areas when compared with control (no culling) areas was consistent across all triplets.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the percentage increase was in the number of TB reactor herds reported in 2003 compared with 2002; and what factors are believed to be responsible for this increase.  [150576]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40130w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 In 2003, up to the end of November, there had been 2,880 new cattle herd TB incidents in Great Britain. In the same period in 2002, there were 3,035 new TB herd incidents reported.
<P>

<a name="40130w03.html_para8">It is difficult to draw comparison between 2002 and 2003, because the testing effort in 2002 was very much increased to clear the backlog of testing after the foot and mouth disease outbreak in 2001.

<P>

<a name="40130w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Determination of the minimum infectious dose of <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> in cattle is part of the TB pathogenesis research programme. Early indications are that the minimum infectious dose for cattle via the respiratory tract is relatively small; the lowest infectious dose recorded so far is 70 colony forming units CFU, when introduced by the intracheal route or 9,600 CPU by the intranasal route.
<P>

<a name="40130w03.html_para9">Relatively high levels of <i>M. bovis</i> in the urine of badgers with renal TB have been identified by culture methods, so far bacterial loads of up to 300,000 colony forming units per millilitre of urine have been measured.
<P>

<a name="40130w03.html_para10">It is known that the survival of <i>M. bovis</i> on pasture is widely variable depending on climate and pasture type. In hot dry weather survival may be a day or less whereas in cool damp weather <i>M. bovis</i> may survive for several months and in some circumstances in excess of six months.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40130w03.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to her answer of 8 December 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 216W, on bovine TB, what other rapid assay techniques are <i>(a)</i> available and <i>(b)</i> in the course of development which have the potential to speed up the detection of <i>M. bovis</i> in suspected TB lesions submitted for laboratory analysis.  [150597]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40130w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Several liquid culture methods are commercially available for the isolation of bacteria of the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> complex from clinical samples. These methods are mainly used in medical laboratories for the diagnosis of TB in humans. Although the liquid culture media can significantly shorten culture times, they have not been optimised for isolation of <i>M. bovis</i>. The growth requirements of <i>M. bovis</i> and <i>M. tuberculosis</i> are slightly different and culture media that work for one mycobacterium may not work so well for the other.
<P>

<a name="40130w03.html_para11">The Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) is evaluating the <i>M. bovis</i> recovery rates and ease of use of two of these liquid culture media compared with the traditional method used for cattle and badger tissues. Preliminary findings suggest that one of these systems might be adequate for rapid isolation of <i>M. bovis</i> from badger tissues. Additional experiments are under way to validate these findings and see if they can be extrapolated to cattle samples.
<P>

<a name="40130w03.html_para12">The VLA is also collaborating with the Imperial College in the design and optimisation of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the detection of <i>M. bovis</i> DMA in suspect TB lesions.
<P>

<a name="40130w03.html_para13">Although this is a priority area of research for Defra, it is unlikely that any of the new laboratory tests being evaluated can totally replace the traditional culture technique.

 The Department has been providing financial assistance to English local authorities for contaminated land capital projects for many years. Since the introduction in April 2000 of the contaminated land regime in Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, a total of &#163;33.083 million capital funding has been provided, covering the financial years 2000&#150;01 to 2002&#150;03. Final figures are not yet available for 2003&#150;04, but approvals to local authorities total a further &#163;10.8 million, although the final outturn may be lower.

 The price for an internationally traded species of fish, such as haddock, will tend to be influenced by the world price.
<P>

<a name="40130w04.html_para4">The processing industry imports substantial quantities of fish to meet its needs and over time can adjust its import needs for species such as haddock, if the price and quality of domestic landings are considered appropriate.
<P>

<a name="40130w04.html_para5">However, in the short term, prices for fish landed at UK ports may be affected by a number of factors, including the quality and size of fish, and whether exceptionally heavy or light concentrations of fish, are landed at particular times.

It was also agreed that no sales would take place before May 2004 at the earliest to provide time for baseline data to be gathered on population and poaching levels and for information to be obtained on whether potential importing countries can effectively regulate their domestic ivory markets. The aim of these controls is to prevent any illegal ivory from entering into legal markets and to discourage an upsurge in poaching.
<P>

 Survey techniques employed on this project to assess abundance of wildlife include spotlight surveys of hedgehogs, foxes, rabbits and brown hares and count surveys of ground-nesting birds. Radiotelemetry is also used to study the behaviour and mortality of hedgehogs, and video and still camera surveillance to monitor predation of birds' nests. Fox diet has been investigated through the collection of faecal samples. Detailed protocols of these techniques will be documented in scientific publications which are currently in preparation.

 The Rural Payments Agency is responsible for the administration of the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) Appeal Procedure in England. The procedure was introduced on 1 April 2002 to provide IACS scheme applicants with easy access to an independent review of decisions on their claims. Those appellants who are unsuccessful at the first stage of the procedure have the opportunity to progress to a second stage. The percentage of successful appeals under each stage of the appeal procedure is as follows:

<i>[holding answer 26 January 2004]:</i> The Thames Gateway Development area is currently protected from flooding to a standard in excess of 1:1000 (or a 0.01 per cent. chance).
<P>

<a name="40130w05.html_para1">This standard will be maintained until 2030 by the existing defences. The Environment Agency is now starting to consider the longer-term strategy for the whole Thames estuary beyond this date including mitigation for the impacts of climate change.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the rationale is behind the cut-off point of &#163;14,200 for household income above which a family in receipt of working tax credit will not qualify for assistance through the Warm Front scheme.  [150436]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40130w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 This cut-off point was established to help target those on low incomes and therefore more likely to be in fuel poverty.
<P>

<a name="40130w05.html_para2">The eligibility criteria for Warm Front are broadly in line with the low income priority group for the Energy Efficiency Commitment (EEC). In a consultation document on the changes to the tax credit system affecting the priority group for the EEC, published by the Department in December 2002, a cut-off point of around &#163;14,000 was proposed for child tax credit and working tax credit.
<P>

<a name="40130w05.html_para3">Following that consultation and consideration of the responses received, a cut-off point of &#163;14,200 was set for the EEC. To maintain consistency, this was also introduced to the eligibility criteria for Warm Front.

 In recent years the total number of available residential places has increased from 332 (2001) to 409 (January 2004). Plans for a further increase in the number of residential places and a continuing programme of replacements for unsuitable and substandard facilities are currently being developed but have not yet been fully finalised. It is expected that these further plans will involve an increase of around 50 in the number of residential places available over the next three years.

 Extensive negotiations over several months did not result in an agreed pay deal for the 11 departments of the Northern Ireland Administration this year. Management Side presented an offer worth 3.67 per cent. on 5 November. As this could not be agreed, and Trade Union Side declined to negotiate within the 3.67 per cent. envelope, we took the decision to proceed to pay the award and communicated this to staff and Trade Union Side on 27 November . I have made clear to Trade Union Side that the 3.67 per cent. deal is the maximum that can be paid. We are however open to exploring other reasonable means of resolving the dispute. A further meeting of the Central Whitley Council between Trade Union and Management Sides has been arranged.

 The responsibility for calculating charges for private patients, or for patients who are not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom, lies with Health and Social Services Trusts, each of which maintains its own list of charges. Residents of countries within the European Economic Area (EEA) are entitled to free treatment if they are taken ill while visiting Northern Ireland. Patients may also be referred to Northern Ireland for treatment of a specific condition under formal contractual arrangements between individual hospitals or health boards. With the exception of cross-border workers, visitors from the Republic of Ireland have the same entitlement to treatment as those from any other EEA country.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the relationship between the criminal guardianship powers in the Mental Health Act 1983 and the community treatment orders proposed in the Draft Mental Health Bill 2002.  [149798]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40130w08.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Like the guardianship order, the proposed power&#151;that the courts would make a mental health order without requiring residence in hospital&#151; could enable people who needed treatment subject to sanction to receive it without resort to detention in hospital. Unlike the guardianship order, the proposed power would enable the admission of the person to hospital for compulsory treatment in the event of that becoming necessary for his own health or safety or that of others.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40130w08.html_wqn4"><B> Mrs. Helen Clark: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the target groups of people with mental health problems who will be helped by the introduction of community treatment orders.  [149800]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40130w08.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The provisions in the draft Mental Health Bill for formal powers to be used in the community are based on the principle of least restriction. When treating someone for mental disorder under formal powers, the restriction of their liberty should be the minimum necessary, taking into account all their circumstances and the need to protect themselves or others. The conditions setting out the circumstances in which formal powers may be used, must always be satisfied, whether treatment is to be provided in hospital or in the community. The power to impose requirements on patients in the community will however, in some circumstances, avoid patients having to go to hospital if appropriate alternative arrangements can be made.
<P>

<a name="40130w08.html_para4">The most important group that it is intended that these powers would be used for is people who have a history of admission to hospital, improvement and discharge, followed by relapse (known as "revolving door" patients). Currently there may be no alternative to renewed admission to hospital. Where someone is well known to services it may not be necessary for them to be reassessed and treated in hospital. Treatment under a regime of conditions and requirements in the community may be more appropriate and avoid the distress of repeated unplanned admissions to hospital.
<P>

<a name="40130w08.html_para5">These powers would also be available for those whose mental condition has improved while being treated under compulsion in hospital and for whom formal treatment in the community would provide a supportive transition, helping to prevent patients relapsing on discharge from hospital. There may also be other individual cases in which treatment under compulsion in the community would be more appropriate.
<P>

<a name="40130w08.html_para6">Formal treatment in the community will also be an option for the Court to consider for mentally disordered offenders. It is intended that convicted offenders who require treatment for mental disorder could benefit if the court is satisfied that they do not need to be detained and clinicians confirm that treatment appropriate for the individual is available in the community.




<P>
<P><I>30 Jan 2004 : Column 561W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40130w08.html_para7">The decision that compulsory treatment in the community is appropriate should always be based on the careful assessment of what is the most suitable way to treat and care for individual patients, taking into account all the circumstances of each individual case.

 The responsibility to convert the transmitter network to digital lies with broadcasters.

<i>[holding answer 26 January 2004]:</i> HM Customs and Excise reorganised in April 2001, creating a Law Enforcement (LE) arm of approximately 7,500 officers. LE staff perform the majority of Customs operational activity at ports and airports in the UK. One of the aims of this restructuring and the subsequent LE business plan for 2003 to 2006 is to build a more intelligence-led, mobile and flexible workforce. The south region includes the south-east, south-west and central southern England.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what discussions his Department has had with representatives of the shipping industry to discuss plans to prevent workers on offshore installations from receiving the foreign earnings deduction benefit; and if he will make a statement.  [151603]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40130w10.html_spnew10"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The intention of Foreign Earnings Deduction (FED) is to encourage seafarers to work on UK ships which can be called upon in time of conflict. Some workers on offshore installations are exploiting FED to seek a tax relief that was never intended for them. As announced in the pre-Budget Report, we will be introducing amendments to the legislation to make it clear that workers on offshore installations are not entitled to this relief and officials have begun discussions with industry representatives.

<a name="40130w10.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Carmichael: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what plans he has to limit the entitlement to foreign earnings deductions for seafarers serving on ships registered in the UK or other EU countries; and what assessment his Department has made of the impact such a change would have on the UK shipping sector.  [151605]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40130w10.html_spnew11"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 In the pre-Budget Report (Cm 6042), it was announced that there would be changes in the Foreign Earnings Deduction to prevent workers on offshore installations claiming the relief. Any changes beyond this would follow consultation with the shipping industry and trade unions and be consistent with the Government's continuing support for the UK shipping industry.

 Information is not held centrally on all the pension schemes of public sector employers, which include schemes provided by public corporations and other bodies in addition to the major schemes established by statute for public service occupations. Among the major statutory schemes those for the civil service, NHS, teachers, police, fire and armed forces are unfunded and the only major public service scheme that has funds is the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS). The LGPS is supported by individual funds held at local level. The last triennial valuations of these funds for England and Wales were conducted in 2001 and showed an actuarial value of aggregate assets of &#163;85.3 billion being held against liabilities of

 HM Customs and Excise are unable to calculate VAT receipts from the construction of sports facilities. It is not possible to identify specific sources of VAT revenue from VAT returns.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on progress on the Army's proposed Dismounted Countermine Capability programme.  [149540]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40130w11.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Dismounted Countermine Capability (DCMC) programme is intended to provide dismounted personnel with an improved capability to locate and deal with anti personnel (AP) and anti tank (AT) mines. DCMC seeks to provide a solution based on the need to detect mines, mark individual mines and areas of mine contamination, neutralise individual mines, and communicate information about these actions to other forces on the battlefield.
<P>

<a name="40130w11.html_para4">DCMC gained Initial Gate approval in March 2003. In August 2003, following a competitive downselection, Thales Missile Electronics was awarded a contract to complete a Study Assessment Programme. Initial work suggests that a technological answer to the problem of detecting minimum metal and non metallic mines (modern mines made from plastics and other non metal materials) is likely to be feasible.

<a name="40130w12.html_wqn3"><B> Lady Hermon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many reservists mobilised for operational service under <i>(a)</i> Operation Telic 1 and <i>(b)</i> Operation Telic 2 under the provisions of the Reserve Forces Act 1996 have lost their jobs since returning from service; what his Department did to support them in retaining their employment rights; and if he will make a statement.  [151426]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40130w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 There is no requirement for reservists to provide the information requested to the Ministry of Defence. There is, therefore, no comprehensive record of the numbers of reservists who may have lost their civilian job. However, indications are that civilian employers have been very supportive of reservists and, of over 8,600 reservists called-out to support Op Telic, we are aware of only 14 individuals who have brought cases under the 1985 Act.
<P>

<a name="40130w12.html_para0">The Ministry of Defence provides detailed advice to demobilising reservists to ensure that they are aware of their legal right to reclaim their civilian employment. The Supporting Britain's Reservists and Employers (SaBRE) campaign team provides a help line and a website which gives additional information and advice. Also, each Reserve Forces and Cadet Association (RFCA) has an Employment Support Executive who is able to offer advice and assistance to reservists who are experiencing problems returning to their civilian employment.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40130w12.html_wqn4"><B> Lady Hermon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what provision is being made to ensure that life insurance and other financial services made available to reservists being mobilised for operational service in Iraq are of a similar standard and as affordable as those offered to reservists mobilised under Operation Telic 1; and if he will make a statement.  [151427]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40130w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The only financial service specifically for reservists which MOD facilitates is RPAX, which provide personal accident and life cover&#151;there is a similar product, PAX, for regulars. RPAX was available to reservists mobilised under Operation Telic 1, and is still available now. Information about RPAX was then and still is advised to individual reservists and units.

In June 2003, its remit was extended to integrate the essential functions which underpin the successful delivery of all types of acquisition based programmes and projects (including those concerned with procuring IT). As cost benefits for IT procurements will not accrue until improvements start to take effect, it is too early to measure cost savings. All Centres of Excellence are currently developing future plans and as part of this process methods for measuring savings are being worked out.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs whether the Government have asked the state from which they obtained intelligence on Iraq's alleged attempt to procure uranium from Africa if they may share that intelligence with <i>(a)</i> the United States Administration and <i>(b)</i> other governments.

<a name="40130w14.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Government asked the originators of the intelligence that Iraq sought the supply of uranium from Africa to discuss the issue with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The Government understand this was done shortly before the IAEA report of 7 March 2003. I am withholding further details of intelligence exchanges with allies under Exemption 1(c) of Part 2 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

 The Government have no objection to students from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) studying language and culture courses in the UK. Through our policy of engagement with DPRK, we encourage the country to increase its citizens' exposure to the outside world. Our on-going programme of educational activity with DPRK includes Foreign and Commonwealth Office-funded (FCO), UK-based English language courses for DPRK officials, and an FCO-sponsored/British Council-managed English language course for teachers and students in universities in Pyongyang. We also provide educational materials to schools and universities in DPRK.

 We regularly urge the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) authorities to allow freer and wider access to and within DPRK for western non-governmental organisations (NGOs). We also supported the resolution adopted by the 2003 UN Commission on Human Rights, which calls for free and unimpeded access for NGOs to all parts of DPRK.

 We have raised the issue of prison camps in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) with the DPRK authorities on a number of occasions, through our embassy in Pyongyang and the DPRK embassy in London.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40130w14.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 Most food aid in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) is distributed by the World Food Programme (WFP), a UN agency. We work closely with WFP and the resident aid community, and embassy staff travel frequently with WFP on their monitoring missions. We deplore restrictions placed on WFP by the DPRK authorities which limit their monitoring of food aid in many areas of DPRK, and we regularly urge the DPRK authorities to grant WFP full, unrestricted access to all parts of the country. Although the situation is not satisfactory, we welcome WFP reports of improvements in monitoring, access and food distribution systems.

However the annual rate of company insolvencies for the last 12 months remains at the Q2 level of 1.0 per cent., the lowest level since Q1 1989 and just over a third of the level reached following the recession in the early 1990s.

<i>[holding answer 13 January 2004]:</i> Civil partnership is aimed at same-sex couples who cannot obtain full legal recognition of their relationships. Opposite-sex couples can achieve this through marriage. There can be no real benefit of extending to opposite-sex couples the right to achieve legal recognition of their relationships when they already enjoy that opportunity.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40130w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 This is a matter for the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem). As part of its distribution price control review, which is presently under way, Ofgem is reviewing the standards of performance under which compensation payments are made.
<P>

<a name="40130w16.html_para5">As the next price control is not implemented until April 2005, with two winter periods before then, Ofgem has recently introduced interim arrangements for compensation in severe weather conditions. The aim of these arrangements is to ensure that the basis for compensation is clear and that customers who have valid claims are paid out quickly after the event. Under the new arrangements, for all but the most extreme events, customers who make a valid claim for compensation will be entitled to &#163;25 if they are off supply for more than 48 hours plus &#163;25 for each additional 12 hour period up to a maximum payment of &#163;200.
<P>

<a name="40130w16.html_para6">Under normal weather conditions, the Guaranteed Standards of Performance continue to apply and a payment of &#163;50 is triggered at 18 hours with &#163;25 for each additional 12 hour period.

 The current outstanding debt on Nigeria is &#163;4.494 billion (this figure includes interest and arrears.) Due to the high number of transactions involved (over 26,000 dating back 20 years or more), it would not be possible to identify all projects individually without incurring disproportionate cost.

 As indicated in the previous answer, there are and have been no safeguards inspections at UK defence nuclear facilities.

<a name="40130w17.html_para1">The first phase, which started in January 2003, provides three possible entry routes for new entrants designed to open up 30 per cent. of the UK letter market (by revenue). In phase two, from 1 April 2005, Postcomm intends to open another 30 per cent. of the mails market (by revenue) by increasing the proportion of the bulk mail market that is open to competition. We believe that this staged approach provides Royal Mail, other operators and customers with a clear end date and a simple step-by-step transition to make their plans.

<i>(a)</i> <i>UK High Technology Fund</i>
The UK High Technology fund has stimulated private sector investments of &#163;106.1 million, against a target of &#163;105 million, significantly increasing the amount of finance available for investment in technology-based businesses.
From the total fund of &#163;126.1million (which includes DTI investment of &#163;20 million), over &#163;123 million of this has, to date, been committed to nine specialist venture capital funds. These venture capital funds have in turn made investments in over 130 technology-based companies throughout the UK.
<i>(b) Quality Mark</i>
Quality Mark provides a competitive edge for accredited tradespeople by improving the information available to consumers.
<i>(c) Inside UK Enterprise</i>
In the three years to 2002, Inside UK Enterprise helped users to increase sales by around &#163;175 million and increase profit margins by around &#163;135 million.
<i>(d) Constructionline</i>
Constructionline streamlines procurement procedures and cuts costs by supplying the construction industry and its clients with a single national pre-qualification scheme.
<i>(e) Basic Technologies</i>
The first projects to be supported by this programme commenced in mid-2003. It is too early to estimate the benefits to businesses.
<i>(f) Construction Best Practice</i>
In 2002, businesses using Construction Best Practice increased profitability by &#163;56 million&#151;28 times the cost of running the scheme.
Productivity also improved with each user saving an average of 12 days and &#163;3,300. This equates to a total of &#163;8.5 million and 60,000 days saved.
It is currently estimated that in 2003, users increased their profitability by more than &#163;100 million.

<a name="40130w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 In 2001 the former Post Office Users National Council was replaced by a new Consumer Council of Postal Services, known as Postwatch. The Postwatch Council is made up of the Chairs of nine Regional Postwatch Committees and four national Council members, operating under a National Chairman. Full details of all Council members and their remuneration are set out in the Postwatch Annual Report. Currently the Northern Ireland, Scottish and Welsh committees are chaired by, respectively John Stringer, Tom Begg and Eifon Pritchard. The remuneration for the Regional Chairs is based on an average annual rate of &#163;20,500 per annum for two days per week; with some working for two and a half and some three days per week.

 Part 3 of the Employment Act 2002 set out a framework of new minimum statutory dismissal and disciplinary and grievance procedures, and also made some changes to the law on unfair dismissal and on employment particulars. The detailed operation of disciplinary and grievance procedures was left to be specified via secondary legislation. This was laid before Parliament on 20 January 2004, and is anticipated to come into force on 1 October 2004.
<P>

<a name="40130w18.html_para3">All employers, regardless of size, will normally be required to follow these minimum procedures before dismissing employees&#151;failure to do so may result in a tribunal finding the dismissal automatically unfair. In addition, in ordinary unfair dismissal cases, the employment tribunals will continue to take account of the Acas Code of Practice on Disciplinary and Grievance Procedures in deciding whether or not an employer acted reasonably in dismissing. Acas launched this month a public consultation on a revised version of their Code of Practice.

 The requested figures for absolute and relative low income are available from: "Households Below Average Income&#151;An analysis of the income distribution for 1994&#150;95 to 2001&#150;02". This analysis covers Great Britain only; no data are available for Northern Ireland.

 Pre-Budget report 2003 announced that the child element of the Child Tax Credit would increase by &#163;180 to &#163;1,625 a year, equivalent to a weekly increase 



<P>
<P><I>30 Jan 2004 : Column 600W</I><P>
of &#163;3.50. This increase will benefit 7.2 million children in 3.7 million families. As a result of this investment the Government are on track to meet or exceed its PSA target to reduce by a quarter the number of children in low income-households by 2004&#150;05 on a Before Housing Costs (BHC) basis. The target is more challenging on an After Housing Costs (AHC) basis, although the nature of the target means there are uncertainties either way.
<P>

<a name="40130w18.html_para11">Forecasting how many children will be in relative low income in future years is problematic. Any estimate is dependent on forecasting median household income growth from 2001&#150;02 (the latest available data). This itself is dependent on a number of factors, including the rate of earnings growth, demographic changes, changes in household composition and employment patterns, and changes to the tax and benefit system. Consequently, there is inherent uncertainty in any estimates produced, which is exacerbated the further into the future one attempts to model. For this reason, while our estimates allow us to provide a broad indication of progress towards the 2004&#150;05 PSA target to inform policy decisions, point estimates are not sufficiently robust to be put in the public domain.
<P>

<a name="40130w18.html_para12">Independent analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests that the increase in Child Tax Credit will enable the Government to make substantial progress on both elements of the PSA. This extra investment will also enable the Government to make progress step by step towards their goal to halve child poverty by 2010 and eradicate it by 2020.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department further to his answer of 10 December 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 497W, on the Nottinghamshire Criminal Justice Board, whether the action plans of local criminal justice boards are being sent to local hon. Members for comment.  [145048]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40130w19.html_spnew8"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 It is a matter for Local Criminal Justice Boards how they consult locally on their plans.
<P>

<a name="40130w19.html_para6">Nottinghamshire Criminal Justice Board has not sent its plan to local hon. Members for comment. However, I understand that in the spring the Board plans to hold a consultation event on the criminal justice system for local hon. Members.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many individuals due for detention in <i>(a)</i> Yarls Wood and <i>(b)</i> other specialist immigration detention centres have been imprisoned in the prison estate in the past (i) 12 months and (ii) 24 months.  [151079]<P>

<P>
<a name="40130w20.html_spnew0"><B> Beverley Hughes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 January 2004]:</i> Information on individuals detained in Prison Service establishments who were due to be detained in Immigration Removal Centres and on the number of individuals detained over a period is not available except by examination of individual case files at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="40130w20.html_para0">The latest available data on the number of persons detained solely under Immigration Act 2002 powers relate to 27 September 2003. As at that date, 190 people were recorded as being detained in Prison Service establishments.
<P>

<a name="40130w20.html_para1">The figure of 190 may include individuals who are held pending deportation after completion of custodial sentences. Although the routine use of Prison Service accommodation for immigration detainees ended at the beginning of 2002, it may be necessary to continue to hold some individuals in Prison Service accommodation for reasons of security and control. Such decisions are taken on a case-by-case basis.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the <i>(a)</i> shortest and <i>(b)</i> longest period is that an individual due for detention in a specialist immigration detention centre has spent in detention in the prison estate; and what procedures are being implemented to ensure that immigrants who have not been convicted or accused of a crime or offence are not detained in the prison estate.

 <i>[holding answer 26 January 2004]:</i> I regret it is not clear exactly what figures the hon. Member is requesting and therefore I cannot say if they are available or not.
<P>

<a name="40130w20.html_para3">The routine use of prisons to hold immigration detainees ended at the beginning of 2002. However, in ending the routine use of prisons to hold detainees, it was made clear that there would continue to be a need to hold small numbers of individual detainees in prison for reasons of security and control. That remains the case.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40130w20.html_spnew2"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 Remand fostering in England and Wales is funded by local social services departments and neither the Home Office nor the Youth Justice Board hold central information on them. However, some foster placements contribute to bail support and supervision schemes for young people which are sponsored by the Youth Justice Board.
<P>

<a name="40130w20.html_para4">The National Children's Homes (NCH) Wessex Community Remand Project is the largest example. This successful project provides remand fostering for the Wessex Youth Offending Team covering Hampshire, Portsmouth, the Isle of Wight and Southampton. Carers work with a variety of young defendants, most charged with more than two offences including violent and sexual offences and arson. The Home Office sees such schemes as important to the development of intensive community supervision for juveniles.

<P>

<a name="40130w20.html_para6">Also, admission statistics are not collated on Swedish nationals. European Economic Area (EEA) nationals are free to enter the United Kingdom without requiring leave to do so. EEA nationals are therefore not included in statistics on border control.

<a name="40130w20.html_para7">Data on passengers given leave to enter the United Kingdom are published in the Command Paper 'Control of Immigration: Statistics United Kingdom 2002' (Cm6053), obtainable from the House Library, The Stationery Office and via the Home Office website http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/hobpubs1.html
