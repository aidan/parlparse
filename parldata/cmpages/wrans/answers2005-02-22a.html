 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what representations he has made to the Government of Kazakhstan concerning <i>(a)</i> human rights and <i>(b)</i> the implementation of good governance practices.  [215768]</p>








<p><a name="st_0"><a name="50222w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 I have been asked to reply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">We continually raise, bilaterally and with our EU partners, the importance of respect for human rights and good governance in Kazakhstan. When I met the Kazakh Minister for Justice last May I raised democratic reform and human rights issues, including the death penalty and conditions in Kazakh prisons. Following the parliamentary elections in September/October 2004, the EU released a statement reflecting the concerns of the OSCE Election Observers that the elections had failed to meet international standards. The concerns were also raised by our Ambassador with the Foreign Minister in October 2004. More recently, in February, along with our EU partners we raised human rights issues at an EU-Kazakhstan sub-committee meeting. This month, we supported an EU statement in Vienna expressing concern at the new law on Extremism and the recent banning of an opposition party.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w01.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">Wherever possible we also look to work with the Kazakh authorities to improve the human rights situation and have funded projects aimed at improving the conditions in prisons, preventing torture in places of detention and encouraging the abolition of the death penalty. We have an on-going dialogue with the government of Kazakhstan on transparency issues and are working closely with NGOs on this too.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w01.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">We will continue to stress the importance of human rights and good governance with the Kazakh authorities and look for opportunities to provide suitable assistance. Kazakhstan has recently been identified as a priority country under the sustainable development strand of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office&#039;s Global Opportunities Fund. This will provide further scope for the UK Government to support rule of law, torture prevention and death penalty abolition initiatives.

make towards the running costs of each; what the total capital and refurbishment expenditure has been on those properties in each of the past five years; how much money was spent in each property on <i>(a)</i> flowers and plants, <i>(b)</i> wine and entertaining, <i>(c)</i> food, <i>(d)</i> telephone bills and <i>(e)</i> electricity and gas in 2003&#150;04; how many (i)domestic and (ii) maintenance staff are employed at each property, broken down by post; and what the total cost of staff employment at each was in 2003&#150;04.

<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50222w01.html_spnew1"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 DFID currently owns 11 domestic properties overseas, in Zimbabwe (3), Solomon Islands (1), and Malawi (7). DFID also provides approximately 450 UK-based staff posted overseas with commercially leased accommodation. DFID does not pay for flowers and plants, food, wine, or domestic staff, all of which are the responsibility of the occupier. Individuals receive a cost of living allowance, and where appropriate a gardening allowance, in respect of the additional costs incurred of living overseas, and these allowances vary depending on location.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w01.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">Official expenditure on business phone calls and utilities are met from individual delegated budgets but are not separately identifiable and this detailed information cannot be obtained without incurring disproportionate cost. Similarly, information on the individual occupancy of each of the overseas properties, and the overall cost to DFID, are not held centrally and cannot be obtained without incurring disproportionate cost.

 To ask the Secretary of State, Department for International Development what the total expenditure by his Department on <i>(a)</i> advertising and <i>(b)</i> advertising and publicity was in (i) 1996&#150;97, (ii)1997&#150;98 and (iii) 2003&#150;04; and what the estimate of cost of each will be in (A) 2004&#150;05, (B) 2005&#150;06, (C)2006&#150;07 and (D) 2007&#150;08.

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50222w01.html_spnew2"><b> Hilary Benn  </b> 
<i>[pursuant to the reply, 10 February 2005, Official Report, c. 1642W]:</i> The correct figure for expenditure on advertising for 2003&#150;04 was &#163;676,649 and the estimated figure for 2004&#150;05 is &#163;663,591.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w01.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">It was originally stated that the expenditure on advertising for 2004&#150;05, which was then believed to be higher than that for 2003&#150;04, reflected a higher number of posts being advertised in 2004&#150;05. On re-examination this is incorrect. The number of recruitment competitions for which advertisements were placed was in fact slightly more in 2003&#150;04 than the number to date in 2004&#150;05.

<a name="stpa_25">Increasing the limit to &#163;600 or &#163;1,200 per annum would potentially cost the Exchequer an extra &#163;30 million or &#163;120 million per year respectively in the long run. Doubling the limit would not necessarily double the cost because many tax-exempt savings plan customers do not save at the current maximum.

1.The drop in registrations between September 1997 and September 1998 is mostly attributable to the reduction in the re-registration period from two years to 15 months.<br>

2.The figures excludes patients treated in dental access centres who are not registered. In 2004 there were some 375,000 episodes of treatment in dental access centres.<br>

In the Durham and Chester-le-Street PCT, a local dental access scheme has been developed at a cost of &#163;65,770 from central funds. Under the scheme, 10practices, which were not previously taking on new NHS patients, have been funded to provide an agreed number of new patient contacts. From September 2004, the scheme has delivered 1,000 additional NHS appointments and expects shortly to deliver a further 300 appointments. As a result, between late September and November, all patients seeking a NHS dentist should have been able to access occasional NHS dental treatment and, in addition, some were able to register with a NHS dentist.

Notes:<br>

1.A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the data year. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

2.Data quality&#151;hospital episode statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England. The Department liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>

3.Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

4.Time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

<p><a name="st_87"><a name="50222w11.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Jamieson  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 8 February 2005]:</i> The Ml motorway is equipped with cameras for traffic and incident management purposes such as comprehensive surveillance of accidents, traffic and weather conditions. They do not measure individual vehicle speed. However, some cameras measure the average speed of the traffic for the purposes of setting automatic queue-warning signs. These cameras are not used for speed enforcement. The provision of CCTV cameras is controlled by departmental standards and they can only be used for the purposes described. Most cameras are fixed to free-standing masts installed in the motorway verge. In Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, 12 cameras (installed early in 2004) have been fitted to traffic message sign gantries.

<a name="stpa_66">On the Al just north of the end of the Ml near Wetherby, a number of traffic and incident management cameras are being provided on message sign gantries.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w11.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_67">These cameras have all been provided as part of a much larger project, thus an accurate cost of camera only provision cannot be determined. However it is estimated that the typical cost of installing a single camera on a traffic message sign gantry and making it operational is around &#163;15,000.

<p><a name="st_155"><a name="50222w19.html_spnew3"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 The information is not available in the form requested. Funding for nursery and pre-school education has been provided through a mixture of nursery education grant and education standard spending (up till 2002&#150;03) and education formula spending (from 2003&#150;04). The new education formula spending system is not directly comparable with the old education standard spending assessments at sub-block level. This is because the coverage of the sub-blocks and the amount of resources allocated within them changed significantly in 2003&#150;04. Therefore the figures are not comparable between 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04.

1997&#150;98 figures for LEAs subject to local Government reorganisation in that year have been estimated, pro-rata to their post LGR figures.<br>

Figures reflect relevant sub-blocks of education SSA/EFS settlements and include the pensions transfer to EPS for 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05<br>

Total funding shown includes nursery education grant for 1998&#150;99 to 2002&#150;03 and nursery vouchers in 1997&#150;98. Extra funding through schools standards grant and standards fund is not included as it is not possible to identify how much of these grants are spent on under fives.<br>

 Stockton South has two Sure Start local programmes (Parkfield & Victoria and Mandale, Village & Stainsby) approved by the Sure Start Unit in December 2002 supporting around 1,560 young children and their families living in the area. They deliver a wide range of child, family health and parental support services seeing on average around 17 per cent. of these children. The Parkfield and Victoria local programme has visited 100 per cent. of families with newborn babies within the first two months of their child&#039;s life.

<a name="stpa_126">Linked to these programmes are two neighbourhood nurseries delivering a total of 100 full daycare places.

 Telford and Wrekin local authority is served by two Sure Start local programmes: Sure Start Lawley Plus, which serves the communities in Lawley, Arleston and College, The Rock, Overdale and Newdale and Ketley Bank; and Sure Start Jubilee, which serves Madeley, Woodside and Cuckoo Oak. The programmes between them support over 1500 local young children and their families.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w20.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_127">Prior to the establishment of Sure Start Lawley Plus at the end of 1999, the area was identified as an isolated area with no early years infrastructure. It now has a nursery closely integrated with the local primary school and with social care and health services. It has strong links with the Carpenter Family Centre which has a parent and toddler group and training sessions. The programme also supports mothers with post-natal depression. It had meaningful contact with over 95 per cent. of the children in its catchment area in the year ending 31 March 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w20.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_128">Sure Start Jubilee was approved in early 2003. It offers a range of services including family support through home visiting, parenting support, baby massage, home safety promotion and reading and early language development and support. It has had some success in reducing smoking during pregnancy and just under 19 per cent. of the mothers in the area gave up smoking prior to or during pregnancy. It is using its &#163;1 million capital allocation towards two children&#039;s centres. One of these, Woodside children&#039;s centre will create a 64 place day nursery and family room in a 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>22 Feb 2005 : Column 542W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
building to which the PCT&#039;s health visiting team will relocate alongside the Sure Start team. The other, Sutton Hill children&#039;s centre will create 42 full day care places, training facilities and a health room. Although it was a very new programme at the time and had no dedicated building from which to deliver services, it had already had meaningful contact with some 17 per cent. of the children in its catchment area in the three months between its establishment and 31 March 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w20.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_129">In addition to these services, between April 2003 and March 2004, both programmes contacted all pregnant women in their areas to give ante-natal advice and support. They also both visited 100 per cent. of these families within two months of the baby being born. In the last annual satisfaction survey, some 92 per cent. of families who responded said they were satisfied or very satisfied with the local services for young children.

<p><a name="st_161"><a name="50222w20.html_spnew3"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 One Sure Start programme serves both the Whitmore Reans and Dunstall areas. It was approved in 2001 and supports around 870 young local children and their families. It delivers a wide range of services to support local families including family support in partnership with the Primary Care Trust (PCT); a support group for single parents; the provision of healthy eating advice to families, provision of safety equipment on a loan basis to families at a subsidised rate; a toy library; a cr&#232;che; play and stay as well as play groups; additional home visits by qualified midwife and health visitors and early assessment and referral for children with development delay.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50222w20.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_130">Since opening, this programme has helped to improve the quality of life for local families. For example it works closely with the smoking cessation programme run by the PCT and all staff have received training in ways to support parents and families who may want to give up smoking. All staff have been trained to be able to identify children with delayed language development and either apply strategies recommended by therapists or refer the families for specialist help.

<a name="50222w20.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_133">The programme has strong parental participation both on the management board, which has six parent representatives with a parent vice chair and in activities where parents act as volunteers. It has a volunteer policy which aims to match skills gaps within the programme to the skills of the parents within the catchment area. This is used as a stepping stone to further training and ultimately employment. Volunteer parents can access all the training available to the programme staff.

<p>
<a name="50222w21.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_138">These figures have been produced by combining information from the local Labour Force Survey for the last three years, to reduce the error margins around the NEET percentages. However, sample sizes are still very small due to the narrow age bands and small geographic area. The rates are volatile and care should be taken when interpreting the figures. An estimate of the confidence interval is provided, to aid with interpretation. Where fewer than 10 people who took part in the survey in a given LEA were NEET, the information has been suppressed as it would be potentially disclosive or particularly unreliable.

 Travel by Ministers&quot; makes it clear that special flights may be authorised when a scheduled service is not available, or when it is essential to travel by air, but the requirements of official or parliamentary business or security considerations or urgency preclude the journey being made by a scheduled service. In respect of overseas travel by Ministers, since 1999 the Government has published an annual list of all visits overseas undertaken by Cabinet Ministers costing &#163;500 or more during each financial year. Where RAF/private charter aircraft are used this is shown in the list. The Government has also published on an annual basis the cost of all Ministers&#039; visits overseas. Copies of the lists are available in the Libraries of the House. Information for 2004&#150;05 will be published in due course.

North and West Belfast Health and Social Services Trust considers that specialist staff are those who have particular expertise in the field of Child and Adolescent Mental Health attendant upon their professional training and ongoing professional development including accredited training. The above staff have the competencies to independently provide community-based Tier 2 services across North and West Belfast and to work within a specialist multi-disciplinary Team at Tiers 3 and 4. Tier 2 services are concerned with the provision of child and adolescent mental health services with a focus on prevention and early intervention with children and adolescents with moderate mental health needs. Tier 3 (out-patient) and Tier 4 (in-patient) provide assessment and intervention of children and adolescents with the most complex mental health issues.<br>

 I have no plans to change the Home to School Transport arrangements in Northern Ireland from this September. The average cost of provision for eligible children in 2003&#150;04 was over &#163;600 per pupil totalling over &#163;59 million. I have therefore asked the Department of Education to carry out a fundamental review of the service with a view to identifying the source of cost pressures and developing mechanisms for cost control. Thereafter, any proposed policy changes would be subject to public consultation and to rigorous equality testing. The introduction of any new arrangements would be publicised in advance.

 The Ministry of Defence is continually restructuring. Currently this is being taken forward in the context of the Delivering Security in a Changing World: Future Capabilities White Paper, published in July 2004. This set out our requirement for flexible and adaptable Armed Forces supported to carry out the most likely expeditionary operations. In order to better meet these operational requirements we are reducing force levels in certain capabilities in order to invest more in higher priority capabilities. The overall financial effect of the restructuring process will be that we are able to spend more on those capabilities able to deliver the effects we require. That will mean we are able to deploy our resources to optimum effect. Overall, the Spending Review 2004 settlement provided a 3.7 billion increase to the Defence budget. This represents the longest period of sustained real growth in defence spending for over 20 years.

 At the time of the suspension of Remote Ammunitioning Facility Tamar in 2002, &#163;15 million had been spent on works (covering design, ammunition clearance, dredging and site preparation). Subsequent cancellation and project management costs have increased expenditure to a total of &#163;25 million and this has been highlighted as a potential constructive loss in the departmental annual accounts for financial year 2003&#150;04.

<a name="stpa_253">A number of environmental assessments were carried out prior to the commencement of the RAFT project. The first in 1996, was carried out by Babtie, the Ministry of Defence&#039;s Project Manager. In 1998, the Babtie Group carried out a desktop archaeological study to review the potential effect of RAFT on existing scheduled monuments at Bullpoint. This was followed by a supplementary report on the effects of RAFT dredging on potential buried archaeological artefacts in peat deposits in the riverbed. An Ecological Study, also in 1998 and carried out by Panscape Consultancy, considered the potential impact of RAFT on the key habitats and species in Plymouth Sound and its estuaries. In addition, a Baseline Environmental Survey of Estuarine Sediment and Benthic Macrofauna, carried out by Zeneca and which supplemented the Ecological Study, assessed the potential environmental impact of dredging on surface sediments and resident worms. In 1999, an extensive hydraulic modelling study was undertaken by Hydraulics Research Wallingford, which covered the potential effects of dredging on the River Tamar (in particular on the salmon), the inter-tidal habitats of the Tamar and the salt marshes in the Upper Tamar estuary. A detailed sedimentation study was carried out of the whole tidal extent of the Tamar rather than just the local area of RAFT. The conclusions and results were overseen by an independent expert appointed by English Nature.

<a name="50222w36.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_254">In 2000, during the lifetime of the RAFT project and following award of the construction contract, a Conservation Management Plan was jointly produced with English Nature and the Environment Agency. In support of this plan, extensive mitigation measures were applied, including noise pollution monitoring of the surrounding areas and water quality monitoring in the River Tamar, during the dredging. The Environment Agency has recently confirmed that, as a result of this mitigation, there have been no permanent effects on fish stocks in the river.

 Preventing conflict is a key objective for the Ministry of Defence (MOD). It underpins the successful delivery of the defence aim, to deliver security for the people of the United Kingdom and the Overseas Territories, and to act as a force for good by strengthening international peace and stability. Consequently, much of MOD and the armed forces&#039; operational and non-operational activity, together with the associated research work and military equipment development and procurement programmes that support these activities, contribute in some way to HMG&#039;s wider conflict prevention efforts around the world. This is particularly true of the work that MOD carries out in conjunction with FCO and DFID through the separately funded Conflict Prevention Pools.

 The Ministry of Defence has no requirement to retain spend information against individual shipping lines. Also, while some bookings may be made direct with shipping lines, others are placed through agents/freight-forwarders and spend will be recorded against them and not the shipping lines used. As the MOD operates a financial regime of disaggregated budgets, bookings can be made by units throughout the United Kingdom and overseas. For these reasons the spend requested is not held centrally or in a form which could be easily extracted and without disproportionate cost. The only spend information readily available is that against P&O shipping companies for invoices submitted through the Defence Bills Agency which is shown in the table.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_210">I should stress that this is a snapshot of our plans based on the best information available. The lists of offices will inevitably change as we progress through rollout of the new, integrated service and continue to refine our plans for centralising benefit processing in Jobcentre Plus. For example, a significant number of the site closures are dependent on construction of new buildings or acquisition of new premises and these are often subject to delays and other issues. I would also expect the number of Flexible Service Delivery sites to increase significantly as we conclude local discussions with partners on arrangements.</p>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_211">We continue to review the plans for our network as the reducing headcount is impacted on all parts of the business, and we may have to reconsider the future viability of a number of sites in this context. Completing the rollout of the new service and centralising benefit processing at the same time is a challenging programme of work and I can assure you that providing customer service is at the centre of decisions we make. We will also ensure that local stakeholders are kept informed of progress and any changes to our plans.</p>
</ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_212">We are shaping the future Jobcentre Plus network in response to the changing business need. The need for face-to-face facilities for jobsearch and other aspects of our business has been superseded in many instances by new business processes and the use of information technology. For example, over the last 12months we have seen an increase of over 40 per cent. in the number of hits on our jobsearch website. Encouraging our customers to use these new channels enables us to focus on those customers who need greatest help, through the intervention of personal advisers, for example.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_213">You will see from the lists that we will retain a significant network of offices through which customers can access our services. Our current forecast is that when rollout is complete the total number of outlets from which our services can be accessed is likely to be around 1,000. On present plans, our network will be substantially complete by the Summer of next year.</p>

1.Data has been taken as at August 2004, the latest date for which the relevant carer&#039;s allowance figures are available.<br>

2.Figures are rounded to the nearest five.<br>

3.Figures for households in receipt of pension credit also in receipt of or with underlying entitlement to carer&#039;s allowance (i.e. the figures in the second column) exclude cases where the person to whom the pension credit award has been made is not the same as the person to whom the award of carers allowance has been made (i.e. where the partner of the pension credit recipient is in receipt of or with underlying entitlement to carer&#039;s allowance).<br>

4.Individual recipients may include a small number of partners under the age of 60.<br>

5.Carer&#039;s allowance is paid to people of state pension age where there is no entitlement to state pension or where state pension is paid at a lower rate than carer&#039;s allowance. If a low state pension is paid, a reduced rate of carer&#039;s allowance will be paid as a top-up.<br>

6.Carer&#039;s allowance is not paid where the weekly rate of state pension equals or exceeds the weekly rate of carer&#039;s allowance. Such cases are known as underlying entitlement&quot; cases.<br>

 We welcome the report from the NAO; it recognises that the social fund plays an important role in helping people in financial hardship and is reaching many of those in greatest need. The report found that there were &#163;3 million social fund payments made in the last financial year at a total cost of &#163;854 million and acknowledges that the Department recovers the majority of social fund debt. Many of the recommendations in the report are already being taken forward.
