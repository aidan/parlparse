 The EU payment window for the single payment scheme (SPS) runs from 1 December to 30 June and the Rural Payment Agency (RPA) aims to ensure that payments are made as early as possible within that payment window. However in line with detailed EU regulations, before making each payment, RPA is required to perform detailed validity checks including carrying out cross-checks against all other SPS applicants to ensure that there are no dual claims. The timing of each payment will therefore vary according to the complexity of the claim with simple claims processed and paid quickly and more complex claims taking longer.</p>

 I have no current plans to introduce sea angling-only areas. However, DEFRA is funding research to explore whether closing specific coastal areas to commercial fishing with nets and lines (alongside limits on angling such as catch and release requirements or bag limits) would improve sea bass survival. The project is also assessing whether such restricted-catch areas could provide benefits to anglers. Emerging results from this project will be published shortly and discussed with stakeholders, although the final report is not due until 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="81021w0001.htm_para10"><a name="08102136000175">In inland waters, the vast majority of fishing is by angling and in many lakes and rivers the only form of fishing allowed is angling. The Environment Agency has responsibility for regulating salmon and freshwater fisheries in England and Wales. It has a statutory duty to maintain, improve and develop these fisheries. The Environment Agency's approach is to seek to ensure first that target stocks of fish are maintained at satisfactory levels and that fishing is undertaken in a sustainable way. In some places only angling is permitted. Where different fishing methods are allowed, the level of fishing is regulated by controls on effort and the restrictions on exploitation are balanced between the types of fishing allowed, for example, between nets and rods.</p>

 The most recent assessment on &#147;in-utero&#148; infection in calves was done following the discovery of Bluetongue Serotype 8 (BTV8) infected calves in Northern Ireland in February 2007 which were born to recently imported cattle (&#147;Menzies et al 2008, Vet record, 163, 203-209&#148;) and the finding that some English cows infected in 2007 also transmitted the virus to their calves. These findings prompted new legislation to be brought forward at EU level on the export of pregnant cattle and resulted in the UK testing all calves born to imported cattle for evidence of BTV 8 infection. This is still subject to further investigation and research at the Institute for Animal Health in Pirbright, and elsewhere in mainland Europe.</p>

 A range of proposals for altering the table valuation system were presented to DEFRA by members of the Cattle Compensation Advisory Group (a stakeholder group set up in spring 2006 to monitor the roll-out of the table valuation system). We identified problems with these proposals&#151;which focused on premium and organic cattle&#151;and so did not take them forward.</p>

DEFRA have lodged an appeal against the court's finding that it is unlawful to use table valuations for &#145;high value&#146; stock. Any changes to the table valuation system will need to take into account the judgment of the Appeals Court, which is due to hear this case in March next year.</p>

 We are continuously monitoring the impacts of pre-movement testing and key statistics are published on the DEFRA website each month. Evidence to date is encouraging and shows that new TB incidents are being prevented by pre-movement tests as well as Government-funded routine surveillance tests. The policy is also picking up infection earlier in high risk herds. Latest published data show that pre-movement testing led to the detection of 834 reactors in 458 herds in England between March 2006 and the end of July 2008.</p>

Any vessel trying to re-register out of Scotland will therefore be treated in the same way as before the moratorium was announced. No formal assessments were carried out, as given our legal position, the moratorium cannot prevent the movement in licenses and FQA units.</p>

 In December 2007, the European Commission issued an open call for tenders in relation to Studies and pilot projects for carrying out the Common Fisheries Policy (Call No. FISH/2007/07). These studies included one which was intended to form the basis of the long-planned EU Discard Atlas. The study, which was lot four of the call for tenders, was required to provide a review of the current knowledge about discards in EU fisheries, and a feasibility study on a fisheries information system for these.

 The Government make a significant contribution to protecting fish against disease. Legislation was introduced in April 2007 which brought in for the first time domestic controls of koi herpesvirus (KHV) and made it a notifiable disease in the UK. We will be bringing in shortly broad legislation to implement Council Directive 2006/88 and to provide further protective measures against spread of disease. These notably will include the requirement for fish farms and importers of ornamental fish to be authorised and for angling clubs to be registered. Prior to KHV disease becoming notifiable in April 2007, outbreak numbers were not officially recorded and so are unreliable. Since April 2007 there have been 22 confirmed outbreaks, 10 cases in 2007 and 12 new outbreaks confirmed so far this year.</p>

 Novel alien species continue to appear in UK waters. Pathways include entry via commercial shipping (e.g. hull fouling, ballast water transfers) and the pet trade (aquarium and garden pond plants and animals released by the general public to open waters). The complexity of the aquatic environment means the impact of non-native fish introductions on our freshwater fisheries is often difficult to detect.</p>

Introduced non-native fish can have direct effects on native species, for example by predation, competition (for space and food) hybridisation (inter-breeding), or can upset the natural balance that operates between native species. Non-native species can also introduce and spread novel diseases and parasites to which our native species may have little or no resistance.</p>

Under the ILFA Orders it is illegal to keep or release any of the listed species in any water (including tanks and ponds) without a licence. Any person wishing to hold, keep or release any of the listed species is required to be in possession of a licence before obtaining the fish. Some introductions of species already present in England and Wales are allowed, where there is demonstrable benefits and there is no risk to the wider environment. But, there is a presumption against approving consents for the introduction of new non-native populations.</p>

 DEFRA and the devolved administrations operate regimes which aim to prevent the entry of certain non-native species into the UK, such as inspections under plant health legislation. In the course of their work DEFRA&#146;s plant health and seeds inspectors and their equivalents in the devolved administrations inspect consignments of plants and plant products to ensure that they are free of non-native plant pests and diseases of concern.</p>

It is important therefore to prevent their introduction into the wild. In May, jointly with the Scottish Executive and Welsh Assembly Government, my Department published the Invasive Non-Native Species Framework Strategy for Great Britain. This sets out our proposals for more effective and better co-ordinated action to tackle invasive non-native species. Prevention of the introduction of such species into the wild is one of the key themes to which other parts of the strategy will also contribute. In addition to existing measures such as legislative controls under wildlife and fisheries legislation we plan to implement a structured programme of work on raising awareness and education both generally and in a targeted way, developing effective risk analysis capacity, implementing online reporting with improved surveillance and monitoring, and to develop capacity to respond quickly to future threats.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence for what reasons the 20 per cent. threshold for war disablement pensions was set at that level. [222530]</p>

 Since World War 1, the nature and amount of awards under the War Pension Scheme has depended on the assessed degree of disablement due to service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_426"><a name="81021w0007.htm_para6"><a name="08102136000947">Assessment of the degree of disablement is by comparing the condition of the individual as disabled by service with the condition of a normal healthy person of the same age and sex. From this time a distinction has always been drawn between assessments of under 20 per cent. and those of 20 per cent. or more. The reason why the threshold was originally set at 20 per cent. is not known.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_427"><a name="81021w0007.htm_para7"><a name="08102136000948">Before 1 April 1962, awards to &#147;other ranks&#148; with an assessment of less than 20 per cent. were in the form of a weekly allowance for a prescribed period followed in some cases by a terminal lump sum gratuity. For officers only gratuities were paid. A change in 1962 aligned the treatment of all members of the armed forces, so that since that date, all awards for disablement assessed at less than 20 per cent. have been in the form of a one off gratuity, regardless of rank.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_428"><a name="81021w0007.htm_para8"><a name="08102136000949">Assessments of 20 per cent. or more have always given rise to a continuing pension for all ranks. As part of a periodic review of the War Pension Scheme one of the options under consideration is to raise the 20 per cent. assessment level at which a pension becomes payable for new claims.</p>

 Availability for mobilisation is dependant on a number of factors, in particular which section of the Reserve Forces Act 1996 is being used to make a Call-Out Order. Therefore, while reservists may be unavailable for mobilisation under one section of the Act, they will be available under another. This effectively means that nearly all reservists remain available for mobilisation.</p>

The GPEN will comprise: a secure database for e-crime prosecution specialists from across the world; a channel for exchanging advice, queries and best practice between prosecutors; and host e-crime material including training packages and legal guidance that will constitute a virtual college for those who need access to training, and support.

 The associated cost to the Department for International Development (DFID) in contributing to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Humanitarian Pooled Fund is difficult to accurately disaggregate from the overall administrative costs of DFID in DRC. Administration costs for DFID DRC in 2007-08 are 4.4 per cent., with expenditure of just over &#163;72 million. However, now the Pooled Fund is up and running, the costs of our oversight, monitoring and evaluation and lobbying for humanitarian reforms will be much less than 4.4 per cent. of our &#163;30 million contribution to the pooled fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_450"><a name="81021w0009.htm_para6"><a name="08102136001097">The DRC Humanitarian Pooled Fund (about &#163;58 million in 2007) is managed by the United Nations (UN), with technical humanitarian expertise provided by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and financial management provided by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). The management costs associated with the pooled fund are:</p>

</ul><a name="81021w0009.htm_brev3"><a name="08102136001384"><ul><p class="tabletext">UNDP charges 1 per cent. for the overall financial management of the fund, (about &#163;580,000 in 2007).</p>
</ul><a name="81021w0009.htm_brev4"><a name="08102136001385"><ul><p class="tabletext">UNDP also manages grants made directly to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and charges a further 5 per cent. to administer these (about &#163;1 million in 2007).</p>

 In line with the commitments made during the passage of the Consumer Credit Act 2006, the Government will review their policy on interest rate caps after the Act has been in force for three years with regard to all available evidence.

<i> [holding answer 6 October 2008]:</i> The communications sector is subject to regulation under the Communications Act 2003 which implements the overarching European legislation in this area. That European legislation was amended in 2007 by a regulation to address the problem of the high cost of voice roaming while abroad. The regulation acknowledged that the costs of SMS and data roaming would need to be reviewed with a view to further regulation if the relevant charges did not decline through market forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_466"><a name="81021w0010.htm_para15"><a name="08102136001153">In the light of their review of that regulation, the Commission has proposed an amending regulation to extend the present regulation of voice calls, establish a ceiling for the costs of text messages sent while abroad, and a ceiling on the wholesale charges that apply to data roaming (this largely relates to mobile internet access through laptops and phones). While the detail of the regulation has still to be negotiated, the proposal offers the prospect of real gains to UK consumers over and above the competitive packages already on offer in the UK, and the UK Government will be working with European partners to achieve that result.</p>

 It is not possible to identify those crimes in which a gun or a knife was used as these will be charged according to the generic offence, for example, murder, manslaughter, wounding, etc. The only statistics available are those for specific weapons related offences, which are largely for possession. The following table shows the number of persons sentenced to immediate custody for indictable offences relating to weapons.</p>

A custodial sentence comprises two parts. The first part is spent in custody and the second part is served on licence in the community. In addition, some offenders subject to determinate sentences may benefit from the home detention curfew (HDC), early removal scheme (ERS) or end of custody licence (ECL) scheme, which provide for release earlier than the statutory release date of the sentence under certain circumstances. Certain violent offenders are presumed unsuitable for HDC unless there are exceptional circumstances and are ineligible for ECL. In addition, certain categories of prisoner are currently excluded from ERS, for example, extended sentence prisoners  <br>

 No data are yet available on discharges from prison in 2007. The latest available data are for 2006. In 2006, 78,500 prisoners were released from prison of whom 13,666 were released earlier than the halfway point of their sentence under the Home Detention Curfew scheme. A number of foreign national prisoners subject to deportation would also have been removed early under the early removal scheme but figures on this for 2006 are not available. All other prisoners were discharged on or after the half way point of the sentence depending on the statutory release arrangements that applied to them.</p>

 The Secretary of State's policy on planning obligations is set out in Government Circular 05/05, which is available in the Library of the House. The Secretary of State's policy says that planning obligations (also known as section 106 agreements) can be attached to a planning permission to make acceptable development which would otherwise be unacceptable in planning terms. Such obligations can prescribe the nature of development, compensate for loss or damage created by a development, or mitigate a development's impact. Planning obligations must be directly relevant to the  <br>

Policies on types of payment, including pooling and maintenance payments, should be set out in local development frameworks. There should be a clear audit trail between the contribution made and the infrastructure provided. The use of developer contributions under section 106 agreements should reflect the purpose for which they were collected and be directly relevant to the proposed development. Therefore, monies collected under section 106 agreements should not be used to pay for infrastructure which was not intended by the original agreement. Planning obligations should never be used purely as a means of securing for the local community a share in the profits of development. The policy indicates that in the event that contributions are made towards specific infrastructure provision but the infrastructure is not provided within an agreed timeframe, arrangements should be made for contributions to be returned to developers. Local planning authorities must take the Secretary of State's policy into account and have reasons for departing from it.</p>

 As my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government (John Healey) stated when the Planning Bill was in Commons Committee, our principal starting point is that almost all developments will have some imposition and impact on the need for infrastructure, and some call on local services or amenities&#151;including those developments that promote public health, physical activity and sport. For instance, a new swimming pool or sports centre will have impacts upon the local road network. In addition, exemptions to, or reductions from, CIL may cause complexity and distortion and reduce fairness. Therefore, the Government envisage that most types of development will be liable to pay CIL.</p>

 This summer's consultation on the Government's Renewable Energy Strategy (RES) has looked at how the UK is to achieve its share of the target that 20 per cent. of the EU's energy consumption must come from renewable sources by 2020. The RES explains that the substantial switch to renewables in the timescale required cannot be achieved without the right response from the planning system. National planning policies already expect regional and local planners to actively plan for and support renewable energy generation. The RES acknowledges however that it may not always be clear to local planning authorities, applicants and other users how elements of this framework come together in any given case. We have therefore said we will ensure our planning policies for renewable energy are updated quickly to reflect the new RES when in place next year.</p>

<i> [holding answer 16 October 2008]:</i> Government funding was never committed to the 2009 Deaflympics. Funding has previously consisted of a single supplementary payment of &#163;75,000 from UK Sport to the British Deaflympic team in 2005. UK Sport have since developed a new strategy focused on delivering success in the Paralympics and Olympics&#151;through which deaf athletes are eligible for funding. From April 2005 to 31 March 2008, UK Sport also provided &#163;42,000 a year for a development post in UK Deaf Sport. This funding has now ceased, bringing UK Deaf Sport in line with other national disability sports organisations. The English Federation of Disability Sport, funded by Sport England, provides these organisations with support at the grass-roots level. The Government remain hopeful that a British team will go to Taipei and that consequently deaf athletes will not be affected.</p>

(DVLA) and the motor insurance database. The estimate is about 2.1 million licensed vehicles (about 6.5 per cent. of the UK total) are being driven by uninsured drivers. Measures introduced to tackle uninsured driving include police powers to seize vehicles used on the road uninsured, and improved police powers to access information contained in the insurance industry's database. The Road Safety Act 2006 introduced a new offence of being a registered keeper for which there is no valid motor insurance. Further regulations are required to bring the provisions into force and the detail of this scheme for continuous insurance enforcement will be subject to consultation later this year.</p>

When applied to the whole vehicle fleet this would amount to around 1.2 million vehicles. The exercise was repeated this year but the results are not yet available. To improve compliance with these requirements the police have access to the computerised record of MoT test results so that officers can identify vehicles without a valid MoT, when using for example ANPR cameras, and then take action. The &#145;newstyle' MoT certificates come with a peel off and display sticker setting out the MoT expiry date as an aid to motorists.</p>

<sup>(2 )</sup>Data as at 31 March in each of the given years.<br>

<sup>(4 )</sup>Data collected by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) for the number of officers who are deployed to all traffic duties. It is not possible to segregate officers on speed enforcement duties from other officers deployed to traffic duties. The table therefore provides data for all officers deployed to traffic duties.<br>
<sup>(5 )</sup>The basis on which HMIC classify police service staff changed in the year 1999-2000 so the figures for 2000-01, 2001-02 and 2002-03 are not directly comparable with those for earlier years. Some officers counted as deployed to traffic duties in earlier years may, from 1999-2000 onward, have been recorded as deployed to duties relating to traffic wardens.<br>
<sup>(6 )</sup>Data collected by Home Office and not by HMIC. Staff with multiple responsibilities (or designations) are recorded under their primary role or function. The traffic function includes staff who are predominantly employed on motorcycles or in patrol vehicles for the policing of traffic and motorway related duties. This does not include officers employed in accident investigation, vehicle examination and radar duties.<br>

<i> Guide to Quality:</i><br>
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV&#151;for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220.<br>

1. Small numbers: Due to reasons of confidentiality, figures between 1 and 5 have been suppressed and replaced with &#145;*&#146; (an asterisk). Where it was possible to identify numbers from the total due to a single suppressed number in a row or column, an additional number (the next smallest) has been suppressed in order to protect patient confidentiality.<br>
2. Quality of care: Data derived from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) cannot be used in isolation to evaluate the quality of care provided by NHS trusts. There are many factors that can affect the outcome of treatment and it is beyond the scope of HES to adequately record and present all of these.<br>
3. Ungrossed data: Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
4. Finished admission episodes: A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
5. Primary diagnosis: The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital. The ICD-10 codes used to identify Pleural plaques are:<br>
J92.0&#151;Pleural plaque with presence of asbestos.<br>
J92.9&#151;Pleural plaque without asbestos.<br>
6. Number of episodes in which the patient had a (named) primary diagnosis: These figures represent the number of episodes where the diagnosis was recorded in the primary diagnosis field in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record.<br>
7. Data Quality: Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
8. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>

 The NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency (PASA) works to ensure that the national health service in England makes the most effective use of its resources by getting the best possible value for money when purchasing goods and services. The prime target is to release money that could be better spent on patient care by achieving purchasing savings and improving supply performance across the NHS. It provides strategic direction and oversees the development of category strategies and seeks to ensure that NHS procurement is delivered through consistent processes. Where sourcing issues require a national lead they will provide that focus on behalf of the Department. A wide range of guidance is published for the use of those involved in NHS procurement and is available on NHS PASA&#146;s website at:</p>

The PEA is not a benefit paid to residents, but the minimum amount of their own money they must be left with, after their contribution to the cost of their care has been deducted from their income. All care home residents who are supported by local authorities in residential accommodation under section 21 of the National Assistance Act 1948 will, therefore, receive at least the PEA each week.</p>

1. Small numbers: Due to reasons of confidentiality, figures between 1 and 5 have been suppressed and replaced with &#145;*&#146; (an asterisk). Where it was possible to identify numbers from the total due to a single suppressed number in a row or column, an additional number (the next smallest) has been suppressed in order to protect patient confidentiality.<br>
2. Quality of care: Data derived from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) cannot be used in isolation to evaluate the quality of care provided by NHS trusts. There are many factors that can affect the outcome of treatment and it is beyond the scope of HES to adequately record and present all of these.<br>
3. Ungrossed data: Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
4. Finished admission episodes: A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
5. Primary diagnosis: The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital. The ICD-10 codes used to identify pleural plaques are:<br>
J92.0&#151;Pleural plaque with presence of asbestos.<br>
J92.9&#151;Pleural plaque without asbestos.<br>
6. Number of episodes in which the patient had a (named) primary diagnosis: These figures represent the number of episodes where the diagnosis was recorded in the primary diagnosis field in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record.<br>
7. Data Quality: Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
8. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>

 The Government froze the UK funds of Landsbanki under the power in section 4 of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act, 2001. HMG has not frozen any other Icelandic banks. The Act includes a range of provisions. In this instance, use of the power had no relation to the counter-terrorism provisions elsewhere in the Act. The power allows HMG to make a freezing order where action to the detriment of the United Kingdom's economy (or part of it) has been or is likely to be taken by a foreign Government or other person. This was the basis on which the power was used. The Treasury will keep the freezing order under review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_766"><a name="81021w0040.htm_para4"><a name="08102160002851">I am aware of the concerns raised by the Special Commissioners decision in this case, which centred on whether the vessel on which the appellants performed their duties was a ship or an &#145;offshore installation&#146; within the meaning of the legislation. The Special Commissioners decided it had been operating as an offshore installation, and refused the appellants&#146; claims to SED.</p>
