<p><a name="40621w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The agreement reached with BAE Systems in February 2003, embodied in a formal contract amendment on 23 February this year, has put the Nimrod MRA4 programme on a much sounder footing for the future. Under the restructured contract, design and development and production have been separated as far as possible, to ensure that technology is adequately de-risked before making further commitment to production price and schedule. The MOD, however, has been approving low risk production activities when it makes sense to do so, where these help maintain essential skills and product knowledge as well as preserve schedule.

 On 30 June, the UK will no longer be an Occupying Power under the terms of the Geneva Conventions in Iraq. The Iraqi Government will increasingly take direct responsibility for security.

After 30 June, responsibility for security will pass to the Iraqi Government.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs which body is responsible for <i>(a)</i> decontamination and <i>(b)</i> preventing the leachate if a closed landfill site begins to leak contaminants into the water supply or environment.  [174587]</p>









<p><a name="40621w04.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Under the provisions of the Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 2000, enacted in January 2004, the quality of a public, potable water supply to a consumer&#039;s premises (up to the tap) is the responsibility of the relevant water undertaker for that location. This includes responsibility for decontamination.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40621w04.html_para8">
If a closed landfill site begins to leak contaminants into the water supply in England and Wales, responsibility for the overall process of preventing the leachate is divided. The Environment Agency is responsible for &#039;investigating&#039; the incident. The body (or person) who causes or knowingly permits the pollution of controlled waters is responsible for &#039;remedying&#039; the pollution. The Environment Agency in turn is responsible for &#039;ensuring&#039; that the body (or person) who caused or knowingly permitted the pollution takes remedial action. The Agency has powers to prosecute the perpetrator of the pollution in these circumstances.

<p>
<a name="40621w04.html_para9">
The Drinking Water Inspectorate investigates incidents affecting drinking water quality. Local authorities are required to monitor the quality of private water supplies, namely those not provided by a water undertaker.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40621w04.html_para10">
Responsibility for the aftercare and maintenance of closed landfill sites, including the prevention of environmental pollution, will depend on the legislation that was in force at the time the landfill site ceased operations. Sites that closed before the implementation of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 were subject to a different regime to the one currently in place.

It is impossible to predict with any degree of accuracy what the outcome of cases where a DTTO was made would have been if the DTTO had not been available as a sentencing option. However, the DTTO is targeted at offenders with entrenched patterns of drug misuse who have generally committed a considerable amount of crime to fund their drug habit. While the vast majority of DTTO cases are likely to be heard in the magistrates courts, a significant number (perhaps as many as a quarter) of offenders on DTTOs are sentenced at Crown court. In view of the frequency and seriousness of offences committed by offenders in the target group, we anticipate that a significant proportion of those who are sentenced to DTTOs would otherwise have been sent to prison.

<p><a name="40621w08.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </b> 
 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what recent estimate he has made of the number of counterfeit notes in circulation; and what steps he is taking to make counterfeiting more difficult.  [179221]</p>









<p><a name="40621w08.html_spnew0"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The Bank of England, which produces and issues most UK banknotes, records the number of counterfeit notes discovered in circulation. In recent years, this number has remained at a very small fraction of 1 per cent. of the total number of notes in circulation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40621w08.html_para0">
The Bank ensures that its notes are designed to discourage counterfeiters. The current series of notes in circulation have certain security features, which not only make it difficult to counterfeit notes, but also make it easy to determine whether or not a note is genuine.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40621w08.html_para1">
To assist the public with identifying counterfeit notes, a leaflet entitled &quot;Know your Banknotes&quot; is available upon request or downloadable from the Bank&#039;s website. This describes the identity and security features of current notes, and provides advice on how to check for counterfeits.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40621w08.html_para2">
When notes are introduced or withdrawn from circulation, this is advertised prominently in the national and local press and via posters and leaflets. This also minimises the risk of counterfeits of old series notes being passed and accepted.

The Transport Act 2000 brought in the statutory minimum requirement for local authority concessionary fares to ensure that older and disabled people are entitled to half fares or better on their local bus services, with no additional charge being levied for the pass.
</p>


<p>

<p>
<a name="40621w08.html_para9">
The Chancellor announced the introduction of free TV licences for those aged over 75, in his pre-Budget report in November 2000. Over 3.5 million pensioner households benefit from access to free TV licences, at a cost of some &#163;380 million a year.

<p><a name="40621w08.html_spnew6"><b> John Healey: </b>

 We see identity cards having a major contribution to the work of my Department and its agencies. We have identified four key areas: our proposals for a Children&#039;s Service Passport; the Connexions Card issued to 16 to 19-year-olds; access to post-16 education and training; and our proposed Unique Learner Number Infrastructure. However, all of our proposals for the use of identity cards relate to the post-16 provision of education and training. In respect of pre-16 education, we have a legal obligation to educate all children of the appropriate age within our education system.

The legal protection of children under 16 is primarily the responsibility of their parents. Section 3 of the Children Act 1989 gives the meaning of parental responsibility. Children under 16 are presumed to lack mental capacity, as defined legally in some respect, which is why parents can largely make decisions on behalf of their children. The threshold at which local authorities can apply to the courts for a care order which confers parental responsibility on the applicant authority is given in Section 31 of the Children Act 1989.

 There are currently no legal restrictions in place in Colombia preventing access to any part of their country for international organisations and their agencies or for Colombian or foreign NGOs working there. However, the continuing armed conflict and the country&#039;s geography mean that access to the remotest parts of the country can be difficult. In addition paramilitary or guerrilla groups do attempt to block access by outsiders to some parts of the country, particularly remote rural locations. International organisations and NGOs are also conscious of the potential risk to their staff of attempting to gain access to areas in which the armed conflict is ongoing. Through its democratic security policy the Government of Colombia is trying to bring security and accessibility to all regions in the country. We constantly urge the Colombian Government to ensure that the implementation of this policy is in accordance with international law. We also monitor developments closely to inform our own travel advice.

 As oil is an internationally traded commodity, the price rise has affected all world manufacturers. Moreover, as the rise has been accompanied by a fall in the US dollar against sterling, the rise in the sterling price of oil has been less pronounced.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what split he recommends for industry and housing on brownfield sites.  [179511]</p>








<p><a name="40621w17.html_spnew0"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The Government does not set the proportion of brownfield sites which should be developed for industry and housing, nor would it wish to. Local planning authorities, through the development plan process, should decide for themselves what sites to allocate for housing and industrial land.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40621w17.html_para0">
In preparing development plans, local authorities must have regard to national planning policies. Planning Policy Guidance note 3: Housing sets a national target for 60 per cent. of additional housing, including conversions, to be built on previously-developed land. The latest figure achieved is 66 per cent. in 2002, a figure which has increased every year since 1997. There is no target for industrial uses.

<p>
<a name="40621w17.html_para1">
The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is currently producing good practice guidance for the review of local authority employment land allocations, which will be published later this year. The guidance will provide a methodology that can be applied to the circumstances of each local authority area, rather than recommending a proportional split between the development of housing and industrial uses at a national level.

<p><a name="40621w17.html_spnew1"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 Current policy on providing for rural exception housing is set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 3: Housing, Annex B. The policy allows local planning authorities to consider including a &#039;rural exception policy&#039; in their plans where there remains a lack of affordable housing to meet local needs. An exception policy enables a local planning authority to grant planning permission for small sites for affordable housing to meet local needs in perpetuity, within or adjoining existing villages, which may be subject to policies of restraint such as Green Belt.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40621w17.html_para2">
The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s consultation document &quot;Influencing the size, type and affordability of housing&quot; proposes that the &#039;rural exception policy&#039; is replaced by a 100 per cent. affordable housing allocation policy, which would deliver exactly the same objective except through the plan making process.

 Between September 2001 and 31 March 2004, the Starter Home Initiative (SHI) helped key workers into home ownership in areas where the high cost of housing serves undermined recruitment and retention of skilled staff in key public services. The SHI was available in London and the South East region and in some housing hotspots in the East, South West and West Midlands regions. It was not available to key workers in Manchester.

<p><a name="40621w17.html_spnew3"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 Since 1997 allocations of capital funding to local authorities for housing purposes have risen consistently by about 15 per cent. per annum on average. This includes the Major Repairs Allowance we introduced in 200102 specifically for the improvement of local authority stock alongside the Decent Homes standard which sets out minimum standards to be met by 2010. Manchester&#039;s allocation for 2003&#150;04 was &#163;69.671 million and has been supplemented by the announcement of &#163;125 million to be made available to the Manchester/Salford Housing Market Renewal Pathfinder between 2003&#150;04 and 2005&#150;06.

 There are no statistics held centrally for how much land has been allocated for certain land uses, such as industry, in development plans, and could only be provided at disproportionate cost.

<a name="40621w17.html_para4">
The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is currently producing good practice guidance for the review of local authority employment land allocations, which will be published later this year.

 The Pan Government Agreement (PGA) is a non-binding internal arrangement between two Crown bodies, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Ordnance Survey (OS).

<p><a name="40621w21.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The Department for Transport does not hold data on <i>(a)</i> book value of stakeholding or <i>(b)</i> onward sale price on PFI/PPP projects it sponsors.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what the outcome was of the Transport Council held on 10&#150;11 June; what the Government&#039;s stance was on the issues discussed, including its voting record; and if he will make a statement.  [179173]</p>









<p><a name="40621w21.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 The transport session of the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council met in Luxembourg on 11 June. I represented the UK.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40621w21.html_para1">
The Council reached a General Approach on a Directive on enhancing port security. The agreement was based on a Presidency compromise text, which the UK was able to accept. The Directive will, complement Regulation 725/2004 on enhancing ship and port facility security adopted in March 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40621w21.html_para2">
The Council reached Political Agreement on a Directive on ship-source pollution and the introduction of sanctions, including criminal sanctions, for pollution offences. The agreement was on the basis of a revised text, which met many of the concerns of the UK relating to equity, consistency with international law and the apportionment of responsibilities between the First and Third Pillars of the European Union. The agreed text does differ from MARPOL; however, the UK and likeminded Member States did not command sufficient votes to prevent political agreement from being reached on this basis.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40621w21.html_para3">
Reports to the Council on maritime issues under AOB dealt with: ratification of maritime conventions, identification documents for seafarers, and the recent maritime safety forum organised by the Presidency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40621w21.html_para4">
The Council reached agreement on a number of aspects of the Galileo satellite navigation project. Council conclusions were adopted calling for continuing progress in work leading to implementation of the project. Political Agreement was reached on a Council Regulation on the establishment of management structures. The Council adopted two Decisions on Galileo external relations, the first a cooperation agreement with Israel and the second an agreement with the USA on the operation of Galileo and the GPS. All of the agreed texts were acceptable to the UK.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40621w21.html_para5">
The Council did not reach Political Agreement on the proposal to amend Directive 1999/62/EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructure (the &#039;Eurovignette&#039; Directive). The key stumbling block to agreement at the March Council had been the hypothecation of revenues to the transport sector. At this Council, I re-stated that the UK cannot accept mandatory hypothecation and that decisions on how to spend revenue raised from road charging should be left to the discretion of member states. Further examination of this and other aspects of the text will now be carried out, so that the proposal can be put to a future Council.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40621w21.html_para6">
The Council reached Political Agreement on a Regulation amending current legislation on drivers hours&#039; legislation that applies to certain drivers&#039; of large commercial vehicles, and on a Directive on enforcement of those hours. Both of the agreed texts were acceptable to the United Kingdom.

There was an exchange of views on EU-US air transport, based on a report from the Commission on its negotiations with the US. I was joined by other Ministers in stating that an agreement on the lines proposed would be unbalanced, and should not be accepted.

<p><a name="40621w22.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Pond: </b> 
 The gross cost of exempting all pensioners in receipt of Carer&#039;s Allowance from the overlapping benefits rule would be around &#163;221 million. After adjusting for offsets in income-related benefits the cost would be around &#163;145 million. The gross cost for non-pensioners would be around &#163;109 million or around &#163;50 million after adjustments for offsets.

</p>

<p class="tabletext"><i>Notes:</i></p>

1. Estimates use benefit rates for 2003&#150;04 and are based on a 100 per cent. extract of Carer&#039;s Allowance claims on the Carer&#039;s Allowance computer system for May 2003, a 5 per cent. extract from the claims on the Income Support computer systems in 2003 and a 1 per cent. extract of the Housing Benefit/Council Tax benefit claims of May 2002.
2. These costs do not take account of the introduction of Pension Credit where Carer&#039;s Allowance is taken fully into account but an additional amount, the carer&#039;s premium (currently &#163;25.55 per week), may be awarded in respect of the caring.
3. The figures take no account of the behavioural effect of carers who have not claimed a Carer&#039;s Allowance but who would be induced to do so if the overlapping benefits rule was abolished.

<p><a name="40621w23.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Pond: </b> 
 There is no official assessment made of pay differentials between men and women employed by the Department and its agencies in the specific geographical areas referred to. The following table and associated notes show an analysis of mean salaries of staff working in DWP offices in the Southampton area by gender. This analysis shows that the mean salary of a man is 98.7 per cent. of the mean salary of a woman.

Notes:<br>

1. The Southampton Area table shows salaries for staff in workplaces with an &quot;SO&quot; post code prefix. This includes Southampton, Eastleigh, Hythe, Romsey, Totton, Woolston, and Winchester.<br>

2. Salaries have been calculated on the basis of &quot;Whole Time Equivalents&quot;, meaning full time staff count as one and part time staff count as a proportion of one depending on their work 



pattern. Salaries are accordingly pro-rated on the basis of the work pattern. The salaries used are basic rates excluding allowances, overtime and any employer&#039;s contributions for NI or occupational pensions.<br>

3. The percentage difference has been calculated by dividing the value of the difference into the lower mean salary. This calculation shows that the mean salary of women is 1.31 per cent. higher than the mean salary of men.<br>

The gender differential in DWP overall is that men earn on average 4.8 per cent. more than women. This figure is calculated using the salaries of all staff within DWP excluding the Senior Civil Service. The differences between male and female mean salaries change by grade. In the administrative grades that predominate in DWP offices, such as those in the Southampton area, female mean salaries are higher. In the executive grades, male mean salaries are higher. In the Southampton area, 93 per cent. of staff are in Bands A/AA, B/AO and C/EO. Looking at the comparable selection for DWP overall the gender differential is 1.39 per cent. with women earning more than men.<br>

The Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) suggests that, as a general guide, any gender differences of 5 per cent. or more, or patterns of differences of 3 per cent. or more will require exploration and explanation. The Department for Work and Pensions are committed to reviewing their pay policies to ensure that they are compliant with the current equal pay legislation and do not either directly or indirectly discriminate against any group of employees. An Equal Pay Audit is currently being undertaken to review existing policies and to inform the development of the departmental reward strategy.<br>

All jobs that relate to the grades mentioned above are gender-neutral, that is, there is no reason why they should not be performed by men or women. There is therefore no likelihood of any gender-based variances being due to the requirement for work to be performed by staff of a particular gender.<br>

1. Statistics based on Family Resources Survey data 2002/3 for Great Britain.<br>

2. Results in tables 1a and 1b are rounded to the nearest 50,000&#151;due to rounding rows and columns may not sum to totals. Results in tables 2a and 2b rounded to the nearest 1 per cent.<br>

3. The median net income of &#163;189 for all pensioner units is based on unequivalised cash income.<br>

4. The results are based on the incomes of the pensioner units themselves, it excludes any income from any other members of the households they are living in.<br>

5. Single pensioners are defined as people above the State Pension Age, Pensioner Couples are defined as couples where the man is above State Pension Age. This is consistent with definitions used in the Pensioners&#039; Incomes series.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. State benefit income corresponds to benefit income as defined in the Pensioners&#039; Income Series. The three main sources of benefit income are state retirement pension, disability benefit and income related benefits.<br>

2. Private pension and other asset income corresponds to the sum of occupational pension income, personal pension income and investment income.<br>

3. Estimates are subject to sampling error therefore definitive conclusions can not be drawn from small year-on-year changes in proportions.<br>

2. Please note that the figures for 2003&#150;2004 refer only to the main payment run i.e. they do not include the late payment run figures. We estimate that there are approximately 100,000 people in Great Britain paid via late payment runs (0.8 per cent. of all payments). However, since late payment runs are mainly in respect of non-system cases whose claim had not been received by Qualifying Week, they are heavily skewed towards men aged 60.<br>

 The Committee on Safety of Medicines&#039; (CSM) expert working group on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) advised in December 2003 that paroxetine, venlafaxine, sertraline, citalopram and escitalopram should not be used in children and young people under 18 years because of a lack of benefit in this patient population and an increased risk of adverse events including suicidal behaviour.

The recently completed Europe-wide review of the safety of paroxetine, led by the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, has delivered advice on the need for careful monitoring during paroxetine treatment of patients at risk of suicidal behaviour, including those with a history of suicidal behaviour and young adults.

<p><a name="40621w26.html_spnew9"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 Paroxetine is licensed in the dose range 10&#150;60 milligrams (mg.), depending on the indication. The recommended starting dose for all indications is 20 mg. and this was the subject of a reminder to prescribers in March 2004. Clinical experience is that some patients not responding to the recommended dose may benefit from having their dose increased. Changes in dosage should be made progressively according to individual response both at the beginning of treatment and at the end of treatment. The 30mg. tablet allows for flexibility in titration within the licensed dose range.

Notes:<br>

1. This information was obtained from the prescribing analysis and cost (PACT) system, which covers prescriptions prescribed by GP practices in England and dispensed in the community. Prescriptions written in England but dispensed outside England are included. Prescriptions written within a GP practice but dispensed outside the SHA will be included in the SHA in which the GP practice is based. Prescriptions written in hospitals/clinics that are dispensed in the community, prescriptions dispensed in hospitals and private prescriptions are not included in PACT data.<br>





2. Prescriptions are written on a prescription form. Each single item written on the form is counted as a prescription item.<br>

3. Orlistat is defined in the British National Formulary (BNF) section 4.5 &quot;Drugs used in the treatment of obesity&quot;.<br>

4. Data in the table are presented in thousands.<br>

5. The sum of all SHAs does noi: equal the total England figure, because the total England figure includes unidentified doctors (those it is not possible for the Prescription Pricing Authority to allocate to a primary care trust).<br>
