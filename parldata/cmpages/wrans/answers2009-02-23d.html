 Decisions to propose closure for regular public worship are taken within each diocese and the Commissioners have made no specific assessment of the reasons behind such decisions. Where objections are received, the Commissioners consider whether there is a pastoral need for the church. On average, between 25 and 30 churches are closed each year; this is in the context of over 16,000 churches in use, including a number of new places of worship opening each year.</p>

 The Animal Health Act 1981 and Human Rights legislation require that compensation is paid for animals compulsorily killed to prevent the spread of disease. For foot and mouth disease (FMD), compensation is paid for all animals compulsorily slaughtered at the full market value before the animal became infected. Compensation is also paid for other items, such as farm equipment and feed etc which are seized as they are considered to be contaminated. This includes such things as milk. The amount of compensation payable for animals for FMD is determined by an approved valuer at the time of slaughter.</p>

 We deeply regret any incidents where civilians are killed as a result of actions by international forces. Procedures are in place, and being constantly updated in the light of experience, both to minimise the risk of these casualties occurring and to investigate any incidents that do happen. In addition troops undergo comprehensive individual and collective training before they go on operations.

 Pathogen inactivation (PI) is a process designed to eliminate pathogens&#151;i.e. viruses, bacteria and fungi&#151;from water, air or donated blood. The majority of the blood held in-theatre by the Defence Medical Services is supplied by the UK National Blood Services (NBS), which does not routinely carry out PI on its blood products. However, the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO&#151;a Department of Health NDPB) will be reviewing options to reduce the risk of bacterial infection in platelets, including pathogen inactivation, in early 2009, which will inform decisions on its use in the UK.

 All UK cluster munitions, prohibited once the Cluster Munition Convention enters into force, were withdrawn from operational service on 30 May 2008, when the Convention was adopted. All were immediately segregated for disposal to prevent use and transfer and some have already been destroyed.</p>

The MOD has contractual control and oversight over all disposal contracts and disposal certificates are issued when each cluster munition has been destroyed. The MOD carries out checks on contractors to ensure compliance. There is no scope in the disposal contracts for a disposal contractor to do anything other than destroy the munitions. Furthermore, cluster munitions are recorded on the Department&#146;s inventory and explosives safety management IT systems, which means that they can be tracked and prevented from being inadvertently issued for either operational or training purposes.</p>

 Since the UK joined the development phase of the joint strike fighter programme in 2001 we have benefited significantly from the strength of the pound against the dollar and as a result forecasted costs are still expected to remain within the approved level.

However, you have since indicated that your main interest in asking about fuel consumption was to establish whether there is an unjustified increase in RAF flying patterns towards the end of a financial year, designed to ensure that all available fuel is consumed and to justify future fuel budgets. Relevant data is readily available showing the volume of fuel transferred on the ground and during air-to-air refuelling (AAR) with UK tankers, for the Harrier, Tornado GR4 and Tornado F3 fleets for each financial year. This indicates fuel consumption trends by month across financial years since 2005-06. Data prior to 2005-06 is not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>

To better show the trends it has also been presented in graphs for each financial year in an annex to this letter. It should be noted that the figures provided do not include fuel transferred from foreign tankers, for example during NATO exercises. They also do not include data for AAR consumption by 14 Squadron (Tornado GR4) based at RAF Lossiemouth, which is not available. Additionally, due to the relatively small level of consumption, figures for the Fast Jet Weapons Operational Evaluation Units are only recorded annually and so have not been included, as to do so would not assist in analysing any possible month on month trends. Because the figures which are missing are relatively small we do not consider them to be statistically significant.</p>

Although this does occur in some cases, there are also some decreases at the end of financial years and peaks occurring at other times of the year. There are a number of reasons why flying rates may increase from December to March, including the improving weather and the fact that there is normally less flying in December and January, owing to traditional periods of leave. Flying may also increase in March because aircrew need to renew certain qualifications before the end of the training year, which coincides with the end of the financial year.</p>
</ul><a name="90223w0009.htm_brev1"><a name="09022316001099"><ul><p class="tabletext">You also asked about the rejection from first line in the UK for the Pegasus and RB 199 engines in each week of the last five financial years. This data is available on a monthly basis for both engine types from 2005-06 only and is provided in the following table. It is to be expected that there will be a higher number of rejected RB 199 engines, due to the much larger size of the Tornado fleet (for example there are currently 210 Tornado F3 and GR4 and only 75 Harrier GR9 in the fleet) and the fact that that the Tornado is a dual-engine aircraft, whereas the Harrier  <br>

only has one Pegasus engine. However, on average the rate of rejection for the three financial years works out at almost the same: 3.39 engines per 1000 flying hours for the Tornado RB 199 engine as opposed to 3.52 for the Harrier Pegasus engine.</p>

1. These are not whole economy figures. Coverage relates just to vacancies notified to Jobcentre Plus and as such represents a market share of vacancies throughout the whole economy. This proportion varies over time, according to the occupation of the vacancy and industry of the employer, and by local area.<br>
2. These figures are of stocks of unfilled vacancies which reflect more accurately job opportunities available via Jobcentre Plus. In the case of unfilled vacancies, use of the figures on live vacancies is recommended (i.e. excluding suspended vacancies), and this is the default option. Live vacancies may still include some vacancies which have already been filled or are otherwise no longer open to recruits, due to natural lags in procedures for following up vacancies with employers.<br>
3. Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) are available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.<br>
4. Interpretation of this data needs to take account of changes in recent years to Jobcentre Plus procedures for taking and handling vacancies. These figures are not fully comparable over time and may not indicate developments in the labour market. A more detailed explanation is available on the nomis website.<br>
5. Data labelled as &#147;Month X&#148; predominantly relates to the previous month. The release calendar gives details of the monthly release dates and the periods covered. For example, January 2009 relates to the period (6 December 2008- 2 January 2009).<br>
6. Reporting months relate to either a four week or five week period depending on count dates. Users should be cautious about comparing monthly flows and may wish to standardise the figures. For example the January 2009 period is a four week period whereas February 2009 is a five week period.<br>
7. Vacancy data is collected by month and quarterly data is not available. It is not possible to sum up each month in the quarter as this would lead to some job vacancies being counted twice.<br>

1. These are not whole economy figures. Coverage relates just to vacancies notified to Jobcentre Plus and as such represent a market share of vacancies throughout the whole economy. This proportion varies over time, according to the occupation of the vacancy and industry of the employer, and by local area.<br>
2. Notified vacancies include any speculative placings recorded by Jobcentre Plus. Datasets from May 2006 may reflect substantially reduced levels of speculative placings as part of the notified series. Consequently, care should be taken in interpreting time-series data.<br>
3. Data are unrounded.<br>
4. Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) are available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.<br>
5. Interpretation of these data needs to take account of changes in recent years to Jobcentre Plus procedures for taking and handling vacancies. These figures are not fully comparable over time and may not indicate developments in the labour market. A more detailed explanation is available on the NOMIS website:<br>

1. Changes to Jobcentre Plus vacancy handling procedures have lead to a major discontinuity in the vacancy statistics pre and post May 2006. See<br>
 http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/articles/177.aspx#may06<br>
before comparing data over this period. Interpretation of this data needs to take account of changes in recent years to Jobcentre Plus procedures for taking and handling vacancies.<br>
2. These figures are not fully comparable over time and may not indicate developments in the labour market. A more detailed explanation is available on the nomis website.<br>
3. These are not whole economy figures. Coverage relates just to vacancies notified to Jobcentre Plus and as such represent a market share of vacancies throughout the whole economy. This proportion varies over time, according to the occupation of the vacancy and industry of the employer, and by local area. Jobcentre Plus Labour Market System.<br>
4. Notified vacancies include any speculative placings recorded by Jobcentre Plus. Datasets from May 2006 may reflect substantially reduced levels of speculative placings as part of the notified series. Consequently, care should be taken in interpreting time-series data of the notified series.<br>
5. Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) are available from the monthly Office for National Statistics Vacancy Survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the Office for National Statistics survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.<br>

The average cost has been calculated by dividing the total expenditure each year by the number of customers joining the programme within that year. This provides a good approximation, but since the costs for any one individual occur over a period of time (and are not possible to track) the figures will not be exact.  2. Expenditure figures exclude administration costs as they cannot be identified since 2002-03 when 'ring fences' were removed with agreement from HM Treasury.  3. In the case of New Deal for Young People and New Deal 25 Plus, the expenditure does include associated Annually Managed Expenditure (weekly training allowance).  4. New Deal for Young People and New Deal 25 Plus started in 1998, with phased introduction between January and July. Average expenditure per customer on New Deal for Young People and New Deal 25 Plus has reduced year on year since 2005-06 due to changes to New Deal from April 2004 (which included reducing the length of the options period to 13 weeks). The full impact of this change did not take effect until 2005-06.  5. New Deal 50 Plus started in 2000. Performance information is not available until 2003-04. New Deal 50 Plus costs reduce after 2002-03 as the employment credit element of ND50+ (funded by DWP) ceased and was replaced by the 50 plus element of the working tax credit (funded by HMRC). The small residual spend relates to the New Deal 50 Plus Training Grant.  6. New Deal for Disabled People (NDDP) started in 2001. Spend prior to this date is for pilots in selected areas. Performance information is not available until 2001-02. Both costs and participant numbers have risen significantly following re-tendering in 2004. As participants can stay on the programme for longer than a year, dividing spend by starts is not really a valid comparison of spend per person. Furthermore, NDDP is no longer a national programme (it only operates in 18 districts) so costings would be further affected since the programme was subsumed by provider led Pathways from December 2007.  7. New Deal for Lone Parents started in 1998. Average expenditure per customer on the New Deal for Lone Parents programme increased from 2006 due to the additional help available by way of in work credit, child care costs and the increased availability of training opportunities.  8. New Deal for Partners started in 1999 and was re-launched in 2004. Performance information is not available until 2004-05.  9. New Deal for Musicians started in 1999. Performance information is not available for the New Deal for Musicians Programme.  <i> Sources:</i>  1. DWP financial systems (numerator).  2. DWP Tabulation Tool (denominator).<br>

This type of assistance has first call on the social fund loans budget and all crisis loan applicants who satisfy the eligibility conditions are given an award.

1. Caseload figures are rounded to the nearest 10.<br>
2. Totals may not sum due to rounding.<br>
3. Figures for attendance allowance, carers allowance, and disability living allowance include those cases with entitlement but where payment is currently suspended (for example because of an extended stay in hospital or being in receipt of an overlapping benefit).<br>
4. Statistical group is a hierarchical variable. A person who fits into more than one category will only appear in the top-most one for which they are eligible:<br>
Jobseeker: claimant on jobseekers allowance;<br>
Incapacity benefits: claimant on incapacity benefit or severe disablement allowance;<br>
Lone parent: claimant on income support with child under 16 and no partner;<br>
Carer: claimant entitled to carer's allowance;<br>
Other income related benefit: claimant on income support or pension credit; disabled: claimant on attendance allowance or disability living allowance, anyone of working age in this group will be claiming DLA only, and is likely to be in work;<br>
Bereaved: claimant on bereavement benefit or widow's benefit;<br>
State pension only: claimant in receipt of state pension only.<br>
For example a claimant of disability living allowance and jobseekers allowance would appear in &#147;job seeker&#148;, not in &#147;disabled&#148;.<br>
5. Jobseeker's allowance data have been revised following improvements to the methodology for compiling Department for Work and Pensions jobseeker's allowance statistics. To ensure consistency overtime the improved methodology was applied to historical data. The preferred source of data for jobseeker's allowance claimants is the Office for National Statistics' claimant count. However, in this case, the Department for Work and Pensions Work and Pensions Longitudinal Survey has been used for consistency with the other benefit statistics.<br>

 The Design for Manufacture (DFM) competition was launched in April 2005 and was run by English Partnerships until the end of last year. English Partnerships was replaced in December 2008 by the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA), operating on behalf of the Department for Communities and Local Government. The competition was the Government&#146;s challenge to the house building industry to build high-quality, well-designed homes for &#163;60,000. The figure of &#163;60,000 relates to a target construction cost for building a two-bedroom home and does not reflect the development cost or sale price.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="90223w0024.htm_para1"><a name="09022327001936">The competition is expected to deliver more than 1,100 high-quality, well-designed, sustainable homes. Of these, developers were asked to build around 30 per cent. for the target construction cost of &#163;60,000 or less. However, the other 70 per cent. were expected to be larger and smaller homes built at an equivalent cost-efficiency.</p>

Also, the sites are located in different areas in the country and each site has reported different obstacles to overcome. However, early indications from this study show that out of a sample of 135 units surveyed and completed at the time of the study, and with appropriate cost adjustments to reflect price inflation since the competition was launched in April 2005, 79 were built for close to or less than &#163;60,000.</p>

 As set out in the written ministerial statement given by my right hon.

More recently the TCPA has continued to advise my Department through developing best practice guidance on the laying out and planning of eco-towns and similar development, and co-ordinating the input of experts to this.

This sets out details about spending on the eco-towns programme, and the following table provides an update on the costs related to technical consultancy and marketing. This is of course ongoing work involving private consultants, and it would not be appropriate to provide further details of the anticipated costs at this time. In terms of costs in relation to the recent judicial review, the Department&#146;s legal costs were awarded to the Secretary of State. Such costs are the subject of agreement between the parties and in the absence of this a judge will decide the amount in a detailed assessment hearing.

 As no two premises are likely to be the same, a 'one size fits all' approach to fire safety is inappropriate. The Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 is non-prescriptive.

This includes highlighting the message that it is not acceptable for young people to drink in public places.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_408"><a name="90223w0028.htm_para5"><a name="0902249000218">The Home Office co-ordinated enforcement campaigns have provided support to police and trading standard officers in the use of the extensive powers available under the Licensing Act 2003 in relation to children. Indeed successive Alcohol Misuse and Enforcement Campaigns (AMECs) from 2004 and Tackling Underage Sales of Alcohol Campaigns (TUSAC) since 2006 have reduced the test purchase failure rate from approximately 50 per cent. to approximately 15 per cent. Additionally, we have recently launched a new &#163;4.5 million enforcement campaign in 190 areas, with a particular focus on the 50 areas of most concern to us from January to March 2009. The Home Office also supports the Proof of Age Standards Scheme (PASS), as well as initiatives which seek to reduce the number of under-age sales such as &#147;Challenge 21&#148;.</p>

Activity in both campaigns focussed on school holidays and weekends when young people were most likely to be engaged in this activity.</p>

 All social research that is published by the Home Office is subject to an independent peer review process.

We choose peer reviewers for their knowledge of the subject and their expertise in the methodology used for the research. In a small number of cases, the Department instead gives permission for the research to be published by external contractors who completed the work.

 The shift patterns of police officers is an operational matter, and as such is for the chief constable to determine. However, the Government published a review of the Licensing Act 2003 in March 2008 which revealed a mixed picture in terms of its impact. The change in opening hours has not led to the widespread problems some people feared. Overall, crime and alcohol consumption are down, but there has been a small increase in alcohol-related violence in the early hours of the morning and some communities have seen a rise in disorder. Our main conclusion is that people are using the freedoms, but people are not sufficiently using the considerable powers granted by the Act to tackle problems,, and that there is a need to rebalance action towards enforcement and crack down on irresponsible behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_485"><a name="90223w0034.htm_para19"><a name="0902249001037">Additionally, we have introduced legislation for a new, mandatory code of practice.

This will not affect the majority of businesses, small or large, who behave responsibly&#151;but will target those that don&#146;t.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_486"><a name="90223w0034.htm_para20"><a name="0902249001038">Further, the Government are funding a &#163;4.5 million enforcement campaign, in addition to existing resources from the police, local authorities, and others, focused on 40-50 priority areas and led by ACPO Commander Simon O&#146;Brien.

<i> [holding answer 19 January 2009]:</i> The Identity and Passport Service (IPS) Belfast does not keep records of all instances when language facilities other than English are required in dealing with non-English speaking passport applicants. All applications are made in English and when foreign documents support these and require translation, customers are asked to provide a translation from an independent and verifiable translator. Given the range of applications submitted from persons whose birth, marriage, divorce, or change of name may take place abroad, it is impossible to provide a definitive list of the number or type of translation services that may be required.</p>

Given the infrequency of the requirement for translation or interpreter services at Belfast, it would not be cost effective for IPS to make separate permanent provision for this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_501"><a name="90223w0035.htm_para9"><a name="0902249001090">The only exception arises in the case of interviews to authenticate identity at the regional office public counter at Hampton House High street Belfast or at the IPS Interview Office at Norwood House, Great Victoria street, Belfast.

 The following table gives the proportion of the budget requirement of each police force used to fund pension payments for the first two completed years under the current system of police pensions financing, 2006-07 and 2007-08. The information given for pensions expenditure, both as a figure and as a percentage of the total budget requirement, consists in each case of the employer contributions made in that year. The current system of police pensions financing was introduced in April 2006, whereby each police authority pays employer and officer contributions into a separate account out of which pensions are paid. Where the income into the police authority pensions account from contributions (plus other payments such as inward transfer values) is insufficient to meet the cost of pensions payment, it is topped up by Home Office grant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_520"><a name="90223w0039.htm_para3"><a name="0902249002081">These sums contributed to core Home Office expenditure priorities, including policing and other asset recovery measures. Similar sums were allocated in those periods to the police and other agencies involved in the recovery of criminal assets, under the Asset Recovery Incentive Scheme. Police forces have invested most of their monies from the incentive scheme in further developing their asset recovery and financial investigation capacity, with the funding of financial investigator posts, anti-money laundering teams, and asset recovery operations. In addition some funds were used on local projects to tackle gun and knife crime. The Metropolitan Police Service also made a grant to the Safer London Foundation. Other forces supported a range of community initiatives, including youth projects, road shows, prevention of doorstep crime, over 60s club, and equipment for a faith based community centre. Other agencies have also reinvested their shares in asset recovery activity.</p>

As at 31 August 2008, &#163;22 million of the sums allocated for performance in 2007-08 had not been spent. This is mainly due to the fact that allocations for performance in the fourth quarter of a financial year are not made to agencies until the first quarter of the following financial year. No data is available on unspent monies in 2008-09.</p>

 The Association of Chief Police Officers has issued guidance to forces to assist them in managing concerns and tensions within local communities during and following a counter terrorist operation.

At the same time, it provides police officers with an insight into Muslim community concerns and the impact that counter-terrorism operations can have upon those communities.

<i> [holding answer 22 January 2009]:</i> We have worked with ACPO and West Midlands Police since 2004-05 to establish a counter-terrorism capacity and capability outside London. The Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU) in Birmingham developed from this pilot work to become, in early 2007, one of three strategically located units of national assets placed under the local control of a lead force. The CTUs enhance, complement and support the work of police forces by providing coordination and specialist support to deliver our counter-terrorism strategy. West Midlands CTU has a broad operational capability that incorporates intelligence, investigation and surveillance functions. Personnel working within the unit have been responsible for a number of arrests and prosecutions as well as more discrete day-to-day prevention and disruption activity to counter the threat posed by terrorism.</p>

1. FAE:<br>
A FAE is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
2. Data quality:<br>
HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 national health service trusts, and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
3. Ungrossed data:<br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br>
4. Low numbers:<br>
Due to reasons of confidentiality, figures between one and five have been suppressed and replaced with &#147;*&#148;(an asterisk).<br>

 The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has received five written inquiries and three telephone inquiries, one of which related directly to one of the written inquiries, concerning sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) products used for desensitisation to allergies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_539"><a name="90223w0043.htm_para3"><a name="09022423000385">These products are unlicensed medicinal products and importation from elsewhere in the European Economic Area requires prior notification to the MHRA by a licensed importer. Notifications are assessed for regulatory compliance and for known issues with safety and quality and the MHRA may object to importation. In 2005 the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM, now the Commission on Human Medicines, (CHM) advised the MHRA that they should not object to the importation of unlicensed pollen based SLIT products, provided they were for use in non-asthmatic adults under the supervision of NHS specialists with access to resuscitation equipment. On this basis, the MHRA will object to importation of all non-pollen based SLIT products.</p>

 The core principles of the national health service apply across the United Kingdom and an inevitable and healthy consequence of devolution has been some divergence in health policy. Such divergence is entirely appropriate and provides an opportunity for each part of the NHS to innovate and experiment with different models for the provision and organisation of health care services within a common framework of NHS principles, and to learn from each other. NHS services in both England and Wales have seen significant improvement in recent years.</p>

1. Finished admission episodes&#151;A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
2. Cause Code&#151;Gunshot* wounds and Knife** related injuries. The cause code is a supplementary code that indicates the nature of any external cause of injury, poisoning or other adverse effects.<br>
3. Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) has used the following ICD-10 external cause codes when referring to gunshot wounds and knife related injuries.<br>
<i> Gunshot wounds*:</i><br>
W32&#151;Handgun discharge<br>
W33&#151;Rifle, shotgun and larger firearm discharge<br>
W34&#151;Discharge from other and unspecified firearms<br>

X94&#151;Assault by rifle, shotgun and larger firearm discharge<br>
X95&#151;Assault by other and unspecified firearm discharge<br>
Y22&#151;Handgun discharge, undetermined intent<br>
Y23&#151;Rifle, shotgun and larger firearm discharge, undetermined intent<br>
Y24&#151;Other and unspecified firearm discharge, undetermined intent<br>

<i> Knife related injuries**:</i><br>
W26&#151;Contact with knife, sword or dagger<br>

<i> Data Quality:</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts, and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of Independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Ungrossed Data:</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year. <i> Cause Code</i><sup>(1)</sup><sup>( )</sup>The cause code is a supplementary code that indicates the nature of any external cause of injury, poisoning or other adverse effects. Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) has used the following ICD-10 external cause codes as requested for this parliamentary question. It should be noted that this is not the full list of codes used to identify gunshot wounds and so the data should not be used to illustrate this. X93&#151;Assault by handgun discharge X94&#151;Assault by rifle, shotgun and larger firearm discharge X95&#151;Assault by other and unspecified firearm discharge.<br>
<i> Data quality</i><i> </i>HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. <i> PCT/SHA data quality</i><i> </i>PCT and SHA data was added to historic data years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data. <i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.  <i> Source:</i>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care.<br>

 The &#163;330 million announced for Maternity Matters covers three years, 2008-09 to 2010-11. This additional funding is included within the 2008-09 to 2010-11 primary care trust (PCT) revenue allocations. PCTs were informed of their revenue allocations for 2008-09 in December 2007. The 2009-10 and 2010-11 revenue allocations were announced on 8 December 2008. Revenue allocations for the year are made available to PCTs at the start of the financial year. We are in the first year of this additional funding and it is too early to assess the actual impact. However, through the national tariff money automatically flows to trusts when they do more maternity activity. In addition, the price itself for maternity services for 2008-09 has been uplifted by 10 per cent. compared to 2007-08, so even if there were no increase in activity, trusts would be getting 10 per cent. more. This equates to well over &#163;100 million over the current year and means that we know PCTs are passing on to trusts much more that the first year share of the &#163;330 million.</p>

The NHS Plan identified another 18 schemes to go ahead in the next two years under the PFI, bringing the total at the time to 87 schemes; the target of 100 was set in anticipation of more schemes being given the go ahead in future years. For example in addition to the 18 future PFI schemes identified in the NHS Plan, another 11 PFI schemes were given the go ahead shortly afterwards. Since then a number of other PFI and public capital funded projects have also proceeded and opened, which means that the NHS Plan target of opening 100 new hospital schemes was achieved in October 2008.</p>

The North Bristol/South Gloucestershire PCTs is the only health sector PFI scheme in the market at the moment and the two consortiums competing to be appointed preferred bidder have held discussions about current economic conditions and have factored this into their bids as part of the competitive process.

 The Department has asked the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) to oversee a new independent and transparent process for developing and reviewing Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) clinical and health improvement indicators for England from 1 April 2009 as part of their role in providing guidance for the NHS based on evidence of clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness. We launched a public consultation on the proposed new process on 30 October 2008. The consultation ended on 2 February. Subject to the outcome of that consultation, any proposal for further changes to QOF indicators would need to be considered under that new process.

 The cost of dispensing free prescriptions to those aged 60 and over in England in the community is estimated at between &#163;300 and &#163;350 million for the year 2008-09, where cost is assumed to be prescription charge revenue.</p>

The cost is calculated by estimating that 50 per cent. of those having to pay would purchase a prepayment certificate and the balance would pay a charge per item.</p>

 Vioxx (rofecoxib) was one of a relatively new group of anti-inflammatory medicines known as COX-2 selective inhibitors. It was licensed in the United Kingdom and many other countries for the treatment of arthritic conditions - osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis&#151;and also for the short-term treatment of some painful conditions. COX-2 selective inhibitors are effective anti-inflammatory, pain-relieving medicines that are thought to have less risk of gastrointestinal side effects, for example stomach ulcers, than conventional anti-inflammatory medicines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_662"><a name="90223w0060.htm_para1"><a name="09022423005675">Since 2000, evidence from clinical trials had raised concerns about a possible increased risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular conditions associated with Vioxx, and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)/Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) had continually reviewed the cardiovascular safety of this drug since it was first licensed. The product information for healthcare professionals and patients, which lists all the known side effects of the medicine, was updated on a number of occasions on the basis of emerging evidence, and in accordance with CSM&#146;s advice.</p>

The underlying medical condition of many patients treated with COX-2 inhibitors means that they are already at higher risk of heart attack and stroke than the rest of the population, and the impact of the COX-2 inhibitor on this risk is not possible to calculate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_664"><a name="90223w0060.htm_para3"><a name="09022423005677">Since Vioxx was voluntarily withdrawn by the manufacturer in 2004, the safety of other COX-2 inhibitors and traditional anti-inflammatory drugs&#151;non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)&#151;has been under continual and intense assessment in the UK and Europe. The latest evidence suggests that both NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors might pose a small increased risk of heart attacks or strokes, although the exact level of risk may vary between medicines. The MHRA has widely communicated the latest information and advice for healthcare professionals in letters and bulletins, and other publications through liaison with the British National Formulary and National Prescribing Centre. In addition, product information (including patient information leaflets) has been updated in order to support informed decision-making in relation to the choice of anti-inflammatory medicine.</p>

 The National Minimum Wage Act 1998 provides for penalties to be levied on an employer for non-compliance with an enforcement notice which requires them to pay the NMW and repay arrears to workers who have been underpaid the NMW. The enforcement is carried out by HM Revenue and Customs and by DEFRA in relation to the agricultural minimum wage. The Employment Act 2008 includes provisions to strengthen the enforcement regime of the NMW. These provisions, which will come into force on 6 April 2009, will replace the current enforcement and penalty notices with a single notice of underpayment imposing automatic penalties of between &#163;100 and up to &#163;5,000 for employers for non-compliance with the requirement to pay workers the NMW.</p>

The study will consider the existing relay service Text direct (also known as Type Talk which allows two way telephone conversations between deaf or speech impaired people), captioned telephony (where the relay assistant re-voices one end of the call into captions using speech recognition technology), Video relay (which enables sign language users to communicate with hearing people in real time, using a sign language interpreter based remotely) and internet protocol access to text relay (which would enable people to have fixed and mobile access to text relay via a PC with an internet connection, removing the need for specialist terminal equipment).</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change what research his Department has conducted into the scale of polar icepack melting in the Northwest Passage. [255188]</p>

<p><a name="st_625"><a name="09022441000520"><a name="90223w0065.htm_spnew5"><a name="09022441000903"><b>Joan Ruddock:</b>
 My Department funds the Met Office Hadley Centre (MOHC), through its Integrated Climate Programme with joint funding from the MOD and DEFRA, to monitor, understand and predict climate change; this research includes incorporating sea ice into global climate models to ensure best possible predictions on melting of Arctic sea ice. We also liaise with other research groups in the U.K. and internationally on this topic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_740"><a name="90223w0065.htm_para4"><a name="09022441000521">The Northwest Passage temporarily became fully open and navigable in summer 2007, for first time in recorded history, due to the record low extent (September average area: 4.28 million sq km) of Arctic sea ice melt. The same situation occurred in summer 2008, when the sea ice area (4.67 million sq km) was at its second lowest on record. Satellite monitoring data since 1979, available from the US National Snow and ice Data Centre (NSIDC) shows there has been a long-term decline in the extent of summer Arctic sea ice and that this decline has accelerated over the last decade; the long-term downward trend of around 10 per cent. per decade can be linked to human emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols. It is not yet clear if the much larger summer ice melt in the last two years is an acceleration of this long term trend or a short term variation around it. Recent analysis by the MOHC suggests that changes as large as the observed record low in 2007 can indeed result from natural year-to-year variability around the longer term downward trend; this provides confidence in the ability of the MOHC&#146;s climate model to simulate changes in the area of Arctic sea ice and its continuing decline. However, it is evident that climate models show a wide range of future predicted rates of sea ice decline. Whilst the IPCC&#146;s Fourth Assessment Report suggested the Arctic would be largely free of summer ice by 2100, many more recent models predict this will happen much sooner&#151;by the middle of this century or even earlier; several experts suggest there may possibly be no summer sea ice by the mid 2010s.</p>

For example, scientists from University College London recently reported that the thickness of the ice was significantly lower (by an average of 10 per cent.) during the winter of 2007-08 than during the previous five winters, indicating that the total volume of sea ice has decreased significantly. Though based only on satellite data (which are not ideal for measuring sea ice thickness), this result confirms previous evidence of decreasing sea ice thickness over the past three decades from US and UK submarine sonar measurements.</p>

Temperatures have already risen almost twice as quickly in the Arctic as in the rest of the world over the past 100 years. Sea ice retreat also has significant impacts on Arctic ecosystems, as many organisms (including certain species of fish) depend on its presence for survival. DECC is continuing to seek updated assessments of Arctic sea ice conditions and impacts from UK and international experts.</p>

<i> [holding answer 11 February 2009]:</i> The Government's policy on clean coal technologies was set out in the &#147;Strategy for Developing Carbon Abatement Technologies for Fossil Fuel Use&#148; in 2005 and more recently in the Energy White Paper, 2007. Clean coal technologies include: higher efficiency conversion processes; fuel switching to lower carbon alternative such as biomass co-firing; and C02 capture and storage (CCS). Some of these approaches will result in increased efficiency of the operation of the generation plant, but some such as CCS will require additional energy to operate.</p>

 The potential increase in taxation, as reported in Table 2 of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games annual report published January 2009, was the amount of corporation tax estimated to be payable on an anticipated receipt for the sale of the assets post-games. As a consequence of the decision, announced on 6 February 2009, to establish a dedicated 2012 Olympic Park Legacy Company, it is now more likely that the Company will benefit from that anticipated receipt and the corporation tax is now unlikely to be payable by the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_856"><a name="90223w0073.htm_para8"><a name="09022473000639">The increase in programme delivery costs is a result of CLM (ODA's Delivery Partner&#151;and incentivised to deliver to programme and against cost targets) achieving a higher level of key performance indicators than anticipated in the original budget leading to a consequential increase in performance related payments.

However, the nature of shooting is that athletes will usually buy their own equipment, specifically the guns used to train and compete, or these are provided by sponsors.</p>

The latter enables athletes to travel, attend training sessions and enter relevant competitions.

Electoral registration officers (EROs) have a duty to compile and maintain an accurate register and they have a number of mechanisms available to them in achieving this. It is a decision for independent EROs whether they initiate proceedings for non-completion of the annual canvass form.</p>

At the end of December 2008, our Jobseeker's Allowance claims clearance rate was an average of 10.4 days, against a target of 11.5 days. Whilst January figures have not yet been confirmed, we expect them to be at a similar level.</p>

Freshstart involves pre-arranging a New Jobseeker Interview to claim Jobseeker's Allowance at the prisoner's home Jobcentre Plus office for as soon as possible after they are released. The customer normally has an appointment with a Jobcentre Plus Adviser within 3 days of leaving prison. The process helps to speed up the receipt of benefit and aims to ensure that the offender engages with the Jobcentre at the earliest opportunity to allow them to gain appropriate support.</p>

This service is available if a prisoner reclaims benefits within 26 weeks of their last claim and their circumstances have not changed. There are simpler and shorter forms to complete and processing the benefit is eased.</p>

 The re-designation of HM Prison and Young Offender Institution Drake Hall and HM Prison and Young Offender Institution Morton Hall as closed prisons will allow the Prison Service to more properly provide for the needs of women suitable for each of the prisons. The effect of the change will allow for greater flexibility in the use of the estate; improving closeness to home and families for some women, allowing appropriate lifer and indeterminate sentenced women to be placed so as to better meet their needs, and in general enable more women to access the resettlement regimes available at the two prisons. There are no plans to move any of the women out of Drake Hall and Morton Hall as a result of the change. The change is essentially an administrative one, both establishments will retain their current levels of internal and perimeter security and their current resettlement regimes, including their roles as specialist foreign national centres. Women suitable for &#147;open&#148; or &#147;closed&#148; conditions will be able to go these prisons if such a move meets their resettlement needs.</p>

We will continue to raise this matter with the Kenyan government and look forward to hearing how the Kenyan government plans to progress the case.

<i> [holding answer 5 February 2009]:</i><i> </i>The European Council sets the direction for the EU through a process of negotiation between the 27 member states, and makes its decisions known through Council conclusions. Every six months the rotating EU presidency publishes a plan of action which is reported to the Council and contains a section on foreign policy. However, these papers do not rank foreign policy objectives in priority order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_946"><a name="90223w0081.htm_para2"><a name="09022473002080">The 2003 European Security Strategy (ESS) provides the framework for the EU&#146;s external action. In December 2008 the European Council endorsed the High Representatives Review of the implementation of the ESS. The ESS and the review suggest that Europe needs to be more active, more capable and more coherent in the external sphere and to work with partners in achieving its objectives. These include tackling distant threats such as terrorism and proliferation, with a focus on Iran and North Korea; building security in our neighbourhood including in the Balkans, the Middle East and the Mediterranean; and contributing to a well functioning international institutional system that is rule-based. The documents set out the need for the EU to tackle concerns over &#147;frozen conflicts&#148;, to push towards a settlement in the Middle East and to focus on ensuring energy security, including greater diversification of energy sources and a more unified energy market within the EU.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_947"><a name="90223w0081.htm_para3"><a name="09022473002081">The review makes clear the principle that states have a shared responsibility to protect populations, and that there is a link between security and development leading to the need for a comprehensive approach to conflict prevention and resolution combining all of the tools at the EU&#146;s disposal. The review also acknowledges the role that the EU has to play in conflicts further afield such as stabilising Afghanistan, and supporting UN objectives in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan/Darfur, Chad and Somalia. It also recognises the need for the EU to expand relationships with China and India and maintain close ties with Canada and Japan, and build on relations with Brazil and South Africa.</p>

<sup>(2 )</sup>Coefficients of Variation have been calculated for the latest period as an indication of the quality of the estimates, as described below:<br>
<i> Guide to Quality:</i><br>

However, we recognise that the graduate labour market will not be immune from the effects of the economic downturn. Although indications suggest that overall vacancies are likely to fall, there will still be growth areas. Graduates will need to consider a wide range of jobs; look for jobs earlier; and do research on potential employers to maximise their chances of success. We are also considering a number of ways to provide real help and support for new graduates including new opportunities for internships; promoting volunteering; the development of entrepreneurial skills; and increasing the availability over the next two years of Professional and Career Development Loans.</p>

<i> [holding answer 10 February 2009]:</i> The two types of student loan have different repayment terms. Borrowers with income-contingent loans introduced in 1998 repay 9 per cent. of earnings above &#163;15,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1028"><a name="90223w0092.htm_para13"><a name="0902259000152">Repayments are usually collected through the tax system via employers, alongside income tax and national insurance contributions.

<p><a name="stpa_1029"><a name="90223w0092.htm_para14"><a name="0902259000153">With both types of loan, repayment is due to start in the April after borrowers graduate or otherwise leave their course, if their income is above the relevant repayment threshold. This point is known as the Statutory Repayment Due Date (SRDD). Some borrowers fully repay before they are required to commence repayments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1030"><a name="90223w0092.htm_para15"><a name="0902259000154">The average time taken to fully repay mortgage-style loans is six years after SRDD, according to data at 31 March 2008. It is not yet possible to give a meaningful average time taken to repay income-contingent loans, because in terms of repayments the income-contingent loans scheme is still relatively young. The longest and shortest time taken to repay a loan cannot be disclosed as this could potentially identify an individual.</p>

<i> [holding answer 10 February 2009]:</i> Borrowers who graduated in 2002 with income-contingent loans would generally be included in the 2003 repayment cohort, i.e. those required to begin repaying loans from April 2003 if their income was high enough. The average annual repayment for this cohort was &#163;600 in tax year 2006-07, equivalent to a monthly repayment of &#163;50.

 The Department's first evaluation of the impact of the Licensing Act 2003 in March 2008 showed that the police have welcomed their new powers and provided evidence that local people are much better engaged than they were under the old licensing regime. Also, information and case studies we gathered from scrutiny councils as part of the review suggested that initial benefits were developing into longer term trends and that the Act is having a real impact on key issues such as crime and disorder and sales of alcohol to children. The Department does receive a number of letters, mainly from the public, where concerns are raised but it is not possible to categorically state which of these could be classified as complaints. We have always maintained that licensing is not the only solution to problems related to crime and disorder and nuisance and we continue to liaise with local authority representatives, police representatives, and other Government Departments (notably, the Home Office and the Department of Health, which have overall responsibility for the Government's renewed alcohol strategy) to develop new measures for combating these social problems.</p>

 Responsibility for what is broadcast on television and radio rests with the broadcasters and the organisations which regulate broadcasting&#151;the Office of Communications (Ofcom), the BBC Trust and the Welsh Fourth Channel Authority (S4C)&#151;within the overall framework set by the Communications Act 2003 and the BBC Charter and Agreement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1080"><a name="90223w0095.htm_para9"><a name="0902259000534">In relation to broadcasting, Parliament has charged Ofcom with maintaining standards, notably to protect children and to protect the general public from harmful and offensive material, including bad language. The Ofcom Broadcasting Code therefore sets out the rules with which broadcasters must comply. Ofcom also produces guidance notes to assist broadcasters in interpreting and applying the Broadcasting Code. In addition, the BBC&#146;s editorial guidelines, under the sovereignty of the BBC Trust, provide clear advice on the standards expected of all BBC content on television and radio. The S4C Compliance Guidelines also provide guidance on the standards expected of all content broadcast on S4C.</p>

 The Departments for Culture, Media and Sport and Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform considered the issue jointly when negotiating the Audio-Visual Media Services Directive, which maintains a distinction between the regulation of linear television and television on demand.

 As an outcome of the comprehensive spending review 2007, the Department announced new capital resources of &#163;9.3 billion, including &#163;3.4 billion of PFI credits, for the Building Schools for the Future and Academies programmes for the current period 2008-09 to 2010-11.

<i> [holding answer 12 February 2009]:</i><i> </i>The European Commission&#146;s proposal for a new regulation on bus and coach passenger rights would make operators liable for loss or damage resulting from the death, personal injury or mental harm to passengers caused by an accident while the passengers were on, entering or leaving the vehicle. In certain circumstances the operator would not be able to contest damages, although they would not be liable if the accident was the fault of the passenger or caused by the passenger&#146;s negligence. No assessment has been made of the likely effect of these provisions on trends in the number of spurious injury claims made by passengers. The Department will shortly be consulting on the European Commission&#146;s proposal to help inform the Government&#146;s position.</p>

This equates to roughly 50,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted by aircraft stacking at Heathrow in 2006-07.</p>
