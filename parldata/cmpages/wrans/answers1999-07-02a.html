<P>
<a name="90702w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. William Ross: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what is the cost to date of implementing the provisions of the Northern Ireland Arms Decommissioning Act 1997.  [88811]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90702w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 It is not possible to give the exact total cost to date as the expenditure incurred by the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning is shared with the Irish Government. To date, the British Government have contributed &#163;1,099,439, which represents approximately 50 per cent. of the total cost.

To ask the Chairman of the Administration Committee if he will make a statement on the extent of use of paper containing acid for (i) the <i>Official Report</i>, (ii) House of Commons printed papers and (iii) other House of Commons documents of record; and what assessment he has made of the estimated durability and life expectancy of paper copies of (i), (ii) and (iii).

<a name="90702w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Roe: </B> 
 The contract for the printing of the House's core documents (including the <i>Official Report</i>, Vote Bundle, Bills and Select Committee Reports) specifies the use of acid free paper of archival quality. The paper used has an alkali reserve of a minimum of 2 per cent., and an archival life in excess of 100 years.

 For information on the current standards for paper used for the <i>Official Report</i> and other House documents of record held by the Library, I refer the hon. Member to the answer given to him today by the Chairman of the Administration Committee, column <i>284.</i>
<P>

<a name="90702w01.htm_para1">The durability of older documents varies according to age, the type of paper used, the frequency of use and the storage conditions. The Library regularly monitors the condition of these documents and has a programme of conservation. It is aware of a particular problem with acidic paper used from about 1850 to 1950. Older Parliamentary Papers were moved in 1992 to controlled storage conditions in Broad Sanctuary, where there are also reserve volumes of the <i>Official Report</i>. The Library is investigating the feasibility of producing a digitised text of older <i>Official Reports</i>. As well as giving easy access to the text, this would also reduce use of the paper volumes and so aid their preservation.

 The total cash payments made by the Department for International Development (DFID) to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) between 1 January and 30 June 1999 amount to &#163;14.66 million. Of this total, we have contributed &#163;7 million to UNHCR's General and Special Programmes, &#163;3 million to a DFID/UNHCR scheme to support NGO Refugee projects, and &#163;4.66 million to specific country programmes and regional appeals.

<P>
<a name="90702w01.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Foulkes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 July 1999]:</i> We are presently exploring with the Department for Child Protection of the Government of Romania how best we can assist them, taking account of other donor support in this area.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90702w01.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Foulkes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 July 1999]:</i> We financed a Child Care project in Romania between 1995 and 1998. This provided advice on the framing of child care legislation, support for the development of model Centres for Family Support and Child Protection, and assistance at county council (judet) level with the development of sustainable and accountable services to vulnerable children and families. The total cost was about &#163;339,000. The project was managed by the European Children's Trust.
<P>

<a name="90702w01.htm_para4">In Bulgaria, we co-financed with the EU (Phare) a project to advise on child care legislation and good practices. We provided &#163;90,000 in 1998 for a three month study visit to the UK by child care practitioners. We have just started a &#163;300,000 project to advise the Ministries of Education, Health and Labour and Social Policy on alternatives to institutional child care. This is being managed by Save The Children Fund.
<P>

<a name="90702w01.htm_para5">We are also financing projects in south-eastern Europe to address the problems of refugee children in the region as a result of the Kosovo crisis. For example we have contributed &#163;300,000 to Save The Children Fund for regional programmes, which include non-formal education through local groups and volunteer teachers; &#163;160,000 to Children's Aid Direct for the distribution of school materials and equipment for Kosovo refugees and host communities in Macedonia; and an unearmarked sum of &#163;2.25 million to UNICEF for their activities in the region. UNICF are aiming to improve access to health care and primary education. They have been effective in developing and advocating child friendly spaces in camps and other locations. These spaces provide basic services for children and mothers such as baby care, pre-school, primary school, recreational activities, counselling and basic health and nutrition education.
<P>

<a name="90702w01.htm_para6"><P>

<a name="90702w01.htm_para7">Through the newly established Humanitarian Assistance Field Office in Pristina, we will continue to identify further areas of support in accordance with the needs of the returning refugees and the displaced people of Kosovo.

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 17 June 1999]:</i> The European Commission has been studying the feasibility of applying VAT to financial services, including insurance, since 1993. No proposal has been made.

<P>
<a name="90702w02.htm_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 We have made it very clear that the draft Directive on savings in its current form is unacceptable because of its likely impact on our financial markets. The Conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting on 1 December 1997 record that the United Kingdom considers the Directive should not apply to eurobonds and other similar instruments.

<P>
<a name="90702w02.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Prescott: </B> 
 Following the publication of the Government's Outline Changeover Plan, my Department is considering what preparations may be necessary for the introduction of the euro as far as its own areas of responsibility are concerned. Beyond this, my Department and the Government Offices for the Regions have no specific budget for euro preparations, neither do the Regional Development Agencies.
<P>

<a name="90702w02.htm_para1">Government advice for business on the implications of the introduction of the euro in the eurozone countries is co-ordinated by HM Treasury. Government support includes the setting up of 12 regional euro fora, in which the Government Offices for the Regions were involved and in which the Regional Development Agencies have been invited to participate.

<P>
<a name="90702w02.htm_spnew8"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Circle line service is not suspended. London Underground (LU) continues to operate services at all Circle line stations. Where possible, they are running extra trains on other lines to minimise passenger disruption.
<P>

<a name="90702w02.htm_para8">LU first informed officials in my Department in November 1997 that engineering works might necessitate the closure of the Circle line between High Street Kensington and Gloucester Road stations.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90702w02.htm_wqn9"><B> Mr. Redwood: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what are the closure dates for <i>(a)</i> the Circle line and <i>(b)</i> the Northern line.  [88603]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90702w02.htm_spnew9"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Engineering works between High Street Kensington and Gloucester Road, which are preventing a normal Circle line service from operating, began on 12 June 1999 and will continue to 16 August 1999. The Northern line City branch will be closed between Moorgate and Kennington from 3 July 1999 to 5 September 1999.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90702w02.htm_wqn10"><B> Mr. Redwood: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans have been made to provide alternative public transport for people who normally use the Northern and Circle lines. [88493]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90702w02.htm_spnew10"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Although engineering works are disrupting services, all Circle line stations remain open. London Underground are operating additional services on the Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines, along part of the route where Circle line services usually run, and a normal District line service along most of the rest of the Circle line. Additional buses are also running on routes 16, 23 and 52. Underground tickets and passes are valid on these buses.
<P>

<a name="90702w02.htm_para9">While the Northern line City branch is closed between Moorgate and Kennington, a rail replacement bus service will operate and there will be also be an enhanced service on the 133 bus which runs along the route. In addition, there will be a 15 per cent. increase in services on the Northern line Charing Cross branch. Alternative routes will be advertised and extra station staff will help to keep passengers informed.

<P>
<a name="90702w02.htm_spnew13"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 As all stations served by Circle line trains and many served by Northern line trains are also served by other lines, London Underground (LU) are not able to provide detailed line specific information in the format requested.
<P>

 By the term in my earlier answer "RDX in its its raw form", the intended meaning was "RDX or explosives containing RDX, not incorporated into other products such as ammunition or missiles." All of the licences and pending applications listed in my answer of 26 May 1999, <i>Official Report, </i>columns <i>200-01,</i> covered explosive mixtures containing RDX as a component at a range of concentrations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if governing bodies of sports currently with a unified Great Britain governing body will need to split into English, Scottish and Welsh bodies in order to have guaranteed eligibility for funding for the World Class Start and World Class Potential programmes from the English, Scottish and Welsh sports councils.  [89141]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90702w05.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 The World Class Potential and World Class Start development programmes have been formulated by Sport England to support young athletes in England. Other home countries have developed their own Lottery Sports Funded talent development programmes. British or UK governing bodies will not need to separate into English, Welsh, or Scottish bodies in order to secure such development funding. They will need to identify the home country of each nominated athlete in order to direct a funding request to the relevant Sports Council.

<a name="90702w05.htm_wqn9"><B> Mr. Fearn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what are the criteria set by the Government and the United Kingdom Sports Council for sports bodies to be included in the World Class Potential Programme; and on what basis basketball and hang-gliding are excluded.  [89140]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90702w05.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 Both basketball and hang-gliding are eligible to apply for Lottery Sports funding from the World Class Potential Programme. However, as World Class Potential funds are limited it may not be possible to meet the demands from all eligible sports, and priority will be given on the basis of criteria established by Sport England as the statutory distributor of Lottery Funds for Sport.
<P>

<a name="90702w05.htm_para4">I understand that Sport England's criteria include: the status of the primary competition; the likely degree of sporting success to be achieved within 10 years; and the significance to the public of both a particular sport and any likely competitive success.

<P>
<UL>(2) if, under the terms of the new financial directions for the allocation of Lottery funding, professional sporting bodies will be able to obtain funds for the non-professional side of their game.  [89143]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90702w05.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 Commercial organisations and professional sporting bodies are eligible to receive Lottery funds provided the projects for which Lottery funding is sought are intended to promote the public good, and are not intended primarily for private gain.

 Representatives of the independent British film distributors were included in the consultation exercise on my Department's spending review, which covered the establishment and remit of the Film Council. The report of that spending review, and the earlier Film Policy Review, made clear that one of the main objectives of the Film Council will be to assist the development of sustainable industry structures in the area of distribution.

 Future policy on the distribution of Lottery-supported films will be set out in the strategic plan on which the new Lottery distributor, the Film Council, will consult my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. The Film Council will consider a variety of issues in determining that policy, including the needs of the UK distribution sector; the importance of maximising public access to Lottery-supported films; and the importance of maximising the commercial benefits from the distribution of such films.

 It is for the European Commission to pub forward proposals for possible changes to the MEDIA II programme for member states to consider. Independent film distributors are eligible to receive support from the current MEDIA II programme to assist the trans-national distribution of European films.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many complaints the Benefits Agency has received in the past year from people who were not paid their pensions, having reached pensionable age; what discussions he has had with the Benefits Agency about the prompt payment of benefits; and if he will make a statement.  [89660]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90702w07.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The data requested are not available. In the 10 months up to 31 March 1999, the Benefits Agency target of processing 65 per cent. of its claims within 20 days was met in all but one of the months. Since April, the target has been 95 per cent. processed in 60 days and for April and May the percentages achieved were 94.9 and 94.7 respectively.
<P>

<a name="90702w07.htm_para1">Over the last year, more than 10 million people who were receiving their pensions a year ago have continued to receive them without interruption. Ministers have both met with and received written progress reports from Benefits Agency officials on the potential impact on pension and other benefit claims of the delayed implementation of NIRS2. The Benefits Agency has started to review cases that have been affected by the delays in implementing NIRS2 as planned.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90702w07.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Recent contacts with companies marketing non-instrumented drug test devices (litmus tests) capable of testing for a group of drug types suggests that an average price of &#163;6 per device would apply. The precise cost to the Prison Service for laboratory screening a similar group of drug types is commercial in confidence, although I can advise that it is comparable to that figure. However, if the result from a test is disputed, a more sophisticated and considerably more expensive confirmation test has to be carried out by a laboratory in order to meet the required standard of proof. The Prison Service uses laboratory screening because it produces the most reliable and consistent results and so minimises the number of confirmation tests required. For this reason the Prison Service does not authorise the use of non-instrumented drug test devices in mandatory drug testing.

<a name="90702w07.htm_wqn5"><B> Ms Drown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department in what circumstances, under the provisions of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Bill [Lords], the complainant in a rape trial could be denied screening from the defendant.  [89664]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90702w07.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Under clause 17(4) of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Bill, all complaints in sexual offence trials will benefit from a presumption that they are eligible for help with giving evidence. As the clause is currently drafted, a complainant would be considered ineligible for help if the court was satisfied that the quality of his or her evidence was not likely to be 



<P>
<P><I>2 Jul 1999 : Column: 309</I><P>
diminished by fear or distress. However, I am considering whether the presumption in clause 17 could be strengthened.
<P>

<a name="90702w07.htm_para7">Once a witness is deemed eligible, the court will go on to consider which (if any) of the special measures in the Bill, including screens, would be likely to improve the quality of his or her evidence. If it decides that a measure would improve the witness's evidence, it must award it. In reaching that decision, it will have to consider all the circumstances of the case. Those circumstances include the witness's views, and whether the measure might tend to inhibit the evidence being tested.
<P>

<a name="90702w07.htm_para8">So a court could decide that a rape complainant should not be screened from the defendant for one of the following reasons: the witness was ineligible for special measures; the witness did not want to be screened; another measure (perhaps live link, or clearing the court) would be more likely to maximise the quality of the witness's evidence; screens might inhibit the ability of the defence to cross-examine the witness; or, for some other reason, in all the circumstances of the case, the quality of the witness's evidence would not be maximised by being screened from the defendant. Having said that, I would not expect courts to commonly refuse screens for rape complainants who want them.

 The available information is that in the period between January and May 1999 3,455 applications for asylum in the United Kingdom were made by nationals of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, excluding dependants. 2,835 initial decisions were made, of which 2,165 were granted asylum and 165 were refused. 505 decisions were made under the pragmatic measures aimed at reducing the pre-1996 asylum backlog with the large majority being granted asylum and a small number exception leave to remain.

The Human Rights Act 1998 will give further effect in United Kingdom law to the rights and freedoms guaranteed in the Convention. It will not create any substantive new rights. A properly regulated and controlled CCTV system should therefore fully comply with the requirements of the Act.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department to whom the Video Appeals Committee is responsible; who appoints its members; and if he will make a statement.  [89662]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90702w08.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Section 4(3) of the Video Recordings Act 1984 requires the Secretary of State to be satisfied that adequate arrangements exist for appeals against classification decisions which submitting companies consider to be too strict. The Video Appeals Committee is the independent, appellate body set up for this purpose. Its members are selected by the British Board of Film Classification but it is independent of the Board and the Home Secretary. Although the Committee has no statutory authority, it has been the Board's practice to accept its decisions.

 Statutory responsibility for ensuring efficient fire services rests locally with the fire authority. However, the approval of my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary is required, under section 19 of the Fire Services Act 1947, if a fire authority wishes to close a fire station or reduce the number of its fire appliances or firefighting posts. West Yorkshire Fire and Civil Defence Authority applied on 23 April for his approval to the removal of four emergency tenders, including one in the Bradford Metropolitan Area, and associated firefighting posts. My right hon. Friend is considering this application in consultation with Her Majesty's Fire Service Inspectorate.

 We are providing considerable practical support for ECOMOG's efforts to consolidate the security situation in Sierra Leone. We believe that ECOMOG should continue to play an important role in providing security in Sierra Leone for the time being. We are encouraged by President Obasanjo's recent public commitment that Nigerian troops will remain in Sierra Leone until peace is guaranteed.
<P>

<a name="90702w09.htm_para11">Since September 1998, Britain has provided over &#163;4 million worth of practical logistic support to ECOMOG and the Government of Sierra Leone. As part of our new &#163;10 million package of assistance, we have made available a further &#163;5 million to provide further equipment for ECOMOG. We are providing logistic support in the form of vehicles and spares, boots, rations, tents, helicopter hours, and transportation of a new contingent, as well as light weapons and ammunition.
<P>

<a name="90702w09.htm_para12">The question of the total financial cost to ECOMOG to date of its deployment in Sierra Leone is a matter for the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).

 The British Government are active in seeking a peaceful and lasting solution to the conflict in the region of Abkhazia, Georgia. We are members of the group known as the Friends of the UN Secretary-General, which supports the parties in their efforts to find a negotiated settlement to the conflict. Most recently, the British Ambassador in Tbilisi joined representatives of the other Friends of the Secretary-General and the parties in UN-sponsored talks in Istanbul from 7 to 9 June. The UK currently has seven military observers in a UN mission (UNOMIG) monitoring the ceasefire in co-operation with the CIS Peacekeeping Force. The British Government fully support a solution to the conflict based on the territorial integrity of Georgia, and maximum autonomy for the region of Abkhazia.

 It is the policy of the British Government, together with the rest of the international community, to recognise the North Ossetian Autonomous Republic as part of the Russian Federation and the region of South Ossetia as part of Georgia. We fully support the efforts of the OSCE in South Ossetia to find a lasting settlement to the unresolved conflict in the region.

<P>

 The dangerous security situation in Chechnya limits opportunities for trade. Our strong advice is that visitors, including British business people, should not travel there because of the security risks. If a British company wished to trade with Chechnya without its staff travelling to the region, we would provide our normal services to British exporters.

 The Government fully recognise the potential problems that might occur as a result of date-related computer and embedded chip failures. That is why we are working closely with our international partners especially in the EU and with the G8 to minimise the potential impact both in the UK and overseas. The conclusions of the G8 and EU Heads of Government meetings that took place in June set out clearly our priorities. A copy of both sets of conclusions can be found in the Library of the House.

 As a member of the G8, Russia is working closely with its international partners to address the issue of millennium compliance across all sectors including energy and defence. It is not possible to give an accurate estimate of the costs involved. There is no evidence to suggest that ballistic missiles are affected by millennium date problems. The Russian electricity generation and distribution company has stated that it is increasingly confident that it will be able to continue to supply electricity over the date change period.

Another 22 per cent.--or 9,270--were still on the New Deal and either on the point of entering another option or receiving intensive help to find a job. Of those young people who had left New Deal after participating in the FTET option, 54 per cent. with known destinations had entered jobs and roughly 27 per cent. of all leavers--including those who did not disclose a destination--had done so.
