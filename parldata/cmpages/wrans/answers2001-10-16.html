<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11016w01.html_spnew7"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Improved co-operation is being encouraged through the Health Act 1999 flexibilities&#151;pooled funds, lead commissioning and integrated provision, especially in intermediate care, community equipment and nursing care. Care trusts can now be formed as single organisations, commissioning and providing both health and social care. Fifteen care trust demonstrator sites are preparing to go live from April 2002 to April 2003, receiving financial support for the preparatory period from the money recently announced to reduce bed blocking. Co-operation on the use of this money will be supported by the capacity planning being carried out by the local health and social care economy.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11016w01.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Diagnostic services are key in meeting NHS Plan targets. Central procurement programmes for CT and MRI scanners are already delivering improvements in the diagnostic quality of images, supporting the work of clinicians and benefiting patients. Over the last two years we have invested &#163;20 million in supporting innovative pathology modernisation projects and a further &#163;8 million is being made available this year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11016w01.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Human reproductive cloning cannot and will not be carried out in the United Kingdom. Treatment using human embryos requires a licence from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which has stated that it would not issue a licence for reproductive cloning. Anybody carrying out such treatment without a licence would be guilty of a criminal offence. We will introduce primary legislation to put this ban on a statutory footing as soon as parliamentary time allows.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11016w01.html_spnew10"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 There are well established clinical procedures in the NHS for dealing with osteoporosis. We have included specific targets for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in the National Standards Framework for Older People.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is responsible for the provision of dental services in England. Provision of services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the devolved bodies.
<P>

<a name="11016w02.html_para0">In September 1999, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister promised that within two years everyone will be able to access national health service dentistry if and when they want it via NHS Direct. All health authorities in England now have in place dentistry action plans to ensure that everyone in their local area can access NHS dentistry if they want it within a reasonable time and distance. The plans identify shortfalls in service provision and ways of tackling unmet demand.
<P>

<a name="11016w02.html_para1">We have invested over &#163;100 million of additional funding in NHS dentistry in the last two years. Dental access centres offering a complete range of services to unregistered patients, are operating from over 100 sites and more are being developed. Funding has been made available to general dental practitioners to encourage them to treat more NHS patients. In addition regulations have been introduced allowing health authorities to use their own resources to access NHS dentistry tailored to the needs of their local communities.
<P>

<a name="11016w02.html_para2">Information for patients on NHS dentistry via NHS Direct has been available nationally since the end of September. Callers seeking access to NHS dentistry will from now on be provided with information about the availability of NHS dental services within a reasonable distance of their homes.

<a name="11016w02.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Currently there is one dentist in Scarborough Town and another some three miles away in East Ayton accepting new National Health Service patients. There are also dentists in Whitby and Kirkbymoorside accepting new NHS patients. Additional resources have been allocated to a general dental practice in Scarborough to enable it to treat more unregistered NHS patients. The health authority has set up dental access centres in Scarborough, Whitby and York. The demand for these services is high and the health authority is considering expanding these dental access centres.

<P>
<a name="11016w02.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 In the NHS Plan we made a commitment to set national targets for reducing unacceptable inequalities in health which consistently widened under the last Government. In February of this year two new national targets for reducing health inequalities in infant mortality and life expectancy were announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and at present we are consulting widely on the actions necessary to deliver them. Copies of the consultation document, "Tackling Health Inequalities", are available in the Library.

 In response to the anticipated population growth over the next few years Huntingdonshire Primary Care Trust opened a new general practitioner practice in Huntingdon in March of this year. There are currently two GPs in the practice but the building has the capacity to accommodate four GPs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) which categories of person, on the basis of age, marital status, duration of residence in UK, contribution record, immigration status, nationality and other characteristics, are eligible for <i>(a)</i> free emergency treatment in NHS hospitals, <i>(b)</i> free non-emergency treatment in NHS hospitals, <i>(c)</i> free treatment by NHS general medical practitioners, <i>(d)</i> free treatment by NHS dental practitioners and <i>(e)</i> NHS drug prescriptions;  [7954]

<P>
<a name="11016w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 There is no charge for any treatment given in a hospital accident and emergency department regardless of the personal circumstances of the patient. Patients who are not normally resident in the United Kingdom may be charged for any other treatment given by an NHS trust or primary care trust if they, or the treatment they are being given, are not specifically exempt from charges under the terms of the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 1989, as amended. Copies of these regulations are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="11016w04.html_para0">The regulations place an obligation on health authorities, NHS trusts and primary care trusts to determine if a patient should be charged for their hospital treatment and, if so, to make and recover a charge for that treatment.
<P>

<a name="11016w04.html_para1">There is no separately identifiable record held centrally of the amounts recovered from charge-liable overseas patients or the amount outstanding from them at any one time.
<P>

<a name="11016w04.html_para2">There is no charge for any treatment which a general medical practitioner regards as emergency or immediately necessary, regardless of the personal circumstances of the patient. General medical and dental practitioners have discretion to accept or reject any patient, whether ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom or not, for NHS treatment subject, in the case of dentistry, to the same charges as other UK residents. They are advised however to offer private treatment if it appears that a patient has come to the UK specifically to obtain treatment. Guidance on the eligibility of overseas patients to free primary care has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="11016w04.html_para3">Patients who are entitled to NHS hospital treatment or who have been accepted as NHS patients by a general practitioner or dentist are entitled to prescriptions on the same basis as other UK residents.

<a name="11016w04.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2001]:</i> We recognise the critical importance of this issue and agree that children should have access to medicines that have been fully evaluated to the same high standards of safety, quality and efficacy as those available for the adult population. The issue is not confined to the United Kingdom, but affects the whole of Europe and the United States. Medicines regulation in the UK derives largely from European legislation and an international approach to the issue is therefore needed.
<P>

<a name="11016w04.html_para4">We have consequently raised the profile of this issue at a European level, including taking the lead in developing a European guideline, adopted in 1997, to encourage companies to undertake appropriate clinical trials on the use of medicines in the treatment of children. This formed the basis for an international guideline, which came into operation in January in the EU, and also applies in the USA and Japan. In addition, the Council of the European Union has asked the European Commission to bring forward measures to make sure that medicines for children are fully adapted to their specific needs. We are presently waiting for their proposals. However, the Commission has stated its intention to comply with this request. The UK will play an active role in the development of this initiative to ensure that effective solutions are found.
<P>

<a name="11016w04.html_para5">In addition, the Committee on Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP), the scientific advisory committee of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA), recognising the importance of this topic has announced its intention to set up a Paediatric Expert Group to advise the EMEA and its scientific committees on all questions relating to the development and use of medicinal products in children. The UK has nominated representatives to this Paediatric Expert Group.
<P>

<a name="11016w04.html_para6">In the meantime, the UK Government have taken important steps to address the issue at a national level within the existing regulatory framework. The Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM), an independent expert committee that advises the Licensing Authority has established a Paediatric Sub-Group to provide expert advice on the regulatory strategy to improve the availability of medicines licensed for use in children. MCA now routinely asks companies for paediatric development plans where appropriate. Pharmaceutical companies are required by the Licensing Authority to provide dosage information in the Summary of Product Characteristics when a Marketing Authorisation for their

<P><I>16 Oct 2001 : Column: 1135W</I><P>
medicinal product is granted or amended in the UK. This dosage information must be supported by the findings from clinical trials undertaken in the relevant adult or paediatric patient population.
<P>

<a name="11016w04.html_para7">The safety of all medicines whether licensed, used outside the terms of their licence, or unlicensed, is monitored by the Medicines Control Agency and CSM. Various data sources are used for monitoring safety including: the UK Yellow Card Scheme for reporting suspected adverse drug reactions, suspected adverse drug reaction reports from abroad, the world-wide medical and scientific literature, clinical trial reports and periodic safety updates from manufacturers. The UK Yellow Card Scheme acts as an early warning system for drug safety hazards but is not a scheme for recording all suspected adverse reactions that occur in the UK. Data from the Yellow Card Scheme cannot, therefore, provide estimates of the incidence of adverse reactions, including fatal adverse reactions occurring in children. The CSM Working Group on Paediatric Medicines also advises on the collection of information on adverse reactions in relation to unlicensed use of medicines in children.

<P>
(3) if the forward equipment programme contains full functioning for type 45 destroyers;  [6985]

<P>
(7) when the last of the new type 45 destroyers is expected to enter service with the Royal Navy.  [6986]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11016w05.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 On current plans, we expect that the first type 45 destroyer will enter service with the Royal Navy in 2007 and that the last will enter service in 2014.
<P>

<a name="11016w05.html_para0">We have yet to decide where the type 45 destroyers will have their base port. The decision is the subject of on-going work which will also take account of the base porting requirements of other vessels in the procurement programme such as the Future Aircraft Carrier and the Future Surface Combatant.
<P>

<a name="11016w05.html_para1">The forward equipment programme includes funding for up to 12 type 45 destroyers. Capability upgrades included in the type 45 incremental acquisition plan will be funded within the type 45 programme budget. Other capability upgrades, including those to reflect future changes in defence requirements and technology advances, would be funded as appropriate.
<P>

<a name="11016w05.html_para2">The currently planned complement of the type 45 is approximately 190 personnel, of whom around 20 will be officers and 170 other ranks. We are continuing to 



<P>
<P><I>16 Oct 2001 : Column: 1137W</I><P>
examine the scope for driving down the complement even further and to introduce a more flexible and adaptable style of crewing. Accommodation standards will be significantly better than in earlier classes of warship.
<P>

<a name="11016w05.html_para3">BAE Systems Electronics, the Prime Contractor, has selected a consortium comprising Alenia Marconi Systems and BAE Systems Combat and Radar Systems to develop and manufacture a Command System, known as the Combat Management System, specifically for the type 45.
<P>

<a name="11016w05.html_para4">Assuming a class of 12 type 45s, we expect that nine or 10 ships would, on average, be available at any one time to the Commander-in-Chief Fleet for tasking, while two or three would be undergoing maintenance, including one or two in refit.
<P>

<a name="11016w05.html_para5">In most operations we currently expect to have a Lynx helicopter embarked on the type 45 destroyer. The type 45 will also be interoperable with the Merlin helicopter. The type 45 destroyer will be a versatile platform, able to operate a variety of other helicopters; the ship's large flight deck can take helicopters up to and including Chinook size.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11016w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has made clear, we support the further enlargement of NATO when the political and military conditions agreed at the 1997 Madrid and 1999 Washington Summits are met. To support this process, we are assisting aspirants with their preparations through the Membership Action Plan, which was launched at the 1999 Washington Summit. The main objectives are to promote defence reform and restructuring within a democratic context and to support the development of flexible, modern armed forces capable of contributing to peace-keeping operations. Assistance takes many forms including: English language training to support interoperability; the secondment of military and civilian advisers to aspirant countries; the provision of a wide range of training opportunities including Non-Commissioned Officer training at the permanent British Military Advisory and Training Team based in the Czech Republic; exercise opportunities in the UK and in aspirant countries; seminars on specialist subjects; and high-level visits.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how much the Sustained Hypersonic Flight Experiment programme is expected to cost; for how many years the programme is projected to last; and if he will make a statement.  [7337]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11016w05.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Sustained Hypersonic Flight Experiment is an experimental programme with the primary aim of obtaining vital engineering data to allow the Ministry of Defence to determine the credibility and risk levels associated with the development and future possible procurement of hypersonic cruise missiles.

<P>

<a name="11016w05.html_para6">The programme is expected to last for six years. The first year is a preliminary study costing &#163;172,000. The cost to MOD for the following five years is expected to be approximately &#163;1 million per annum.
<P>

<a name="11016w05.html_para7">The programme will be reviewed at the end of the first year and again at the end of the third year to ensure its aims remain viable and that the project has a manageable level of technical risk before continuation funding is released.
<P>

<a name="11016w05.html_para8">An important part of the preliminary study phase is to seek international collaborative partners to increase the overall value of this research programme to MOD.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11016w05.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence to which countries the UK has exported small arms; how much revenue was generated from such sales in each of the past five years; and if he will make a statement.  [7338]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11016w05.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Government's Annual Reports on Strategic Export Controls (Part III) provide details of the number of weapons and small arms exported, by country. Information on the total value of guns, small arms and parts exported in each of the last five years has been published in the Ministry of Defence publication "UK Defence Statistics 2001" (Table 1.13), which is available in the Library of the House. In both cases the definition, which is based on Customs Tariff codes, includes large as well as small calibre weapons.
<P>

<a name="11016w05.html_para9">The UK is not a major exporter of small arms. It is Government policy that small arms which are declared surplus by the Ministry of Defence&#151;other than automatic weapons which are routinely destroyed&#151;are made available only to Governments, for use by acceptable military, paramilitary and police organisations, either directly or through duly licensed entities authorised to procure weapons.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will increase spending on long range strike weapons; and if he will make a statement.  [8032]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11016w05.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The UK invests a significant amount of money in its long range strike weapons capability. The Tomahawk Land Attack Missile has already demonstrated its worth in Kosovo and the current operation against international terrorism; the Tornado GR1 to GR4 conversion is proceeding well, with upgraded aircraft now in service; new GPS Interim Precision Guided Bombs are due to enter service at the end of this month; and we are planning to take delivery of the Stormshadow conventional air launched stand off missile next year.
<P>

<a name="11016w05.html_para10">The UK's requirements for long range deep strike weapons are, however, kept under constant review. Decisions on whether there is a need for increased spending will be taken as and when gaps in the UK's existing capability are identified.
<P>

<a name="11016w05.html_para11">We are also currently reviewing our future requirements for long range strike weapons as part of the Future Offensive Air Capability Study. This study is examining the deep strike capability that the UK will need

<a name="11016w05.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the projected cost is of his Department's collaborative effort to develop, produce, and support the Meteor Beyond-Visual-Range-Air-to-Air Missile; how much of this development will be carried in the UK; which UK companies are involved in this project; and if he will make a statement.  [7323]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11016w05.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 To the UK, the whole life cost of the Meteor missile will be in the region of &#163;1.5 billion. This figure includes the cost of development, production and in-service support. Some 35 per cent. of the work undertaken during the development phase will be carried out in the UK, and matches the UK's financial contribution to that phase.
<P>

<a name="11016w05.html_para12">Matra BAE Dynamics (UK) (MBD) will be the prime contractor for the Meteor programme with Alenia Marconi Systems, Royal Ordnance, Roband, Fairey Hydraulics, BAE Systems&#151;Systems and Sensors Division, and Missile and Space Batteries acting as first level UK sub-contractors.
<P>

<a name="11016w05.html_para13">Subject to conclusion of a Memorandum of Understanding with all of our partner nations, and negotiation of satisfactory contractual terms and conditions with MBD, we hope to be able to place a demonstration and manufacture contract for Meteor by the end of this year.

 Under current practice, reports on annual monitoring surveys of the marine and terrestrial environment are provided to Dumfries and Galloway Council, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, and placed in the Library of the House. On 28 March 2001, the Ministry of Defence produced reports containing results from the 1999 marine and terrestrial environment monitoring surveys&#151;copies are held in the Library of the House under reference DEP01&#150;872. Reports for the 2000 monitoring surveys are being prepared and will be published shortly. This practice will continue. In addition to the routine marine and terrestrial environmental surveys, a more general survey to try to find any previously undetected depleted uranium (DU) fragments is currently being conducted at the range and results will be published next year.
<P>

<a name="11016w06.html_para0">MOD has no plans to produce an annual report outlining future DU firing at the Kirkcudbright Training Area range. Further firings may be required while the ammunition remains in service, and I will publicise the details when plans are agreed.

I regret that the figure of &#163;250M for whole life costs, given in the answer of 25 July 2000, related to support costs alone and was intended to be additional to the quoted procurement costs.

Mr Khoo questioned the Agency's right to make any restrictions on access to the area, and asked why such concerts could not be held in one of the other Royal Parks instead.</FONT></UL>

 We understand that no other EU state was granted access to their detained nationals ahead of British consular officials. However, detainees were held in several widespread locations, so it is impossible to confirm definitively which nationals were seen first on Wednesday 25 July, when access was finally granted. Our Consul visited one detainee in hospital as early as Sunday 22 July. British consular officials had visited all of our detainees ahead of most other EU states. American officials were the first to gain access to their nationals in the detention centres.

 UN Security Council resolution 1373 (2001), adopted on 28 September, is the first resolution to impose obligations on all states to respond to the global terrorist threat. It focuses on two key areas: suppressing the financing of terrorism and denying terrorists a safe haven from which to operate. The United Kingdom Permanent Representative to the United Nations has been appointed Chairman of the Security Council committee that will monitor the implementation of this Resolution.
<P>

<a name="11016w08.html_para12">The United Kingdom is obliged to implement immediately the mandatory provisions of the resolution. The Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2001, the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) (Overseas Territories) Order 2001, the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) (Isle of Man) Order 2001 and the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) (Channel Islands) Order 2001 were adopted by the Privy Council on 9 October 2001 and came into force on 10 October 2001. They will implement the mandatory provisions on terrorist financing in the United Kingdom, the Overseas Territories and the Crown Dependencies.
<P>

<a name="11016w08.html_para13">The orders have been made under section 1 of the United Nations Act 1946. They implement paragraph 1(c) and (d) of the resolution by restricting the making available of any funds or financial services to terrorists and providing powers to freeze accounts of suspected terrorists. Paragraph 1(b) on criminalising fundraising for terrorist purposes can be implemented through the Terrorism Act 2000 in the United Kingdom. However, a specific provision on fundraising is included in the Overseas Territories, Isle of Man and Channel Islands Orders. Copies of all four orders have been placed in the Libraries of the House.

 My Department and the Department of Culture, Media and Sport have made available to Parliament dummy orders, that is drafts of possible orders using the powers in the Bill as they currently stand. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of the House. They are also available from my Department's library and on our website (www.dti.gov.uk/export.control). These dummy orders have been provided to assist Parliament in its scrutiny of the Bill by providing a clear indication of how the Government would propose to use the powers that would be conferred by the Bill.
<P>

<a name="11016w09.html_para6">We intend, however, to hold a full public consultation on drafts of the orders to be made following enactment of the Bill. This public consultation, which we currently expect to hold in the spring, will provide interested parties with an opportunity to comment on the details of secondary legislation that the Government propose to introduce under the Bill. We currently expect the dummy orders to be the basis for preparation of these draft orders for full public consultation.
<P>

<a name="11016w09.html_para7">The provisions in the dummy orders are based both on existing secondary export control legislation, consolidated and rationalised where appropriate, and on the Government's proposals for new controls to be introduced under the Bill. Proposals for new controls were set out in the Consultation Document on the Draft Bill (Cm 5091) published in March 2001.

<P>

<a name="11016w09.html_para8">The Consultation Document sought views on options for certain aspects of the new controls on technical assistance and trafficking and brokering. The provisions of the dummy orders reflect decisions taken on these options in the light of the consultation results. Views were sought on whether controls on the provision of technical assistance to embargoed destinations should be introduced on a unilateral basis. The Government have concluded that such unilateral action is unlikely to be effective but we will use the powers in the Bill to implement requirements in international embargoes to impose controls on technical assistance. This will enable a higher maximum penalty to apply. In addition, as explained in the Consultation Document, the Government propose to introduce controls on the provision of technical assistance to weapons of mass destruction and related missile programmes.
<P>

<a name="11016w09.html_para9">The Consultation Document proposed the introduction of controls on trafficking and brokering to embargoed destinations, of equipment whose export we have banned because of evidence of its use in torture and of long-range missiles that would apply to the activities of United Kingdom persons overseas as well as to activities carried out in the United Kingdom. The Consultation Document also set out proposals for additional controls on trafficking and brokering. Views were sought on whether these additional controls should apply to all equipment on the "Military List" (the "Military List" is contained in existing export control legislation) or just to weapons, ammunition and certain other key military or paramilitary items. Views were also sought on whether these additional controls should apply to the activities of United Kingdom persons carrying out activities wholly abroad as well as to activities taking place in the United Kingdom. The Government have concluded, in the light of the consultation held, that these additional controls should apply to all equipment on the "Military List" and to activities, any part of which takes place in the United Kingdom, but not to the activities of United Kingdom nationals carried out wholly abroad. The Government will, however, as noted above, apply controls on trafficking and brokering by United Kingdom persons overseas of equipment used in torture and long-range missiles and trafficking and brokering by such persons to embargoed destinations. The Government will press for international embargoes to be imposed on countries in conflict.
<P>

<a name="11016w09.html_para10">Finally, the Consultation Document also sought views on proposals to replicate the current licensing regime for exports of objects of cultural interest. In the light of responses which broadly welcomed these proposals, the dummy order on the export of objects of cultural interest reflects the proposals contained in the Consultation Document.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11016w10.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Department makes and publishes projections of UK gas supply and demand, for example in 'Energy Projections for the UK' published in November 2000 and in the annual "Brown Book". In DTI's submission to the current Performance and Innovation Unit Energy Review, projections of supply and demand consistent with these publications were presented which suggest that the UK could become a net importer of gas on an annual basis by 2005 or soon thereafter. There is, 



<P>
<P><I>16 Oct 2001 : Column: 1159W</I><P>
though, uncertainty on both the supply and demand projections, not least since both can be affected by changes in energy prices. Most outside commentators are also currently forecasting net imports from around 2005&#150;06. At times of high demand in the winter, the UK is already a net importer of gas, as it was before 1997.
<P>

<a name="11016w10.html_para13">Looking further ahead, to 2010, there is greater uncertainty, so it is possible only to speculate on a likely range of estimates for net imports in that year. Allowing for an effect on gas demand from the full Climate Change Programme announced in November 2000, and assuming production by then of at least some of the discovered gas reserves which are currently classified as possible and of some as-yet-undiscovered gas reserves, an import range of between 15 and 55 billion cubic metres is indicated.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what percentage of the UK's energy she expects to be sourced from gas by 2020; and what by percentage the countries of origin of the gas will be.  [7379]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11016w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Future estimates of the proportion of gas in UK primary energy demand in 2020 are naturally subject to considerable uncertainty. My Department's paper, 'Energy Projections for the UK' <sup>1</sup> , suggests that under a number of assumptions, including possible future economic growth and fossil fuel prices, gas will supply a little under 50 per cent. of primary energy demand in 2020.
<P>

<a name="11016w11.html_para0">It is anticipated that much of the UK's gas will, by then, be imported. With the commissioning of the Bacton-Zeebrugge interconnector in October 1998 and the opening of the Vesterled link with Norway in October 2001, the UK is an integral part of the European gas network. Further links are likely. Europe's indigenous production is expected to decline by 2020 but it is relatively well situated close to more than two thirds of the world's proven gas reserves. The UK's gas could come from a variety of sources with suppliers of pipeline gas likely to include Norway, Russia and countries in the Caspian Basin and North Africa. The share that comes from each in 2020 will be determined by commercial considerations and supply-demand pressures in Europe both before and at that time. It is also possible that the UK will again import Liquefied Natural Gas that could come from some of the above countries but also from more distant sources such as the Middle East, Nigeria and Trinidad and Tobago.

<P>
<a name="11016w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Under legislation introduced after the oil crises of the 1970s, and the economic damage caused by the two oil price hikes, each European member state has an obligation to keep stocks of oil that can be made available in the event of any disruption to international oil supplies. As part of this obligation, the UK is required to hold stocks of oil products (including motor spirit) or crude oil equivalent equal to or above 67.5 days' worth of consumption at any one time. To ensure that the UK meets these obligations, my Department regularly monitors the levels of stocks of crude oil and oil products held in the UK. The latest data available are provisional data for stocks as at 31 August 2001, which show the UK as having 4.2 million tonnes of motor spirit (including a contribution from stocks of crude oil that will be refined into products), equal to 72 days' worth of consumption. This is considered to be more than adequate, especially given the level of our indigenous resources of crude oil, to meet the UK's needs or UK contribution to any international response to an oil supply shortage.

<P>

 The Department has made no independent assessment of the likely growth in fossil fuel use over the next 20 years outside the UK. Assessments of future fossil and other energy uses are, however, undertaken by a number of organisations, including the International Energy Agency and the US Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration. These organisations typically produce annual reports covering such work.
<P>

<a name="11016w12.html_para0">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has had no discussions with her EU counterparts on the ratification of the Kyoto Agreement as that issue is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. I understand that ratification of the Kyoto Protocol will be discussed at the Environment Council on 29 October.

<a name="11016w12.html_para1">Since 1976 reprocessing contracts with overseas customers have included a provision to return the resulting wastes back to the country of origin. Government policy remains that radioactive waste arising from overseas should not be stored in the UK.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what commitments have been given to UK airlines since 11 September about <i>(a)</i> insurance cover for terrorist risk, <i>(b)</i> compensation for compulsory grounding, <i>(c)</i> the reallocation of unused slots, <i>(d)</i> compensation for extra security, <i>(e)</i> the payment of passenger ticket taxation and <i>(f)</i> state assistance to offset financial losses; and what representations have been received in respect of each of the above.

<a name="11016w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 October 2001]:</i> The aviation industry has made a number of representations to the Government about the financial difficulties that it faces as a result of the downturn in passenger demand following the terrorist attacks on 11 September. The Government have taken action to provide temporary third party insurance cover for war and terrorism risk, but no commitments have been given in respect of any other requests. The European Commission has now produced guidelines on what financial assistance they might allow member states to provide to airlines, and these will be discussed at the Transport Council meeting on 16 October.

The Government will continue to provide six-monthly updates to Parliament on the cost of the consultancy work for the PPP and the restructuring of London Underground. The next report will also provide an assessment of the expected final outturn.
<P>

<P>
<a name="11016w13.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 October 2001]:</i> The Government's plans for a publicly run, privately built Tube will deliver around &#163;13 billion of investment to improve the underground's infrastructure over the next 15 years. The Secretary of State has stated that these plans will go ahead only if they demonstrate value for money.
<P>

<a name="11016w13.html_para1">To assess whether this is the case, London Transport and its advisers are carrying out a thorough evaluation of the cost and value for money of bids. My Department is also commissioning Ernst and Young to carry out an independent review of London Transport's evaluation to ensure that it is completed on a fair and robust basis. Ernst and Young's review will be published, but not before London Transport has completed its negotiations with bidders.

<a name="11016w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Between 17 October 2000 and 1 October 2001, no public money was paid direct to Railtrack, but its profitability during that period was contingent on public money. For example, in 2000&#150;01, some 85 per cent. of Railtrack's &#163;2,476 million income was paid to it in access charges by train operating companies, which were paid &#163;847 million in Support for Passenger Services (SPRS) by the Franchising Director and the Strategic Rail Authority.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11016w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Driving Standards Agency has 327 driving examiners nationwide who are qualified to conduct PCV practical driving tests. In addition there are 68 examiners employed by bus and coach companies authorised to conduct PCV practical tests of drivers in those companies and a further 114 fire service and police examiners authorised to conduct practical PCV tests for drivers in their authorities.
<P>

<a name="11016w13.html_para4">The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency is running a scheme for a faster service for applications for provisional bus driving licences in response to a request from the Confederation of Passenger Transport. The scheme was initially trialled by several companies nominated by the Confederation before being extended to all bus companies on 1 May 2001. DVLA will turn around applications made under the scheme within 48 hours of receipt and provide a faxed letter of entitlement to drive on the same day the application is processed.

 I am today announcing a review to be undertaken by my Department, as to the future of English Partnerships. I have decided to bring forward the quinquennial review due in 2003 to ensure that the future of English Partnerships is given greater clarity and focus. The terms of reference for the whole review are set out as follows.
<P>

<a name="11016w14.html_para2">During the review we will be seeking the views of a wide range of interested organisations. We expect to complete the first stage of the review examining the role of English Partnerships by the end of this year. Subject to confirmation of their continued existence, we aim to complete the review of the structure and skills of the organisation by Easter, to ensure that English Partnerships can deliver their new role. I will publish the findings of the first stage of the review in the New Year.

 It is for each college to agree annual pay rises and conditions of employment with its staff in the context of the overall resources available to them.

<P>

<a name="11016w15.html_para0">This year alone an additional &#163;527 million is available for FE, a 4 per cent. real terms increase on last year.

<a name="11016w15.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Threshold assessment has enabled over 200,000 teachers in England and Wales to have their professional effectiveness confirmed and gain a substantial pay increase. The number of first-round applicants was exceptionally large and its successful implementation is a tribute to the professionalism of everyone involved, particularly head teachers. The number of second-round applicants will be much smaller, guidance and training materials have been improved and heads will be able to build on their first round experience. Accordingly, the second round of threshold assessment will be much less time consuming for heads than the first.

 The New Opportunities Fund ICT teacher training is being provided to ensure that serving teachers feel confident and are competent to teach using ICT within the curriculum. The effective use of ICT in the classroom will reduce rather than increase the burden on teachers, by equipping them to access and use a much wider range of teaching aids. The flexibility of the New Opportunities Fund programme minimises the cost to the school as the training budget itself is not charged to an individual school.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what funding per pupil was provided to grant maintained schools in the London borough of Havering in the year immediately prior to the end of grant maintained status; and what funding per pupil these schools have received in the current financial year.  [6549]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11016w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 In the financial year 1998&#150;99, the grant-maintained (GM) schools in the London borough of Havering, all of which were secondary schools, received recurrent funding from the former Funding Agency for Schools (FAS) amounting on average to &#163;2,690 per pupil. For the financial year 2001&#150;02, the most closely comparable figure currently available in respect of these schools is &#163;3,120 per pupil. The figures have been calculated to the nearest &#163;10 on the basis of pupil numbers from the annual schools' census for January 1998 and January 2001.
<P>

<a name="11016w16.html_para0">The calculations for 1998&#150;99 are based on financial information supplied to the Department by FAS. The figures include annual maintenance grant together with special purpose grants for development, GNVQ, premises insurance, and the purchase of books, but not other special purpose grants or capital grants. Where the schools' annual maintenance grant included an element to compensate the schools for their inability to reclaim VAT, appropriate adjustments have been made to reflect this.
<P>

<a name="11016w16.html_para1">The calculations for 2001&#150;02 are based on information from the budget statement published by the local education authority under section 52 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, supplemented and updated (in the case of specific grants) by information separately provided by the LEA. The figures include the schools' budget shares (including school standards grant), and standards fund resources devolved to the schools (but excluding capital grants, and other grants relating to school security and the National Grid for Learning).
<P>

<a name="11016w16.html_para2">In 1998&#150;99, under arrangements specific to the GM sector, the GM schools in Havering received formula capital allocations from FAS amounting on average to &#163;32 per pupil. Under the NDS devolved formula capital arrangements which apply to all schools, the Havering ex-GM schools' allocations for 2001&#150;02 amount on average to &#163;29 per pupil; these figures are rounded to the nearest pound.

The money is allocated through regional broadband consortia (RBCs) and local education authorities (LEAs), who have been commissioned to provide cost-effective and co-ordinated broadband internet connectivity at 2 Mbits or faster to 20 per cent. of schools in their region, including all secondary schools, by August 2002. The Government intend to increase the number of schools with a broadband connection beyond the current target of 20 per cent. of all schools in future years.
<P>

<a name="11016w16.html_para5">Universities have had a broadband network for many years, called the Joint Academic Network (JANET). The network not only connects all universities, but also all colleges of further and higher education, and research centres.

 Pay and conditions are matters for college corporations to determine. The Learning and Skills Council will work closely with individual category C colleges&#151;that is, those colleges that are financially weak&#151;to produce action plans aimed at addressing the causes of the college's financial difficulties. We are determined to work with the LSC and the individual colleges to improve the quality of all colleges to the standard of the best. Where appropriate, and as part of the agreed action plan, the LSC is able to provide additional financial support and flexibility to colleges that are financially weak.

 <i>[holding answer 15 October 2001]:</i> The rate of return to a private sector contractor in a schools PFI contract is fixed as part of the annual payment made by a local education authority for delivery of the services specified in the contract, and as such is a matter between the local education authority and its private sector partner. All PFI contracts in schools have to demonstrate better value for money than traditional procurement.

 The Department for Education and Skills does not have responsibility for spending outside England except for higher education student support and its administration for students from Wales plus some small programmes. The table shows estimated programme spending by Government region in 1999&#150;2000 by the then Department for Education and Employment on those programmes for education and skills which are now the responsibility of this Department. It does not include local authority expenditure on education and training funded from the education standard spending assessment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will make it a requirement to include teaching on the non-religious ethical life stance alongside the major faiths in multi-faith religious education; and if she will make a statement.  [7129]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11016w17.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Government have no plans to change the legislation on agreed syllabuses which, since it was introduced in 1988, has helped to contribute towards the rising standards in religious education in non-faith schools reported by Ofsted. Opportunities exist in religious education teaching for pupils to explore issues within and across faiths thereby learning to understand and respect different religions, beliefs, values and traditions (including ethical life stances), and their influence on individuals, societies, communities and cultures.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11016w17.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Extending the guidelines in the way my hon. Friend suggests would undermine the purpose and ethos of faith schools. Religious education in these schools will continue to be taught in accordance with the trust deed or in accordance with the tenets of the religion in question.

 <i>[holding answer 15 October 2001]:</i> The national curriculum test and teacher assessments are designed to allow as many pupils as possible to have access to them. There may, however, be a small number of pupils who are unable to take part in some or all of the assessments. In such instances the national curriculum and/or the tests and teacher assessments may be disapplied for a particular pupil. Pupils may be disapplied through a statement of special educational needs or because they are awaiting an assessment of special educational needs. However, there may be other circumstances where it is necessary to disapply pupils temporarily (for example, pupils recently arrived from a different educational system who require a period of adjustment).
<P>

<a name="11016w18.html_para0">The national curriculum test and teacher assessment results information collected for disapplied pupils includes the total number of pupils disapplied in each subject at each key stage. This information does not differentiate between pupils with statements of special educational needs, those in the process of being assessed or between long term and temporary disapplication.

<a name="11016w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The development of emotional intelligence is already covered in the National Curriculum as part of the Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) framework. The framework has been in place since September 2000 for pupils aged five to 16 and was introduced to support the personal and social development of young people in today's complex and changing world. PSHE enables pupils to develop their self-esteem, confidence and well being. It also helps pupils to appreciate the effect of their actions on their own lives and the lives of others, and to understand the limits and codes of personal and social behaviour. Good PSHE in schools supports parents in helping their children to develop the ability to make informed, healthy and responsible decisions about their lives.
<P>

<a name="11016w18.html_para2">The National Healthy School Standard (NHSS), which was launched in October 1999, has as one of its specific themes 'Emotional Health and Well-being', which includes awareness of mental health issues. The Standard is delivered as an integral part of the Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) framework in schools.

 The first of the Neighbourhood Support Fund (NSF) projects went live in spring 2000. The 653 community based projects have worked with almost 17,000 of the hardest to help young people. Recent evaluation of the programme by an independent research organisation shows that one third of leavers had moved on to education, training or employment with training. A further one in 10 had gone on to a local programme, including the Learning Gateway or the New Deal.

 The Department collects statistics on teacher vacancies annually. In January this year the vacancy rate in Surrey was 1.4 per cent. compared with a rate of 1.3 per cent. in England as a whole. Officials have maintained regular contact with Surrey local education authority over recent months and I am pleased to be able to report that schools in Surrey are operating normally. Recruitment is more difficult in secondary schools, particularly in the shortage subject areas of mathematics, science, English, modern languages or technology. The Government have put in place a range of measures such as training bursaries, "Golden Hellos" and the welcome back bonus to boost teacher recruitment. We have provided &#163;33 million in funding to be devolved to schools to put in place local recruitment and retention initiatives. Surrey received &#163;650,000 from the recruitment and retention fund. Ninety per cent. of this was targeted at secondary schools giving an average of around &#163;11,000 per secondary school in Surrey. In England the average allocation was around &#163;9,000 per secondary school. The fund was targeted at areas of greatest need and not all schools will have received an allocation.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what percentage of criminal offences were drug-related in the last five years; and if he will make a statement.  [7294]<P>

<P>
<a name="11016w19.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 It is difficult to calculate a single percentage figure reflecting precisely what proportion of all crimes is drug-related since no statistical data are collected on offences that may have been committed due to drug taking. However, information is collected on the number of drug offences. Details of the number of persons convicted of or cautioned for drug offences and as a proportion of persons convicted of or cautioned for all indictable offences in England and Wales during the period 1995&#150;99 are given in the table.

 I have no plans at present to visit Huntingdon Life Sciences. My predecessor visited on 26 April. Since becoming Home Secretary I have held a number of discussions aimed at ensuring businesses and individuals involved in important scientific research where animal experimentation is necessary can safely carry on their work without impediment from those who try to intimidate or obstruct them.

The Chief Constable of North Wales Police and the North Wales Police Authority produced a joint annual report for 2000&#150;01 which was submitted to the Home Office in mid-August.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what evidence he has collated on the likely effect of community sentences on rates of re-offending; and if he will make a statement.  [6054]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11016w21.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 Analysis of reconviction rates for different disposals shows that reconviction after community sentences does not differ greatly from that after other sentences once the underlying population characteristics have been taken into account. In recent years reconviction rates after community sentences have stayed fairly constant. However, there is a broad consensus in the research literature that some specific interventions are effective in reducing further offending, typically achieving around a 10-percentage point reduction in reconviction rates. A review of what works can be found in Home Office Research Study 187 'Reducing offending an assessment of research evidence on ways of dealing with offending behaviour'.
<P>

<a name="11016w21.html_para2">Five principles have been found to be key to effective work with offenders:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. More intensive programmes need to be targeted at high risk offenders.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. Programmes should focus on factors affecting criminal behaviour eg anti social attitudes, drug dependency, low levels of educational and vocational skills, poor cognitive and inter-personal skills.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>3. Programmes need to be properly carried out by trained staff and not deviate from their aims and objectives.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>4. Active, participatory styles of delivery are more effective than unstructured or overly didactic methods.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>5. The most effective types of interventions are skills-based and are designed to improve problem-solving and social interaction.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="11016w21.html_para3">The National Probation Service is developing new approaches to working with offenders based on research and the principles outlined above in its pathfinder programmes.
<P>

<a name="11016w21.html_para4">Evidence about the effectiveness of these approaches in reducing offending is beginning to emerge but it takes time to obtain reconviction results. The main measure&#151;reconviction rates two years after release from prison or completion of order&#151;is typically only available some three years after the offender has been on the programme. Therefore evidence is only becoming available in 2001 for offenders who started programmes in 1998. Annexe A summarises the currently available evidence, a copy of which has been placed in the Library.

 I am told by the Chief Constable that Henley has 21.3 full-time equivalent constables. Thames Valley police is unable to make a direct comparison with 1997 because of territorial boundary changes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11016w22.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The survey of drivers on Westbourne Terrace on 16 July was one of a programme of similar surveys undertaken by Transport for London as part of the 2001 London Area Transport Survey. To conduct such surveys it is necessary to stop the vehicles passing the survey point and only police officers have the general power to do this. The cost of police involvement in such surveys is borne by the survey sponsors.
<P>

<a name="11016w22.html_para1">The Government recognise that police involvement in such surveys may not be seen as the most effective use of police resources.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11016w22.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Confiscation of Alcohol (Young Persons) Act 1997 provides a power for the police to confiscate alcohol from young people under 18 who are drinking in public places and who are creating disorder or causing nuisance. In addition, the law relating to the sale or purchase of alcohol to or for young people has been strengthened through the Licensing (Young Persons) Act 2000, whether the intention is to consume the alcohol on licensed premises or elsewhere. The Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 will further strengthen the law by placing a positive duty on licensees and their staff not to sell to any person unless they are certain of age.

 In addition to broader measures to tackle violent crime and disorder, we are implementing the programme set out in the Home Office action plan on alcohol-related crime and disorder. This focuses on reducing under-age drinking, public drunkenness and alcohol-related violent crime. Specific measures, given legislative effect through the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, include new powers for local authorities to restrict antisocial drinking in specified public areas, with increased police powers of arrest and a power to confiscate alcohol; new powers for the police to order the immediate closure of licensed premises for up to 24 hours where there is disorder or disturbance; strengthening of the law relating to the sale of alcohol to those under 18; and a widening of the existing offence of permitting drunkenness or other violent or disorderly conduct on licensed premises.

 A top priority for the Government is to ensure that the police service is more representative of the communities it seeks to serve and that it should reflect and be strengthened by the full diversity of society. The Home Secretary has published targets for the recruitment, retention and progression of minority ethnic police officers in "Dismantling Barriers". As part of the assessment of forces' progress in meeting those targets, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary inspected all forces in England and Wales. Their inspection report "Winning the Race&#151;Embracing Diversity" published in January 2001 concluded that the great majority of forces were progressing satisfactorily, or exhibiting good practice, in minority ethnic employment.

 Information on the normal retirement age and on compulsory early retirement or severance for my Department and for the executive agencies and public sector bodies for which my Department is responsible is as follows.
<P>

<a name="11016w22.html_para6">The normal retirement age for non-industrial staff is 60, and for industrial staff 65. However, the age retirement policy for grades between Administrative Assistant and Executive Officer (including equivalent grades, except certain Prison Service specific grades) has been temporarily relaxed. Staff in these categories who would normally retire at age 60 can choose to stay on until 31 March 2002, subject to health and efficiency considerations. Staff at Higher Executive Officer level and above can also apply for extensions of service subject to business needs, but the expectation is that they would normally retire on reaching the age of 60.
<P>

<a name="11016w22.html_para7">A variation to this policy is applied in the Prison Service where pre "fresh-start" Prison Officers employed before 1987 retire at age 55, and Operational Support Grades retire at 65.

<a name="11016w22.html_para8">The compulsory early retirement or severance procedures followed in the Home Office are subject to the conditions set out in paragraphs 11.5 and 11.6 of the Civil Service Management Code. As a pre-redundancy measure, Departments and agencies may call for volunteers to leave on compulsory terms to avoid compulsory redundancy procedures. Staff may also be retired on compulsory early retirement or severance terms on grounds of structure, and on early retirement on grounds of limited efficiency. Early retirement applies to staff aged 50 or over, early severance applies to staff aged under 50.

In Wiltshire, the county council works closely with the four district-based community safety partnerships in the county who have responsibility for developing and implementing individual crime and disorder reduction strategies for their areas. The first strategies were published in March 1999 for the period 1999&#150;2002. The next three-year strategies are due for publication by the end of March 2002. Crime and disorder reduction partnerships play an important role in tackling crime locally, ensuring a joined-up approach to crime prevention and community safety.

 Based on an assessment made in 1998, <sup>1</sup>  had cases transferred to the reformed scheme at that time, around 65 per cent. of non-resident parents in work would have seen a reduction in their child support liability while 35 per cent. would have seen an increase. However, only around one half of non-resident parents paying through the CSA pay all that is currently due, so a simple comparison of potential liabilities is therefore misleading. Increased compliance will mean that more of the maintenance due will actually be paid. The child support reforms have been introduced to ensure that more children see the benefit of maintenance and over one million children will gain.

2. Figures are for Great Britain and are rounded to the nearest thousand.<P>

3. Some people may be entitled to more than one means-tested benefit. A large proportion of people receiving Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, may also be receiving one of the other means-tested benefits/tax credits. Figures cannot therefore be added together to produce a total.<P>

4. The data refer to benefit units, which may be a single person or a couple.<P>

5. The Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit totals for Great Britain include estimates for local authorities that have not responded. These estimates are based on historical and regional data.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11016w25.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 On 7 March 2001 the Government announced their proposals to replace the minimum funding requirement (MFR) with a long-term scheme specific funding standard, with additional measures to strengthen security. Our proposals offer better protection that provides more effective security for scheme members without damaging consequences for investment.
<P>

<a name="11016w25.html_para0">On 18 September 2001 we published "The Minimum Funding Requirement: The Next Stage of Reform". This document seeks views on the workability of draft regulations that introduce changes to the current MFR regime in advance of its replacement. The consultation period ends on 10 December 2001, and we plan to introduce these changes early next year.
<P>

<a name="11016w25.html_para1">Implementing our proposals to replace the MFR in full will require primary legislation, and in the meantime we are working with the pensions industry and other interested parties to develop proposals for legislation when parliamentary time becomes available.

 <i>[holding answer 15 October 2001]:</i> The UK Government have frozen &#163;63 million of Taliban assets since sanctions were introduced; details of the assets are listed in the table. No funds belonging to Afghan National Credit and Finance have been frozen in the UK. The National Trading Company of Afghanistan assets were frozen on Friday 5 October 2001 as a temporary measure. When the freeze lapsed, we decided to take no further action as they work for the state of Afghanistan and not the Taliban, and are therefore not covered by the UN sanctions.

Once the interview responses and all the Census returns have been analysed, we will have a definitive picture of how well we have done at Local Authority level.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when her Department first received an offer from hunt staff to assist in the foot and mouth slaughter process; and when the first hunt slaughterman was engaged.  [5351]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11016w26.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Masters of Foxhounds Association contacted Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food veterinary officials in the first week of the outbreak. Their offer of help was passed to local disease control centres in order that hunt staff could be called upon if needed. Local hunt staff also directly contacted the disease control centres. The first hunt slaughtermen who were properly licensed were engaged at the end of March. Finding qualified slaughtermen was not generally a problem.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11016w26.html_wqn5"><B> David Maclean: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many reports her Department has received of <i>(a)</i> crows, <i>(b)</i> foxes and <i>(c)</i> other wildlife eating in the open carcases slaughtered because of foot and mouth.  [5350]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11016w26.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 On some occasions there has been evidence that predation of slaughtered carcases may have occurred. Instructions require carcases awaiting disposal to be, as far as is practicable, put beyond the reach of predators. Carcases are also sprayed with disinfectant which may act as a deterrent to scavengers. However, such animals can and do breach measures put in place to prevent such scavenging.
<P>

<a name="11016w26.html_para5">Following confirmation of disease and slaughter an epidemiological inquiry is undertaken. One aspect of this is to consider possible routes of spread from the premises. Although it is a theoretical possibility that scavenging animals could spread infected carcase material to neighbouring stock, it is considered a much less likely source of infection when compared with other more direct routes of transfer and the overall risk is considered low. The rapid slaughter of affected stock remains the single most important factor in stopping production of virus.

<a name="11016w26.html_wqn6"><B> Dr. Julian Lewis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps her Department is taking to ensure that restrictions imposed on rural areas are lifted on a consistent basis.  [6083]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11016w26.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The removal of movement restrictions on animals around infected premises is governed by EU rules. Other movement restrictions are applied on the basis of the disease status of a county or unitary authority or metropolitan district areas. Counties are reclassified when results of serological testing demonstrate disease freedom.
<P>

<a name="11016w26.html_para6">Other restrictions are largely based on veterinary risk assessments which are published on the DEFRA website.
<P>

<a name="11016w26.html_para7">This Department will continue to ensure that restrictions are applied and lifted on a consistent and proportionate basis. Significant progress is being made on the lifting of the restrictions on farming and other rural activities. Nine out of 10 footpaths are now re-opened. Cleansing and disinfection of farms continues and we are blood-testing animals throughout the country.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for what reason restrictions are being maintained on farms around the Hallburn site, Longtown, Cumbria.  [5345]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11016w26.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The farms around the Hallburn site were subject to protection zone restrictions due to their proximity to foot and mouth disease infected premises. However, these restrictions were lifted on 23 August 2001. Infected premises in the area remain under separate restriction while the final cleansing and disinfection process is taking place. Farms around the Hallburn site are still subject to the national restrictions on the movement of livestock.

 <i>[holding answer 15 October 2001]:</i> The UK Government have not applied for any EU aid for the cereals sector.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what steps the Government are taking to protect UK peatlands; and if she will make a statement on the practice of peat extraction in the UK;  [7776]
<P>
<UL>(2) what action she will take with regard to the European Habitats Directive in order to exempt areas of the UK from the possibility of peat extraction.  [7893]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11016w27.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The best examples of peatland habitats in the UK are notified by the country nature conservation agencies as sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs), or areas of special scientific interest in (ASSIs) in Northern Ireland. In England, peatland SSSIs are protected from damage through the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, strengthened recently by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. In 1999 the UK Government endorsed the Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) for lowland raised bogs in which targets for restoration of damaged peatlands are set out. The BAP also contains targets for the replacement of peat in the UK horticultural industry, including supplies for amateur use&#151;a reduction of 40 per cent. by 2005 and to 90 per cent. by 2010.

<a name="11016w27.html_para0">The EU Habitats Directive provides for the creation of a network of protected wildlife sites across the European Union. The UK has identified and forwarded to the European Commission 565 sites suitable for selection as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), thirty-eight of which feature a peatland habitat type. Sites in England receive the full protection offered by the Conservation (Natural Habitats etc) Regulations 1994, implementing the directive's provisions. Minerals Planning Authorities (MPAs) have statutory responsibility to determine applications for permission to extract peat.
<P>

<a name="11016w27.html_para1">Applications for new permissions, and extant permissions, must be assessed with regard to any potential effect peat extraction will have on the conservation status of candidate SACs, or Special Protection Areas (SPAs) under the Birds Directive. New permissions may be refused and extant permissions amended or revoked if an adverse effect is determined. Guidance to MPAs on criteria for selection and identification of acceptable sites for peat extraction is contained in Mineral Planning Guidance 13 'Guidelines for Peat Provision in England Including the Place for Alternative Materials'. Additional guidance on designated sites to MPAs is also given in Planning Policy Guidance 9 'Nature Conservation'.

 During the preparation of the Rural White Paper 16 of the 799 responses to the Discussion Document "Rural England" came from individuals and organisations in Cambridgeshire, including a number of district, town and parish councils and other public, private and voluntary sector bodies.

<P>

<a name="11016w27.html_para2">For ex-MAFF staff including executive agencies, the age of retirement may vary according to grade and reckonable service. Staff in grades at Administrative Officer level and below may generally, subject to efficiency, remain in service until age 65. Staff in higher grades are required to retire at age 60, but a short service concession is available for staff who have then served less than 20 years. Staff may also be retained past their retirement age for limited periods if, exceptionally, the Department's business needs justify it. Compulsory retirement before the normal age may exceptionally apply in circumstances of redundancy, restructuring or limited efficiency.
<P>

<a name="11016w27.html_para3">DEFRA staff who were formerly attached to DETR retain their retirement arrangements. These are broadly similar to those for ex-MAFF staff, and for details I refer the hon. Member to the reply given by the Under- Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead), on 15 October 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 872W.

<a name="11016w27.html_para4">Staff in the Intervention Board/Rural Payments Agency normally retire at age 60 but may be retained for an extended period (up to a maximum age of 65) dependent upon meeting standards of efficiency and upon the Agency's needs.

<P>
<a name="11016w27.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Local authorities are responsible for issuing most animal movement licences.

Of these 780 were returned and 425 licences were issued. 92 applications were rejected by the Animal Movement Licensing System, 188 farmers withdrew their applications and 75 applications are awaiting approval.
<P>

<a name="11016w27.html_para6">In addition, 1,227 licences for moving livestock for slaughter have been processed by Somerset local authorities/Trading Standards own system.

<P>

<a name="11016w27.html_para8">The report shows that the civil service is increasingly successful in attracting the best graduates, despite the highly competitive nature of the market, and is doing so while maintaining the high standard required of entrants. For the first time in several years, for instance, the service has filled all its vacancies for scientists and engineers. The proportion of graduates recruited to the fast stream from minority ethnic groups has risen from 3 per cent. in 1998&#150;99 to 7 per cent. in 2000&#150;01. The service's commitment to improving the diversity of the fast stream will continue.
