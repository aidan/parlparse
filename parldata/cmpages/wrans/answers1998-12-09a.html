<a name="81209w01.html_spnew1"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 The British Tourist Authority recently opened the new Britain Visitor Centre in London. The new Centre, which is a partnership between the BTA and the tourist boards of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, aims to encourage visitors to London to travel more widely throughout the UK. This year we are providing a further &#163;1.5 million to the London Tourist Board to support its Focus London campaign, which promotes London as a gateway to the rest of Britain. Our new tourism strategy, which will be published early next year, will set out in detail our plans for spreading the benefits of tourism throughout the country and throughout society.

 <i>[holding answer 7 December 1998]:</i> I assume that the hon. Member has in mind registration of a trademark rather than copyright. Action is in hand through the United Kingdom Sports Council to register as a trademark the names 'UK Sports Institute', 'United Kingdom Sports Institute' and 'UKSI' with the Trademarks Registry. A hearing before the Trademarks Examiner was attended by the UK Sports Council's legal advisers on 24 November as a forerunner to the process of formalising the submission of evidence for registration in the form of a Statutory Declaration.
<P>

<a name="81209w01.html_para0">A licence agreement has also been prepared between the Department, the UK Sports Council and Phoenix Sports Ltd. (the Sheffield bid team) for use of the trademark 'UK Sports Institute' and other similar marks during the period prior to registration of the trademark.

the crash of a British military helicopter in the South China Sea off the east coast of Malaysia; and if he will make a statement.  [62079]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81209w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 December 1998]:</i> A Lynx helicopter, operating from HMS Grafton, crashed during a bilateral exercise with the Singapore Navy on 23 September this year. Following the crash, a Singaporean naval vessel rescued the pilot after he had spent about an hour in the sea. Other Singaporean ships and aircraft continued to search for the second crew member until the decision was taken to call off the rescue.
<P>

<a name="81209w01.html_para5">Malaysia was not involved in the exercise and was therefore not in a position to offer immediate help. Two Malaysian ships did, however, offer assistance later; but by then the wreck of the helicopter had been located and so it was not necessary to accept the offer.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81209w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The MOD is funding two epidemiological studies into the health of UK Gulf veterans. One study, being conducted by a team from Manchester University led by Professor Nicola Cherry, aims to determine whether Gulf veterans are experiencing greater ill-health than Service personnel who did not take part in the conflict and to identify possible exposures and predisposing factors associated with any distinctive pattern of symptoms which may be found. It will also investigate whether there is an increased incidence of mortality or cancer amongst Gulf veterans. Initial results from this study are expected to emerge in the first part of next year.
<P>

<a name="81209w01.html_para6">The other study, being conducted by a team from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine led by Dr. Patricia Doyle, will examine the reproductive health of Gulf veterans and the health of their children.

<a name="81209w01.html_para7">Initial results from a US-funded study by a team from Kings College, London, led by Professors Simon Wessely and Anthony David, are expected to become available at around the turn of the year.

<P>
<a name="81209w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B>

<P>
<P><I>9 Dec 1998 : Column: 192</I><P>
Defence has stated publicly that Major Bunel had not had access to detailed planning, and preparations for NATO military action had therefore not been compromised. This case had no direct implications for UK forces.

<a name="81209w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 I believe that my hon. Friend is referring to allegations that appeared in a newspaper article and a book recently of corruption in the Special Air Services (SAS) Regiment during the Dhofar Campaign in the early 1970s. The events in question took place almost 25 years ago and official records on the matter are incomplete. However, I understand that the Regiment dealt with the matter at the time and that disciplinary action, where appropriate, was taken.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what steps he takes to ensure that those qualifying as driving instructors will be equipped in most cases to meet the standards later operating in their check-tests; and if he will introduce an appeals system for those who fail their check-tests.

<P>
<a name="81209w02.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The standards established when passing the qualifying examinations are the same as those needed subsequently to pass the periodic check-tests. Advice and assistance is available to instructors at any time from local supervising examiners. Also, the system of check-tests is operated in an educational rather than a punitive way. Following an unsatisfactory check-test, an examiner will offer to discuss performance, so the instructor can consider what action is needed, possibly involving re-training, before a further check-test takes place. We have no plans currently to introduce an appeals system to review the examiner's judgment where a check- test is failed. It would be difficult for an independent adjudicator to pass judgment on a text without having been present.
<P>

<a name="81209w02.html_para2">The Registrar seeks to remove the instructor's certificate only after a third consecutive unsatisfactory performance. A statutory mechanism already does exist to protect any instructor who wishes to appeal against the Registrar's decision to take removal action.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many driving instructors who have been removed from registration during the last four years following check-test failures have then sought re-qualification by taking the appropriate examinations; how many of these have been successful; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="81209w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 I have no plans to do so. The Building Regulations set minimum standards for the health and safety of people in and around dwellings, as well as making requirements for energy efficiency and access for disabled people. Housing warranty providers also set their own standards over and above the requirements of the Building Regulations.
<P>

<a name="81209w02.html_para3">In addition, my Department has commissioned a set of detailed Housing Quality Indicators, which can be used to evaluate all aspects of housing design, from internal and external layout and space standards to energy efficiency and sustainable construction.

 Decisions on the need for new motorway service areas (MSAs) are not matters for the Highways Agency. Its role is to advise on the impact of MSA proposals on the operation and safety of the motorway and trunk road network. Need is a matter for planning authorities to consider in the light of that and other relative advice. Guidance on the criteria to be used in determining need issues was contained in my answer of 31 July 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>611-12.</i> Copies are in the House Libraries.

<P>
<a name="81209w02.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Blizzard: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what advice he is taking on the responses to the consultation paper on the new waste strategy for England and Wales "Less Waste: more value".  [63604]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81209w02.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 My Department is examining all the comments that were made, both by individuals and by organisations in response to "Less waste: more value". Where further elucidation seems necessary, they are discussing points with a number of experts selected on a personal basis, as well as continuing to hold regular liaison and ad hoc meetings with representative bodies from local government, the community sector and industry. The aim of this consultation is to produce a draft waste strategy next spring for further consultation with a view to adopting a final strategy before the end of 1999.

<P>
<a name="81209w03.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Stinchcombe: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the advantages of introducing necessary user rebates in respect of fuel duties paid by the disabled and their carers.  [61796]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81209w03.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Government have no plans to introduce a fuel duty rebate for disabled motorists but they will continue to take account of the impact of the fuel duty escalator on these and other essential car users. Whilst disabled motorists often need the use of a car, they can still reduce their fuel consumption and, in some cases, will be able to choose significantly more fuel-efficient vehicles which manufacturers are committed to introducing to the market. Disability Living Allowance, which will rise in line with inflation, also provides a contribution towards the extra costs of disability, and is awarded on the basis of the mobility as well as care needs of disabled people. In addition, vehicles owned by many disabled drivers are exempt from Vehicle Excise Duty.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the Health and Safety Executive's findings over the past 10 years on the failures of non-metallic storage vessels including plastic-lined GRP storage vessels, together with relevant information on recorded failures which is contained in the HSE database of investigated incidents; and if he will make a statement.  [62303]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81209w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 December 1998]:</i> A research report by the Health and Safety Laboratory of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has reviewed all the failures of non-metallic vessels reported to HSE during the period 1986-1996. The report discloses that early experience with GRP storage vessels was disappointing due to poor design, poor or inadequate installation, lack of suitable testing and inspection techniques, poor fabrication or materials specification, environmental stress cracking, and user-abuse. A number of key recommendations aimed at addressing these problems are contained in the report and HSE is reviewing its guidance in the light of these. In total, the report reviews a total of 59 incidents, 7 of which involved plastic-lined GRP storage vessels. Arrangements are in hand for a copy of the report to be placed in the Commons Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the impact on the retail price of aspirin of changes in the maximum quantities available over the counter at pharmacies.  [62295]

<P>
<a name="81209w05.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Department has made no assessment of the impact on the price of aspirin products, this is a matter for the Office of Fair Trading. The Director General of Fair Trading has investigated the pricing of a number of pack sizes of aspirin and paracetamol that were available over the counter before and after the introduction of the new pack sizes. He did not find any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour. The market in analgesics is very competitive and equivalent products are available at a wide variety of prices. The Director General will keep the market for analgesics under review and will investigate any anti-competitive behaviour.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health by what means the funding formula for health authorities in South West England takes account of the number of older people resident in them.  [62386]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81209w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 The national funding formula used to inform health authorities' unified allocations includes adjustments to take account of the relative healthcare needs of different age groups. Elderly people require relatively more health care, and the target allocations of health authorities reflect this.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what account he took of the closure of other local health services in considering the proposal to close the Bartlett Hospital in Felixstowe; and what assessment he made of the overall impact of the proposed closures.  [62317]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81209w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 I have rejected the proposals to transfer the rehabilitation and recovery services from the Bartlet hospital, Felixstowe to Ipswich hospital until Suffolk Health Authority has undertaken a full and comprehensive review of the implications for the future of the Bartlet hospital. This must clearly take into account other local health services.

 The table ranks health authorities in England by decayed, missing or filled teeth of 5-year-old children for the year 1995-96. These results are from a survey co-ordinated by the British Association for the Study of Community Dentistry. Information for Leicestershire Health Authority is not available.

<a name="81209w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 The General Dental Council has proposed that it should set up a statutory register of dental nurses, entry to which would be dependent upon the satisfactory completion of an approved training programme. We support this proposal and, in due course, will consider if measures to strengthen the existing regulatory systems of the health care professions, which we plan to include in the forthcoming National Health Service Bill, could be used to make the necessary amendments to the Dentists Act 1984. Information is not held centrally upon numbers of dental nurses, but each year some 2,000 candidates pass the examinations of the National Examining Board for Dental Nurses.

 The Land Registry's latest accommodation review has revealed that a sub-office (1,269 sq m) of the Gloucester District Land Registry is surplus to current

requirements. The Land Registry is actively marketing the sale of the lease. Since 1990, the Land Registry has reduced its estate by some 43,000 sq m of accommodation, covering 34 sites.

To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department which Land Registry offices in the North West have sufficient spare capacity in terms of space or people to enable them to take on the work currently conducted by the Lytham Land Registry.  [62896]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81209w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 There are no Land Registry offices in the North-West which have sufficient spare capacity in terms of space or people to enable them to take on the work currently conducted by the Lytham Land Registry.

To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department what analysis his Department or the Land Registry has undertaken on the future of the Land Registry office in Lytham.  [62897]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81209w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 An analysis by the Land Registry on the future of its office in Lytham has concluded that registration activity is projected to increase by up to 20 per cent. over the next five years following recent land registration legislation. Existing accommodation, which is operating at fully capacity, will therefore soon be insufficient to carry out its business.
<P>

<a name="81209w06.html_para2">The Land Registry intends to redevelop its nearby Warton site to house the registration work generated by the County of Lancashire. The existing Lytham building will cater for work generated by Greater Manchester.

<a name="81209w06.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Jack: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will make a statement on the operational future of the Land Registry office in Lytham <i>(a)</i> in the next 12 months, <i>(b)</i> in the next three years and <i>(c)</i> in the next five years.  [62898]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81209w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 In the next 12 months the Land Registry will begin to operate from its Lytham office as the Lytham District Land Registry (dealing with registrations from Greater Manchester) and the Lancashire District Land Registry (dealing with registration from Lancashire)--the latter moving to the new accommodation at nearby Warton on its completion. Over the next five years the two business units will be taking forward partnerships with local authorities to register all of their landholdings. This will bring considerable security and efficiency benefits to local authorities and to the local taxpayer.
<P>
<P>
<a name="81209w06.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Jack: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department if he is currently acting on a request from the Treasury to review the property portfolio of office accommodation currently used by the Land Registry.  [62899]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81209w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 A review of the property portfolio of office accommodation used by the Land Registry was carried out as part of the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review. The review identified some 13,000 sq m of accommodation as surplus to requirements and this has now been disposed of.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. The Secretary of State is not under an obligation to provide reasons for his decision to sign an authority to proceed. However, in this case, and in the light of the matters raised by the representations, he has agreed to give his reasons at this stage.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Representations</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>3. The Secretary of State received notification, before the House of Lords judgment on 25 November, that he would be receiving representations for and against the issue of an authority to proceed.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>4. Although there is no provision in the Extradition Act ("the Act") for representations at this stage in extradition proceedings, he has taken careful account of these in making his decision; in particular representations made to him by legal representatives of Senator Pinochet, the Spanish Government, the Chilean Government and legal representatives for "the Interveners" before the House of Lords. He also received material from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>7. The Secretary of State has considered these requests, and further material made available by the Swiss Government, under section 12(5) of the Act and Article 17 of the European Convention on Extradition ("ECE").

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(4) On receipt of any such request the Secretary of State may issue an authority to proceed unless it appears to him that an order for the return of the person concerned could not lawfully be made, or would not in fact be made, in accordance with the provisions of this Act.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>9. The Secretary of State has taken the approach that if it already appears to him that no order for the return of Senator Pinochet to Spain could lawfully be made, or would in fact be made, then he should not issue an authority to proceed. If those conditions do not exist he has a discretion whether or not to issue an authority to proceed.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>10. He has had regard to the relevant extradition arrangement, namely the ECE. The UK's obligation is to extradite Senator Pinochet to Spain consistently with the ECE. That is a consideration to which the Secretary of State gives particular weight.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>11. In reaching his decision, the Secretary of State has considered the application of the Act to the Spanish request and all the general restrictions on surrender in sections 6 and 12 of the Act.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Extradition crimes</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>12 Section 1 of the Act provides that where, as in the case of Spain, extradition procedures under Part III of the Act are available, a person in the United Kingdom who: "is accused in that state of the commission of an extradition crime" may be arrested and returned to that state in accordance with those procedures.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>13. The Secretary of State considers that Senator Pinochet is accused, in Spain, of offences equivalent to UK offences of attempted murder, conspiracy to murder, torture, conspiracy to torture, hostage taking and conspiracy to take hostages.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>14. Senator Pinochet is also charged, under Spanish law, with genocide, and the CPS advised, on behalf of the Spanish Government, that murder is also disclosed by the request. The Secretary of State does not consider that the contents of the extradition request satisfied the definition of an extradition crime under section 2 of the Act in respect of these offences, and has therefore not included them in the authority to proceed.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>15. The relevant test under the Act was explained by the Lord Chief Justice in the Divisional Court (with whom the other judges agreed) who said: "What is necessary [for the definition of extradition crime in s. 2] is that <i>at the time of the extradition request</i> (rather than at the time of the conduct alleged; emphasis supplied) the offence should be a criminal offence here, "</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>16. The Secretary of State has proceeded on the basis that he is entitled, at this stage of the extradition proceedings against Senator Pinochet, to treat the Spanish request as well-founded as a matter of Spanish law.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Sovereign or diplomatic immunity</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>17. The Secretary of State has also proceeded on the basis that Senator Pinochet does not enjoy any immunity in relation to the offences in question. He has not accepted a representation made on behalf of Senator Pinochet that he should disregard the House of Lords judgment on the grounds of alleged bias on the part of one of the law lords. Nor does it appear to him that Senator Pinochet is entitled to diplomatic immunity or protection as the head of a special mission.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>General restrictions</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>18. The Secretary of State has considered all the general restrictions on surrender in sections 6 and 12 of the Act. In particular, he has had regard to:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Political Offences (section 6(1)(a))</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>19. Section 24 of the Act provides that no offence to which section 1 of the Suppression of Terrorism Act applies can be regarded as an offence of a political character. Since Spain is a designated country for the purposes of section 24, the Secretary of State considers that all the offences that are to be 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>9 Dec 1998 : Column: 216</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>included in the authority to proceed fall within this provision. In any event it does not appear to him that the offences charged are of a political character.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Punishment for political opinions (sections 6(1)(c) and (d))</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>20. The Secretary of State does not consider that there are good grounds for concluding that the request has been issued for this purpose.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>The passage of time (section 12(2)(a)(ii))</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>21. The Secretary of State has not been notified by the Spanish Government that any of the offences for which extradition is sought are time barred from prosecution, and considers that it is reasonable to proceed at this stage on the footing that no relevant time bar appears to apply.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>22. Nor does the Secretary of State consider that the passage of time would render it unjust or oppressive to issue an authority to proceed in this case. It does not appear that Senator Pinochet is unfit to stand trial. The offences for which return has been sought are serious, and in the nature of those for which, domestically, passage of time would not be regarded as restricting prosecution. The case is an accusation case and, ordinarily, the reliability of witnesses' memories may properly be regarded as a matter for the court of prosecution.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Accusation not made in good faith in the interests of justice (section 12(2)(a)(iii))</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>23. The Secretary of State does not believe that there are good grounds for concluding that the request has been issued other than in good faith in the interests of justice.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>The Secretary of State's discretion</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>24. The Secretary of State has considered the ambit of his discretion under section 7(4) and his residual general discretion under section 12 of the Act, which would apply in relation to the return of Senator Pinochet were he to be committed by the Bow Street magistrate under section 9 of the Act. Contrary to certain of the representations made to him, he has been advised that the discretion conferred upon him is wide, and he has therefore taken a range of factors into consideration.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>25. A large number of points were raised in representations concerning the Secretary of State's discretion, including aspects of issues that fall to be considered under the general restrictions on return contained in the Act. In particular, the Secretary of State has had regard to the following:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Humanitarian considerations</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>26. Representations were made on behalf of the Senator that his age and health would render it unjust or oppressive to issue an authority to proceed. The Secretary of State has considered these carefully, but concluded that it does not appear that the Senator is unfit to stand trial and concluded that in all the circumstances it would not be unjust or oppressive for him to stand trial in relation to the offences with which he is charged. The Secretary of State also has in mind that this question, among others, can be re-examined in the light of any developments, at the stage when he comes to exercise his final discretion at the end of the extradition process, under section 12 of the Act.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Pending proceedings in Chile</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>27. The Chilean Government argued that Senator Pinochet should be returned to Chile where he could stand trial. However, there is no extradition request from the Chilean Government, which the Secretary of State could consider under section 12(5) of the Act. Moreover, there is no provision of international law which excludes Spain's jurisdiction in this matter. The Secretary of State does not consider the possibility of a trial in Chile to be a factor which outweighs the UK's obligations under the ECE to extradite Senator Pinochet to Spain.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Other factors</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>28. The Secretary of State has also considered other factors, under his general discretion, including:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) the possible effect of extradition proceedings on the stability of Chile, and its future democracy; and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) the possible effect of extradition proceedings on the UK national interest.</FONT></UL>




<P>
<P><I>9 Dec 1998 : Column: 217</I><P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>29. He has concluded that the material and representations put before him do not amount to sufficient grounds not to issue an authority to proceed.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Conclusion</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>30. In the event that Senator Pinochet is committed to await the Secretary of State's decision on his return, the Secretary of State will consider the extradition request afresh under section 12 of the Act. At that stage he will be able to take into account any findings in the committal proceedings and any habeas corpus proceedings as well as any further representations which Senator Pinochet may wish to make against return.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>31. If Senator Pinochet decides to apply for leave to move for judicial review of the Secretary of State's decision, he reserves the right to expand upon the reasons given in this letter in an affidavit to be sworn by one of his officials."</FONT></UL>

 There is no specified limit on the borrowing powers of Scottish Enterprise.

The limit is defined as the aggregate amount outstanding (AAO) and was set by the Scottish Enterprise (Aggregate Amount Outstanding) Order 1997 at &#163;3,000 million. The AAO is made up of the following elements (with the level of funding at 31 March 1998 given in parenthesis): sums issued by the Secretary of State or the Treasury, in fulfilment of guarantees (nil); loans guaranteed by Scottish Enterprise or its subsidiaries (&#163;0.3 million); payments from the Secretary of State consisting of grant-in-aid less administrative expenses plus voted loan payments (&#163;2,470 million); and the general external borrowings of Scottish Enterprise and its subsidiaries (&#163;3 million).

Dame Ann has secured the agreement of the two parties to treat discussions within this process as confidential.

Last week we saw the introduction of pilots in West Wales and Bridgend/Rhondda Cynon Taff which brought the New Deal for Over 25s within the range of those who have been unemployed for 12 and 18 months respectively.

 The Welsh steel industry is among the most competitive in the world. However, like others, it is experiencing difficult trading conditions. The industry is therefore undertaking a range of measures to maintain its competitiveness, such as the introduction of new technology and team working. In particular British Steel has recently completed a &#163;121m investment in a new continuous annealing process line at Port Talbot. This is the biggest single investment since privatisation and represents a massive vote of confidence in the Welsh steel Industry.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81209w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Following the Comprehensive Spending Review and extensive consultation on my spending priorities in Wales, I propose that total standard spending in 1999-2000 should be &#163;3,243 million, an increase of &#163;143 million or 4.6 per cent. on the comparable figure for 1998-99.

<a name="81209w12.html_para1">This is a good settlement for local government and for Wales as a whole. It is not just about money but about partnership. It paves the way for the co-operation I have offered to the leaders of local authorities which is aimed at improving services and extending opportunity everywhere in Wales. It also sets the scene for a strong partnership between the National Assembly for Wales and local government which I believe is essential for the success of both.
<P>

<a name="81209w12.html_para2">The increase includes an additional &#163;70 million revenue spending for education and extra provision so that local authorities can:

It reiterated the advice contained in an earlier letter from the Department of 18 November 1997 about the importance of institutions undertaking the collection of the fee sensitively and flexibly in the early months of a degree course, taking account of the particular circumstances of individual students. It went on to advise that, in the case of students still awaiting an awards letter, and if instalment or other arrangements were offered, these should be put into effect only when the awards letter became available, so that payments were based on actual amounts due and students not required to make any contribution were not disadvantaged.

 Dental and other students who entered higher education before 1998-99 and who take out five or more loans will repay these loans over a period of seven years compared with five years for other borrowers.

<P>

<a name="81209w14.html_para0">From 1998-99 dental students in the first four years of their course will have access to the same loan, grant and fees support as all other new entrants, but they will receive help in years five and beyond through NHS bursaries and the Department of Health will meet their tuition fees. After graduation, they will benefit from the fairer repayment system which we are introducing, which links repayments directly to graduates income. No repayments are made until their income reaches a threshold, initially set at &#163;10,000, and thereafter they are calculated as a percentage of income above that level.

 The EU pigmeat regime is very light and contains no provision for direct aids to producers of the sort introduced for beef and sheep farmers. Paying these as a state aid would contravene European law. Moreover, we generally oppose state aid schemes in the pig sector because they can distort trade, interfere with the market and risk prolonging a crisis.

 Like its counterparts in the rest of the EU, the British pig industry is going through a difficult time at present, with market prices well below the cost of production. The crisis is due mainly to over-production, because of an exaggerated producer response to the BSE crisis and to a reduction in supply due to outbreaks of classical swine fever (CSF) on mainland Europe, 



<P>
<P><I>9 Dec 1998 : Column: 240</I><P>
principally in the Netherlands. This has led to a distorted version of the classic pig cycle, with the position being exacerbated by the strong pound, high production in the USA and a reduction in world demand, e.g. in Russia and the Far East.
<P>

<a name="81209w15.html_para3">The Meat and Livestock Commission (MLC) and Food from Britain have helped the British pig industry to establish a healthy export trade in pork and pork products with other EU countries. In 1997, over 200,000 tonnes were exported to the EU (up some 20 per cent. on 1996) and this figure is likely to be exceeded in 1998.

<a name="81209w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Aromatherapy oils would not normally be classified as agricultural products but if the hon. Member writes to me with specific details about the products she is concerned with I will try to provide a more definitive answer.

<a name="81209w15.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 GB meat hygiene legislation provides the Meat Hygiene Service with powers to require the slowing of line speeds in individual abattoirs where, in the opinion of the Official Veterinary Surgeon, line speeds are such as to jeopardise the satisfactory inspection or the hygienic production of meat. I have no plans, however, for the blanket introduction of maximum line speeds in licensed abattoirs.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what plans he has to ensure that reductions in prices paid to milk producers are passed on to milk consumers.  [63127]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81209w15.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Pricing decisions at retail level in respect of produce, including milk, are matters for the commercial judgment of the various food retail companies, which operate in a fiercely competitive market. However, it must be remembered that a significant part of the final price of food to the consumer is accounted for by processing,

distribution and marketing costs. So the proportional impact of raw material price changes would be expected to be much reduced at retail level.
