 The Office for Security and Counter Terrorism (OSCT) commissioned two evaluations of Prevent funded initiatives in 2008. One was of the processes and procedures of community intervention projects. This covered financial and business management, governance, methodology and activities. It was not an evaluation of the impact or the effectiveness of interventions in preventing radicalisation but the results were used to inform decision making about the continuation of funding to projects. The second was a process evaluation of Channel, undertaken on behalf of OSCT by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) The results of this evaluation contributed to the national Channel guidance published in March 2010.

When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.

 The UK holds a watchlist of adverse information and intelligence drawn from a variety of sources, including the police. The system is used by UK Border Agency staff for the purposes of national security and the detection and prevention of crime. It is long-standing policy not to discuss either the specific data held on the watchlist or the source of the data as to do so would be counterproductive.</p>

1. These statistics are based on households below average income (HBAI) data available at:
http://research.dwp.gov.uk-asd-index.php?paqe=hbai_arc
2. Data are sourced from the Family Resources survey and covers Great Britain up to 1997-98 and the United Kingdom from 1998-99, with estimates for Northern Ireland imputed for the years 1998-99 through 2001-02. The reference period for FRS figures is single financial years.
3. Disposable household income is adjusted using modified OECD equivalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.
4. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.
5. Numbers of people in low-income households have been rounded to the nearest 100,000, while proportions have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.
6. Figures have been presented on a before housing cost (BHC) basis. For BHC figures, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, buildings insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income.
7. The household level poverty threshold is defined as the 60% of contemporary median equivalised disposable household income.

 The UK State Pension is payable world-wide but is only up-rated abroad where there is a legal requirement or reciprocal agreement to do so. A well known court case challenging the UK's position was heard by the European Court of Human Rights' Grand Chamber in September 2009 and the court's judgment of March 2010 was in the UK's favour. We continue to take our obligations under the terms of the European Convention on Human Rights seriously and are satisfied that we are complying. We therefore have no plans to make any changes to the current arrangements that allow for the exportability and up-rating of UK State Pensions.</p>

 The distribution of formula grant takes into account the relative costs of providing services between areas (largely based on its socio-economic and demographic characteristics) together with its relative ability to raise funding locally (based on the number of band-D council tax equivalent properties within an authority's area). We then guarantee that every authority will receive at least a minimum percentage change (the ‘floor’) in its formula grant year on year on a like for like basis.

However all contractual issues in relation to the provision of those services are operational matters for East Coast Main Line Ltd and Directly Operated Railways Ltd and Ministers were not involved in any decisions.</p>

 The European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) is financed by the European Commission raising funds on capital markets, guaranteed by the EU Budget. There is no direct impact on the EU Budget and therefore on the Exchequer from any such borrowing by the Commission. Only in the event that a beneficiary member state defaults on loan repayments would the EU Budget be adversely affected.</p>

In addition, once the ESM comes into existence, it will replace both the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) and the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).

 English Heritage has recently launched the National Heritage Protection Plan, which sets out why, what and how England's vulnerable historic environment is to be safeguarded in the next four years. Developed in consultation with a wide range of partners, it shows where the threats are the greatest and will help English Heritage to prioritise its work. It will also help other heritage professionals and volunteers to contribute to the business of managing England's heritage. This Department and English Heritage are also considering various measures to tackle the problem of buildings which have been on the Heritage At Risk Register for an extended period of time.</p>

               <a name="110706112001451"> English Heritage offered over £400,000 to projects in Kent in 2009-10 under its two main grant programmes. English Heritage grant-aid has helped preserve important heritage sites at Shurland Hall, Sheppey, the No 1 Smithery at Chatham Historic Dockyard and at Westenhanger Castle in Folkestone. Survey work on the Hoo Peninsula undertaken by English Heritage is extending understanding and protection to a little-studied landscape under considerable pressure for change. In Margate, Dover, Gravesend and the Medway towns, a number of heritage assets have been assessed for statutory designation in a series of Defined Area Surveys (some of which are ongoing), resulting in a number of newly listed buildings and scheduled monuments.</p>

 No specific assessment has been made of the impact of allocating Band HE spectrum for local DAB on FM stations which occupy Band II. However, we note that the vast majority of FM stations are simulcast on local DAB, providing these stations with the potential for greater coverage and improved reception and functionality for listeners. In 2010 the Government launched the Digital Radio Action Plan to consider the case for a radio switchover which would, if implemented, allow for the re-allocation of much of the Band II spectrum currently used for radio for other purposes.</p>

 Sunderland city council is responsible for the day to day cleanliness of its beaches. The Environment Agency (EA) and Sunderland city council have completed surveys of the beaches that found very little evidence of any significant pollution. Occasionally small amounts of sewage-related debris are found from storm sewage overflows. This is a minor problem and appropriate clean-ups are carried out.</p>

               <a name="110706112001478"> The EA monitors the quality of bathing water throughout the bathing season from May to September. Since 1995, Sunderland's designated bathing waters have always met the ‘mandatory’ bathing water quality standard under the Bathing Waters Directive. In eight of the last ten years they have also met the higher ‘excellent’ standard. These are very good results for bathing waters so close to a large urban area, and demonstrate that the sewerage systems put in place to protect the water quality are performing well.</p>

               <a name="110706112001479"> The EA has compared the bathing water results to the tighter standards in the revised Bathing Water Directive, which comes into force in 2015. This predicts that designated bathing waters in the area will meet the ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ standards, which is over and above the ‘sufficient’ standard required. The EA will continue to monitor to ensure that this remains the case.</p>

 There are many civil society groups who report on the rights of religious minority groups. We engage regularly with them on these issues, and their reports are assessed along with other information to influence how we address our efforts in this area. Reports continue to suggest that minority groups in some areas in Pakistan discrimination in the practice of their religion.</p>

 Anguilla has benefited from several DFID-funded initiatives over the past few years: The Overseas Territories Environment Programme (OTEP) is jointly funded and managed by DFID and the FCO and totals £2 million over four years; the Enhancing Capacity for Adaptation to Climate Change (ECACC) project in the Caribbean, which works with a number of Caribbean governments, including Anguilla, to help them adapt to climate change; an initiative to help Overseas Territories engage in international climate change negotiations. This allowed Anguilla to have a stronger engagement in the development of a UK Government position in the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change Conference of Parties at Mexico in December 2010.</p>

 Subject to the passage of the Health and Social Care Bill, clinical commissioning groups will take on responsibility for commissioning the majority of national health service healthcare services. The Government's response to the NHS Future Forum Report makes clear that it will strengthen existing duties on clinical commissioning groups to secure professional advice and ensure this advice is from a full range of health professionals where relevant.

They may relate to true side effects, or they may be due to coincidental illness. As reports are not necessarily proof that a vaccine or medicine was a cause of the reported illness, the data cannot be used to estimate the true frequency of side effects to the vaccine.

This involved daily review of all suspected side effect reports and an epidemiological approach to detection and evaluation of any new safety ‘signals’. This included review of data from other countries using the vaccine. MHRA published weekly updates on this surveillance via its website as well as summaries in the Drug Safety Update bulletin April 2009, October 2009 and October 2010:</p>

This followed administration of more than 4.5 million doses of vaccine in the UK up to July 2010. CHM advised that no serious new risks have been identified in association with Cervarix and the balance of risks and benefits of the vaccine remains positive.

 The Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) has not received any applications for support in connection with exports to Colombia. If ECGD was approached, its support would be provided in accordance with the OECD “Revised Council Recommendation on Common Approaches on the Environment and Officially Supported Export Credits” (the Common Approaches). Applications for ECGD support that fall within the ambit of the Common Approaches are screened by ECGD for potential environmental, social and human rights impacts, including the impacts of land acquisition and involuntary resettlement. Under the Common Approaches, relevant projects are required to meet international standards, usually those of the World Bank Group. This includes the International Finance Corporation's Performance Standard 5, which covers land acquisition and involuntary resettlement issues.</p>

To protect the viability of institutions at risk, and with the agreement of the Information Commissioner, HEFCE releases information on institutions assessed to be at higher risk three years after the assessment was made. The most recent available information relates to November 2007, when there were six institutions in HEFCE's ‘at higher risk’ category. The Government accepts the Public Accounts Committee's recent recommendation that this approach should be reviewed and will do this in the context of its forthcoming consultation on the future role of HEFCE.</p>

 It is part of the routine business of Headquarters Land Forces (HQ LF) to plan and manage unit moves. For example, in September 2010 the Army completed the move of HQ Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) and its supporting elements from the Rhine Garrison to Innsworth, Gloucestershire. This move and other scheduled activities were planned before we completed the Strategic Defence and Security Review. Consequently, there is already a team in HQ LF which is carrying out the necessary work. Once we have concluded the basing study, this team will work with the Defence Infrastructure Organisation, UK Support Command (Germany) and the German authorities to develop and implement the larger draw-down plan.</p>

Rounding has been applied to all figures. When rounding to the nearest 10, numbers ending in five have been rounded to the nearest multiple of 20 to prevent systematic bias. Totals have been rounded separately and therefore may not equal the sum of their rounded parts.

 The Future Rapid Effect System has been recast from a single programme into a set of constituent programmes, one of which is the utility vehicle programme. The Department continues to examine the best way to take the utility vehicle programme forward. The total cost of the utility vehicle programme and platform numbers will be confirmed when the main investment decision is taken. The Department does not publish such estimates before this point as its disclosure would prejudice commercial interests.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 4 July 2011]:</i>Fire services employed on the Ministry of Defence (MOD) estate have established plans that identify the respective roles and responsibilities of the MOD fire services and the local authority fire services in the event of fire incidents at Defence establishments. In support of the mutual co-operation and interoperability that already exists between these organisations Joint training and exercises are regularly undertaken, as are liaison visits to review risks and to ensure emergency responders maintain familiarity with the sites' facilities, hazards and operational procedures. These arrangements are in place at all Defence sites where MOD fire services are established, including research and storage facilities.</p>

               <a name="1107072000436"> Several local authority fire and rescue services responded to the fire at Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) on 3 August 2010, including Royal Berkshire, Hampshire and the London fire brigade, as well as the AWE fire and rescue service and the Defence Fire Risk Management Organisation (DFRMO). DFRMO has investigated the fire and rescue services' operational response to the fire. Their report, which was published on the MOD website on 9 June, identifies a number of learning points and provides recommendations to rectify those shortfalls identified in the fire services' response to the fire incident. The DFRMO report can be accessed via the following link:</p>

<sup>(2)</sup> Excludes those whose nationality and/or country of birth was not known.
<sup>(3)</sup> Coefficients of Variation have been calculated for the latest period as an indication of the quality of the estimates, as described below:
<i>Guide to Quality:</i>
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV—for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220
<i>Key:</i>
* 0 = CV&lt;5%—Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered precise
** 5 = CV &lt;10%—Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered reasonably precise
*** 10 = CV &lt;20%—Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered acceptable
**** CV ? 20%—Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered too unreliable for practical purposes
CV = Coefficient of Variation
<i>Note:</i>
It should be noted that the above estimates exclude people in most types of communal establishment (e.g. hotels, boarding houses, hostels mobile home sites etc.)

 Decisions on investment in schools are made locally and the Department does not collect data on, or make forecasts of, expenditure on school buildings. Most of the capital which the Department allocates to local authorities for schools is not ring-fenced. Up to 2010-11, significant amounts of the funding allocated to local authorities were in the form of supported borrowings, and local authorities may not fully have raised their nominal allocations. Local authorities and schools may use other sources of funding in addition to the funding they are allocated by the Department.</p>
