To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what plans his Department has for further research into depleted uranium; and if he will make a statement.  [44012]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20314w01.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence has funded extensive research into DU munitions over many years. This work has been complemented by studies on the health and environmental consequences of the testing, development and battlefield use of DU munitions carried out by a range of governmental and non-governmental bodies in the UK and overseas. These studies, and the Royal Society's report, all indicate that the health risks associated with the battlefield use of DU are minimal, other than in a small number of very specific circumstances.
<P>

<a name="20314w01.html_para0">Nevertheless, there are a number of areas where we believe that further research is desirable to enhance the database on which to make judgments weighing the potential loss of life arising from not using DU munitions in battle against any potential longer term impact on human health and the environment resulting from its use. Some research will aid MOD in any future test-range decommissioning.
<P>

<a name="20314w01.html_para1">We therefore propose to carry out a programme of further research, which has been reviewed by the Royal Society, the Medical Research Council and the Natural Environment Research Council. We have given veterans' representatives early sight of the programme. The full details of our proposals have been placed in the Library of the House. They have also been published on the MOD's website.
<P>

<a name="20314w01.html_para2">Much of the work is in line with the recommendations of the Royal Society's report. In particular, we propose to conduct an epidemiological study to identify any links between exposure to DU and ill health, and a critical review of literature relating to the effects of DU inhalation on the pulmonary lymph nodes. We also intend to study the ways in which DU is transported from the point of introduction into the environment to the point at which it has the potential to affect the health of plant, animal or human life. Furthermore, we have already begun research into the corrosion and dissolution rates of DU in typical corrosion environments and in controlled laboratory studies. We intend to consider a range of soil types and profiles and marine environments in this work.
<P>

<a name="20314w01.html_para3">In addition, we propose to carry out research into the operational role of DU munitions and consider alternative penetrator materials. We aim to conduct a radiochemical analysis of DU rounds and examine contamination in the barrels used to fire DU round. Further to this, we aim to review and address work being conducted by others on biokinetic modelling related to uranic materials.




<P>
<P><I>14 Mar 2002 : Column 1180W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20314w01.html_para4">These research activities are in addition to work that MOD is already undertaking. We have set up the independent Depleted Uranium Oversight Board, which includes independent members of the scientific community and veterans' representatives as well as MOD staff and is now overseeing the programme of work to devise a valid test for uranium isotopes in urine and a methodology for a voluntary DU screening programme for Balkans and Gulf veterans. We are developing our policy of biological monitoring for DU for troops on operations. We are also collecting data on the levels of DU in environmental samples in Kosovo. Annual surveys are already in progress at UK ranges where DU has been fired.
<P>

<a name="20314w01.html_para5">It will be necessary to set priorities for funding each of the proposals, and re-assess their relevance and content as the research progresses.

 As I informed the hon. Member in my reply of 9 July 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 365W, the Board of Inquiry into the sad loss of HMS Sheffield was conducted to the highest professional standards. It was the responsibility of the Board of Inquiry to ensure that it had all the information it needed to reach its conclusions about the loss of HMS Sheffield and to support its report and recommendations. This included interviews with 98 members of Sheffield's company. The Board had access to all available information and considered all the evidence that it believed to be relevant. As I informed the hon. Member previously, much of the information put before the Board of Inquiry remains classified. I am satisfied that the Board of Inquiry was conducted in a professional and proper manner and that no useful purpose would be served by re-opening this tragic incident. I am not aware of any representations other than those made by the hon. Member regarding the re-opening of the inquiry into the sinking of HMS Sheffield but this information would not be held centrally.

 The number of United Kingdom armed forces personnel serving in the Persian Gulf region fluctuates. Operational Detachments, Defence Attaches, Liaison Officers, Staff College students, training advisory teams and other service personnel are deployed, and their numbers are kept under review. In addition assets are regularly deployed and/or recovered for a variety of reasons; for example in September and October 2001 23,000 men and women were deployed to Oman for exercise Saif Sareea II.

 Where a former mineworker makes a claim for both respiratory disease and Vibration White Finger, VWF, and is entitled to loss of earnings or services, there may be overlap between the claims, which could result in double compensation. Discussions are currently taking place between the Department and the Claimants' Solicitors Group as to how to process these claims. The general damages element of these dual claims can be dealt with while discussions are in progress.

 Comprehensive data on mortality rates in internally displaced persons (IDPs) camps in Afghanistan are not available. However, as access has improved in Afghanistan, agencies have been able to provide better- targeted assistance and to monitor the situation more effectively. For example, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has reported a significant decrease in mortality rates at Maslakh camp outside Herat. An estimated 180,000 displaced persons, mostly from Ghor and Badghis provinces, have been living in Maslakh camp since September 2000. By December 2001, the crude mortality rate was 0.47 per 10,000 people: a death rate of approximately 50 persons per week. This figure has now halved to approximately 0.2 per 10,000.

 The volatile situation remains a serious concern for refugees returning to Afghanistan.

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and I represented the UK at the Council. The GAC adopted the "A" points listed in document 6220/02. It also noted the resolutions, decisions and opinions adopted by the European Parliament listed in document 5079/02 PE-RE 5. Copies of these documents have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. No formal votes were taken. Conclusions were reached by consensus on a number of issues, as follows.
<P>

<a name="20314w05.html_para0"><i>Zimbabwe</i>
<P>

<a name="20314w05.html_para1">The Council heard a report from the head of the EU election observation mission, whom the Government of Zimbabwe had refused to accredit. Ambassador Schori's report confirmed that the conditions did not exist for the EU to mount a credible mission. On 28 January, the Council had agreed that the consultations with Zimbabwe under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement would be closed and targeted sanctions implemented if the Government of Zimbabwe prevented the deployment of an EU election observation mission, or if it prevented the mission from operating effectively, or prevented the international media from having free access to cover the election, or if there was a serious deterioration in the situation on the ground, or if the election was assessed as not being free and fair.
<P>

<a name="20314w05.html_para2">At the February GAC, the Council concluded that the principles enshrined in Article 9 of the Cotonou Agreement had not been respected despite all efforts made by the European Union through Article 8 dialogue and later, Article 96 consultations. Consequently, and in the light of its January agreement, the Council decided to close Article 96 consultations and take appropriate measures. Furthermore, the Council decided to implement targeted sanctions in the form of an embargo on the sale, supply or transfer of arms and technical advice, assistance or training related to military activities and an embargo on the sale or supply of equipment which could be used for internal repression in Zimbabwe, as well as a travel ban on persons who engage in serious violations of human rights and of the freedom of opinion, of association and of peaceful assembly in Zimbabwe and a freezing of their funds, other financial assets or economic resources. The Council also decided to withdraw without delay all EU electoral observers still present in Zimbabwe.
<P>

<a name="20314w05.html_para3"><i>Work in other Council formations</i>
<P>

<a name="20314w05.html_para4">The Council took stock of a presidency report on work on the most important issues currently under discussion in other Council configurations, including topics being considered in the ECOFIN, Agriculture, Justice and Home Affairs and Education Councils. The Council noted that a number of these issues were of particular relevance in the run-up to the spring European Council in Barcelona. The Council also agreed to monitor the work of the Convention on the future of the European Union.

<i>Barcelona European Council</i>
<P>

<a name="20314w05.html_para5">The presidency outlined plans for practical organisation of the Barcelona European Council, noting that the GAC on 11&#150;12 March would focus on substantive preparations. The Council agreed that the Barcelona European Council should take a number of concrete steps on priority actions to be taken to ensure delivery of the EU's economic reform strategy set at the Lisbon European Council in 2000.
<P>

<a name="20314w05.html_para6">The Council noted that separate meetings with Heads of State or Government, Foreign Ministers and Finance Ministers from the candidate countries would be held during the Barcelona Council. The Council was informed that a summit with social partners would take place on 14 March with the participation of the President of the European Council, the President of the Commission, the Prime Ministers of Denmark and Greece, as well as their respective Employment Ministers.
<P>

<a name="20314w05.html_para7"><i>Enlargement</i>
<P>

<a name="20314w05.html_para8">The Council noted a Commission presentation on financial aspects of the enlargement negotiations, following recent discussions by Foreign and Finance Ministers. The Council invited the Commission to submit draft common positions for the negotiating chapters on Financial and Budgetary Provisions, Agriculture and Regional Policy and Co-ordination of Structural Instruments as soon as possible, taking into account the Council's deliberations. The Council recalled that timely production of these draft common positions was essential in order to keep to the road map laid down by the Nice European Council and the timetable for concluding negotiations agreed by the European Councils in Goteborg and Laeken. The Council reaffirmed that the negotiations will be based on the present acquis and on the financial framework ceilings decided by the European Council in Berlin in 1999.
<P>

<a name="20314w05.html_para9"><i>Economic and social cohesion report</i>
<P>

<a name="20314w05.html_para10">The Council heard a Commission presentation of the update to the second report on economic and social cohesion. The report updates the data presented in January 2001, analyses potential disparities in a Union of 25 and summarises the debate on future cohesion policy after enlargement. The Council instructed the Permanent Representatives Committee to examine this report with a view to further work by the Council in due course.
<P>

<a name="20314w05.html_para11"><i>Debate on the effectiveness of the EU's external actions</i>
<P>

<a name="20314w05.html_para12">The Council held a policy debate on ways for the Union to achieve more effective and comprehensive external action on the basis of a presidency paper and report by the Commission. Ministers addressed the relationship between development and foreign policy objectives; the need for improved flexibility and responsiveness; and the need for speedy delivery of external assistance and the quality of such assistance. The presidency suggested in particular that the Secretary-General/High Representative and the Commission looked further at specific areas of work for improving effectiveness, including the use of case studies, improved co-ordination in the field, better use of decentralisation and improving inter-pillar co-ordination. The outcome of this work should be submitted to the May GAC, at which an initial review could be undertaken with a possible further review in the autumn.

<i>Middle East Peace Process</i>
<P>

<a name="20314w05.html_para13">The Foreign Secretary and the German Foreign Minister both briefed partners on their visits to the middle east. The GAC reaffirmed the EU's view, as set out in the Laeken European Council declaration, that a political perspective must be established if there is to be sustained progress. It was accepted that an improved security situation was an essential first step and this required determined action by the Palestinian Authority. The importance of close EU-US co-ordination was stressed. High Representative Solana was asked to return to the region.
<P>

<a name="20314w05.html_para14"><i>UN Financing for Development conference</i>
<P>

<a name="20314w05.html_para15">The Commission presented proposals for increasing the quantity and quality of official development assistance (ODA). The Council invited the Permanent Representatives Committee to examine the Commission's proposals before the March General Affairs Council so that the Union can make an important contribution to the success of the UN conference, to be held that month in Mexico, through the adoption of positive initiatives.

On Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), High Representative Petritsch outlined the recent achievements and the likely future challenges. He confirmed that he would step down by the end of May, to be succeeded by Lord Ashdown. The Council expressed its willingness to appoint Lord Ashdown as the EU Special Representative in BiH (EUSR) when he becomes High Representative. The Council announced the EU's readiness to ensure the follow-on to the UN International Police Task Force (IPTF) in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 2003.

 The People's Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) is not an organisation proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000. The group is none the less a terrorist entity which, for example, claimed responsibility for the assassination of Israeli Tourism Minister Ze'evy in October 2001. The Bank of England froze the assets of the PFLP in 2001 as a result of its involvement in terrorism.

<a name="20314w06.html_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 After 36 years' service the VC10s were withdrawn from their ministerial transport role at the end of 2001. The royal family had ceased using the VC10 nine years ago. The Government considered a number of options for future long-range royal and ministerial air travel. These included chartering commercial aircraft, adapting an existing RAF aircraft, and procuring a new aircraft.
<P>

<a name="20314w06.html_para0">The Government have decided that when a dedicated aircraft is needed it will charter a commercial aircraft. In line with current practice, any accompanying business- people or press will usually be asked to pay their share of costs. Where there are security concerns RAF planes will be used. We assess that this approach is likely to be the most cost-effective. In many cases a dedicated aircraft is not necessary and Ministers and members of the royal family will continue to travel on scheduled flights.

To ask the Prime Minister, pursuant to his answer to the right hon.

 Social services funding is increasing by around 20.4 per cent. in real terms between 1996&#150;97 and 2002&#150;03; an average of 3.1 per cent. each year, compared with an average of 0.1 per cent. annual real terms growth between 1992&#150;93 and 1996&#150;97.
<P>

<a name="20314w06.html_para2">Local government's social service responsibilities are funded through general grant as part of the local government finance settlement, ring-fenced grants provided by the Department of Health and local authorities through council tax. Decisions on the budgets local authorities allocate to particular services are for local authorities to make bearing in mind their statutory responsibilities, their priorities and the wishes of their electorate. It is not therefore possible to say how much funding for social services has been provided through council tax or general grant.

 The Government have allocated &#163;87 million towards the expenditure by local authorities in England on Disabled Facilities Grants (DFGs) for 2001&#150;02. This meets 60 per cent. of the total cost of such grants, the remaining 40 per cent. being met from elsewhere in local authorities' budgets. The latest estimate on the number of DFGs made in England is 28,097 for 2001&#150;02. The Government do not collect data separately on the number of grants paid to adults or children.

 The Secretary of State confirmed in February 2002 that following placement of an objection to de-trunking of the A46/A36 by the South West Regional Assembly a further study into the management of the route and the traffic problems related to the route in Bath would be commissioned shortly. Formal appointment of a consultant to undertake the work is progressing with interviews of those firms shortlisted taking place soon. Not until this study had been completed, December 2002 in the current programme, would Bath and North East Somerset Council agree to continue with de-trunking negotiations.
<P>

<a name="20314w08.html_para1">There are four other local authorities involved in taking over sections of the route on satisfactory completion of de-trunking negotiations. No serious obstacles to completing negotiations successfully with these remaining four authorities have been identified. Although this might suggest that a piecemeal de-trunking of the route is possible this would not be in the public interest nor would this course of action answer the Regional Assembly's objection.

These would direct the SRA to consider the use of Special Purpose Vehicles to undertake rail infrastructure works (section 8.2) and require the SRA to detail in its strategy how and by when such projects will be introduced (section 7.4). A copy was placed in the House Library at the time of their publication.

To ask the Chairman of the Information Committee what measures he is taking to improve remote access to PDVN for hon. Members' constituency staff; and what recent assessment he has made of the reliability of access to the network.  [43127]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20314w09.html_spnew4"><B> Michael Fabricant: </B> 
 I fully recognise the need to improve the reliability of remote access services for hon. Members' constituency staff. As a short-term measure, the Parliamentary Communications Directorate has tested an upgrade to the existing remote access software (Citrix) and plans to make it available shortly to all hon. Members. 



<P>
<P><I>14 Mar 2002 : Column 1208W</I><P>
It is expected that this upgrade will improve the performance of the remote access service, within the limitations of the Citrix product.
<P>

<a name="20314w09.html_para0">The question of remote access for constituency staff is a matter for the President of the Council and is being pursued in the context of the changes to hon. Members' allowances which were agreed by the House on 5 July 2001. I understand that the House is in the final stages of placing a contract to provide Members with improved access to the Internet and to the Parliamentary Data and Video Network (PDVN) via a commercial Internet Service Provider (ISP). Once the necessary administrative, financial and technical elements are in place, Members' constituency offices will be able to connect directly to the PDVN using a Virtual Private Network (VPN), which will allow broadband access (such as ADSL where available) as well as ISDN and dial-up services. It is hoped that a pilot of the new service will take place in July 2002, and I am optimistic that this long-term solution will provide considerable benefits for hon. Members and their staff.

 The National Curriculum is gender-free, requiring equality of opportunity for girls and boys between the ages of five and 16. Pupils study an equal balance of biology, physics and chemistry together with aspects of earth science and astronomy. Results in primary science are excellent; in 2001, 87 per cent. of pupils achieved level 4, the standard expected for their age, or above, a 25 per cent. increase since 1996. Building on the achievements at primary level, we are piloting a science strategy designed to raise standards for all 11 to 14-year-olds and a national programme will be introduced in all schools in September. In recognition of its importance in preparing young people for adult and working life, we are proposing the retention of science as a core subject for 14 to 16-year-olds in our consultation document: "14&#150;19 extending opportunities, raising standards".

 The Department's policy is to strengthen research excellence and support world-class research. The Higher Education Funding Council for England implements this policy by providing funding selectively to higher education institutions, taking into account the quality of their research in each subject as measured by the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE). The purpose of the RAE is to distribute funding, not to determine the amount of funding that should be made available. However, in the light of the improvement in quality shown in the 2001 RAE, my Department has made available an extra &#163;30 million in 2002&#150;03 to allow the Higher Education Funding Council for England better to support high quality research in higher education. Future research funding is being considered as part of the current spending review.

 In 1996&#150;97, when this Government came to office, capital spending on school buildings was &#163;683 million. This has risen to &#163;2.2 billion for 2001&#150;02, and will rise further to an annual rate of &#163;3.5 billion by 2003&#150;04. Between April 2002 and April 2004, over &#163;6.4 billion will be available for investment in school buildings. Local education authorities and schools are able to use this greatly increased funding to address the backlog of repairs that had built up over years of under- funding by the previous Administration. They can also start to modernise the schools estate to meet the teaching and learning needs of the 21st century.

<a name="20314w13.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The air conditioning central chiller plant in 50 Queen Anne's Gate was replaced last year, because the old plant contained Chlorofluorocarbons, which were banned from 31 December 2000. This project did not form part of a larger refurbishment.
<P>

<a name="20314w13.html_para3">The procurement of the replacement chillers was handled using the standard procurement procedures for works contracts below the value of &#163;3.6 million. Consultant engineers, Torpy Management (now known as Halcrow) and the Facilities Management Contractors, Johnson Controls, were asked to select five firms established in this particular field to tender. Another firm chaired by the right hon. Member for Suffolk Coastal (Mr. Gummer) offering an innovative environmentally friendly solution approached our consultants. This firm was seriously considered, but was not invited to tender, because our consultants considered that the alternative offered would have increased the cost and project risk unacceptably. The building work required in an occupied building would have been more extensive. In making this decision, the consultants took advice from the then Property Advisers to the Civil Estate (now part of the Office of Government Commerce) and experts within their own organisation.
<P>

<a name="20314w13.html_para4">The consultants were aware of the Home Office's Greening Operations Policy, which advised that environmentally friendly alternatives to Hydrofluorocarbons should be used where feasible. It was their view that a safe, technically feasible and cost-effective environmentally preferable solution did not exist in this particular case, taking into account that the building is in need of a major overall refurbishment and the Department's plans to relocate to 2 Marsham Street in three to four years' time. However, the firms that were asked to tender were invited to offer environmentally innovative solutions&#151;none did so and the contract was awarded in October 2000 to a firm using a standard environmentally compliant refrigerant containing Hydrofluorocarbons.

<a name="20314w14.html_spnew8"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Sex Offenders Act 1997 requires offenders cautioned for, convicted of, or found not guilty by reason of insanity of an offence specified in Schedule One to the Act to provide certain details to the police. There is, however, no "register" of sex offenders, as such; nor are sex offenders subject to the requirements of the Act separately identified as such in criminal statistics.
<P>

<a name="20314w14.html_para4">Until recently, data on the number of sex offenders subject to the requirements of the Act were collated biannually on a national basis from the police national computer. However, this arrangement has been overtaken following guidance issued by the Home Office in respect of the provisions in section 67 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000. The guidance requires information about the number of sex offenders subject to the Act's requirements in each police area to be published on an annual basis starting in 2002 and local systems are being put in place to deliver this. Until these systems are in place information on numbers of sex offenders subject to the Act's requirements could be obtained only by a specific exercise by the particular police force concerned. We have no plans to require publication by constituency or to break down published figures further.

 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has approved an agreement reached in the Police Negotiating Board (PNB) granting improved maternity leave to policewomen in England and Wales. The PNB Agreement also creates new rights for police officers to maternity support leave, adoption leave and to time off to care for dependants. The full details of the agreement are set out in Home Office Circular hoc 12&#150;2002 that has been placed in the Library.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what estimate he has made of the net saving in public expenditure that will be made in 2001&#150;02 due to the public sector's reduced liability for national insurance contributions following the rebates associated with the climate change levy.  [41828]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20314w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The levy package is expected to lead to little change to the overall public finances in 2001&#150;02. An estimate of the impact of the climate change levy package on the public finances was published by HM Customs and Excise in the Regulatory Impact Assessment for the levy in April 2000 including national insurance implications for public sector employees. Subsequently in Budget 2001 the Government revised the estimate of the cost of the enhanced capital allowances for investments in energy-saving measures from its previous figure of &#163;100 million per year to &#163;70 million for 2001&#150;02 and &#163;130 million for 2002&#150;03.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what estimate she has made of the <i>(a)</i> financial costs and <i>(b)</i> benefits to her Department of the parental leave directive.  [42485]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20314w16.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 To date no staff in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport have taken parental leave. We estimate future costs to be minimal as parental leave is currently unpaid. The Department already offers paid and unpaid maternity leave, paid paternity leave, career breaks, paid and unpaid special leave and a range of flexible working patterns, so we do not envisage the current parental leave arrangements to be of significant benefit to the Department.

<P>

<a name="20314w20.html_para1">Taken together, the findings of serious case reviews are an important source of information to inform national policy and practice. The Department of Health is responsible for identifying and disseminating common themes and trends across review reports, and acting on lessons for policy and practice. We will shortly be publishing an overview report drawing out the key findings of a selection of case reviews from the last two years, and their implications for policy and practice. At the same time, we are developing a comprehensive database of all serious case reviews.

<a name="20314w21.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Hopkins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to increase the number of cleaning staff employed by the NHS.  [40645]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20314w21.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 March 2002]:</i> We recognise that the standard of cleanliness in our hospitals is important to patients, their relatives, staff and the public. The investment we have made since the publication of the NHS Plan has seen standards raised across the board. The implementation of the Patient Environment Action Team programme has ensured that this issue remains high on trusts' agendas and a further round of unannounced inspections is currently under way to ensure that the progress made has been maintained and, where necessary, built upon.
<P>

<a name="20314w21.html_para0">As announced in the NHS Plan, there is now a national standard of cleanliness for the NHS which all trusts with in-patient beds are required to report against as part of the performance assessment framework. This means that for the first time there is a comprehensive standard for the whole NHS which is outcome-based and measures what is, or is not, clean. NHS trusts will need to employ sufficient staff to ensure that these standards are met, or to adjust cleaning contracts accordingly.
<P>

<a name="20314w21.html_para1">The responsibility for ensuring wards are clean has been restored to ward sisters, with the support of modern matrons, and they have also been given the authority to withhold payment where the required standards are not met.
<P>

<a name="20314w21.html_para2">The NHS Plan also set a target for ward-housekeepers to be in place in 50 per cent. of hospitals by 2004. The duties of the ward house-keeper will include working alongside cleaning staff, who may be directly or indirectly employed, to ensure that ward environments are clean, tidy and well maintained and they will report to ward sisters. Already 41 per cent. of trusts have started to introduce ward-housekeepers.
<P>

<a name="20314w21.html_para3">Attracting staff to work in the NHS requires there to be career opportunities and pathways which are attractive and flexible. The introduction of the ward-housekeeper role provides a further pathway for staff, who may enter the NHS as cleaners, to develop their skills and continue their career in the NHS.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20314w21.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Hopkins: </B>

<P>
<a name="20314w21.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 March 2002]:</i> The information requested is not collected centrally.
<P>

<a name="20314w21.html_para4">"The National Standards of Cleanliness for the National Health Service" was published in April 2001, and all trusts are required to ensure that these standards are implemented from this year. NHS trusts will need to ensure that cleaning contracts are adjusted to take account of these standards.
<P>

<a name="20314w21.html_para5">The national standards have been developed to ensure that all trusts with in-patient beds apply the same standards of cleanliness regardless of who provides the cleaning services.
