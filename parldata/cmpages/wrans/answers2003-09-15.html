<P>
<a name="30915w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General what percentage of the care home abuse cases have been rejected by the Crown Prosecution Service since 1997.  [128390]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service does not maintain a central database of cases, and 'care home abuse cases' do not form a separate category of offence. The information requested could be obtained only by examining every case file and would therefore incur disproportionate costs.
<P>

<a name="30915w01.html_para0">Recently, ACPO undertook a study that concluded that between 1997 and 2000 the CPS rejected 79 per cent. of cases of institutional child abuse referred to it. Of the cases that were prosecuted, convictions were achieved in 83 per cent. of cases.

<P>
<a name="30915w01.html_spmin1"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 In March this year, I arranged and attended a meeting between the CPS, the SFO and the Federation of Small Businesses.
<P>

<a name="30915w01.html_para1">I have had discussions with colleagues in the DTI about the importance of tackling fraud against small business.
<P>

<a name="30915w01.html_para2">In July of this year, the Home Office published their report on responses to their consultation on business crime.

To ask the Solicitor-General what targets were set by the CPS in 2002&#150;03 on meeting the needs of victims and witnesses in the criminal justice system, in co-operation with other criminal justice agencies; and what the performance results are of these targets.  [128719]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w01.html_spmin2"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 Meeting the needs of victims and witnesses in the criminal justice system, in co-operation with other criminal justice agencies was a specific Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) objective in 2002&#150;03 and is set out in the 2002&#150;03 CPS Annual Report.
<P>

<a name="30915w01.html_para3">Two targets were set: firstly, to pay 100 per cent. of correctly completed witness expense claims within 10 days; and secondly, to increase to 94 per cent. the proportion of replies to complaints within 10 days.




<P>
<P><I>15 Sept 2003 : Column 494W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30915w01.html_para4">In respect of the first target, CPS performance improved compared with 2001&#150;02. During 2002&#150;03, 99.8 per cent. of witness expenses were paid within agreed timescales compared with 98.2 per cent. in 2001&#150;02.
<P>

<a name="30915w01.html_para5">The second target was not met, although CPS performance improved considerably compared with 2001&#150;02. Timely replies were made in 89.2 per cent. of cases in 2002&#150;03, compared with 81.9 per cent. of cases in 2001&#150;02.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General what steps the Crown Prosection Service has taken to improve the service to <i>(a)</i> victims and <i>(b)</i> witnesses of crime.  [128858]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w01.html_spmin3"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is working to improve the service that victims and witnesses of crime receive. This includes working with the Home Office and other criminal justice system agencies in developing the Government's recently published national strategy to deliver improved services to victims and witnesses.
<P>

<a name="30915w01.html_para6">The CPS has fully implemented the direct communication with victims initiative, whereby prosecutors provide reasons to victims for decisions to drop or substantially alter charges. A meeting to provide a further explanation should also be offered in cases involving death, child abuse, sexual offences, racial offences or offences with a homophobic element.
<P>

<a name="30915w01.html_para7">In relation to vulnerable or intimidated witnesses, the CPS is continuing to work closely with the Home Office and others to implement measures recommended in the report Speaking up for Justice, given statutory force by the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999. In July 2002, video recorded statements became admissible as evidence in chief in crown court proceedings for children under 17 and for vulnerable adults. In the crown court, the provision to give evidence by way of TV link is also available to children, vulnerable adults and intimidated witnesses. The CPS undertook a comprehensive training programme to ensure that staff were fully aware of the issues raised by the new measures. By March 2003, over 1000 CPS staff had been trained.
<P>

<a name="30915w01.html_para8">In relation to general victim and witness care, the CPS is working with ACPO and the Office for Public Service Reform on piloting a Victim and Witness Care Project that builds on the developing working relationship between the police and the CPS. Five pilot Areas (Gwent, North Wales, West Midlands, Essex and South Yorkshire) were established in July 2003. The pilot will run until March 2004.
<P>

<a name="30915w01.html_para9">In all pilot Areas, police officers will undertake a needs assessment for all victims and witnesses. If criminal proceedings are commenced, dedicated witness care staff will manage delivery of information and support to witnesses throughout the life of a case.
<P>

<a name="30915w01.html_para10">The CPS has also been conducting a public consultation on whether prosecutors should be permitted to conduct pre-trial interviews with prosecution witnesses in order to assess their reliability. 



<P>
<P><I>15 Sept 2003 : Column 495W</I><P>
The consultation period ended on 2 1 July 2003 and the report is due to be placed before the Attorney-General in the autumn of 2003.

To ask the Solicitor-General what steps are being taken by the CPS to target street crime in each hot spot street crime area.  [128723]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w01.html_spmin4"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 Since April 2002, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has worked in partnership with the police and the courts to target street crime in the 10 areas with the biggest robbery problem.
<P>

<a name="30915w01.html_para12">As a result, levels of street crime in these 10 areas have been reduced by 17 per cent. and conviction rates have been improved.
<P>

<a name="30915w01.html_para13">The CPS has played a central role by developing a premium service for street crime cases whereby experienced prosecutors get 'in early and stay late'. The elements of the premium service are:

<a name="30915w01.html_spmin7"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 In 2002&#150;03 the Crown Prosecution Service prosecuted 1,362,312 defendants in magistrates courts, of which 94,546 proceeded to the Crown Court. The comparable figures for 2001&#150;02 were 1,304,185 defendants prosecuted in magistrates courts, of which 84,335 proceeded to the Crown Court.

<P>
<P><I>15 Sept 2003 : Column 496W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30915w01.html_para15">The number of defendants prosecuted by the CPS rose over the two year period. In magistrates courts there was an increase of 58,127, or 4.5 per cent. In the Crown Court there was an increase of 10,211 defendants, or 12.1 per cent.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General how many <i>(a)</i> summary cases and <i>(b)</i> indictable or either way cases were received by the Crown Prosecution Service in 2002&#150;03.  [128859]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w01.html_spmin8"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service holds no central records showing the type of charge in cases received: rather the information is recorded when the case is eventually completed.
<P>

<a name="30915w01.html_para16">In 2002&#150;03 the Service dealt with 796,742 defendants in summary proceedings in magistrates courts, and 565,570 in either way and indictable only proceedings in the magistrates courts and the Crown court.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w01.html_spmin9"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 Pending the implementation of the charging scheme in the Criminal Justice Bill, the police and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) are establishing non-statutory arrangements (based on those which were piloted in 2002) which involve their working together more closely pre-charge. One element is the provision of early CPS advice through a duty prosecutor routinely stationed at busy police stations or charging centres. These arrangements, which in some Areas are still at the planning stage, should be in operation in all Areas by the end of the year. Prior to the charging pilot, advices sought by the police from most forces were usually limited to a few cases involving substantial legal difficulty. Frequently, advice was sought after charge when many of the issues were already decided and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) intervention would often involve a reversal of previous police decisions. In the charging pilot last year over 6,100 advices were sought by the police during the period of CPS attendance.

<P>
<a name="30915w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B>

<a name="30915w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Edwards: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General if she will make a statement on guidance issued to the Crown Prosecution Service on the conduct of cases involving domestic violence.  [129395]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w02.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 Cases involving domestic violence are conducted in accordance with the Crown Prosecution Service revised policy on prosecution of cases of domestic violence issued in November 2001. The policy focuses on the safety of the victim and children, while holding abusers accountable for their actions. The CPS is committed to supporting victims by, where appropriate, the use of special measures and, wherever possible, by constructing cases on the basis of evidence other than that of the victim.
<P>

<a name="30915w02.html_para0">The CPS network of domestic violence co-ordinators facilitates implementation of the revised policy, assists in providing training and shares and promotes good practice and a consistency of approach across the 42 areas.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w02.html_spmin1"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 There are two officials in the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers who assist in dealing with any questions of international law relating to Iraq. There is a longstanding convention, followed by successive governments, that neither the substance of Law Officers' advice, nor the fact that they have been consulted, is publicly disclosed. This is consistent with paragraphs 2 and 4<i>(d)</i> of Part II of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

 The Government established a National Criminal Justice Board and 42 Local Criminal Justice Boards following recommendations made by Lord Justice Auld in his review of the Criminal Courts and as part of a wider package of Criminal Justice reform announced in the White Paper "Justice for All".
<P>

<a name="30915w02.html_para1">At a national level, a National Criminal Justice Board comprising CJS Ministers, senior officials from the Home Office, the CPS, the Department for Constitutional Affairs and senior representatives from the police and the judiciary, is responsible for

<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w02.html_spmin3"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) keeps a wide range of statistical information on matters pertaining to the prosecution of cases, as do the courts and other criminal justice agencies. Data is gathered by CPS on generic reasons leading to unsuccessful case outcomes but this does not extend to specific and unusual acts, such as a witness receiving payment from a media organisation.

 During the period of the trial opening (2000 and 2001) of the summer line of route, tickets were on sale in Westminster Hall. Following the Houses' decision to put the arrangement on a permanent footing, and pending the outcome of discussions with Westminster City Council as the local planning authority and with English Heritage, a temporary facility on Abingdon Green was used as a ticket office in 2002. The cost was &#163;53,500, of which the House of Commons share was &#163;32,100.

 A number of small-scale improvements to ease congestion and improve safety are planned to be implemented by late 2004. In the longer term, following the Secretary of State's announcement on 9 July 2003, the Highways Agency has been asked to work with local authorities and statutory environmental bodies to identify schemes that are less damaging than those recommended by the South Coast Multi-Modal Study and reduce the need for major road construction. The Highways Agency are expected to report back in the middle of 2004, which will enable a decision on the way forward.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will take steps to prevent airlines from intentionally overbooking flights; if he will issue guidance to airline companies on appropriate <i>(a)</i> levels of compensation and <i>(b)</i> alternative arrangements for passengers unable to board flights they booked; and if he will make a statement.  [129217]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Overbooking is an accepted practice among full-service scheduled airlines. On any particular flight there is likely to be a proportion of passengers, mainly from those holding flexible tickets, who do not check in. On the basis of statistical evidence from previous flights, airlines estimate the probable number of no-shows and overbook accordingly. On the great majority of flights no passengers are denied boarding, and by reducing the number of empty seats overbooking keeps fares lower than they would otherwise be. This practice is widely accepted by passenger organisations and by regulators as being in the best interests of consumers generally.
<P>

<a name="30915w04.html_para0">In the comparatively small proportion of cases where denied boarding occurs, existing Community legislation requires Community air carriers to provide prescribed minimum levels of financial compensation, in addition to offering passengers a choice between re-routing and reimbursement. In December 2001 the European Commission presented a proposal for a regulation to increase levels of compensation to passengers denied boarding, as well as to require the provision of assistance to travellers affected by cancellations for commercial reasons or delays. Political agreement on this proposal was reached at Transport Council in December 2002, and it is currently subject to conciliation procedures involving the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The International Civil Aviation Organisation recommend that, as far as possible, symbols alone should be used without words and that, where words are found to be essential, the choice of languages should be determined having regard to the particular needs of air travellers and the general public. We consider that airport operators are best placed to judge whether any language other than English would be beneficial in conjunction with particular signs, and that it is not necessary or desirable to impose requirements on them in this respect.

 In the case of Luton Airport, in the fiscal year to 31 March 2003 the proportion of car park revenue to total revenue was 21 per cent. For Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, the proportions were, respectively, 6 per cent., 9 per cent., and 20 per cent.

<a name="30915w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Based on an analysis of cases of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) between 1990 and 2000, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) estimates that there is an incidence in pilots of 0.2 per 1,000 per year. The annual incidence for the northern European population as a whole is 1.6&#150;1.8 per 1,000 per year. Records are not kept by the CAA on the health of cabin crew as this group, unlike professional pilots, are not required to have routine regulatory medical examinations.

 Advice on health and travel is widely available to the public in the Department of Health's 'Health advice for Travellers' booklet. The Government issued specific advice on travel-related deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in 2001, which has been made available to the public through NHS Direct, the internet, the airlines and health services. All UK long-haul carriers have produced information for their passengers, in pamphlets, videos or announcements, incorporating material contained in the Government's advice.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w04.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 All the factors you have mentioned have been appropriately taken into account in the development of the options presented in the consultation. The constraints imposed by each factor vary in relation to each option. For instance, wake vortices are less of a problem where there is greater distance between two runways (i.e. the wide spaced two runway option). In the close parallel option, their potential effects can restrict operations to the dependent segregated mode (resulting in reduced movement capacity).
<P>

<a name="30915w04.html_para2">Further information is contained in the Optioneering report for Gatwick, Stansted and Southampton airports, which was included in the package of SERAS documents made available as part of the consultation (document reference numbers 51 and 66). Although this information relates to options which differ somewhat from those presented in the consultation document, the differences between the options are small in this respect.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what impact to the public safety zone related to the proposed new wide spaced runway at Gatwick would have on use of the main London to Brighton railway line.  [129002]

<P>
<a name="30915w04.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The impact of the Public Safety Zone (PSZ) for the proposed wide-spaced runway on the use of the London to Brighton railway line is likely to be small. The focus of PSZs is on the risks associated with residential property and places where people congregate for significant time. These risks are greater than for road and rail traffic passing through the zones as the time spent stationery is relatively short.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w04.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Maude: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport by how much the high ground to the west would reduce the runway length available for take-offs in relation to the proposed new wide spaced runway at Gatwick.  [129003]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w04.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Information on how the high ground to the west of the airport would reduce the runway length for take-offs is given in the Optioneering report for Gatwick, Stansted and Southampton airports, and included in the package of SERAS documents made available as part of the consultation (document reference number 51). Page 25 of the report states that the TODA (take-off distance available) would be reduced to about 2,550m. Although this information relates to a slightly different runway location it should be regarded only as an estimate and, therefore, remains broadly valid.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w04.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Maude: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what studies he has made of the alternative plans produced by BAA for a close parallel runway at Gatwick; and what asessment he has made of the additional environmental impact of these plans.  [129004]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w04.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 As with all alternative options put forward during the consultation, we are considering these carefully.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w04.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Maude: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how much earth would need to be removed to make the proposed new north runway at Gatwick level with the rest of the existing airport.  [129102]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w04.html_spnew13"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 This information is contained in the Optioneering report for Gatwick, Stansted and Southampton airports, and included in the package of SERAS documents made available as part of the consultation (document reference number 51). Page 28 of the report states that an estimated 18 million cubic metres of material would need to be removed to create a platform 1100 million wide. The corresponding draft layout plan for Gatwick with a possible new northern runway is shown in the associated document of figures, also available (document reference number 66, figure 4.4).

<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Regulations specific to ship to ship transfer operations within UK waters, remain in draft form as a Statutory Instrument and Merchant Shipping Notice at this time. No specific regulations apply beyond the 12 mile limit.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what contingency plans are in place for dealing with spillages within and beyond the 12 mile limit from ship to ship oil and chemical transfers in Lyme Bay; and if he will make a statement.  [129161]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Within the 12 mile limit of UK waters, transfers comply with draft legislation and include contingency planning for oil spills, mainly through the mechanism of Ship's Oil Pollution Emergency Plans (SOPEPS). Where cargoes being transferred are of a particularly persistent nature, appropriate oil recovery, collection and containment measures are also required in the form of a recovery vessel on stand-by throughout the operations.
<P>

<a name="30915w05.html_para6">Beyond the 12 mile limit, but within the UK's Pollution Control Zone, which can stretch up to 200 miles off shore, pollution resulting from ship to ship transfers would be treated in the same way as marine pollution from any other source.

 There are only two locations outside harbour limits and within UK waters where ship to ship transfers are allowed to take place, namely off Lyme Bay, Dorset and Southwold, Suffolk. The industry has accepted current draft regulations governing these transfers as a common standard.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many former Chatham Dockyard workers have been given estimated radiation dose records.  [129736]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w06.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 It was necessary to enter estimated external doses into the statutory records of those radiation workers likely to receive higher radiation doses (called classified persons) when the film badge issued to these workers was lost or damaged. In such circumstances an estimated dose was entered onto an individual's dose record by entering doses from direct reading dosimeters worn by the individual. On the rare occasions when no dosimeter information was available, a calculation was made based upon time of exposure and radiation dose rates in areas where the individual worked. Since these details were entered onto individual records and there was no requirement to record the number of such events centrally, the numbers could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

 Providing a safe, secure and risk free environment for the Iraqi people is a key aspect of restoration activity for the coalition.

While the Ministry of Defence has not therefore allocated Defence funds to demining operators for the cleaning of UK unexploded ordnance, we have provided personnel to help the process. The UK and the Iraq Mine Action Centre are in the process of marking and documenting around 400 unexploded ordnance sites.

 The six Joint Rapid Reaction Force ro-ro are not part of the Royal Navy. They are commercial vessels, sponsored by the Ministry of Defence. They were built and are owned and operated, under a Private Finance Initiative, by AWSR Shipping, a commercial consortium. They are manned by Merchant Navy seafarers, who are members of the Sponsored Reserves List of the Royal Naval Reserve, and are therefore liable for call-up when the situation dictates.
<P>

<a name="30915w08.html_para3">In the same way as for Royal Navy ships, threat assessments are carried out and the appropriate level of protection is provided to the ro-ro, when considered necessary. Such protection may include a United Kingdom Service escort party on-board or accompanying Royal Navy ships.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (1) how the statement in the Government's response to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee report on A London Olympic Bid, Cm 5867, that special funding streams to meet Olympic costs should be closed by 2013&#150;14, accords with her statement on 15th May, <i>Official Report</i>, column 481, on the length of time that the special London council tax precept will run;  [128084]
<P>
<UL>(2) how long the London council tax precept to contribute to the cost of a London Olympic Games will last; at what level it will be set each year; and what the proceeds will be.  [128085]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w10.html_spnew5"><B> Tessa Jowell: </B> 
 The Memorandum of Understanding between the Government and the Mayor of London, as published in the response to the Select committee, makes clear that "the Government and Mayor's expectation I that special funding streams to meet Olympic costs should be closed, having provided the necessary amounts, by 2013&#150;14, except that where the Greater London Authority has borrowed to meet capital costs of the Olympics it may be necessary to extend the period during which the Olympic precept is levied to reflect the requirements of the prudential framework for capital finance."
<P>

<a name="30915w10.html_para6">Within that Memorandum, London is required to contribute up to &#163;550 million towards the cost of the staging of the Games, with provision for a further &#163;75 million if needed. The Mayor has said that he will raise this from the London Council Tax from an additional &#163;20 a year charge, or 38p a week, on Council Tax for a band D property, likely to begin in 2006&#150;07 if the bid is successful. On the current tax base it is estimated that this would arise the required &#163;550 million in ten years and a further &#163;75 million within another two years if necessary. However, the Mayor has also advised that during the period from 2006&#150;07 the tax base will increase and so that time period may reduce. In addition, the funding package for the Games allows a &#163;1.2 billion contingency over and above Arup's estimates of required public subsidy for staging the Olympics. The time period for collection of Council Tax would also reduce if all contingencies were not required, and it is the Mayor's expectation that special funding streams should have closed, having provided the necessary amount by 2013&#150;14. In the unlikely event that the full funding package is required, and the GLA has to 



<P>
<P><I>15 Sept 2003 : Column 528W</I><P>
borrow to meet capital costs of staging the Olympics then the period of special funding may extend beyond that dated as allowed for in the Memorandum.
<P>

<a name="30915w10.html_para7">My statement to the House on 15 May on the length of the time that the special London council tax precept would run presented the Government's assessment of a possible worst-case scenario. The Memorandum of Understanding, as I have explained, makes provision for such an eventuality. However, current expectations are that this will not be the se and that special funding streams should be capable of being closed by 2013&#150;14. The Mayor has also advised that current expectations are that in the unlikely event that the full London contribution were required this could be raised in less than 12 years.

The objective of the Digital Television Action Plan Project is to ensure these criteria are met so that we can, if we choose, take the decision to proceed to full switchover by ordering the switching off by 2010 of analogue terrestrial transmissions.

<i>[holding answer 11 September 2003]:</i> Responsibility for what is broadcast on television rests with the broadcasters and the organisations which regulate broadcasting&#151;the Governors of the BBC, the Independent Television Commission and the Welsh Fourth Channel Authority. They are independent of the Government and responsible for safeguarding the public interest in broadcasting. In carrying out their responsibilities, these authorities have a duty to ensure that programmes contain nothing which offends against good taste and decency or is likely to be offensive to public feeling. They also maintain guidelines for programme-makers on the standards which should be observed. This guidance includes advice on the use of language and timing of programmes and recommends when warning announcements about programmes should be made. In addition, the Broadcasting Standards Commission acts as a forum for public concern.
<P>

<a name="30915w11.html_para1">The Communications Act 2003 establishes a new regulatory framework for broadcasting and the communications industries, including the creation of a single regulatory body for the communications industries, the Office of Communications, which will have similar responsibilities for broadcast content. Viewers who are offended by television programmes should complain to the relevant broadcaster and, in the case of serious breaches of the regulatory codes, to the regulator.

 European Community law sets out the import conditions which must be met by all meat imported into the community from third countries. These conditions do not permit meat to be imported from areas where veterinary controls cannot guarantee that the meat poses negligible disease risk to human or animal health. Defra veterinary experts and the Food Standards Agency are fully engaged in negotiations to develop Community import conditions. Should the disease situation in an exporting country change, for example if a new outbreak of disease is notified, the European Commission will introduce safeguard measures to control imports so that there is no increased risk of disease as a result. Pending these changes to community rules, in such a situation individual member states are permitted to introduce unilateral provisions to control imports. The Government take such unilateral action whenever the situation demands it.

<a name="30915w12.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Maude: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty lie within 15 miles of Gatwick airport; and what assessment she has made of the impact on these AONB's from new flight paths to the proposed new runways at Gatwick.  [129008]<P>

<P>
<a name="30915w12.html_spnew1"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Parts of four Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty lie within 15 miles of Gatwick airport. The Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty concerned are the Kent Downs, Sussex Downs, High Weald and Surrey Hills. We have worked closely with the 



<P>
<P><I>15 Sept 2003 : Column 534W</I><P>
Department for Transport to ensure that the noise impact of the proposed new airport developments is given full consideration. Taking the 57dB contour as the onset of significant community annoyance, the options for a single close parallel or wide parallel runway are likely to have a minimal impact on the surrounding Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The option of building two additional runways at Gatwick would have a greater impact on the Surrey Hills and High Weald Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

<P>
<a name="30915w12.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the operation of the cattle passport scheme.  [129065]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w12.html_spnew2"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The cattle passport scheme is operated by the British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS) and became part of the Rural Payments Agency on 1 April 2003. The cattle passport scheme has been in operation for over six years and the national cattle database contains the details of the 9.7 million animals that make up the national herd. We are currently investing a further &#163;12 million to upgrade the system and improve its performance.
<P>

<a name="30915w12.html_para2">BCMS operates to ISO 9001:2000 standards, is registered with the British Standards Institute and its operating practices have received the Kite mark. In addition to paper reporting systems, we have provided online facilities via a website for cattle keepers to use. BCMS are constantly striving to improve their service and efficiency.

<a name="30915w12.html_wqn3"><B> Andrew Bennett: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to her answer of 13 May 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 142W, on the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, if she will set out the timetable for the implementation of regulations under Part I of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.

<P>
<a name="30915w12.html_spnew3"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The following table records the progress we have already made towards bringing the regulations into force and our timetable for completing the process. As I explained in my answer of 13 May, the precise timing may vary but we are firmly committed to ensuring the necessary regulations are made to allow the new right of public access under the Act to be rolled out as planned. Regulations enabling persons to dedicate land for access came into force on 1 September and I expect to lay regulations relating to the exclusion or restriction of access soon.

<P>

<a name="30915w12.html_para6">Dr. Chris Fay holds the title Emissions Trading Champion. Reporting to the Director for Climate, Energy and Environmental Risk, he assisted the Government in recruiting participants to the UK's voluntary Emissions Trading Scheme launched in April 2002, and plays a role in communicating with business on emissions trading issues.
<P>

<a name="30915w12.html_para7">Lord Haskins acted as Rural Recovery Co-ordinator during the latter part of the foot and mouth disease outbreak in 2001. His role was to help local authorities and other agencies plan for the economic recovery of Cumbria, and to consider what lessons were also applicable to other areas affected by the outbreak. Lord Haskins began work on 14 August 2001 and reported to me in October 2001.

The figures will include press officers, although they are not separately identified. The total number of permanent and casual civil servants on both a head-count and a full-time equivalent basis at 1 April 2002 is available in Table A of Civil Service Statistics. Full-time equivalents are preferred to head-counts when examining trends over time. Also, the number of permanent staff is preferred as a basis when looking at trends as casual staff numbers reflect short-term responses to changes in workloads.

<a name="30915w13.html_spnew1"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The Animal By-Products Regulations 2003 permit hunt kennels to continue collecting fallen stock; however they will be required to upgrade to knackers' yard standards if they wish to collect fallen stock for the purposes of feeding to hounds. The effect of a ban on hunting would depend on decisions made by those who currently offer a service and on choices made by farmers leading to takeup of the national scheme. Most hunts already make a charge and there is no reason why such a service should not continue as a business opportunity when hunting wild mammals with dogs is banned.

<i>[holding answer 10 September 2003]:</i> EU import duties on fresh fruit and vegetables are set for a range of products on an ad valorem basis. For some products, an additional or minimum sum based on an amount per kilo is payable. The relevant duty rate is applied to the customs value which is normally based on the price actually paid or payable for the goods. However, for certain products, simplified rules are in place which allow a standard unit value to be used as the customs value; these are updated fortnightly. The simplified procedure values in force from 29 August to 11 September are as follows:

<P>

<a name="30915w14.html_para0">The paper sought opinions as to whether the Government should introduce new regulations for the positioning of external lighting (including domestic or security lighting, but excluding street lights); and whether the remit of the statutory nuisance regime should be extended to include such lighting. The consultation period closed on 14 February. A summary of the comments received to this consultation exercise has now been published. Most respondents felt that the statutory nuisance regime would be the most effective option, but issues were highlighted regarding the need to identify a feasible means of assessing external light for enforcement purpose.

 <i>[holding answer 11 September 2003]</i>: Cypermethrin is included as an active ingredient in 12 products currently authorised for use as veterinary medicines, including a number of sheep dips. All of these products have been fully assessed against a number of statutory criteria designed to assure their safety, quality and efficacy for this use.
<P>

<a name="30915w14.html_para3">However my officials are currently investigating reports that suggest that a number of farmers may be purchasing an arable form of cypermethrin for use illegally to dip sheep. Although these investigations are at an early stage we have identified a number of sheep farmers in the Ceredigion region of South Wales who do not grow arable crops but who recently have purchased arable cypermethrin products.
<P>

<a name="30915w14.html_para4">The arable product has been assessed for use as a pesticide, not as a sheep dip. It is not possible accurately to quantify the risks to the environment, animal health or human health from the illegal use of arable cypermethrin products as sheep dips as more information is required on how the product has actually been used. We are trying to collect this information and will carry out a risk assessment as soon as we are able. However, from the limited information currently available, our main concern relates to the potential environmental damage that might be caused by the inappropriate use, and disposal, of such products.

 With the exception of schemes targeted at particular industry sectors, such as the Vocational Training Scheme provided under the England Rural Development Programme, people working in the countryside are entitled to the same wide and diverse range of training opportunities as people working elsewhere. The pattern of provision varies from place to place. Issues which are specific to the countryside, such as access to training for people living in remote rural areas, are being examined in the Department's Learning Skills and Knowledge Review.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what research her Department has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> evaluated on chemical resistant varroa mites; and what plans she has to contain the spread of varroa mites.  [113257]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Controlling varroa is still the single most important challenge to UK beekeeping today. The pest is now endemic across much of the UK. Defra (and MAFF before it) has been funding a range of measures applied by the National Bee Unit under the Department's bee health programme, and R&D to better equip beekeepers to manage varroa infestations in their colonies ever since it was first detected in Devon in 1992. These measures include the provision of a free diagnostic and inspection service as well as training and education to enable beekeepers to become self-reliant in controlling the mite through improved bee husbandry.
<P>

<a name="30915w14.html_para6">The Department has not yet commissioned any R&D on resistant mites, although current research investigating biological control methods for varroa is extremely relevant given the presence in England and Wales of varroa mites resistant to Apistan and Bayvarol, until recently the only two varroacides authorised for use in the UK.

<a name="30915w14.html_para7">As has been demonstrated on the Continent, the varroa mite will develop resistance to most chemicals applied to control it; the spread of resistance is therefore inevitable. However, with foresight, the National Bee Unit began implementing a surveillance programme monitoring apiaries for signs of resistance in early 2000. As a result, the UK has been one of only a few countries that has been able to detect resistance before it has become fully established, thus enabling us to take action to help beekeepers treat affected colonies at an early stage. Although resistance is more widespread this year, the recent introduction on the UK market of a new treatment for varroa is welcome. Unlike Apistan and Bayvarol, the new product, Apiguard, is not based on a pyrethroid active ingredient and beekeepers will be able to use this, along with other controls, in particular Integrated Pest Management, which we are strongly advocating, to combat pyrethroid resistant mites.

 We have studied various and somewhat contradictory assessments that have been made by others considering the effect of music piracy on the internet on music sales and the cost of legally purchased music. These suggest that reliable evaluation of the relationship would be difficult. Moreover, my understanding is that much illegal file sharing on the internet is illegal private copying rather than piracy which further adds to the difficulty of an evaluation.
<P>

<a name="30915w14.html_para8">Although UK copyright law already provides strong protection for those who own rights in music, our implementation in the UK of the EU Copyright Directive will clarify these rights and introduce criminal offences for internet music piracy, that is wilful illegal transmission of music on the internet when conducted at least on a commercial scale. The increasing availability of legitimate music tracks on the internet should also assist in encouraging those engaged in illegal private copying to desist and the clarification of the law resulting from the Copyright Directive should enable the music industry to trade online with even greater confidence.

 The 'Go Karts' sequence was one of a number included in the Early Literacy Support (ELS) video made available to local authorities in September 2000, as part of the first national training of Reception and Year 1 teachers and teaching assistants. The specific purpose of this sequence was to provide training to Reception teachers about the ELS programme. Revisions were made to the video and training materials that were sent to schools in September 2001, specifically to support the implementation of the programme in Year 1.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills for what reasons <i>(a)</i> further education tuition for adults to Level 2 will be free and <i>(b)</i> tuition to Level 3 will be charged for.  [129698]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w16.html_spnew8"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 In making decisions about public funds we have to prioritise so that funding is targeted where it will make the most difference. Over 7 million adults in the workforce in England do not possess level 2 or equivalent qualifications. These individuals are more likely to lack the foundation of skills they need for employability, and are less likely to get a secure, well paid job. In contrast, the higher wages paid to people with qualifications above level 2 offer a greater incentive for both individuals and employers to invest in learning. The entitlement to free tuition for individuals studying for a first full level 2 qualification, to which the right hon. Gentleman refers, will enable individuals to achieve a level of educational attainment that will provide them with a with a platform of skills for employability, enable them to improve their position in the labour market and increase their chances of undertaking further learning.
<P>

<a name="30915w16.html_para6">This focus on using public funds to help people reach level 2 should be seen within a wider strategy which encourages up-skilling and re-skilling at all levels. To that end, the Government will provide increased support for individuals developing their skills and qualifications at level 3 in priority sectors and to meet specific regional skills needs. We believe that this is the fairest way to manage participation in further education, and make productivity gains with public investment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w17.html_spnew3"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 Support for dependent students under 25 in higher education is based on a financial assessment of their parents' gross income in the previous financial year. In the academic year 2003/04, parents will not make any contribution to their children's support if their residual income is below &#163;20,970 a year.
<P>

<a name="30915w17.html_para0">Where there is more than one child in higher education, the total parental contribution is limited to the amount that would be assessed if there were only one student child. The parental contribution is then apportioned between the number of children in the family studying a course of higher education. Therefore, where parents have more than one student child, there is no higher assessed parental contribution to make to their student support.

<P>
<a name="30915w17.html_spnew4"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Government do not regulate the levels of fee charged for Masters Degree courses: it is for Higher Education Institutions to decide what level of fee they will charge. The Government do not make available assistance in the form of grants for fees for students undertaking Masters Degrees. The research councils and the Arts and Humanities Research Board provide a number of studentships and research grants each year for postgraduate students, including some on Masters courses depending on the field of study.

 Universities are taking into account an increasingly wide range of evidence when making decisions about a candidate's suitability. The extent to which vocational and work-based learning qualifications are taken into account varies from course to course, but they are particularly relevant for more vocationally orientated courses such as foundation degrees. However, this is a matter for universities and we have no figures on the number of courses for which vocational or work-based qualifications are taken into account in assessing a student's suitability.

 The Department for International Development provides extensive financial and technical support for the development of microfinance globally. Much of this work involves collaboration with The World Bank. DFID is an active member of The Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest (CGAP), a 29-member organisation of donors and private foundations committed to the spread of best practice and the expansion of microfinance worldwide.
<P>

<a name="30915w17.html_para1">CGAP is based in Washington DC, and is supervised by the World Bank, its largest shareholder. DFID currently chairs CGAP's Executive Committee, and works with the organisation in many developing countries to help commercialise microfinance institutions, extend their outreach to more clients, and diversify the range of financial services they offer poor clients from credit to savings, insurance, leasing and remittances.
<P>

<a name="30915w17.html_para2">DFID also collaborates with World Bank officials in several of its country programmes including Uganda, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan. This involves co-ordinating programmes to develop the financial sector, and to mainstream microfinance into the formal banking system. DFID also supports programmes of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in the World Bank Group in the Balkans, Africa, South Asia, China and the Mekong. These programmes improve the policy and regulatory environment for small enterprise development, and support the expansion of private banks and non-governmental organisations that provide microfinance services.

 Adults with learning disabilities are able to access the full range of services provided by Jobcentre Plus. In addition Jobcentre Plus offers a range of programmes specifically tailored to the needs of disabled customers. These are, Access to Work, Work Preparation, Workstep and New Deal for Disabled People. These programmes are all aimed to help customers with disabilities, including learning disabilities, move into paid employment.
<P>

<a name="30915w19.html_para0">Access to these programmes is through Disability Employment Advisers (DEAs), who are based in Jobcentre and Jobcentre Plus offices. DEAs work closely with employers, employees and disabled people looking for work.
<P>

<a name="30915w19.html_para1">Workstep is the employment programme most suitable for many people with learning disabilities. Workstep provides tailored support for people with disabilities who have more complex barriers to finding and keeping work. It provides the support and opportunity for people to progress to unsupported employment where this is the right option for the individual. Of the 21,500 people accessing support through Workstep, 37 per cent. have a learning disability.

By June 2004, all pensioner households will have been contacted. These direct mail arrangements are being supported by a national TV and press advertising campaign, which began on 3 September. The Pension Service is also working with partner organisations at national and local level to encourage take-up of the new entitlement. The Pension Credit freephone application line, which became operational on 7 April, enables our trained staff to help pensioners through the application form and complete it for them over the telephone. Friends and family can use the application line and apply on a pensioner's behalf.

 There has been only limited exports of beef from Northern Ireland in each of the last seven years.

Northern Ireland companies have either recently been approved, or are at an advanced stage leading to approval, under the Date Based Export Scheme. To date, only an insignificant tonnage of beef has been exported but it is expected that volumes will increase as new contracts are secured and more companies are fully approved in the coming months.

 Until last week the definition of BSE moderate risk status was 100 BSE positive cases per million adult cattle aged over 24 months. Northern Ireland incidence of positive cases of BSE for the period May 2002 to April 2003 is 112 positive cases per million adult cattle aged over 24 months.

 In March 2003, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, in partnership with the Department of Education and the Department for Employment and Learning, published "Enterprising Education"&#151;the Entrepreneurship and Education Action Plan.




<P>
<P><I>15 Sept 2003 : Column 570W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30915w20.html_para10">Fully integrating entrepreneurship and education will take time and concentrated effort by a range of key stakeholders. The primary purpose of Enterprising Education is to establish an initial framework of action to provide a strong foundation for moving forward the integration process. The long-term goal is to ensure that every learner, including life-long learners, is given the opportunity to build the skills and develop the attributes which equip any individual to make a unique, innovative and creative contribution in the world of work.
<P>

<a name="30915w20.html_para11">The Action Plan, which will establish benchmarks, is the first stage in a longer-term process and will inform future decision-making. Progress will be reviewed on an annual basis and each Department will continue to promote the benefits of strengthening business/education links within their respective Departments and the wider circles in which they operate.
<P>

<a name="30915w20.html_para12">A copy of the Action Plan can be viewed or downloaded at www.detini.gov.uk.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w22.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Beggs: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what action is being taken to support Northern Ireland's <i>(a)</i> existing and <i>(b)</i> new (i) high technology and (ii) telecommunications industry and entrepreneurs; and if he will make a statement.  [128294]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w22.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 Invest NI has focused significant resources in these areas in its overall drive to support existing companies to become more innovative and competitive and to encourage the formation of new, entrepreneurial, business starts. Support for existing hi-tech and telecommunications companies during 2002&#150;03 resulted in companies bringing forward business proposals representing a total investment of almost &#163;109 million, against which Invest NI offered &#163;14.3 million in support. In addition, the Agency assisted the formation of 74 new, potentially high growth companies in these sectors.
<P>

<a name="30915w22.html_para0">In driving forward this work, Invest NI uses a broad range of measures designed to help all companies, both existing and new starts, increase their capability. These include fostering greater innovation, increasing levels of R&D, developing external trade and utilising a variety of other business improvement tools.
<P>

<a name="30915w22.html_para1">During its first year of operation, Invest NI played a key role in establishing the Northern Ireland Science Park and it also provided &#163;26 million to assist the establishment of 17 centres of research excellence, the majority of which are focused on high technology sectors. In addition, Invest NI has drawn up a series of Sector Strategies aimed at maximizing the economic development potential for a range of industrial sectors including hi-tech and telecoms.
<P>

<a name="30915w22.html_para2">This work provides an important demonstration of Invest NI's commitment to engage with companies, higher and further education establishments, centres of research excellence, science parks and other research organisations in developing hi-tech start-up businesses. In addition Invest NI is working closely with the education sector and others to encourage entrepreneurship in Northern Ireland.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland whether horses in Northern Ireland are defined as agricultural animals by Northern Ireland Departments; and if he will make a statement. [R]  [128420]




<P>
<P><I>15 Sept 2003 : Column 575W</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w22.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 Under NI legislation, the horse is not classified as an agricultural animal. This mirrors the position in the other parts of the UK.
<P>

<a name="30915w22.html_para3">The Report "Vision for the future of the agri-food industry" included a number of recommendations relating to the equine sector. One of these was that the redesignation of the horse as an agricultural animal should be pursued in the longer term. In the Vision Action Plan which I published in November 2002, I highlighted that there were wider issues to consider and that these would be discussed with the industry in due course.
<P>

<a name="30915w22.html_para4">I have recently established an Equine Stakeholder Group, one of whose early tasks will be to advise on a comprehensive study of the equine industry in Northern Ireland. This will run in tandem with a similar study in Great Britain. The designation of the horse will be an aspect of both studies.
<P>

<a name="30915w22.html_para5">The overall rating system in Northern Ireland is currently subject to a major policy review. A Policy paper on existing and potential non-domestic reliefs and exemptions will be published in late autumn. That paper will include consideration of the need for the introduction of any exemption or relief for the equine industry.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w22.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. McGrady: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what further steps will be taken by the <i>(a)</i> Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and <i>(b)</i> Eastern Health and Social Services Board to address the funding imbalance of the Down Lisburn Health and Social Services Trust; and if he will make a statement.  [128311]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w22.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 A target has been set, by the Department, in "Priorities for Action 2003&#150;04", that all HSS Boards should have strategies to address locality equity issues prepared by March 2004 and work is ongoing on this. I understand that the Eastern Health and Social Services Board intend to publish their latest assessment of the locality equity position within their area in the autumn. It is their policy, endorsed by the Department, to ensure that existing services are maintained and to address equity issues by levelling up resources through skewing new money to populations that are currently receiving less than their target share. For example the population of the Down Lisburn area gained by some &#163;1.5 million through such a skewing strategy in 2003&#150;04. It should be noted that equity assessments are based on the needs of a population living in an area and not on the funding of any specific Trust.
<P>

<a name="30915w22.html_para6">Locality equity is a priority for the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety but it must be balanced by the need to ensure that existing service provision is not destabilised. This results in change being phased in over a period, usually some 3&#150;4 years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what action is being taken by 



<P>
<P><I>15 Sept 2003 : Column 576W</I><P>
Northern Ireland Departments to address adult basic literacy and numeracy problems; and if he will make a statement.  [128280]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w22.html_spnew3"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The Department for Employment and Learning (DEL) launched the Essential Skills for Living Strategy and Action Plan in October 2002. The strategy aims to support 25,000 adults to improve their literacy and numeracy skills by 2005.
<P>

<a name="30915w22.html_para7">The Department has established an Essential Skills Committee comprising key stakeholders from Government Departments, business and industry, the further education sector and the voluntary and community sector to take the strategy forward. It has developed also a framework of qualifications through the universities for all levels of essential skills tutors. During 2002&#150;03, Queens University successfully delivered the Certificate in Management and Teaching of Literacy to 70 tutors and a further 66 have enrolled for the course in 2003&#150;04. The Department launched a major promotional campaign in May 2003, with the aim of engaging a wide range of learners to improve their essential skills.
<P>

<a name="30915w22.html_para8">Plans are in place to liaise with the Northern Ireland Departments to ensure essential skills is taken into account in the design and delivery of their policies and programmes. The Department of Finance and Personnel, for example, is developing a strategy and action plan for the delivery of essential skills throughout the Northern Ireland civil service. The Northern Ireland Prison Service has worked with DEL to enhance essential skills provision for prisoners and the Social Security Agency has been actively involved in considering new approaches to encourage benefit claimants to improve their essential skills. Pilot exercises using financial incentives and new essential skills screening tools are planned for January 2004.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w22.html_wqn4"><B> Mrs. Iris Robinson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what progress has been made by the Northern Ireland Fishing Task Force; and when it intends to publish its overall findings.  [113488]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w22.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 As a response to the December 2002 EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council decision, and the NI fishing community's reaction to it, I set up in January a Taskforce for South Down which is made up of officials from relevant NI Government departments, local councils and representatives of both the fish producers and processors to consider the wider socio-economic effects of the Council decisions and to identify whether there were more steps Government might take to address particular difficulties.
<P>

<a name="30915w22.html_para9">To help inform its work, the Taskforce undertook a consultation exercise with public meetings in Kilkeel, Ardglass and Portavogie. In addition Taskforce representatives have met with the Tri-Council Fisheries Working Group and with the NI Fisheries Harbour Authority. The Taskforce has also received 15 written submissions. A survey of producers and processors is also being undertaken to obtain information and views from the industry.
<P>

<a name="30915w22.html_para10">The Taskforce will be assessing all the information collected and views received with a view to publishing its findings in the summer.




<P>
<P><I>15 Sept 2003 : Column 577W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30915w22.html_para11">Finally, the Taskforce will also be following closely the work of the Cabinet Office Strategy Unit established by the Prime Minister to look at the medium to long-term issues facing the UK sea fishing industry. I am a member pf the Steering Group for this exercise. Along with the local representatives on the Stakeholder Advisory Group I shall ensure that the Northern Ireland perspective is properly covered in the Strategy Unit's work.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what progress has been made towards negotiating a Memorandum of Understanding between the Policing Board and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission; and if he will place a copy of the memorandum in the Library.  [114149]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w22.html_spnew5"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The Policing Board is committed to developing and maintaining effective working relationships with all other statutory authorities, including the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. It is committed to meeting its statutory duty of carrying out all its functions having regard to the need to co-ordinate its activities and co-operate with other statutory authorities.
<P>

<a name="30915w22.html_para12">The Policing Board has not entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with any statutory authority and is content that it can play its part in maintaining working relationships, including with the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, without the need for a Memorandum of Understanding.
<P>

<a name="30915w22.html_para13">This issue was most recently discussed at a meeting between representatives of the Policing Board and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission when both parties gave a commitment to follow good practice in sharing relevant documents and research; where appropriate to consult over and above legislative requirements, and to assist one another in the fulfilment of those statutory duties that relate to human rights issues.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will increase the proportion of funding to the primary school sector; and if he will make a statement.  [116045]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w23.html_spnew0"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The Government recognises that the current differential in funding between primary and post-primary funding in Northern Ireland is too wide. The Local Management of Schools Common Formula, scheduled to come into operation in April 2004, contains a number of factors by which resources can be more effectively targeted and it is intended to use these over the initial years of the formula to reduce the funding differential.
<P>

<a name="30915w23.html_para0">In recognition of the issue the Budget Addition allocations for 2003&#150;04, given to schools on top of their formula budget, were for the first time weighted in favour of the primary sector. This has resulted in an additional &#163;1 million being provided for primary schools this year.

 <i>[holding answer 8 September 2003]</i>: Over the last two years, the Home Secretary's Task Force on Child Protection on the Internet has run and evaluated two successful national awareness campaigns. The campaigns sought to raise awareness of Internet safety measures, via cinema, television and radio advertising, national newspapers, online advertising on teen websites and chatrooms, and sponsorship activity. The core messages that were conveyed were that: children/young people should not give out their address, email, mobile or other contact details, that they should never attend a face-to-face meeting unaccompanied by an adult, and that people may lie about their identity. The task force also issued a 'Keeping your child safe on the Internet' leaflet and 200,000 copies of the leaflet were distributed via doctors surgeries and as an insert in the Department for Education and Skills magazine <i>Parents</i> <i>+ Schools</i>.
<P>

<a name="30915w25.html_para4">The Home Office also runs two websites, thinkuknow.co.uk and wiseuptothenet.co.uk. The former is aimed at children and young people and the latter is aimed at parents. The Department for Education and Skills, Superhighway website and guidance, includes advice on all aspects of Internet safety such as walled gardens, firewalls, user contacts and net smart rules. Their revised guidance also includes advice on e-mails for students, filtering systems, school websites and chatrooms.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what measures he has put in place since 1999 to speed up the process of renewing a passport.  [128093]<P>

<P>
<a name="30915w25.html_spnew4"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Since 1999, the UK Passport Service (UKPS) has put in place a number of measures which have all contributed to speeding up the process of renewing a passport.
<P>

<a name="30915w25.html_para5">The UKPS has increased capacity by 30 per cent. through increased staffing, and the opening of a seventh passport office in Durham in March 2000. It opened its new London office in June 2000 which provides much improved service to its customers. TheUKPS has extended the working hours of its public counters which open longer on weekdays, and on Saturdays, and introduced a guaranteed one-day and one-week services, available by appointment, for those customers who need an urgent renewal service. The UKPS Service Standard has been set to process 99.5 per cent. of all correctly completed passport applications within 10 days and this is being consistently achieved throughout this year. To encourage renewal customers to apply early at less busy times, the UKPS has introduced a facility whereby customers can be credited on their new passport with the unexpired validity of their old passport, up to a maximum of nine months.
<P>

<a name="30915w25.html_para6">The UKPS has also improved the guidance to customers wishing to renew their passport. Page 1 of the information guide, which accompanies the passport application form, has a separate and clearly highlighted statement on what sections of the form to complete for renewals, and other relevant advice, to make completion of the form and its accurate submission easier. Finally, the UKPS has established a Call Centre, which handles passport inquiries 24 hours a day, seven days a week; and has enhanced its website (www.passport.gov.uk) to enable, among other things, e-mail inquiries, and online renewal application form completion. These measures all help customers to complete their applications accurately and to use the correct application channel to meet their needs.

<P>
<a name="30915w25.html_spnew6"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The Government's restorative justice strategy, issued on 22 July 2003, sets out proposals to extend the use of restorative justice, including mediation and reparation to victims and the community.
<P>

<a name="30915w25.html_para8">The Government aims to maximise the use of restorative justice in the Criminal Justice System, where we know it works well, to meet victims' needs and to reduce re-offending, and in society at large to resolve disputes and build strong, active communities. The strategy will also encourage more high quality, visible reparation by offenders to the community. The key link between restorative justice and reparation is that both are ways the offender can take responsibility for the harm they have caused and put it right. Both are ways that the Criminal Justice System can bring visible benefits to victims and other ordinary citizens, and be seen to be responsive to their needs. In practice, restorative justice can often lead to the offender making reparation to their victim, or to the wider community.
<P>

<a name="30915w25.html_para9">The launch of this strategy (which can be found on the Home Office website) marks the start of a 12-week consultation process. Officials have been working closely with criminal justice practitioners and the voluntary sector to develop the restorative justice strategy. Comments on the consultation paper are welcome.

<P>
<a name="30915w26.html_spnew0"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 We understand that West Sussex are considering closure of the safe house. It is, of course, for local authorities to decide how best to provide support and services for children in need in its area, including accommodation for children who are the victims of trafficking. There is no current specific earmarked funding for services of this nature. Instead, Government funding is allocated to councils with social services responsibilities on the basis of the needs of their populations. It is, therefore, for councils, working in partnership with relevant local stakeholders, to determine their spending priorities on the basis of local needs. A National Asylum Support Service grant reimburses local authorities for the extra costs incurred for the care of unaccompanied asylum seeking children.




<P>
<P><I>15 Sept 2003 : Column 589W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30915w26.html_para0">West Sussex recognise that a body of expertise has been built up in the safe house over the last two years. They plan to close the safe house and use this expertise in the form of training and support packages for carers of young people assessed as being at risk of being trafficked. Currently, the safe house caters only for 17 and 18-year-old girls. There are also concerns that its location has become widely known, thus undermining the security of the service provided. West Sussex feel that by closing the safe house they will be able to offer a service to all children at risk from traffickers, including boys and under-16s and address the security concerns that have arisen.

<P>
<a name="30915w26.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 We continue to monitor the situation in Chechnya and in the Caucasus. We have noted the steps the Russian Government is taking to establish a political process in Chechnya and welcomed the constitutional referendum held in March 2003. We continue to believe that the success of the political process will be dependent on the thorough and consistent implementation of the political and civil rights set out in the new constitution. While recognising the serious threat posed by terrorism in the region, we remain concerned about the security and human rights situation in Chechnya and the surrounding republics. We also note with concern the bombings in recent months throughout the North Caucasus.
<P>

<a name="30915w26.html_para3">Conflicts in and between the countries of the Southern Caucasus pose challenges for regional security and stability and the prospects for regional co-operation. As a member of the Group of Friends of the UN Secretary General on Georgia, the UK is participating in the process to find a political settlement to the Abkhazia dispute. On Nagorno Karabakh our policy is to support any solution acceptable to both parties, and capable of delivering a lasting political settlement. We support the efforts of the OSCE Minsk Group in this regard. Her Majesty's Government's Special Representative for the Caucasus region. Sir Brian Fall, is actively addressing these problems and will work closely with his newly-appointed EU colleague.

 After over a year in power, President Uribe continues to receive much support from the Colombian people. His government is still battling guerrilla and paramilitary groups which commit appalling human rights violations funded by illegal drug production, extortion and kidnapping. We support his efforts to tackle these problems and to develop a fully functioning democratic state throughout Colombia based on social and economic reform and sustainable economic development. At the same time we underline the need in so doing to respect the rule of law, human rights and the safety and welfare of its citizens. There is still much to do.

 The proposal in the draft Constitutional Treaty, to introduce a mechanism to enforce the subsidiarity principle, represents a significant step forward in the role that national parliaments will have in EU business. It provides, for the first time, a Treaty-based power for national parliaments to question EU legislative proposals on the basis of subsidiarity. If more than a third of national parliaments considered a proposal at odds with the principle of subsidiarity, the Commission would have to review it; and would in practice find it very difficult to ignore those parliaments' views.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what his estimate is of the revenue raised by the March 1998 Budget decision to abolish advanced corporation tax and introduce quarterly payments of corporation tax, for each year from 1998&#150;99 to 2005&#150;06; and if he will make a statement.  [130147]<P>

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what his latest estimate is of the cost of the changes to the statutory corporation tax deduction for share schemes announced in the Pre-Budget Report November 2002; what the purpose is of the changes; and if he will make a statement.  [130234]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w28.html_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The provision to introduce a statutory corporation tax relief for employee share acquisition announced in the November 2002 Pre-Budget Report was brought into effect by Schedule 23 of Finance Act 2003. The estimate of exchequer costs to provide the statutory relief is in the Final Regulatory Impact Assessment published on the 10 April 2003 and remain unchanged, growing to around &#163;95 million by 2007&#150;08. The purpose of the statutory relief is to encourage and enable companies to set-up or expand employee share schemes by removing the need for complex arrangements solely to obtain a CT deduction. It levels the playing field between the use of cash and equity as remuneration and provides a modern, simple and fair system. It gives certainty to companies in terms of timing and amount of relief, reduces administration and compliance costs.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) what assessment he has made of the extent of <i>(a)</i> illegal property ownership and <i>(b)</i> illegal working patterns in developing countries; and what assessment he has made of the impact in each case on the ability of developing countries meeting their international financial obligations;  [129314]

<P>

 There is widespread consensus that weak property rights are a key barrier to private sector development, economic growth and poverty reduction by, for example, deterring foreign investment, discouraging people from investing in their land, and preventing them from using it as collateral for loans.
<P>

<a name="30915w28.html_para2">Almost all of the world's poor are engaged in some form of private sector activity, with most in the informal sector. Private sector policy must therefore support the development of small, medium and micro enterprises in both the formal and informal sectors.
<P>

<a name="30915w28.html_para3">The ability of a country to meet its international financial obligations depends on a range of factors that will support private sector development and economic growth, including sound macroeconomic policies that ensure the level of debt remains sustainable.
<P>

<a name="30915w28.html_para4">There are many other factors that are important to securing greater investment, raising growth rates and reducing poverty including: the quality of governance, the level of corruption, crime and political instability; access to credit and finance; the quality of infrastructure; and the macroeconomic environment.

This research concluded that both schemes have met their objectives of encouraging more investment by individuals in smaller, high risk trading companies, which in turn has increased their potential to grow and become successful. The research did not measure the benefits of the holding period change specifically, but found that, of those existing investors that were aware of any changes made to the schemes, up to half would be more likely to invest through the schemes in future as a result.

 Estimates of the exchequer cost of tax and national insurance relief on options granted under Enterprise Management Incentives (EMI) were published in Budget 2000 for 2000&#150;01 to 2002&#150;03 (Table A.13). The additional costs of subsequent changes to the EMI rules were published in Budget 2001 (Table A.13) and the pre-Budget report 2001 (Table B4). These estimates are of the taxable salary sacrificed in lieu of EMI option grants and no further estimates have been made on this basis.
<P>

<a name="30915w29.html_para1">Each year, estimates of the tax and national insurance relief cost of gains made by employees upon exercise of their EMI options are published in Inland Revenue Statistics on the Revenue's website at www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/stats/emp share schemes/menu.htm. Only a very small number of employees exercised their options in the early years of EMI, so the estimated costs were negligible for 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02. These costs will rise as the scheme matures.

<a name="30915w29.html_para2">As stated in the Full Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA), published in March 2000, a full review of the success of EMI will take place during 2005.

To date, around 4,000 companies have granted EMI options to around 60,000 employees.

 Awards of child and working tax credits are adjusted if claimants report a change in the circumstances on which the award is based. Claimants may also ask for their award to be adjusted to reflect their expected income for the current tax year.
<P>

<a name="30915w30.html_para1">The tax credits award for 2003&#150;04 is initially based on the family's income for the tax year 2001&#150;02. The final tax credits award will be based on 2003&#150;04 income if it is lower, or more than &#163;2,500 higher, than 2001&#150;02 income. Even if income does rise, the first &#163;2,500 of the rise is ignored in finalising the award. To allow awards to be adjusted to reflect current income, claimants can ask during the year for their tax credits to be based on their expected 2003&#150;04 income, which is checked against actual income after the year end.

 The UK government have been at the forefront of the international debate on debt relief issues, and continues to press for the rapid and full implementation of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative.
<P>

<a name="30915w30.html_para7">Of the 38 countries that stand to benefit from enhanced HIPC debt relief, there are now 27&#151;23 from Africa and 4 from Latin America&#151;that already benefit from debt relief, which will amount in total to over $70 billion. This is a significant step towards achieving the $100 billion commitment made at the Cologne summit in 1999, and will reduce their debts to below the average for developing countries. For these 27 countries, the UK is providing 100 per cent. relief on their debts. Furthermore, the Chancellor has announced that any payments from countries yet to reach Decision Point would be held in trust for the day they can be returned to fund poverty reduction. Since 1999, the total UK commitment to multilateral institutions such as the World bank, the African Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to support the HIPC initiative has been $474 million.

participation of all creditors in the initiative, and reaffirmed their objective of ensuring debt sustainability for countries reaching completion point. Following on from discussions at Evian, the Chancellor will be working with other G7 Finance Ministers to agree the methodology for calculating the amount of "topping-up" debt relief available to countries. The UK has been pushing for a change in the rules of HIPC to exclude additional voluntary bilateral debt relief from the calculation of topping-up at Completion Point and the Chancellor will be working with other G8 Finance Ministers to review mechanisms to encourage good governance and the methodology for calculating the amount of topping-up debt relief available to countries&#151;a measure that could provide an estimated $1 billion extra debt relief to HIPCs. In addition, the Treasury and the Department for International Development is seeking international support to establish the International Finance Facility, which could raise $50 billion annually to fund the Millennium Development Goals. This money could be disbursed in the form of concessional loans and grants, including debt relief.

<a name="30915w31.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The Legal Services Commission assesses applications for Community Legal Service funding (formerly civil legal aid) against a means and a merits assessment under the Funding Code approved by Parliament. The only exceptions are public law Children Act cases and hearings before the Mental Health Review Tribunal, for which funding is available on a non-means, non-merits basis. A cost-benefit test is an important part of this assessment. The Code imposes different types of cost-benefit test according to the nature of the case. Broadly the criteria seek to ensure that public funding is only available in circumstances where a privately paying client would be prepared to litigate.
<P>

<a name="30915w31.html_para1">A cost-benefit test is not used when deciding whether to grant publicly funded legal representation in criminal cases.

 The Legal Services Commission is responsible for granting public funding in civil cases.

The criteria themselves are supported by detailed decision-making guidance which is regularly reviewed and updated by the Commission.

 Allocation of funds to a local authority under the Arms Length Management Organisation (ALMO) Programme is subject to two conditions: the council obtaining approval from the Secretary of State under section 27 of the Housing Act 1985 to delegate its housing management functions to an ALMO, for which tenant support is a key criterion; and the ALMO gaining at least a 2* from the Housing Inspectorate.

 Disabled Facilities Grants (DFGs) are administered by local authorities who are under a statutory duty to notify an applicant on whether or not their application is approved as soon as is reasonably practicable, but no later than six months after the date of application. The grant is payable on completion of the works. Authorities have a statutory power to delay payment if they are under financial pressure but in these cases this must not be beyond 12 months from the date of grant application.

<a name="30915w32.html_para0">We have recently consulted on new Office of the Deputy Prime Minister/Department of Health draft guidance on delivering housing adaptations for disabled people, which sets out the Government's view of best practice on service delivery. This includes target times for the complete delivery process including needs assessment, processing of the application and the completion of building works. These target times will depend on the complexity of, and priority attached to, individual cases but the guidance suggests that the maximum target time for the entire process should in any event be no more than 260 working days and only 80 working days in high priority cases.

 Planning policy guidance note 23 "Planning and pollution control", which was published in 1994 clearly states that the arrangements for sewage disposal are capable of being a material consideration in planning applications and appeals. It advises that local planning authorities may need to refuse planning permission where they are not satisfied about the adequacy of sewerage infrastructure or they may be able to impose conditions to ensure that suitable arrangements are in place. Examples of the types of conditions are given in Department of the Environment Circular 11/95 "The use of conditions in planning permissions".

<a name="30915w32.html_para5">The consideration given to sewage disposal when determining planning applications will depend on the circumstances.

Enforcement of the Building Regulations 2000 is by local authority building control departments or approved inspectors. Where a connection is to be made to a public sewer, under the Water Industry Act 1991, there is a duty to notify the sewerage undertaker and provision for the undertaker to inspect the connection.

 Cancer of the oesophagus affects around 6,000 people a year in England and Wales, the majority of whom are aged 40 or over. Common symptoms of the cancer are heartburn and difficulty in swallowing. Most people also lose weight and about half have anaemia, which causes severe tiredness.
<P>

<a name="30915w34.html_para7">Cancer of the oesophagus or gullet develops as a result of cell changes in the lining of the oesophagus.

<a name="30915w34.html_para9">The Cancer Plan sets out new waiting time targets for cancer treatment. A two-week out-patient waiting time standard was introduced for all urgently referred suspected cancer patients in December 2000 and the most recent figures show that over 98 per cent. of all urgent referrals were seen with two weeks.
<P>

<a name="30915w34.html_para10">By 2005, all cancer patients will wait a maximum of one month from diagnosis to treatment and a maximum of two months from urgent general practitioner referral to treatment.

It is planned to achieve this by 2008.

The Office for National Statistics is currently in the process of updating this study to cover the period 1999&#150;2002. The results of this analysis will be published next year.
<BR>
It is impossible to put a firm figure to the number of people who die from MRSA because people are often very sick with a number of other conditions so the contribution of MRSA to the outcome in any particular case is uncertain. In addition, the underlying cause of death is most often the disease or injury which led them to be admitted to hospital, rather than the MRSA which may have complicated the course of the illness.

It is not possible to predict what the figures will be for the next three years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w36.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 The fees payable by care providers registered under the Care Standards Act were the subject of a wide-ranging public consultation in 2001. As part of the funding arrangements, we expect the costs associated with regulatory fee increases to be passed on by providers through increased fees to service users and commissioners of services. This would mean, for example, that local authorities would pay higher amounts and their financial settlements from central Government reflect this.
<P>

<a name="30915w36.html_para0">The Government are committed to a review of the framework for regulatory fees in 2004. This review will include a further public consultation.

 It is for primary care trusts to assess the ability of their prosthetic services to meet the needs of users, as part of their general duty to determine what level of resources to devote to the treatment of different conditions in their localities. Strategic health authorities are responsible for the performance management of primary care trusts.

 Baseline allocations of &#163;0.5 million in 2001&#150;02, &#163;1.5 million in 2002&#150;03 and &#163;2.0 million in 2003&#150;04 were expected to be used for the provision of silicone cosmesis for artificial limbs. Spending on silicone cosmesis through the National Health Service Purchasing and Supply Agency, which probably represents most if not all spending on silicone cosmesis, was &#163;81,858 for 2001&#150;02, &#163;410,479 for 2002&#150;03, and &#163;137,502 in the first quarter of 2003&#150;04. Information is not held centrally on the sums made available to individual prosthetics centres, nor on numbers of patients treated with silicone cosmesis. In future years primary care trusts will remain free to determine what amounts from their baseline allocations to use for the provision of silicone cosmesis.

<P>
<a name="30915w36.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 September 2003]:</i> The National Institute for Clinical Excellence is currently developing a guideline on the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in primary and secondary care. It is due to publish the guideline in 2004. In January 2003 the Respiratory Alliance published their guidance, "Bridging the Gap", which aims to help primary care trusts (PCTs) to commission and deliver high quality allergy and respiratory care.
<P>

<a name="30915w36.html_para1">In line with our policy of "Shifting the Balance of Power", it is up to PCTs, in conjunction with strategic health authorities (SHAs) to take this work forward. I have been advised by the Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire SHA that in Gloucestershire patients with COPD have access to support within the primary care setting and also secondary care services within the wider hospital respiratory team. The local PCTs in Gloucestershire are jointly funding a project post to look at ways in which delivery of the current service can be improved, and to consider the development of future initiatives including COPD rehabilitation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w36.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to his answer of 5 August 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 958W, on stroke services, how many and what percentage of hospitals have had a working specialist stroke unit in each <i>(a)</i> region and <i>(b)</i> strategic health authority in each of the last six years for which figures are available.  [129122]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w36.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 The most comprehensive source of information is the National Sentinel Stroke Audit, carried out by the Royal College of Physicians. The audit was commissioned by the national health service in 1998 and was last updated in 2002. The results can be found at http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/pubs/strokeaudit 01&#150;02.pdf.
<P>

<a name="30915w36.html_para4">The 2002 audit shows that 73 per cent. of trusts that participated had a stroke unit, compared to 56 per cent. three years earlier. The audit shows that 80 per cent. of trusts that participated have a consultant physician with specialist knowledge of stroke who is formally recognised as having principal responsibility for stroke services. While it is recognised that some services need to increase their capacity, the audit notes that very significant improvements have already been made.
<P>

<a name="30915w36.html_para5">Our major vehicle for further improving standards for stroke services is through the older people's national service framework (NSF), which sets specific milestones for improvement by 2004 of stroke services in primary care trusts, specialist services and general hospitals that care for people suffering from a stroke. Our document, "Improvement, Expansion and Reform", which sets for the NHS a priorities and planning framework for 2003&#150;06, makes clear that implementation of the older people's NSF is a top priority and that the 2004 milestone around specialist stroke services is a key target.
<P>

<a name="30915w36.html_para6">We monitor progress against the key milestones in the NSF. From the information gathered so far, we know that 83 per cent. of the hospitals which have replied now have plans to have a specialist stroke service in place by April 2004.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what measures the Department is taking to reduce the number of children with tooth decay.  [128895]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30915w36.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Due mainly to the introduction of fluoride toothpaste and the fluoridation of water in some areas of the country, there has, over the last 20 years, been 



<P>
<P><I>15 Sept 2003 : Column 627W</I><P>
a major improvement in oral health. Nearly 60 per cent. of 5-years-olds now have no experience of tooth decay. However, significant variations remain which, in areas where drinking water is not fluoridated, are strongly associated with economic and social deprivation. The Government are committed to reducing these inequalities and have made provision in the Water Bill, currently before Parliament, to give communities with 



<P>
<P><I>15 Sept 2003 : Column 628W</I><P>
high levels of tooth decay a real option of having their water fluoridated. We have also established the "Brushing for Life" scheme in areas of poor dental health, whereby families with young children receive free fluoridated toothpaste, toothbrushes and advice on oral hygiene when attending child health developmental checks at aged eight months and 18 months and three years.
