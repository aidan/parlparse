 My right hon. Friend, the Foreign Secretary, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Ministers and officials receive representations on human rights violations overseas on a regular basis. Where possible the Foreign Secretary, Ministers and officials meet with those making the representations. For example, the Foreign Secretary met with Amnesty International in October. Most recently he met with his new Human Rights Advisory Group where they discussed a wide range of human rights issues relating to conflict, counter-terrorism, and religious freedom, as well as specific countries of concern and broader strategic trends. As Minister with responsibility for human rights policy, I met with Open Doors earlier this month to receive a petition against the UN Defamation of Religions Resolution.</p>

The remainder was available to support short term projects led by Israeli and Palestinian non-governmental organisations. By September 2010 the Conflict Pool had agreed funding for 12 non-governmental organisations which amounted to 85% of the available funding. Unallocated funds for the remainder of the year are currently being reviewed. No new spending will be allocated until after the full implications of the review are known.

 The Department for International Development monitors the food security situation in Bangladesh closely, drawing on our own analysis as well as external sources (e.g. the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations and the Bangladesh Food Policy Monitoring Unit). Our current assessment is that rice production in 2010 will be around 3% higher than in 2009 and that there is no general shortage of food in the country. However, food prices continue to rise faster than general inflation and around 20% of the population continue to suffer from food insecurity. Although not heavily dependent on food imports, Bangladesh also remains vulnerable to fluctuations in global food prices, particularly for rice and wheat.</p>

<i> [holding answer 14 December 2010]:</i> The Department is looking at the governance arrangements for all its partner organisations, including the Insolvency Service, with a view to having an updated governance framework in place for the new financial year. This work is being undertaken in the light of a number of factors, including the spending review settlement; the introduction across Government of spending controls such as those on pay and recruitment and on spending on marketing and advertising, IT, consultancy, estates; and the requirement to consolidate an increased number of partner organisation financial statements from 2011-12.</p>

Many of these institutions receive additional funding from the Funding Council to account for their small size or specialist nature, which are not recognised through the mainstream funding formula. While it is for the Funding Council to make decisions on grant allocations the Government will set out their priorities for continuing grant in the forthcoming grant letter to HEFCE and the higher education White Paper. It will be our priority that in putting the new funding system in place we do not weaken those institutions with a world class reputation for the arts and music.</p>

The processing time includes time when the application is with the applicant and, therefore, cannot be progressed by the company, for example, when the company is awaiting missing evidence or when it is awaiting from the student a declaration form accepting the terms of the loan.

 This Government are satisfied that the current legislation achieves the right balance between the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants. The previous Administration had extensive plans for the further regulation of private sector landlords, including a proposal to introduce a national register for landlords. The Government have no plans to implement those proposals as imposing new regulatory requirements on private landlords would be likely to lead to a reduction in the numbers of properties to rent, which would not help tenants or landlords. Of course, local authorities already have access to a comprehensive package of powers to deal with houses in multiple occupation and tackle the minority of rogue landlords that provide a poor service to tenants.</p>

Such changes of use can now take place freely without the need for planning applications unless there are local concerns about such development. In such cases, local planning authorities can use existing powers to remove this freedom of movement and require planning applications for such changes of use should they consider this appropriate for their areas.</p>

 The Ministry of Defence (MOD) manages its surplus staff by using the redeployment pool (RDP). This service enables those who are or who will become surplus to be given priority consideration for vacancies. Staff in the RDP usually continue working in their last directorate or are redeployed to cover short-term tasks. On average, staff spend six months in the RDP before finding a post or leaving the Department. The RDP is also used by staff returning from overseas postings, including civilians supporting the armed forces in operational theatres. The MOD is currently subject to a freeze on external recruitment and the RDP helps us to fill vacancies from within existing staff resources.</p>

 The Ministry of Defence has one EU directive pending transposition into domestic legislation, namely the Defence and Security Directive (2009/81/EC) which sets out new procurement rules for contracting authorities/entities which purchase military equipment, sensitive equipment, and related goods, works or services. It also provides rules where contracting authorities/entities purchase works and services for specifically military purposes or works or services for security purposes which involve, require or contain classified information. The purpose of the rules is to meet the concerns of member states about the sensitive nature of procurements in the defence and security sectors. Currently, all public sector procurements (civil and defence), unless they are exempt, are governed by the rules set out in the Public Procurement Directive (2004/18/EC) or the Utilities Directive (2004/17/EC). The standard rules in the 2004 directives do not always permit the acquisition of military or security capability as effectively as they could, or deal explicitly with key requirements for acquisition such as security of information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_648"><a name="101215w0003.htm_para44"><a name="1012163001010">The directive was agreed by the British Government when it was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union on 13 July 2009.</p>

 The Highways Agency is considering the design of Active Traffic Management (ATM) in view of the experience gained from operating the pilot section on the M42.

The Highways Agency has demonstrated that Managed Motorways can deliver a substantial proportion of the benefits of conventional road-widening solutions, while securing cost savings of 40%, and the agency is aiming to increase these savings still further by driving efficiencies in how it specifies and deliver projects, encouraging the introduction of standardised solutions.</p>

<i> [holding answer 6 December 2010]:</i> The independent review on winter resilience led by David Quarmby CBE published its report in October 2010. The report made a number of recommendations both for the Government, local highway authorities and others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_685"><a name="101215w0004.htm_para7"><a name="1012163001206">One of the recommendations was for a benchmark of 12 days (48 runs) pre-season salt stockholding to be adopted for local highway authorities. It was recognised by the Review that some authorities would not be able to implement this recommendation in the short term, but in these cases they should carefully review their salt usage history and consider further action if necessary, such as increasing capacity or mutual aid arrangements with neighbouring authorities.</p>

1. The information provided is Management Information. Our preference is to answer all parliamentary questions using Official/National Statistics but in this case we only have Management Information available. It is not quality assured to the same extent as Official/National Statistics and there are some issues with the data, for example, figures given are estimates. Actuals are not available.<br>
2. A cold weather payment is made to an eligible customer when the average temperature has been recorded as, or is forecast to be, 0°C or below over seven consecutive days at the weather station linked to the customer's postcode. (When the temperature criterion is met, the weather station is said to trigger.)<br>
3. Some weather stations listed are linked both to an area within the north-west and also to an area outside the north-west. Estimated numbers given are for the weather station as a whole, not for the part of the north-west linked to the weather station.<br>
4. Some postcode to weather station linkages have changed from one year to the next, so estimated numbers are not always comparable from year to year.<br>
5. Estimated numbers are for cold weather payments triggered in the relevant financial year.<br>
6. Cold weather payments are made to benefit units. A benefit unit can be a single person or a couple and can include children.<br>
7. Some benefit units received more than one payment in some years.<br>
8. Estimated numbers have been rounded to the nearest 100.<br>

1. The information provided is management information. Our preference is to answer all parliamentary questions using Official/National Statistics but in this case we only have management information available. It is not quality assured to the same extent as Official/National Statistics and there are some issues with the data.<br>
2. For technical reasons figures are estimated volumes rather than actual volumes, except for winter fuel payments which are actual volumes.<br>
3. For winter fuel payments, the number of recipients is the number of individuals to whom payment was made. Where an eligible person is receiving pension credit, income-based jobseeker's allowance or income related employment and support allowance on behalf of a couple, that person receives one winter fuel payment on behalf of the couple.<br>
4. Figures for winter fuel payments include payments made to recipients within Great Britain and also recipients from within the European economic area who qualified for payments while resident in Great Britain.<br>
5. Figures for winter fuel payments for 2005-06 have been revised and therefore do not match exactly those currently in the House of Commons Library. Information in the Library will be updated as soon as possible.<br>
6. The numbers of people in receipt of a grant or loan have been rounded to the nearest thousand.<br>
7. The numbers of recipients for sure start maternity grants and funeral payments are unavailable.<br>

1. Data are rounded to the nearest 10 claimants.<br>
2. These figures refer to claimants whose problems relate to any drugs (including prescription ones). Claimants who do not report drug or alcohol dependency as their main disabling condition are not captured, nor are people on JSA or IS for whom this information is not recorded, meaning that these figures represent a subset of all claimants with a drug or alcohol problem.<br>
3. Incapacity benefit and severe disablement allowance was replaced by employment and support allowance (ESA) for new claimants in October 2008.<br>
4. Drug or alcohol dependency does not of itself confer entitlement to disability benefits, this is determined by a person's capability or capacity for employment. Where individuals with a substance dependency are in receipt of such benefits it will be because they have other diagnoses, for example mental illness, which limit their capability for work.<br>

<p><a name="stpa_717"><a name="101215w0004.htm_para39"><a name="1012165000347">Due to the time it takes for appeals to be submitted and heard by the Tribunals Service, it is likely that there are more appeals that have not yet been heard, particularly for the most recent cohorts of ESA claims. The percentage of people found Fit for Work who appeal (column 6) therefore appears to decrease as the date of claim becomes more recent, but this may not in fact reflect a decline in appeals against a Fit for Work decision as a number of appeals may have been submitted but not yet heard. These figures should therefore be treated as emerging findings and not as final at this stage.</p>

 Revised life expectancy projections mean that by 2026 men aged 66 are expected to live an extra 1.5 years and women an extra 1.6 years, on average, than the 2004 projections used to set the current state pension age increases. No responsible Government can ignore these increases in life expectancy and the pressure they place on the state pension system. Our new timetable will reduce pressures on public finances by around  £30 billion between 2016-17 and 2025-26.</p>

 The information is not available at a parliamentary constituency level. Data on the actual size of property occupied by social sector tenants is  not yet collected as part of DWP administration and the data collected for private sector tenants is not  of sufficient quality to undertake detailed analysis of  the accommodation they occupy.
