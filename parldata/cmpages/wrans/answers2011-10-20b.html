Detailed objectives for the skills working group can be found via the Skillset website.

 Robust data about the library sector are only published annually by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy and the initial release of provisional data for 2010-11 is to be published later this month. The Department supplements it by monitoring proposals about changes to library services across England through information gathered via correspondence, media coverage and from relevant bodies such as Arts Council England. Many local authorities are still developing and consulting on proposals and consequently the overall picture is always changing. It is therefore not practical to attempt to provide definitive numbers for libraries that have closed or have reduced their opening hours.</p>

 Earlier this year we consulted on our proposals for the new local audit framework which included a number of proposals that will increase transparency, for example, increasing transparency in the way that auditors are appointed. We proposed that local public bodies would appoint their own auditors from a published register of eligible auditors, taking advice from an independent audit committee. The advice of that independent audit committee would be published (giving regard to commercially confidential material). If the local public body did not follow the independent audit committee's advice as to the auditor that should be appointed, it would be required to publish the reasons why it had departed from that advice. The consultation also included proposals around the transparency of the audit itself, for example continuing the requirements to publish accounts and auditors' reports.</p>

 Because the Local Government Pension Scheme is funded, it has been possible to design a scheme-specific approach to securing savings by 2014-15 to protect membership levels. A current statutory consultation exercise proposes increases in contribution tariffs in England and Wales involving either a 1% cent increase, or a 1.5% increase phased in over a three year period, commencing in April 2012, plus accrual rate adjustments for either one or two years.</p>

There are no payable benefits open to MAs or the equivalent, although some personnel may accrue allowances due to their personal circumstances or trade/specialty.

Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr Osborne), that from April 2011 the consumer prices index would be used for the indexation of benefits, tax credits and public service pensions (including police pensions). This was confirmed in the Pensions Increase (Review) Order 2011 made on 16 March 2011 by the Treasury.</p>

 All services are moving towards delivery of the new health visiting service vision and offer to families spearheaded by the early implementer sites. The actual arrangements for deployment of health visitors is a matter for local leadership based on meeting local health needs. This may include a range of approaches including primary care attachment, geographic placement and corporate caseload. All local arrangements must address key issues of professional relationships with families, working with local communities and optimising working arrangements with other local providers of children and family.</p>

Families are able to receive support for child care costs of 70% up to a maximum of £175 for one child or £300 for two or more children per week. From 2013 this support will be paid through the universal credit. Currently, child care support is only available for people who work 16 hours a week or more, but under universal credit this requirement will be removed.</p>

Mediation can be very expensive to administer and may not be the most appropriate support for all families. Families require differing support depending on their circumstances, and that is why we are already working with the voluntary and community sector in order to understand what forms of existing support are most effective in helping parents work collaboratively to establish enduring co-parenting arrangements.</p>

<i>Notes</i>:
1. Figures from November 1995 to February 2002 are taken from 5% sample data. They
have been uprated to be consistent with WPLS data and are rounded to the nearest 100.
 Figures from May 2002 onwards are taken from WPLS 100% data and are rounded to the nearest 10. Totals may not sum due to rounding.
2. Totals show the number of people in receipt of an allowance, and excludes cases where the payment has been suspended, e.g. if they are in hospital.
3. Constituencies used are for the Westminster Parliament and reflect the changes from May 2010. Prior to this, the constituencies used are for May 2005.
4. Local authority boundary changes from April 2009 have also been taken into account.
5. There is no parliamentary constituency information for DLA until February 1997.
6. Great Britain data have been provided as the information for Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Office. Northern Ireland statistics can be found at:

                     <i>Notes</i>:
1. Figures rounded to nearest 1,000.
2. DLA decisions made figures include reconsiderations, renewals, supersessions (where someone is already in receipt of benefit and reports a change of circumstances which results in the benefit being changed or suspended) and active case management supersessions. The figures do not include Secretary of State supersessions—that is where an award of DLA is looked at again because information has been received that raises questions about the customer's entitlement to DLA. This is because the DLA computer system does not report out the same level of information for Secretary of State supersessions.
3. The DLA management information on appeal decisions does not enable us to identify the type of decision that the customer is disputing. Not all of the appeal decisions shown above will be in connection with an appeal against a decision to award a lower level of benefit or disallow DLA following reassessment. The appeal figures will also include appeals where the customer is disputing the outcome of their initial claim for DLA.

 Kinship carers can be eligible for a range of benefits. If they are approved foster carers, they can receive a fostering allowance in England and Wales or kinship care allowance in Scotland. If they are not approved, kinship carers may be entitled to child benefit, either child tax credits or pension credits, and any other benefits available to parents, subject to the standard eligibility criteria. In order to prevent double provision, these benefits are not provided where the child is formally looked after by the local authority and their accommodation or maintenance is provided from public funds.</p>

                     <i>Notes:</i>  1. These statistics are from the National Statistics publication “Income Related Benefits Estimates of Take-Up in 2008-09” and are available via the following link http://research.dwp.gov.uk/asd/index.php?page=irb They refer to private households in Great Britain and exclude the full-time self-employed.  2. Take-up estimates are presented as ranges within which it can be assumed true take-up lies. These robust “ranges of true take-up” account for possible biases that arise in estimating take-up from the available data sources. These ranges also account for the effects of sampling variation (otherwise known as sampling error). Care should be taken when interpreting take-up statistics. For instance, if the upper limit of a caseload take-up range is 90%, this does not necessarily mean that at least 10% never take up their entitlement. This is because some of the shortfall in take-up may represent a delay in claiming benefit that is eventually received.<i>  Source:</i>  Income Related Benefits Estimates of Take-Up in 2008-09.

 Between 1990 and 2008, the death rate for children under five decreased by 28%. Worldwide this means 10,000 fewer under-five deaths every day. However, 7.6 million children still die every year and over 350,000 women lose their lives unnecessarily from complications with pregnancy and childbirth. The UK is committed to supporting the UN "Every Women Every Child" Global Strategy on Women's and Children's Health to accelerate progress on improving maternal and child health. Our Framework for Results; ‘Choices for women: Planned pregnancies, safer births and healthy newborns’ sets out the UK contribution to this strategy. We will save the lives of 50,000 mothers and 250,000 newborn children in poor countries by 2015. UK support to GAVI over the next five years will enable them to vaccinate over 80 million children and save 1.4 million lives.</p>

               <b>Mr O'Brien:</b>
 DFID's Bilateral and Multilateral Aid Reviews in 2010-11 introduced a new approach to aid allocation. DFID no longer allocates resources to countries and regions through a top-down process focused on a formula based on country need and the likely effectiveness of assistance. Instead, DFID identifies and scrutinises from the bottom-up the results that UK assistance can achieve against its development objectives in each country and makes allocation decisions accordingly. DFID will continually centrally monitor its performance against its published targets and country operational plans as part of its annual budget cycle and this will drive resource allocation decisions going forward.</p>

 Electoral registration is the responsibility of individual Electoral Registration Officers (EROs). Local authorities have a duty to encourage participation in the electoral process and the Electoral Commission promotes public awareness of registration and produces research and reports on electoral registration issues. Electoral registration activity at the local level is funded through the Revenue Support Grant from central Government.</p>

               <a name="11102052000616"> The Ministry of Justice (responsible for elections policy until June 2010) provided funding through the Electoral Participation Fund set up in 2007-08 to support local electoral officers in undertaking their statutory duties. The following funds were provided from the Participation Fund: £934,742 in 2007-08, £544,392 in 2008-09 and £153,895 in 2009-10. A further £67,355 was spent in 2010-11 to support activities undertaken by electoral administrators to encourage participation at the elections which were held on 6 May 2010, but approved in the previous financial year. The Participation Fund was closed in the Emergency Budget of 22 June 2010.</p>

It will also fund research to understand the current state of the electoral register and currently under-registered groups in order to ensure that as many people as possible are registered to vote. This year the Government are funding the piloting of 'data matching' of electoral registers against other data sources, such as the National Pupil Database and the Department for Work and Pensions database, to identify possible eligible electors, as well as looking at the ways in which we can make it as easy and secure as possible for citizens to register to vote, such as online registration.</p>

This includes learning from the experience in Northern Ireland in formulating our plans for the transition, such as phasing the transition in over two years, allowing electors who do not apply under the new system in 2014 to be carried forward so they retain their vote at the 2015 general election. Every eligible elector will be asked in 2014 to register under the new system: this will include personal invites to people on the register, inquiries to households where no one is registered or people have moved, reminder letters and face to face doorstep canvassers. There will be a publicity campaign run by the Electoral Commission.

Further research will also be conducted into those groups that are currently under-registered, including young people, to inform our plans for implementation. As part of that research we will be learning from the experience of initiatives trialled in Northern Ireland.</p>

The declaration is not legally binding and cannot therefore be ratified by Governments.

 DECC Ministers and officials meet suppliers and others on a regular basis to discuss market issues. The Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, my right hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne), chaired a consumer summit on Monday 17 October 2011 to launch the 'check, switch, insulate to save' campaign and a package of measures to help consumers this winter. We are working with consumer groups, energy suppliers and the regulator Ofgem to ensure consumers know how to save money on their energy bills by checking on their energy deal, switching their supplier if appropriate and insulating their homes.</p>

Over 600,000 of these will be pensioners in receipt of pension credit guarantee credit only, who will receive an automatic rebate on their electricity bill of £120 this winter. In addition, a 'Broader Group' such as low income families and those with long term illnesses and disabilities may also receive this discount, with £3 million available for Broader Group expenditure in 2011-12. To ensure a smooth transition from the previous Voluntary Agreement, £140 million has been allocated for Legacy Spending in 2011-12, for suppliers to continue to provide discounted and social tariffs.</p>

The numbers assisted automatically through the Core Group will also increase in future years as eligibility expands to include those on the savings element of pension credit.

 The full answer to this question could be provided only at disproportionate cost because of the large number of transactions that would need to be reviewed before publication and changes to the format in which data for past periods is held. I am able to provide details of transactions over £500 for the period from December 2009 to May 2010.

 The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) was created in October 2008. DECC's records of procurement card transactions prior to December 2009 were held on a mix of paper and electronic files. It would incur disproportionate cost to search these records. DECC holds central records of all procurement card transactions for the period December 2009 to March 2011, and of all transactions over £500 for the period 1 April 2011 to 30 June 2011. We have identified one cash withdrawal using a procurement card in December 2009. This was to cover Copenhagen cash expenses and to top up ministerial petty cash.</p>

 The Generic Design Assessment (GDA) is an independent review by the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and the Environment Agency (the Regulators) to ensure that the proposed new nuclear reactor designs for the UK are safe, secure and protect the environment. The regulators publish quarterly progress reports that summarise the progress made to assess and evaluate a comprehensive range of technical areas, including control of reactivity, post trip cooling, containment, severe accident management, and spent fuel storage. The latest quarterly report was published on the ONR website on 14 July 2011 and mentions, for the first time, the outstanding GDA issues, based on the completion of ONR's planned assessment. All the issues must be cleared to both regulators' satisfaction before ONR grants consent to start construction of reactor buildings at a nuclear licensed site.</p>

This is because the regulators' assessment was completed before this incident. The consequences of the Fukushima incident will be addressed through a separate GDA issue, to which the industry has yet to respond. It will also need clearing to the regulators' satisfaction as one of the suite of identified GDA issues.</p>

 The probability of coincident damage to both a nuclear facility and off-site technical support centre is considered remote, given that there is considerable distance between the locations of the reactor sites and the support centres. However, the UK's nuclear emergency response arrangements, which consider the implications for public safety, are kept under review by the Department of Energy and Climate Change, with support from the Office for Nuclear Regulation and the multi agency Nuclear Emergency Planning Liaison Group.</p>

 Under the nuclear site licensing regime, licensed operators are legally required to have adequate arrangements in place to deal with a range of on-site accidents or emergencies. This includes the provision of appropriate and adequate training for site personnel. The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR), which enforces the licensing regime, has produced guidance to assist in ensuring the adequacy of levels of competence and training provision among site staff to respond to a nuclear emergency.</p>

 The final report of Her Majesty's Chief Nuclear Inspector to the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, my right hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne), on the implications for the UK nuclear industry of the Fukushima nuclear incident in March 2011, includes a recommendation that the industry should ensure that its physical structures and hardware for responding to a nuclear accident, including plant control rooms, on-site emergency control centres and off-site emergency centres are adequately protected should such an accident occur. This includes the need for enhancing control room habitability along with other measures. The Chief Nuclear Inspector expects the industry to report progress to him on this, and other recommendations, in June 2012 following which he intends to publish a further report setting out progress on the 38 areas where he concluded lessons can be learned in the UK from the Fukushima incident.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 17 October 2011]:</i>Under section 11 of the Children Act 2004, local authorities have a statutory duty to ensure that they safeguard and promote the welfare of all children, regardless of their immigration status or nationality. Victims of child trafficking have the same entitlement to education as all other children of compulsory school age. Trafficked children are likely to require additional educational support to help them overcome any barriers to learning and assessment. Schools should consider the specific needs of all children who are newly arrived from overseas, taking account of their cultural, religious and linguistic backgrounds and of their prior learning experiences.</p>

               <a name="11102059000033"> Where a trafficked child becomes looked after, they will be entitled to the same services as all looked after children. They will be allocated a qualified social worker who will arrange for them to be placed in a care placement where they will be safeguarded. The social worker must assess the child's needs and draw up a care plan which will include plans for accommodation, educational support, and other services based on need (eg health services, which could include specialist treatment because of past experiences or pre-existing medical conditions).</p>

 For income tax, software providers have already made changes to payroll software so that employers could operate the existing Scottish Variable Rate (SVR) of income tax. This means that most existing payroll software already provides for a different rate to be operated. Additional compliance costs may arise if the Scottish Government seek processes that differ from the SVR, for example introducing a higher degree of transparency in payslips and end of year forms (e.g. P60). Other areas that may incur additional compliance costs relate to the treatment of certain tax reliefs.</p>

                     <sup>(1)</sup> Only those police forces in England and Wales are shown where data have been reported.
<sup>(2)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.
<sup>(3)</sup> The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.
<sup>(4)</sup> The number of defendants proceeded against in a particular year may exceed the number found guilty as the proceedings in the magistrates court took place in an earlier year and the defendants were found guilty at the Crown Court in the following year; or the defendants were found guilty of a different offence to that for which they were originally proceeded against.

The petition debt level has not been increased since the Insolvency Act first came into force in 1986 and so remains at £750. To be able to threaten someone with bankruptcy for such a small amount is, we believe, disproportionate. The consultation will cover increasing the petition debt level in both personal and corporate cases, which would affect the terms for SMEs.</p>

 Officials from this Department and UK Permanent Representative will attend the meeting. They will express support for the broad aims and objectives of the proposal. They will welcome the work undertaken by the European Commission that has been done in identifying areas within the current Recreational Craft Directive that could be improved to provide greater clarity of the obligations imposed by the directive. This will help to reduce undue burdens placed on business (particularly small and medium-sized enterprises), and facilitate cross-border trade. The UK will address those features of the proposal itself that risk being unruly burdensome on the sector and UK operators.

 Available data and evidence are not yet sufficient to enable BIS to undertake a reliable assessment of the impact on manufacturing output in 2010 at this time. The Government's top priority is to achieve strong, sustainable and balanced growth. Sound public finances are essential for sustainable growth. We are also taking action as set out in the Plan for Growth to create the best possible climate for enterprise and growth in the UK, including action to support advanced manufacturing by encouraging higher levels of innovation, exports, business investment and technical skills as well as cutting excessive red tape.</p>

 Working with industry, this Government are taking action aimed at increasing growth in manufacturing output in the UK by encouraging higher levels of innovation, exports, business investment and technical skills as well as cutting excessive red tape. The Plan for Growth announced as part of Budget 2011, included a package of measures to stimulate the growth of engineering and advanced manufacturing, including changes to capital allowances, the launch of a High Value Manufacturing Technology and Innovation Centre (TIC) as well as nine new university-based research centres, funding for 10,000 additional higher apprenticeships, and action to promote the image of the sector.</p>

For example, on 11 October a £140 million investment in the country's first TIC—focused on high value manufacturing—was announced. Between 10 and 21 October the second phase of the automotive pilot of See Inside Manufacturing was also launched. Over 40 world class automotive manufacturers opened their doors allowing teachers, careers advisors and young people to see first hand some of the UK's world-class automotive and motorsport facilities and research centres to raise awareness of the diverse range of careers available. On 14 October, we also announced the new supplier for the reformed Manufacturing Advisory Service which will go live from January 2012 and includes an additional £7 million to deliver supply chain activities over the next three years.</p>

            <p>education institutions have duties under the Equality Act 2010 to support disabled students in higher education when applying to higher education and when studying. The legal duties apply to both educational and non-educational services, facilities and benefits including residential accommodation, where it is provided.</p>

               <a name="11102063000171"> The law establishes a framework of responsibility which higher education institutions must comply with and also promotes an anticipatory and proactive approach to supporting disabled students. Universities are required to make reasonable .adjustments for disabled students to ensure that they can fully participate in the education and enjoy the other benefits, facilities and services which are provided for students. Making reasonable adjustments applies to the provision of university accommodation (where that service is offered) and ensuring it is accessible. Universities are required to plan to meet the needs of disabled students, make the adjustments that may be required, and periodically review their policies and provision.</p>

These include good practice on student accommodation and disabled students and are available on the ECU'S website:</p>

 Members of the governing board of the Technology Strategy Board are appointed only on the basis of their experience and knowledge of key technology areas and their ability to bring a personal perspective to the exploitation of science, technology and new ideas by business. Regional representation plays no role in their appointment, but the current board members are located from across the UK: London (three), Scotland (two), Winchester, Suffolk, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Sunbury-on-Thames, Cardiff, Guildford, Stockport and Portsmouth.</p>
