 The role of the Commission for Integrated Transport (CfIT) is focussed on future strategic issues and best practice at a national level, so I am satisfied that there is no general conflict of interest. I believe CfIT benefits from the added value of such a senior figure as Chair. However, in the event that CflT&#039;s work was to impinge on TfL&#039;s responsibilities the Chair has made it clear that he would declare an interest and if necessary excuse himself from that work. There are many other commissioners and a Vice Chair of CfIT who in that case would have no conflict.

 No such analysis has been undertaken by the Department of Education. The Post-Primary Review Body, established by the Department in 2000 to consider future arrangements for post-primary education in Northern Ireland, recommended that academic selection should end (Burns Report). The Post-Primary Review Working Group (Costello) established by the Department in 2003 was required to take account of the consultation on the Burns recommendations and to provide advice on options for new arrangements for post-primary education. It advised that no form of academic selection would remove the high-stakes, high-stress element and that academic selection at age 11 is itself educationally unsound, as this age is too young to commit pupils to particular pathways. Accepting the Costello Report&#039;s recommendations, the Government announced in January 2004 that academic selection would end and that the last Transfer Tests will take place in 2008.

<a name="stpa_142">Recognising that there are both potential benefits and risks associated with gene technologies and GM crops, developing countries should be able to make their own informed choices. To this end, DFID worked with the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the international community to establish the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, under the UN convention on biological diversity (CBD). The protocol adopts a strong precautionary approach and aims to ensure that countries are provided with the information necessary to make informed decisions before agreeing to the import of genetically modified organisms. It also facilitates the exchange of information on living modified organisms and assists countries in the implementation of the protocol. This means that importing countries are able to make a decision to avoid or minimise potential adverse effects of GM organisms, even if the potential extent of such effects is uncertain.

The population of children of compulsory secondary school age (11&#150;15) started to fall in 2005 and is expected to continue falling until 2014.

Many local authorities are facing falling primary rolls. Funding empty places can represent a poor use of resources particularly where schools with spare places also perform poorly.

<p><a name="st_185"><a name="60213w20.html_spnew6"><b> Bill Rammell  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 6 February 2006]:</i> By 2006, the Government will have provided nearly &#163;0.8 billion to higher education institutions through the Rewarding and Developing Staff (RDS) initiative, managed by the Higher Education Funding Council. Developing equal opportunity targets&#151;encompassing the need address equal opportunity issues including equal pay for work of equal value&#151;is one of the six priority areas for RDS. The KPMG evaluation of round 1 of RDS (2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04) showed that approximately &#163;43 million (13 per cent. of the total round 1 allocation) was spent by HEIs on this priority area.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60213w20.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_178">Overall funding available to institutions also influences what they can pay their staff. State expenditure on higher education will increase by around &#163;2 billion between 2004&#150;05 and 2007&#150;08, taking total investment to almost &#163;9.5 billion. Moreover the introduction of variable fees in 2006/07 will increase the funding available to the sector by an estimated further &#163;1.35 billion per year, when it reaches steady state. It is, of course, a matter for individual institutions to decide how best to use the resources they have. The Government has provided guidance to the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), through its Grant Letters, on issues concerning equal opportunities&#151;for example in the most recent letter (January 2006) we have asked HEFCE to continue to support institutions so that they can fulfil their statutory duties. We have not provided specific guidance on equal pay.

 I have been asked to reply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60213w22.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_186">Historically, allocations for school nurses were not determined centrally and until the September national health service work force census, the school nurse establishment was not identified separately from other services for children. The 2004 census showed there were 2,409 (91,619 full-time equivalent) qualified nurses working in the school nursing service.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60213w22.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_187">The Choosing Health White Paper made a commitment to provide new funding for school nursing so that by 2010, every primary care trust (PCT) working with children&#039;s trusts and local authorities, will be resourced to have at least one full-time qualified school nurse working with each cluster of primary schools and its related secondary school. Roll out will start from 2006&#150;07 in the 20 per cent. of PCTs with the worst health deprivation indicators (spearhead PCTs). There are 3,122 secondary schools.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60213w22.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_188">The identified funding for school nurses is &#163;20 million in the 2006&#150;07 allocation, and &#163;42 million in 2007&#150;08. The majority of the funding is prioritised for spearhead PCTs in 2006&#150;07, with the allocation for 2007&#150;08 shared among all PCTs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60213w22.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_189">Our aim is to ensure there is sufficient work force capacity to provide high quality health services in schools. There is scope to reinforce the school nurse role by drawing in other workers and the chief nursing officer has been leading work to modernise the school nurse&#039;s role. In the new year, we will be publishing updated material entitled, &#039;School Nurse Development Pack&#039;, which will outline the principles of a modern role and will enable school nurses to expand their knowledge, skills and competencies to further develop their child-centred public health role.

 Based on latest section 52 outturn statements received from local education authorities for the financial year 2004&#150;05, 21 schools in Cambridgeshire had deficit balances totalling &#163;2.7 million; 227 schools had credit balances totalling &#163;17.1 million; and two schools had zero balances. It is for the local authority to distribute funding to its schools using its locally agreed funding formula, and it is for schools governing bodies to decide how to spend their available resources.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60213w22.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_191">While schools are responsible for their own financial management, where a school is in deficit, it has to agree a three year recovery plan with the local authority to eliminate it.

The PSA target agreed in 2004 is, therefore, to reduce the 2002/03 level of absence (i.e. both authorised and unauthorised combined) of 6.83 per cent. by 8 per cent. by 2008. Since 2002/03 there has been a reduction in absences of 5.7 per cent. which is over two-thirds of the way towards the PSA target.

We hope that the use of the umbrella term will address the known concern of some Gulf veterans that we have not recognised a link between their ill-health and the 1990&#150;91 Gulf conflict. The PAT decision also confirmed our position that there is insufficient reliable evidence to indicate that Gulf War Syndrome exists as a discrete pathological entity, or in other words as a recognised disease.

 To ask the Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs what training courses were provided for <i>(a)</i> magistrates and <i>(b)</i> district judges on domestic violence in each region since 2003; what percentage of each attended courses in each region in this period; and if she will make a statement.  [50581]</p>




<p><a name="st_282"><a name="60213w30.html_spnew2"><b> Ms Harman: </b> 
 Judicial training is the responsibility of the Judicial Studies Board (JSB), an independent body chaired by Lord Justice Keene. The JSB organises its training for the professional judiciary, including district judges (magistrates courts), nationally rather than regionally. It provides advice and support to those providing training in the magistrates courts but the training is organised and delivered locally. Data on the provision of magistrates training courses is not currently held centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. Since the amalgamation of the Court Service and the magistrates courts into HM Courts Service on 1 April 2005, the JSB is putting in place processes to monitor and evaluate the training delivered to magistrates.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60213w30.html_para16">
<a name="stpa_253">Domestic violence training is not compulsory for magistrates. The JSB offered training for trainers in each region between October 2003 and March 2004 to enable them to provide domestic violence training for magistrates in their local areas. Representatives from all HM Courts Service regions attended these courses which were supported by the publication of a JSB domestic violence training pack for use in the training of magistrates.

<p>
<a name="60213w30.html_para17">
<a name="stpa_254">All newly appointed fee-paid judges, and all judges who are authorised to take on new jurisdictions, are required to attend a relevant induction course and normally receive continuation training in each jurisdiction they exercise every three years. district judges (magistrates courts) attend dedicated annual courses. Additionally, they are invited to attend specialist family courses on a three-year cycle. The annual DJ(MC) courses run between 2003 and 2005 did not deal specifically with domestic violence, but the courses planned for 2006 will include a domestic violence session and will be run for both full and part time district judges who sit in magistrates courts. Those expected to attend will constitute 99.3 per cent. of the district judge (magistrates courts) bench. District judges who sit in the county courts attend a dedicated annual seminar which included a session on domestic violence in 2003. They also attend civil and (where appropriate) family law continuation courses every three years. These courses include sessions on domestic violence. In addition to 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>13 Feb 2006 : Column 1600W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

 As part of the Lord Chancellor&#039;s constitutional reforms and based on the agreement made with the Lord Chief Justice in the Concordat in January 2004, the handling of judicial complaints will be undertaken by the Office for Judicial Complaints from April 2006.

 For 2005&#150;06 employers&#039; contributions for civil servants are payable to the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme (PCSPS) at one of four rates in the ranges 16.2 to 24.6 per cent. of pensionable pay, based on salary bands. The Scheme Actuary reviews employer contributions every four years following a scheme valuation; last carried out as at 31 March 2003. The contribution rates reflect the cost of benefits as they accrue (net of employee contributions), not the costs as they are actually incurred, and reflect past experience of the scheme. Staff at the Legal Services Commission are not civil servants, and are not members of the Principal Civil Service Scheme, but the Department does contribute to a funded pension scheme.

 To ask the Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs what information her Department collects on the costs of personal injury litigation in other developed countries.  [48630]</p>




<p><a name="st_320"><a name="60213w33.html_spnew3"><b> Bridget Prentice: </b> 
 The Department does not routinely collect information on personal injury litigation in other countries. However, information is sought as appropriate to assist in policy development.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60213w33.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_281">For example, information was sought from other European countries prior to consultation in 2002 on proposals to allow the courts to order that personal injury damages be paid in the form of periodical payments (which subsequently formed part of the Courts Act 2003). In addition, research has recently been commissioned on the funding of personal injury litigation which includes a survey of approaches in several European jurisdictions. This will be published later this month.

 To ask the Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs what the average waiting time was from allocation to hearing for small claims at Southend county court in the last period for which figures are available.  [50495]</p>




<p><a name="st_321"><a name="60213w33.html_spnew4"><b> Ms Harman: </b> 
 The figures for the Southend county court show that between April 2003 to March 2004 there were 270 case dealt with, with an average waiting time of 15.2 weeks.

<p><a name="qn_324"><a name="60213w33.html_wqn5"><b> Miss McIntosh: </b> 
 To ask the Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs for what reasons the Legal Services Commission has decided to withdraw funding from specialist support services; and what assessment has been made of the likely impact of this decision.  [50784]</p>




<p><a name="st_322"><a name="60213w33.html_spnew5"><b> Bridget Prentice: </b> 
 Specialist support services form part of the Legal Services Commission&#039;s (LSC) special projects budget. Given the pressure on the limited legal aid budget and the number of clients needing legal advice, the LSC has concluded that the money would now be better spent on direct, frontline advice to vulnerable legal aid clients.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60213w33.html_para5">
The decision will mean that &#163;2.3 million will be redirected to fund about 9,000 opportunities for people to get direct legal advice in the next financial year. This will increase access to legal aid services for vulnerable people.

 To ask the Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs what recent research on the effectiveness of specialist support services she has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> evaluated.  [50867]</p>




<p><a name="st_323"><a name="60213w33.html_spnew6"><b> Bridget Prentice: </b> 
 Research undertaken by the Legal Services Commission (LSC) which underpins their consultation paper &quot;Making legal rights a reality&quot; points to an increasing demand for front line advice for the most needy. The LSC has concluded that specialist support services do not represent the most cost-effective approach to delivering this need for more and better services for clients.

 Local authorities are already able to maintain, protect and restore local war memorials where they believe this to be an appropriate use of local funds. We have no plans to impose any new duties in relation to these functions.
