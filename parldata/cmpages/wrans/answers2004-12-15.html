<ul>

<p class="tabletext">ONS has been addressing the issue of the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) through its membership of Eurostat&#039;s Taskforce on Accounting and Statistics since 2001, and has been considering the possible effects of the introduction of JFRS on UK statistical data through business contacts since 2003.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">In 2004, ONS established a taskforce, to address the statistical implications of IFRS. The objectives of this taskforce include establishing the potential incidence and significance of any statistical discontinuities arising from the introduction of IFRS. The taskforce established a three-stage action plan for addressing the issue, involving initial direct contacts with significant data contributors, a survey of a broad range of 500 data contributors (early in 2005) and subsequent amendments, as appropriate, to data collections in respect of 2005 onwards.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Despite the proximity of the introduction of IFRS for EU listed businesses, little conclusive information has yet been available about the specific impacts of IFRS on business statistics. Of those businesses contacted to date by ONS, very few have yet been willing or in a position to comment on the effects of IFRS. Very recent contacts have indicated that businesses are beginning to address the IFRS issue with some urgency and it is hoped that much more specific information will be obtained from the survey in early 2005.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">In. addition, ONS is planning for contingencies including any further special surveys necessary later in 2005, any changes to regular business surveys and the handling of any discontinuities in key surveys.

<p><a name="41215w06.html_wqn3"><b> Miss McIntosh: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps her Department takes to make sure that the cost and rigour of environmental regulation in the UK compares favourably with that of current and prospective members of the European Union.  [203667]</p>




<p><a name="41215w06.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 All Defra&#039;s policies are developed using impact assessments that consider the economic, social and environmental effects of different policy options. The majority of UK environment legislation comes from the EU and to ensure the quality of legislation Defra must work effectively with our EU partners and the European institutions to shape policy. Defra has an excellent international reputation for usefully influencing EU legislation. Notable recent successes in the EU include bringing about changes to the REACH chemical proposal to reduce the its burden on business.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41215w06.html_para1">
Defra&#039;s internal organisation promotes detailed scrutiny of policy proposals during their development. Economists form part of policy teams in advising both on costs and benefits and on the best ways to achieve policy goals. In April 2004, Defra&#039;s Better Regulation Unit (BRU) was enlarged to promote the Better Regulation agenda. It plays a role in scrutinising policy and in advising policy teams on aspects of policy making. The BRU are also undertaking studies into red tape and the cumulative burden on business of the whole stock of Defra regulations. Here, as in many other areas of Defra&#039;s work, Defra benefits from close contact and comparison with other EU member states. A recent example is the work done in the BRU to reduce red tape and administrative burdens on business, building on a Dutch methodology. One of the nine principles of policymaking promoted in Defra is the need to be outward looking&#151;to draw on experience in other countries and regions.

 Defra Ministers have not, either before or after 20 June 2004, had any direct representations from biotechnology companies, or farming organisations regarding this application. I have received one letter from an environmental organisation which included, among other issues, a representation on this case. The Application by Monsanto Europe SA/NV for consent to import and market oilseed rape grain GT73 under Directive 2001/18 was made through the Netherlands Competent Authority. As part of the procedure there is a mandatory EU-wide system of written consultation for each commercial GM product application before any decision is made. This provides all members of the public throughout the EU with the opportunity to make representations, which are taken into account during the regulatory process. The UK authorities assessed the dossier after the Netherlands had submitted their opinion and considered that further information was necessary before coming to a decision. Monsanto subsequently provided some further information.

<p>
<a name="41215w06.html_para2">
In December 1998, Defra&#039;s predecessor Department established an action programme within the nitrate vulnerable zones (NVZs) in England and Wales. During the development of this action programme, those Departments formally consulted with stakeholders, including farming bodies, on a number of separate occasions. Specifically:

My view remains that this would be premature, given that the requirements do not come fully into force until September 2005 and there has already been an encouraging fall in the number of oil pollution incidents reported since the regulations were made.

Information on the quantities of each pesticide is not available as these data are not gathered by the Pesticides Safety Directorate. Data on total sales is collected for the purposes of the levy, but this does not include information on individual products. The Veterinary Medicines Directorate does not collect comprehensive data on the sales of veterinary medicines containing organophosphates (OPs), other than sheep dips. This is because OP sheep dips have always been regarded as presenting the greatest potential risk to human health. These sales data are collected under the adverse reaction surveillance scheme, and have been used to put into context the numbers of serious human adverse reactions

The most recent figures available which covers sales in the year 2003 show that there were 54,000 kg of organophosphate active ingredients sold in such products. Given a sheep population of around 36 million in the UK, this equates to about 1.5 grams of active used on each sheep per year.

<p><a name="41215w08.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Bercow: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the total external spending by her Department was on private finance initiative (PFI) consultants in each of the past two years; how many full-time equivalent consultants were employed over this period; how many billed consultancy days there were per year; what the implied average cost of each PFI consultant was; how many consultancy firms were used by her Department over this period; and if she will make a statement.  [202358]</p>




<p><a name="41215w08.html_spnew0"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 From information held centrally, and for the last two years to date, the Department has spent a total of &#163;415,593 on private finance initiative (PFI) consultants. For 2003&#150;04 the expenditure was &#163;80,000 and for 2004&#150;05 to date the expenditure is &#163;335,593. Information on how many full-time equivalent consultants were employed over the two-year period; how many billed consultancy days there were per year; and what the implied average cost of each PFI consultant was is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

As part of its preparations for, and implementation of, the Gershon Value for money agenda in Defra, Pareto or detailed expenditure distribution analysis of departmental expenditure on professional services is now being undertaken, and will be made available publicly in due course.

<a name="41215w08.html_sbhd2"><h3 align=center>Sea Defence Projects</h3>


<p><a name="41215w08.html_wqn3"><b> Norman Baker: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what procurement policy the Government have in place for the use of timber in sea defence projects; and what steps she takes to ensure that all such timber is <i>(a)</i> procured from legal and sustainable sources and <i>(b)</i> certified by one of the two systems the Central Point on Expertise on Timber has identified as guaranteeing legality and sustainability;  [202089]




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 Dec 2004 : Column 1110W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>



<p>(2) if she will list the sea defence projects planned for <i>(a)</i> 2004&#150;05 and <i>(b)</i> 2005&#150;06 which will use timber in their construction, stating (i) what type of timber will be used, (ii) whether this timber is procured from legal and sustainable sources and (iii) whether this timber is certified by one of the two systems the Central Point on Expertise on Timber has identified as guaranteeing legality and sustainability.  [202088]</p>




<p><a name="41215w08.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Defra funds most of the Environment Agency&#039;s flood defence activities and provides grant aid on a project-by-project basis to the other flood and coastal defence operating authorities (local authorities and internal drainage boards) to support their investment in improvement projects to manage flood and coastal erosion risk.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41215w08.html_para1">
In 2000, the Government announced that Departments and agencies, including the Environment Agency, must actively seek to procure timber and timber products from sources independently validated as legal and sustainably managed. In 2002, Defra Ministers wrote to all English local authorities to encourage them to adopt responsible timber procurement policies. However, choice of materials to be used in construction of defences and whether they are obtained from legal and sustainable sources is a matter for the relevant operating authority. I regret therefore that parts (i), (ii) and (iii) of question 202088 could not be answered without incurring disproportionate cost.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41215w08.html_para2">
I understand that the Environment Agency, as a non-departmental body of Defra, purchases timber in accordance with the Government&#039;s timber procurement policy. Currently this policy is to require contractors to supply timber products that derive from legally harvested trees. Bidders for Government contracts are invited to offer timber from sustainable sources as a higher quality variant and such offers are given preference where they offer value for money.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41215w08.html_para3">
Timber used by the Agency in sea defence projects is predominantly tropical hardwood. The Central Point on Expertise on Timber (CPET) has concluded that all five certification schemes it examined provide assurance of compliance with Government requirements for legal timber. CPET further concluded that the Forestry Stewardship Council and the Canadian Standards Association will also assure central departments that timber products derive from sustainably managed forests. However there is very little certified hardwood available that is suitable for marine work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41215w08.html_para4">
The Agency is working with its supply chain to encourage more production of tropical hardwood that can be independently verified as legally harvested from sustainably managed forests. The Agency currently does its own auditing of timber use in the absence of any other independent verification.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41215w08.html_para5">
The following table shows coastal defence projects on which authorities are likely to incur expenditure in years 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 and where timber is either likely to be used or to have been used. The table is based on forward planning project information provided recently by the Environment Agency and by local authorities in the summer and should be regarded as indicative rather than a definitive list.

 Defra has collected information on the land-spreading of organic manures, including turkey manure, in the 2003 British Survey of Fertiliser Practice.

In some cases the spreading of turkey manure may be subject to control under the Waste Framework Directive.

<p><a name="41215w09.html_spnew4"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 From 2007 large turkey producers (those with 40,000 or more places for turkeys) will be regulated under the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control regime. New installations are now regulated from the outset. Under the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control regime farming installations will have to comply with the Environment Agency&#039;s Standard Farming Rules and Guidance for the poultry sector. In regards to manure spreading, turkey producers will be required to set up a manure management plan for spreading turkey manure on their own farm. Turkey producers would also be required to identify the quantity&#151;and the nitrogen content&#151;of manure if it is sent to another farm for land spreading.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41215w09.html_para8">
Land spreading of organic manures in Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (approximately 55 per cent. of England) must comply with the Action Programme that includes limits on nitrogen application, controls on spreading and periods when spreading cannot take place. Guidelines for farmers are published by the Department, while enforcement action is with the Environment Agency. Outside of Nitrate Vulnerable Zones, farmers are encouraged to comply with the advice in Defra&#039;s Codes of Good Agricultural Practice for the Protection of Water, Air and Soil.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41215w09.html_para9">
Where odour is a nuisance for those living in the vicinity of a farm where the spreading of turkey manure is practised, local authorities can take action under the statutory nuisance regime of section 79 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Local authorities have a duty to take reasonable steps, where practicable, to investigate complaints of odour. If a local authority decides that an odour is prejudicial to health or a nuisance, an abatement notice must be issued, requiring that the activity causing the nuisance cease, or that &#039;best practicable means&#039; be employed to reduce the level of odour. The penalty for non-compliance with an abatement notice is a fine not exceeding &#163;20,000 upon summary conviction.

 Borrowing by local authorities to fund investment under the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme will be supported in exactly the same way as other supported borrowing. Any Supported Capital Expenditure (Revenue) (SCE(R)) amount for the BSF programme will be included, together with other SCE(R) amounts, in the calculations for the Debt Charges element of the Formula Spending Share. Each element of the Formula Spending Share (FSS) calculations incorporates a scaling factor to ensure that the sum of the relevant element for all authorities is equal to the national total for that element set by central government in the Spending Review.

The overall Formula Spending Share for an authority is then used in determining how much Formula Grant support an authority will receive for all services for which the authority is responsible.

The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is currently consulting on proposals for Revenue Support Grant for 2005&#150;06.

<i>[holding answer 13 December 2004]</i>: I am watching the situation closely.

The Ukraine is also an important transit state for oil supplies from Russia into the EU. There are no reports that these supplies have been disrupted. If, however, supplies were disrupted for a prolonged period a combination of increased production from other producers, relatively high EU industry oil stock levels, and, if necessary, the coordinated release of emergency oil stocks by International Energy Agency members would limit the impact on the availability of oil products to final consumers in the EU and UK.

 Premium Rate Services (PRS) are regulated by the Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone Information Services (ICSTIS). Their Code of Practice is set in accordance with condition 120 of the Communications Act 2003, which stipulates that Ofcom can set conditions to control the activities of PRS providers by means of such a Code of Practice.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41215w13.html_para1">
The Government have discussed the issue of PRS dialler scams with ICSTIS and other stakeholders on several occasions over the summer and autumn. We have encouraged ICSTIS to take urgent action to deal with the problem. We have noticed some reduction in the number of complaints in the most recent months compared with the summer, although the problem remains significant.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41215w13.html_para2">
In the summer we asked Ofcom to review PRS regulation, and Ofcom published a report on 9 December. The main recommendations for changes fall into the following three areas.

<a name="41215w13.html_para3">
<i>1. Improved Enforcement</i>

<i>3. Consumer Information</i>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41215w13.html_para8">
Consumers need to be better informed about the ways they can protect themselves against PRS scams. All the telecoms companies in the PRS industry should play a more proactive role in informing and educating their customers. ICSTIS should continue to play a role in advising and educating consumers about PRS scams and its budget should reflect the increased resources it will need in order to continue to perform such a role effectively.

In Swaffham, Norfolk, tourists queue to climb the wind turbine tower to the viewing platform at the top.

A partial regulatory impact assessment on the Directive on traditional herbal medicinal products (Directive 2004/24/EC) was published by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in 2003. Work is in progress to update this assessment in the light of detailed ongoing discussions about implementation of this directive between the MHRA and the herbal forum, representing United Kingdom manufacturers&#039; trade associations operating in the herbal sector. An aim of this discussion is to contain the regulatory burden on industry consistent with the protection of public health and compliance with the requirements of the directive.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41215w21.html_para1">
The Directive on traditional herbal medicinal products relates only to herbal products that are classified as medicines and does not affect the regulation of food supplements. During the negotiations, the UK achieved key priorities as identified in discussions between the MHRA and stakeholders. These included the possibility, for which the UK health food sector had pressed, for simplified registration under the directive of traditional herbal medicines containing ancillary vitamins and minerals. Currently such medicines require a full marketing authorisation. Additionally, to allow companies time to adjust to the new requirements, there is a seven-year transitional period starting in April 2004 before herbal medicines that were legally on the market at that date are required to comply with the directive. We have no plans to seek derogation from the terms of this directive.

Advice to doctors about the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease are readily available. Highly sensitive tests for the detection of Lyme disease are readily available and accessible across the national health service. Public health officials in areas such as the New Forest, where the risks of being bitten by an infected tick are highest, have made their local general practitioners aware of relevant symptoms.

<p>
<a name="41215w22.html_para2">
Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics, usually doxycycline or amoxicillin and early treatment usually clears the initial rash within several days and helps to prevent the development of complications. More serious symptoms also respond to antibiotic treatment. Detailed studies have shown excellent long-term outcomes for most people who receive appropriate treatment. Guidance on the treatment of Lyme disease is available on the Health Protection Agency&#039;s (HPA) website: www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics az/zoonoses/lyme borreliosis/faq.htm

 The Department&#039;s commitment not to discriminate unfairly on any grounds is set out clearly in our equal opportunities policy which is currently being revised to make an explicit reference to age. The Home Office Five Year Race and Diversity Programme includes work to meet the requirements of the proposed regulations on age discrimination in time for implementation in December 2006. This includes monitoring age in all our HR processes. This work will be informed by the latest developments on age policy which we follow through our membership of the Employers Forum on Age (EFA). We have also recently established a new staff Focus Group on age. The Home Office is currently developing diversity awareness training for all staff. This will include guidance on age discrimination and a series of booklets on dignity at work will also give examples on how to avoid age discrimination in the workplace. At present, most staff in the Home Office below the Senior Civil Service have the right to request to remain after the &#039;normal&#039; retirement age of 60, up to the age of 65. Their being able to stay is dependent on the quality of their work and their health.

 Under section 6(1) (section 6(2) if married to a British citizen) of the British Nationality Act 1981 applicants for naturalisation must meet a number of residence requirements which are detailed in schedule 1 to the Act.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41215w24.html_para1">
The residence requirements include five years residence in the UK immediately prior to application (three years if married to a British citizen) and a mandatory requirement to have been physically present in the UK on the actual date five (or three) years prior to the date of application. There is no discretion to waive the requirement to have been physically present in the UK at the start of the five or three year qualifying period where an application is being made on the basis of residence.
</p>

These requirements have not been amended and have been applied consistently since the Act came into force on 1 January 1983.

There is scope under the Act for Crown Service overseas, on the date of application for citizenship, to act as an alternative to the residence criteria outlined above. (This is set out in schedule 1 paragraph 1(3) to the Act). However, strict criteria are applied in such cases and very few applications are granted on this basis. Examples of cases that have been approved include those where the applicant had more than 20 years Crown Service with British embassies, at pro- and vice-consul level, and the application was supported by current and previous ambassadors.

In the light of the recent review into the Home Office immigration and naturalisation policy for Gurkhas, the policy for naturalisation for all servicemen has been changed. We will, generally, no longer naturalise a member of the armed forces while they are still in service. Once discharged ex-servicemen will be able to apply for naturalisation, subject to meeting the usual residence requirements. The new policy takes account of the potential high levels of absences that ex-servicemen may have and will enable these to be waived in most cases.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41215w24.html_para5">
Our policy on applications made solely on the basis of overseas Crown Service has not changed as a result of the review, and we will continue to apply the same strict criteria in these cases.

<i>[holding answer 30 November 2004]:</i> The Home Office has made wide-ranging preparations for the full implementation of the Freedom of Information Act. There has been significant work undertaken both in preparation for implementation and also to ensure future resource inputs are reduced where possible. This has included improving Home Office record management systems, which could underpin the office&#039;s ability to comply promptly with the Act, and dummy requests to test processes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41215w27.html_para0">
After January implementation of the Act will principally involve staff who also have other duties. The effort which they devote to Freedom of Information issues in the first quarter of 2005 will depend on a range of factors, including the number of requests for information received in each area, the complexity of those requests, the ease with which it can be established whether relevant information is held, and the number of appeals lodged by dissatisfied requesters.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41215w27.html_para1">
The cost of compliance is being met from existing resources, and there has been no requirement to identify anticipated costs or to collate them centrally. To collect the necessary information now would involve disproportionate cost, and the final part of Exemption 9 (voluminous or vexatious requests) of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information therefore applies.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what assistance was provided to prisoners released under the early release scheme to reintegrate themselves into the community and find employment; and what the largest amount is of state benefits being paid on a weekly basis to a former early release prisoner in Northern Ireland.  [202889]</p>




<p><a name="41215w34.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Pearson: </b> 
 Prisoners scheduled for early release, under the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998, may not have had the opportunity to make adequate preparation for their successful reintegration into the community. In recognition of this, Prisoner Welfare organisations, who received EU funding, were involved in conducting an analysis of the training needs of those prisoners eligible for early release. Training courses in pre-employment, business planning and social skills development were identified as being the most appropriate courses and these were provided at HMP Maze, by individuals and professional community based training organisations.

 I have been informed by the Northern Ireland Police Fund that it has investigated the potential to establish a database of police widows, disabled police officers and their families.

The Department of Education made &#163;4.5 million available in 2003&#150;04 to enable boards to carry out surveys of all schools and prepare for the introduction of the new asbestos regulations. In addition, &#163;3.8 million has been allocated in the 2004&#150;05 financial year towards removal, decontamination work or repair/remedial work, where this is necessary. It is only necessary to remove the asbestos if it in poor condition or at risk of being disturbed, otherwise the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland (HSENI) advice is to leave it in place and manage the risk.
