Regrettably overfishing has occurred in the past and it is something we wish to avoid in the future. As a result, the UK will argue that a reformed common fisheries policy must be better suited to ensure the rational exploitation of fisheries resources and that sustainability is paramount in the future.</p>

I had meetings with the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Mr Thorbjorn Jagland and Deputy Secretary General, Ms Maud de Boer Buquicchio ahead of UK chairmanship commencing in November 2011. I also met with the President of the Council of Europe, Mr Mevlut Cavusoglu.</p>

 English Heritage has recently launched the National Heritage Protection Plan, which sets out why, what and how England's vulnerable historic environment is to be safeguarded in the next four years. Developed in consultation with a wide range of partners, it shows where the threats are the greatest and will help English Heritage to prioritise its work. It will also help other heritage professionals and volunteers to contribute to the business of managing England's heritage. This Department and English Heritage are also considering various measures to tackle the problem of buildings which have been on the Heritage At Risk Register for an extended period of time.</p>

 The Department for Transport does not hold information concerning fee levels for driver awareness courses in the six highest charging authorities or the level of fees in relation to costs. Driver awareness courses are organised by local police forces and it would be for them to respond on this. The Department strongly supports a national framework and has been keen to encourage all police forces to participate in this, which allows motorists to take courses in their local area and should also provide greater consistency of course fees.</p>

 Following consultation with the rail industry and passenger groups, the Government decided to maintain the decision taken in 2009 by the previous Administration to exempt domestic services from the non-core elements of the Rail Passengers' Rights and Obligations Regulation for a period of five years up to December 2014. We believe that the marginal benefits of fully extending the pan-European regime to domestic passengers would be outweighed by the costs to Government and industry. It would also conflict with our intention to reduce regulatory burdens and with our franchise reform agenda. The UK already has a well-established regime for protecting the rights of domestic rail passengers, including by providing assistance to persons with reduced mobility and disabilities, protecting passengers in case of delay and ensuring a convenient handling of their claims in case of an accident.</p>

 Local highway authorities already have control of local speed limits, and should take full account of local communities' views in setting these limits. A key theme in the Government's Strategic Framework for Road Safety published in May 2011 is the empowerment of local communities, including enabling the public to compare road safety performance in their local area with other similar areas. This will help communities to challenge local service providers on issues such as speed limits. Decisions on speed limits should be based upon comprehensive analysis of all the costs and benefits. The Department is intending to help local decision making through further guidance and an economic toolkit on speed limits.</p>

In 2011/12, which is a transitional year, the majority of young people in their second or third year of study who might be expected to apply for a bursary will be supported via the national administration arrangements. As a result, the amount that will be allocated directly to schools, colleges and training providers is less than the full value of the 16-19 Bursary Fund. The allocation has been calculated so as to enable schools, colleges and training providers to pay guaranteed bursaries to all young people in vulnerable groups, discretionary bursaries to young people in their first year of post-16 study, and 'top up' weekly payments to those who are currently in receipt of EMA should they consider it appropriate to do so.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 27 June 2011]:</i> There are no requirements placed on the number of hours that schools must devote to the teaching of basic learning skills. Schools are required to teach a broad and balanced curriculum, which may include such skills, but they are free to use their professional judgment on how this is organised and delivered. Building on the statutory curriculum, which is comprised of the basic school curriculum and National Curriculum, we believe it should be for individual schools to determine a curriculum structure that best meets the needs of their pupils.</p>

 The English baccalaureate is an option that we think should be open to all who have the ability to benefit from it although it may not be suitable for all pupils. Individual schools will take decisions on the subjects they offer based on the needs and choices of their pupils.

Instead, our responsibility is to consider, in the light of that information, whether the provider is failing to meet, or failed to meet at the time of any incident, the requirements and conditions of their registration. We investigate all concerns raised with us in order to determine whether the provider has breached requirements, and we take action where we find this to be the case.

 The Government have no plans to make emergency life support skills a part of the physical education syllabus. The non-statutory programmes of study for personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) education currently provide a context for schools to teach pupils how to recognise and follow health and safety procedures, including ways of reducing risk and minimising harm in risky situations, how to find sources of emergency help and how to use basic and emergency first aid. Pupils learn to develop the skills to cope with emergency situations that require basic first aid procedures, including, at key stage 4 (ages 15 to 16), resuscitation techniques.</p>

Since the Secretary of State was first made aware of an error in examination papers taken in schools during the summer 2011 series on 3 June, he has been informed as each additional error has been identified and has repeatedly spoken with Ofqual's chief executive and asked to be updated on their intended course of action.</p>

In her letter, the chief executive of Ofqual required the awarding bodies concerned to give their written assurance that they had implemented additional checks on the question papers for examinations that remained still to be taken, to ensure that there were no further errors that had been missed by earlier quality assurance processes. Each awarding organisation provided Ofqual with written assurances by 13 June that such additional quality checks had been or would be made before papers were sat.</p>

               <b>Mr Gibb:</b>
 The errors that have come to light in GCSEs and A Levels are extremely serious and are unacceptable. As the regulator of awarding organisations and the qualifications they offer, the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual) have taken swift and robust action to hold awarding organisations to account for these mistakes, and to check that any mistakes in as yet untaken exams are identified and put right. Ofqual will also be checking the awarding organisations' arrangements for securing redress, to ensure they are fair both to the candidates who were directly affected, and those who were not. The Secretary of State for Education has had regular updates from the chief executive of Ofqual, Glenys Stacey, on Ofqual's current action. He has also asked to be kept informed about further steps they will be taking to ensure that awarding organisations do not repeat these mistakes. Fiona Pethick, Director of Regulation at Ofqual has written to the hon. Member providing further details and a copy of her reply has been placed in the House Libraries.</p>

 The Secretary of State for Education, my right hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove), has held no meetings with third parties outside Government on this issue. The Secretary of State spoke to Glenys Stacey, the chief executive of Ofqual on Tuesday 21st, Wednesday 22nd, Friday 24th and Saturday 25th June on this matter. The Secretary of State's office does not provide minutes of such meetings, which are based on the provision on private advice to Ministers. I met Andrew Hall, chief executive of AQA informally at a conference organised by Reform on Tuesday 28 June.</p>

It is extremely important that effective steps are taken to limit the impact on students' marks and grades, and maintain standards overall. Such redress aims to make good so far as is possible. Wider redress measures are broadly a matter for awarding organisations and they have been encouraged by Ofqual to be transparent with candidates about these.</p>

 The fire at Aldermaston AWE took place on 3 August 2010. The Ministry of Defence's fire and rescue service investigated the operational response to the incident and produced a report. This identified areas where improvements could be made, including arrangements with the Royal Berkshire fire and rescue service. This review has been completed and I understand the findings have been acted upon by the respective authorities. Officials in my Department liaise closely with the Ministry of Defence's fire and rescue service on a regular basis, and on a range of issues.</p>

 The Institute for Government and Centre for Cities' report suggests mayors, particularly in our major cities, should have greater powers to promote economic growth including over issues such as transport and strategic planning. We are looking to each of the major cities to tell us the type of powers they would expect their mayor to have, and in our Structural Reform Plan we are committed to consult in September this year on mayoral powers. Our consideration of possible mayoral powers will include looking at their potential impact on the areas concerned, and at whether any such power might appropriately be given to other elected mayors outside the major cities, having regard to the circumstances of their local authority.</p>

I also announced that I plan to consult on improvements to the buying and selling process of park homes to prevent the unacceptable practice of the blocking of lawful sales by unscrupulous site owners and to provide an effective means of redress for residents where this happens. In May, myself and officials met with key industry and resident partners, and officials met separately with local authority partners and representatives of holiday caravan owners, to help inform the consultation and gain a better understanding of the expectations and aspirations of our partners in this sector of the housing market.

 The Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill currently restricts eligibility for appointment to the position of chief constable to persons already holding the office of constable. The Government have brought forward amendments to the Bill for consideration by the House of Lords at Report Stage in that House. These amendments would extend the eligibility criteria by allowing a person who has previously held the office of constable to be appointed. This would mean, for example, that a retired chief constable would be eligible. A person who has not previously been a member of a police force (and therefore not held the office of constable) will continue to be ineligible.</p>

 The Ministry of Justice has plans to generate low carbon energy from its estate which we can export to the grid. In association with Partnerships for Renewables the National Offender Management Service's planning application for wind energy generation at Standford Hill on the Isle of Sheppey, was approved in May 2011.

 There are approximately 3,700 incidents reported annually in open prisons and prisons with an open element. These are reported on the HM Prison Service Incident Reporting System. However not all of these relate to a criminal offence, some relate to breaches of prison discipline while other types of incident include those connected with security or self-harm.</p>

               <a name="11070440001193"> In order to provide data relating to the number of criminal offences committed by offenders serving a sentence in an open prison it would be necessary to manually examine each of these 3,700 records which could be done only at disproportionate cost.</p>

Other pilots have been agreed and will commence shortly. This includes pilot local approaches to reduce demand for criminal justice services in London and Manchester and a pilot at HMP Doncaster that will aim to reduce the reoffending of released offenders. The formal start date of these pilots is due to be July 2011 and October 2011 respectively.</p>

<sup>(2)</sup> The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.
<sup>(3)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.
<sup>(4)</sup> Revisions have been made to 2009 figures to account for the late receipt of a small number of court records.

                     <sup>(1)</sup> The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.
<sup>(2)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.

 Responsibility for this issue is devolved to the governments of the Overseas Territories.

Action undertaken to date has steadily reduced Gaddafiâs ability to launch and sustain attacks on his own people and has prevented a massacre of civilians, particularly in Benghazi.

While there is no humanitarian crisis, there is an enduring need for humanitarian aid. We have also been clear that actions by both Israel and Hamas have contributed to this situation.

However there has been no fundamental change in the crossings regime and economic stagnation and de-development in Gaza remain the norm. We are clear that more needs to be done, particularly to enable exports, accelerate key imports for reconstruction and ensure free movement of people. Without economic growth in Gaza, there is a risk of fostering a more broadly radicalised environment. An improved economy and a resurgence of Gaza's pragmatic business fraternity are not only essential for the people of Gaza, but are also firmly in Israel's security interests.</p>

 Personal independence payment is intended to support people with long-term health conditions or disabilities. A qualifying period of six months helps us achieve this. When taken together with the six month prospective test, the six month qualifying period brings our definition of long-term disability closer in line with that from the Equality Act 2010. As now, people will not always have to wait six months before being paid personal independence payment if some, or all, of the qualifying period has been satisfied by the time they submit their claim.</p>

Some organisations were in favour of our proposals regarding the qualifying period and the fact that it would align with the definition of long-term disability. Others argued against the proposal on the grounds that some health conditions and impairments, such as cancer, have a sudden onset and individuals incur extra costs very soon after diagnosis. The Government's response to the consultation on disability living allowance reform (Cm 8051) includes some representations from organisations on this issue.

               <i>[holding answer 27 June 2011]:</i> The Secretary of State for Defence published Lord Leveneâs report into the structure and management of the Ministry of Defence on 27 June, and endorsed its recommendations. Those recommendations reduce the number of senior military and civilian posts in the Department. However, Lord Levene recommended retaining the Second Permanent Secretary postâand the Vice Chief of Defence Staff postâon the basis that, without them, the loading and span of control on the Permanent Secretary and the Chief of the Defence Staff would be unsustainable. Recognising the amount of change the Department will be embarking on, Lord Levene also recommended that we take stock of progress after about two years and consider whether the proposed structure and role of the Head Office, including the requirement, role and seniority of both the Second Permanent Secretary and the Vice Chief of Defence Staff remain valid.</p>

 The welfare of veterans is the responsibility of Government as a whole and therefore many Departments are involved in its monitoring. The Armed Forces Covenant stresses the importance we place on ensuring that veterans are not disadvantaged as a result of their service in the armed forces. The proposed annual report to Parliament will highlight the progress that has been made and where there is scope for improvement.</p>

 A wide range of products and appliances have historically been eligible for delivery under the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT). These include lighting measures such as CFLs and LED lighting; consumer electronics, such as some televisions and radios; domestic appliances, such as some fridges, microwaves and dishwashers; and other energy efficient products, such as shower regulators and real time displays. Following an earlier public consultation, the Government took action to exclude CFLs from the scheme as from 31 March this year. A further public consultation on the role of the remaining products and appliances closed in January. We are currently considering the evidence received and expect to publish a response to this consultation shortly.</p>

               <i> [holding answer 29 June 2011]:</i>The location for the Green Investment Bank (GIB) will be chosen to enable it best to deliver its mission. The criteria will be: (1) ability to deliver the GIB mission (2) operational costs, and (3) access to required talent. Fuller details of these criteria are set out in section 2.8 of the "Update on the design of the Green Investment Bank" which was published on 23 May. This decision will be taken in due course. While the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, my right hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Vince Cable), will be taking the decision according to these criteria, in the meantime, cities are welcome to make their case.</p>

 The information in the table shows the number of 15-year-olds in English maintained schools in 2003/04 who progressed to Cambridge or Oxford University by age 19 in 2007/08. The local authority is defined by the school where the pupil studied at age 15. Pupils may move to a different local authority area to undertake post-16 studies.</p>

 UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI), which reports jointly to BIS and FCO Ministers, is focused on helping UK companies do business internationally and helping overseas companies invest in the UK. It does not actively promote outward investment from the UK. Where UK companies with existing plans for overseas investment, or those who have already invested overseas, seek UKTI support it will assist as necessary with lobbying or other advice as appropriate. The UKTI team in the British embassy in Khartoum led by the British ambassador will continue to offer this service. After 9 July when South Sudan is established, the British ambassador in Juba will also assist investors where possible and appropriate.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 30 June 2011]:</i> Where carers have the primary responsibility for bringing up a child, there is UK-wide financial provision through child benefit and child tax credit, which can be paid on the same terms as to a parent. Child benefit and child tax credit guarantee support for the first child of over Â£4,000 a year for carers on very low incomes. Guardian's allowance can also be paid where both parents are deceased or, in prescribed circumstances, where only one parent is deceased. In order to prevent double provision, this support is not provided where the accommodation or maintenance of a looked-after-child is provided from public funds.</p>

 Support for children through the care system is a devolved matter. In England, family and friends carers of looked after children must be approved as foster carers and receive support as other foster carers do. Responsibility for maintaining a looked after child lies with the child's local authority and therefore the cost to the foster carer of caring for the child is paid to them in the form of a fostering allowance. The Government set a national minimum fostering allowance. The fostering allowance should be calculated according to criteria that do not discriminate against foster carers that are related to the child.</p>
