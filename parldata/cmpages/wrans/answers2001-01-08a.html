<P>
<a name="10108w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General how many prosecutions have commenced arising from racist actions as a consequence of the present situation in the middle east; what policy the CPS is adopting towards reports to them by the police in these circumstances; and if he will make a statement.  [144377]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10108w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 In the absence of direct evidence or a perpetrator identifying his/her particular motive in acting as alleged, it is impossible to attribute the commission of an offence to any particular event(s). Given that and the fact that the question embraces the possibility of any offence nationwide with a racist element, the information sought could be obtained only at a disproportionate cost. However, I am able to confirm that the Casework Directorate of the CPS is considering a police report into two reported incidents of the publication and distribution of inflammatory material, which targeted the Jewish community. Also, I can say that any other offences reported will be reviewed by the CPS in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors and, where the evidential and public interest tests are satisfied, prosecuted.

To ask the Solicitor-General in how many cases during the last 12 months appeals against lenient sentences resulted in an increase in the sentence that had been imposed.  [143928]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10108w01.html_spmin1"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 In the year 2000, the sentences imposed upon 85 offenders were referred to the Court of Appeal in London or are currently awaiting hearing. The court has heard 48 applications to date. In 43 cases the sentences were held to be unduly lenient and in 36 cases the sentences were increased.

<a name="10108w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 December 2000]:</i> The development within NATO of the European Security and Defence Identity (ESDI), based on decisions taken by the Alliance at successive Summit meetings held in London in 1990, Brussels 1994 and Madrid in 1997, has been an integral part of the adaption of the Alliance's political and military structures, enabling the European Allies to assume greater responsibility for the common security and defence as a manifestation of transatlantic solidarity. These developments have been followed with a view to providing a genuine European military capability without duplicating the military assets and capabilities already available within NATO. The ESDI within NATO has been an important element of the development of the WEU, and has been built upon to support developments in the EU, as envisaged in the Treaties of Maastricht 1992, and Amsterdam in 1997.
<P>

<a name="10108w01.html_para2">At the Washington Summit in April 1999, NATO supported the EU's aspirations and announced that it stood ready to develop arrangements to provide the EU with ready access to NATO resources. In particular, NATO has agreed to develop arrangements for the EU to have assured access to NATO's planning capacities, and a presumption of availability of its common assets and capabilities, for the use in EU-led operations.
<P>

<a name="10108w01.html_para3">At the NATO North Atlantic Council meeting of Defence Ministers on 5 December, it was re-affirmed that NATO
<P>

<a name="10108w01.html_para4"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>intend to put into place arrangements for: assured access to NATO planning capabilities able to contribute to military planning for EU-led operations; the presumption of availability to the EU of pre-identified NATO capabilities and common assets for use in EU-led operations; the identification of a range of European command options for EU-led operations, further developing the role of DSACEUR in order for him to assume fully and effectively his European responsibilities; and the further adaption of the Alliance's defence planning system, taking account of the relevant activities in and proposals from the European Union.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10108w01.html_para5">The detailed modalities for the availability to the EU of NATO assets and capabilities have yet to be determined. However, they will build on the previous agreements between NATO and the WEU.
<P>

<a name="10108w01.html_para6">The EU, at Nice, put forward proposals on the permanent EU/NATO relationship, again building on the NATO/WEU consultation arrangements. Nice also agreed that DSACEUR will be invited to attend meetings of the EU Military Committee, as necessary, in view of his responsibilities for the European Pillar of NATO, and his potential role in EU-led operations.
<P>

<a name="10108w01.html_para7">Interim structures for the Common Foreign and Security Policy were initiated at Helsinki (a Political and Security Committee, an EU Military Committee, and an EU Military Staff) and were established during the Portuguese Presidency. They will achieve their permanent status as soon as possible during 2001.
<P>

<a name="10108w01.html_para8">The allocation of posts in the small permanent European Union Military Staff is still to be determined.
<P>

<a name="10108w01.html_para9">Noting that there is no standing entity of a European Rapid Reaction Force, none of the forces earmarked by the UK, at the Capability Commitments Conference, for potential EU-led operations will be allocated to full-time duties with the European Union.




<P>
<P><I>8 Jan 2001 : Column: 350W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10108w01.html_para10">Within the European Union, there is no EU Council of Defence Ministers. Defence Ministers of the EU have however, on occasion, met on an informal basis, and they have joined their Foreign Minister colleagues in the General Affairs Council.
<P>

<a name="10108w01.html_para11">The Secretary of State has regular discussions with his EU and NATO counterparts. To this end, he has had discussions with his Turkish Counterpart, and met him most recently, at the NATO Ministerials in Brussels on 4-6 December 2000.
<P>

<a name="10108w01.html_para12">The Nice European Council agreed on a substantial set of provisions to enable non-EU European Allies (including Turkey) and other EU accession candidates to have close and continuous involvement in the evolution of the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy and to participate in EU-led operations. These arrangements do not affect their status as associate members or associate partners in the WEU. They create a new set of relationships building on arrangements in the WEU.
<P>

<a name="10108w01.html_para13">At the WEU Council in Marseille in November 2000, Ministers acknowledged the work of the WEU Military Staff and noted that it is preparing to cease its activities. The final exercise of the WEU programme will be the Joint Exercise Study 2001 to be held with NATO between 11 and 15 June 2001. Sweden has identified the development of an EU exercise policy as one of its objectives for its incoming EU Presidency.
<P>

<a name="10108w01.html_para14">Decisions were taken at the WEU Ministerial Council in Marseille in November, and later at the Nice European Council, to transfer the WEU Satellite Centre to the EU, as a Second Pillar agency, with effect from 1 January 2002. The detailed arrangements for the transfer have yet to be established; these will be examined by the forthcoming Dutch WEU Presidency and Swedish EU Presidency. The continued involvement of WEU associate members has been established as an important principle in this process. The residual WEU will not have any requirements of the Satellite Centre beyond 2001.

<P>
<a name="10108w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 We have no current plans to procure Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicles (AAAVs), which are about to enter a second stage of prototype development for the US Marine Corps and are not due in service there until 2006. UK amphibious operations are conducted using landing craft (such as the Landing Craft Utility) and helicopters to land vehicles, material and personnel of the Amphibious Task Force from the Landing Platform Helicopter (LPH), Landing Platform Docks (LPDs) and Landing Ships Logistic (LSL). However, we continue to evaluate our amphibious requirements in the light of doctrinal developments, and are watching the AAAV programme with interest.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10108w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence has not held formal consultations with non-governmental organisations on the general development of the Government's cross-departmental initiative on conflict prevention. However, we maintain contact with non-governmental organisations and academic institutions in the field of conflict prevention, including peacekeeping. Together with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development, we will be expanding and developing these contacts as the cross-cutting strategy develops.

 The cost of storage of spent fuel from nuclear-powered submarines in each of the last five years from 1995 to 1999 inclusive was &#163;2.6 million, &#163;2.2 million, &#163;1.9 million, &#163;1.7 million and &#163;1.3 million respectively (all at outturn prices including VAT).

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10108w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The system of regiments and related regimental associations is unique to the army. Men and women serving in the Royal Navy, Royal Marines and Royal Air Force can expect to serve in more than one unit, ship or squadron and their associations therefore tend to be Service-wide. In all three Services, however, details of the relevant associations and their functions are included in discharge papers. Arrangements for obtaining contact details are also provided.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10108w02.html_wqn6"><B> Ms Walley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will advise members of the armed forces who choose not to extend their service of details of the functions of regimental associations and how to join; and if he will make a statement.  [144053]

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10108w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Although each Service has its own discharge procedures, each ensures that its personnel are informed of the existence and role of appropriate regimental, single-Service or tri-Service associations that can be joined.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many disabled people are employed as civilians by the armed forces; what the percentage in employment of disabled people is in the economy as a whole; and if he will make a statement on widening access to and participation by disabled people in such employment.  [144414]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10108w02.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence employs over 5,900 people with disabilities, around 6 per cent. of the civilian workforce. This percentage is broadly in line with the estimated numbers of economically active disabled people in the working population as a whole. There are no restrictions on disabled people being employed in civilian jobs in the Ministry of Defence. The Department has participated in the Government's 'Positive about Disabled People' programme since 1995 and has developed its own comprehensive action plan to recruit more people with disabilities and help disabled employees develop their full potential at work.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what action he takes to encourage rehabilitation of service personnel who are seriously injured during the course of their duties, and to encourage their absorption into alternative civilian re-employment with the armed forces.  [144415]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10108w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Members of the armed forces who are seriously injured in the course of their duties receive appropriate medical rehabilitation, either from the Defence Medical Services or the National Health Service. Those whose injuries lead to discharge from the armed forces on medical grounds are eligible for an extensive package of resettlement assistance provided by the Ministry of Defence, including help in obtaining civilian employment.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10108w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The NATO Alliance maintains sub- strategic nuclear forces at the minimum level required for its security. Alliance policy is not to reveal details of the number and locations of such forces. We support that policy.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the extent to which the contribution of nuclear-powered submarines to the proposed European Rapid Reaction Force is consistent with the Government's commitment to 



<P>
<P><I>8 Jan 2001 : Column: 353W</I><P>
ensuring a diminishing role for nuclear weapons in security policies under the Non-Proliferation Treaty final document.  [144106]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10108w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 There is no such entity as a standing European Rapid Reaction Force. No nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines have been identified as part of our contribution to meeting the European Union headline goal. Nuclear-powered fleet submarines, which do not carry ballistic missiles, are not themselves considered to be nuclear weapons. Our contribution to the pool of forces and capabilities for EU-led crisis management tasks is fully consistent will Government policy on non-proliferation.

 As I made clear in my statement on 7 November 2000, the ex-gratia payment for British groups who were held prisoner by the Japanese during the Second World War will be made by the War Pensions Agency direct and in full to the eligible recipients. A number of representations have been received, mostly by the War Pensions Agency, about the reported approach to the expected recipients of the ex-gratia payment by a firm of lawyers seeking a contribution towards its costs. However, the terms of any agreement to make such a contribution are a matter for the parties concerned and not for HM Government.

 I was very disappointed to hear of the job losses announced by Courtaulds Ladieswear at Peterlee.

A strategic response group was set up, led by Easington district council, to co-ordinate the resources available. The Employment Service has the necessary arrangements in place to provide advice and guidance to the work force. I understand that opportunities exist in the area for alternative employment and that various local employers have visited the site to present group sessions to staff.

 In 1999, the Government ran a nationwide publicity campaign, including television advertisements, to cover the introduction of the national minimum wage on 1 April 1999.

 To date there have been no criminal prosecutions for underpayment of the national minimum wage.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10108w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 I am not able to provide specific time scales for the East Kent coalfield. However, given the number of claimants--130,000 nationwide--it will take at least three years to settle the last of these claims. This must be set against 15 years or more it would take if each case were dealt with on an individual basis through the courts.
<P>

<a name="10108w05.html_para1">We expect that by Spring 2002 we will have processed the claims for the oldest and most ill. Claims from elderly widows of deceased miners are also being dealt with first, wherever possible.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what plans he has to speed up the settlement of claims for ex-miners seeking compensation for respiratory disease and vibration white finger.  [144048]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10108w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Progress in dealing with claims for respiratory disease must be speeded up. To tackle this, our contractors have increased the numbers of medical testing centres and record scanning teams, and are urgently seeking to recruit more doctors. A review and change has taken place resulting in how doctors are used and paid. We are also seeking to streamline the medical assessment process. These proposals are being taken forward with the claimants' solicitors.
<P>

<a name="10108w05.html_para2">In September, I announced new fast-track proposals of higher expedited offers for those who have already had such an offer and also for new classes of claimants. This is now completed and it has generated over 15,200 offers worth &#163;74 million.
<P>

<a name="10108w05.html_para3">On vibration white finger, initial assessments on all the existing claimants will be complied by the end of next year. A further assessment may be required for those claimants seeking compensation for loss of services, but this is still under consideration.
<P>

<a name="10108w05.html_para4">In total, the Department has now paid out nearly &#163;300 million in compensation for both respiratory and vibration-related diseases, with around &#163;1 million being paid out each day.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10108w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The Department's claim handling agents have registered a total of 61 claims by former miners in the East Kent coalfields who have died in the last five years, and where the date of death is after the date of claim. Of these, 52 were claiming for respiratory disease and nine were claiming for vibration white finger.
<P>

<a name="10108w05.html_para5">In all these cases, the claims will be continued by the claimant's widow or dependants. In addition, where the claimant's death certificate shows that one of the respiratory diseases for which British Coal were found liable either caused or materially contributed to the death, the Department will also make a bereavement award to the claimant's widow. To date, the Department has made 37 bereavement awards to widows in the East Kent coalfields.

 The New Opportunities Fund has &#163;9.75 million available to fund cancer prevention, detection, treatment and care projects in Wales. The Fund has sought applications from interested parties in Wales and is currently working to identify suitable schemes to make the best and most effective use of this money in line with national policies and local needs. The Fund expects to announce successful projects in April 2001.

 Arrangements already exist for the discussion of health and safety issues, including standards, through bodies such as the Health and Safety Commission's Railway Industry Advisory Committee (RIAC), which includes representatives of employers, trade unions and passengers. There are no plans to convene additional meetings prior to receiving Lord Cullen's report on the Ladbroke Grove rail inquiry, which is expected to make proposals on the subject of standards and how they are set.

<BR>
<i>Early Years</i>
<BR>
Cumbria has been allocated sufficient funding to create 808 (&#163;959,904) new free part-time early education places in 2001-02 rising to 915 (&#163;1,114,470) in 2002-03 and 1,037 (&#163;1,294,176) in 2003-04. The Cumbria Early Years Development and Childcare Partnership is responsible for setting criteria, based upon need, to decide which children should receive these places.
<BR>
<i>Sure Start</i>
<BR>
The Allerdale district will receive a Sure Start grant of up to &#163;3 million over three years as part of the third wave of funding.
<BR>
Allerdale is part of the rural pilot programme which is exploring how services can best be delivered to families over a wider geographic area than that covered by other Sure Start Programmes.
<BR>
<i>Employment and Training</i>
<BR>
The Employment Service offers a full range of services to unemployed people in Silloth through its Jobcentres in Maryport and Carlisle. In addition, a vacancy display has been set up at Silloth's community centre, offering a freephone link to Maryport Jobcentre. This will be replaced next year by a vacancy kiosk with computer links to Jobcentre vacancies.
<BR>
Workington and Carlisle each have Jobclub and Jobplan workshops which advise clients and offer support in finding employment. Intakes are on a weekly basis and travel expenses are refunded.
<BR>
Maryport Jobcentre currently undertakes twice weekly sessions at Johnson Controls to take claims for benefit and offer employment advice to staff being made redundant. The redundancy has been declared large scale and early access to ES programmes is open for redundant workers. Ongoing meetings between Employment Services, Cumbria county council and Enterprise Cumbria Ltd. have now defined the plan to submit an application to the Rapid Response Fund to assist workers with additional support for re-training.
<BR>
The local Jobcentre works closely with the local parish council and periodically holds advisory sessions for clients at the community hall.
<BR>
<i>New Deal for Young People</i>
<BR>
Silloth is part of the Cumbria Unit of Delivery (UoD). New Deal for Young People in the Workington parliamentary constituency has placed 652 people into employment since April 1998, 508 of whom were in sustained employment (employment exceeding 13 weeks).

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will <i>(a)</i> make a statement on the Government's approach to the monitoring of air quality, <i>(b)</i> list those sites which the Government use for monitoring air quality and <i>(c)</i> make a statement on the role of local authorities in monitoring air quality.  [143883]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10108w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The air quality strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, published in January 2000, sets objectives for eight main air pollutants in order to protect people's health and maintain sustainable development. This strategy takes account of European legislation and international agreements essential to improve air quality across Europe and the United Kingdom. Over many years successive Governments have developed a variety of national networks which monitor and measure concentrations of the main pollutants in the ambient air. My Department continues to review and extend that coverage to ensure our obligations are fully met and it produces the information necessary for proper decision-making.
<P>

<a name="10108w07.html_para0">A detailed description of the networks, individual monitoring sites within the networks, and recorded measurements is available on my Department's worldwide website (http://www.environment.detr.gov.uk/ airq/aqinfo.htm) within the national air quality archive. Copies of annual reports of the networks are also published on the Department's website. Summary information on measured pollution levels and their effects on people's health is available daily on Teletext and CEEFAX pages, as well as through weather bulletins. A copy of the air quality strategy is available in the House of Commons Library and a list of monitoring sites will be made available to the Library.




<P>
<P><I>8 Jan 2001 : Column: 373W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10108w07.html_para1">Local authorities also have a key role to play in monitoring air quality. Under Part IV of the Environment Act 1995, all local authorities are required to review and assess their local air quality and to designate air quality management areas where they expect any significant problems. The monitoring of current levels of key air pollutants, combined with the forecasting of likely future levels of these pollutants, is a fundamental part of this exercise. My Department has provided over &#163;12 million worth of supplementary credit approvals to local authorities in recent years to assist with the purchase of monitoring equipment, and has provided detailed technical guidance on operational monitoring issues.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10108w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 In the last four months, I have issued no new instruction by way of a direction to the Environment Agency with regard to the <i>(a)</i> monitoring and <i>(b)</i> enforcement of regulations relating to air quality. However, instructions were given which indirectly relate to air quality on the 25 October 2000, when a transitional direction was issued under the Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 to ensure directions previously made under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 continue to have effect under the new regime.

 <i>[holding answer 21 December 2000]:</i> Under the terms of the agreement with the manufacturers of the European Night Services (ENS) rolling stock, the ENS shareholders were to receive a share in any sale proceeds if the price paid for the rolling stock was above a certain level. Unfortunately I understand from Eurostar (UK) Ltd. that the proceeds of this sale were not above that threshold and that there will therefore be no contribution from the sale.




<P>
<P><I>8 Jan 2001 : Column: 374W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10108w08.html_para0">The Government have held no talks with leasing companies since the original agreement was reached in 1998.
<P>

<a name="10108w08.html_para1">The rolling stock meant for services north of London includes both the sleeper carriages for European Night Services and the Regional Eurostar rolling stock. The Government incurred a cost of &#163;109 million when the leases for the rolling stock were terminated and the Government guarantee was called.
<P>

<a name="10108w08.html_para2">The Regional Eurostar sets originally cost &#163;180 million. The Government consented to a sale and leaseback arrangement in 1998 to ease Eurostar's cash flow problems and Eurostar has subsequently arranged a further leasing arrangement on two of the Regional Eurostar sets to allow their use on the east coast main line. The details of this arrangement are a commercial matter between the two parties involved.

No specific exclusions have been placed on Newcastle or on any other authority, and any decision not to give grants in the Newcastle upon Tyne, Central constituency will have been taken by the authority itself.
<P>

<a name="10108w09.html_para1">Newcastle city council made use of the full amount of Government support for private sector housing renewal, which is spent mainly on grants for home improvement, in 1998-99 and 1999-2000. Had the council spent less than its allocation during these years, it would not have been able to reapply the funds to other purposes, as there was separate ring-fenced support for the grants. That ring fence no longer exists, and authorities are free to use the resources within their overall housing capital allocation for a range of housing purposes, including on home improvement grants.

 In the formal consultation on this document, 67 responses were received. All respondents welcomed the proposal to allow local authorities to pay capital receipts into their pension funds. We have, however, always made clear that the scheme is meant to help authorities whose pension fund liabilities are significantly higher than average. On the information currently available, it appears that North Yorkshire county council does not pass this test and there seem to be no grounds for exceptional treatment.

The consultation period closed on 18 December 2000. The First Minister of the National Assembly for Wales has set out his views on the proposals in a response to the director general.

 No specific targets have been set for the gains in water efficiency to be achieved by metering. Metering has a role to play alongside other measures in promoting the sustainable management of water resources. The Government have a "twin track" approach, in which future requirements for water are to be met by demand management as well as resource development. Water companies have also been placed under a duty to promote the efficient use of water by their customers.

local authorities proposing major local transport schemes are required to submit a detailed appraisal in order to be eligible for Government support for their scheme.
<P>

<a name="10108w11.html_para0">For schemes below this threshold, the Government now allocate resources in response to overall programmes and strategies rather than to individual schemes. However, we expect authorities to appraise their programmes in accordance with guidance that we have issued and for components of such programmes to be justified in their own right. In cases where the impacts of components are substantial, formal appraisal is particularly important, even if the cost is less than &#163;5 million. We have also made clear that we may ask authorities to provide such evidence to justify particular components of their local transport plans.

<a name="10108w11.html_para1">Local authorities are under a general statutory duty to place reports which have informed decisions taken by councillors into the public domain, except where such documents contain exempt or confidential information as defined in Schedule 12A of the Local Government Act 1972.

 Estimates are currently available for 1989 to 1996 only, which show, as an average for the period, that 38 per cent. of new dwellings in the South-West were built on previously developed land and 35 per cent. in the former Avon area. These figures exclude conversion of existing buildings, which is estimated to add about 3 percentage points to the annual recycling rate for England. The Government have proposed a 50 per cent. recycling target for the South-West.

 The Government believe it is important that young people should be consulted and involved in the development of policies and services relevant to them. The new children and young people's unit has in place plans to identify good practice at national and local level in the involvement of young people and will ensure that effective strategies are in place to encourage this to happen.
<P>

<a name="10108w13.html_para7">One example is where the Connexions have identified involving young people as a critical, priority area as they develop and implement the full service. The Connexions pilots are already showing evidence that this is being applied successfully. For example, in selecting people who will act as personal advisers, several pilots have consulted young people about the characteristics and competences that they would want to see and have displayed by individuals. Two pilots in particular, Coventry and Warwick and Oldham, extended this by individuals having young people contribute to the selection process. Potential candidates made a presentation to the young people and/or they sat in on the actual interviews.

The size of the average secondary class nationally, at 22, is still five below the average primary class. Secondary headteachers are receiving an average of &#163;50,000 this year in direct grant to spend as they choose. If this were spent on recruiting teachers, the average secondary class size could be reduced by up to 0.8.We have secured early delivery of our infant class size pledge for the vast majority of infants, including in the North Somerset local education authority.

 The introduction of the employment provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) coincided with the abolition of the option to register as disabled under the provisions of the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act 1944. The data now collected by the Government include the number of disabled people as defined by the 1995 Act. The labour force survey is used to provide a quarterly update of the number of people of working age with a current disability as defined by the Act and their employment status. The 1995 Act uses a wider, more inclusive definition of disability than the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act 1944.
<P>

<a name="10108w15.html_para1">According to the labour force survey (Summer 2000), there are 60,000 people of working age with a long-term disability as defined by the DDA living in Durham County. They account for 19 per cent. of the total working age population of Durham.

 <i>[holding answer 20 December 2000]:</i> The figures in the following table are at 1999-2000 prices, calculated using the GDP deflator. The figure for 2000 has been uprated using the forecast GDP deflator for 2000-01 of 102.0. For some years, more than one salary is shown. This is where salary increases were staged, or where further increases were awarded. The first figure relates to the salary as at 1 April, except the first 1980 figure which relates to 1 January, and the second relates to the higher salary introduced later in the same year, usually 1 December. The GDP deflator relating to the financial year in which a pay award became effective has been used to calculate the real terms figures.

 My ministerial colleagues and I regularly talk to representatives of LEAs and funding issues are sometimes on the agenda. In 2001-02, real terms funding per pupil will rise in England by &#163;150, following an increase of &#163;300 since 1997. This contrasts with a cut of &#163;60 per pupil between 1994-97 in real terms.

A similar schools competition in 1998-99 was very successful, with the majority of schools requesting an information pack and estimated 30,000 schoolchildren learning more about work in the NHS. Over 80 per cent. of teachers reported that students were now "quite or very interested" in a career in the NHS.

<P>
<a name="10108w18.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 With the increasing use of DNA technology, and the substantial expansion of the national DNA database, my Department is funding the cost of processing and loading the profiles of 75,000 front-line police personnel on to a separate database, the police elimination database (PED).
<P>

<a name="10108w18.html_para8">Our initial target is by April 2001 to hold samples from the 75,000 front-line staff most likely to visit a crime scene. We are making good progress towards this and by the end of November 2000 over 46,000 samples have been submitted by police forces for inclusion on the police elimination database.
<P>

<a name="10108w18.html_para9">Recent improvements in the sensitivity of DNA have led to a much greater risk of accidental contamination of material by police personnel involved. Police officers are legally obliged to give a DNA sample if there is a risk that they may have inadvertently contaminated a crime scene, to eliminate them from the investigation. After each investigation these samples are destroyed. This results in a delay in subsequent investigations if samples from officers have to be taken and processed on every occasion the officer visits a crime scene, and can mean a delay in arresting suspects. It is also costly, as police forces have to pay for the costs of these repeated tests. Rather than continually carry out this process, officers can agree to their profile being held on the PED. This allows police to identify quickly and eliminate the DNA samples from the police officers visiting a crime scene.
<P>

<a name="10108w18.html_para10">The Police Advisory Board (PAB) has been considering the Association of Chief Police Officers' proposal that new recruits to the police service should be obliged to provide DNA samples for inclusion in the police elimination database as a condition of service, so mirroring the requirement on police officers to provide fingerprints for elimination purposes. The Police Federation of England and Wales has expressed concerns about the proposals and discussions are continuing. I have asked the PAB to reach agreement on the way forward by the end of February.

 The European Council agreed a comprehensive action plan for a co-ordinated approach to the fight against organised crime at its meeting in Vienna during the Austrian Presidency in 1998. In support of this plan, the European Union has developed and implemented a significant number of proactive initiatives. The European Council Meeting in Tampere in October 1999 focused on justice and home affairs in the European Union, in particular the problems presented by organised crime. Subjects covered included human trafficking, drug trafficking, money laundering, crime prevention, and the tools available to fight these crimes--mutual recognition of judicial decisions, EUROJUST, Europol, and the European Chiefs Task Force. Major progress was made in strengthening and implementing existing initiatives and developing new ones. The United Kingdom attaches considerable importance to this work. It has played, and will continue to play, a major role in developing and putting forward initiatives designed to strengthen European Union action and co-operation in this field. Copies of European Union Documents relating to these initiatives, which have been considered by the House European Scrutiny Committee, are available in the Library.

 The hostel in question was, between 1976-2000, an approved probation and bail hostel managed by the Inner-London Probation Service (ILPS), on behalf of the Home Office. We are proposing to refurbish and reopen it in February 2001 under the management of the Langley House Trust. The essential functions of the hostel will remain unchanged, but security and staffing provision will be considerably enhanced. Preference will be given to the accommodation of London offenders and we are satisfied that the hostel will effectively contribute to public protection and the reduction of reoffending. ILPS have arranged a public meeting for 18 January to inform the local community about the proposals.

<P>
<a name="10108w20.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Pickles: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will ensure that emergency calls dialling 999 from Essex addresses are routed to Essex police.  [143665]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10108w20.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Arrangements for the day-to-day policing of an area, including the handling of emergency calls to police force incident rooms, are operational matters and, as such, the responsibility of the chief officer of the force concerned. Emergency calls within a police force area should normally be routed to the appropriate police force by the telephone service operator, and every effort is made to ensure that this is the case.
<P>

<a name="10108w20.html_para1">I understand that problems may arise when mobile phones are used to make emergency calls. When an emergency call is made on an mobile phone the service provider identifies the location as precisely as possible and directs the call to the police area from which they understand the call to have emanated. If the signal is received in a different policing area, the caller may be put through to the wrong switchboard.
<P>

<a name="10108w20.html_para2">Although this problem is less likely to occur when calls are made on land-line phones, it may occur when calls are made from addresses on the borders between two police areas. When calls are routed to the incorrect switchboard for any reason, the protocol is that the receiving police force will take details and pass them to the appropriate force as quickly as possible. This practice has been developed over several years and normally works very effectively.
<P>

<a name="10108w20.html_para3">When a force is particularly hard pressed following a major incident, arrangements may be made for new emergency calls to be routed to a neighbouring force.

<P>
<a name="10108w20.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The national asylum support service does not hold information on the number of vouchers presented to shops participating in the voucher scheme.
<P>

<a name="10108w20.html_para5">At the end of November, the voucher supplier, Sodexho Pass United Kingdom Ltd. had issued a total of 4,247,819 vouchers, which included 390,017 of the &#163;10 vouchers, which can be exchanged for cash at the Post Office. By the same date, a total of 2,307,645 vouchers had been redeemed, including 210,521 of the &#163;10 cash-vouchers and a small number of vouchers from local authority schemes, which the voucher supplier does not distinguish from national asylum support service vouchers.




<P>
<P><I>8 Jan 2001 : Column: 421W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10108w20.html_para6">The substantial difference between the number of vouchers issued and the numbers redeemed is accounted for by the time lag between issue and redemption. Vouchers are valid for up to four weeks and retailers then have an additional four weeks in which to redeem them, so vouchers issued at the end of November will not necessarily be redeemed until the end of January. We would expect vouchers issued at the end of September to be redeemed by the end of November. At the end of September, 2,047,088 vouchers had been issued, including 189,536 cash vouchers.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the total cost was of early retirement and retirement on the ground of ill health to police authorities in <i>(a)</i> 1980, <i>(b)</i> 1990 and <i>(c)</i> the latest 12 months for which statistics are available; and for each of these years, what percentage of the final budget this cost accounted for.  [143881]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10108w21.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 There is no provision within the police pension scheme for officers to retire early with an actuarially reduced pension. Maximum pension benefits are payable on completion of 30 years' service and most officers retire having completed at least 30 years' service.
<P>

<a name="10108w21.html_para0">Officers may also retire with an immediate pension before completion of 30 years--or reaching compulsory retirement age--on the ground of ill-health. A police authority may retire an officer on that ground if he or she becomes permanently disabled from performing the ordinary duties of a police officer. The total cost of retirement on ill health ground to police authorities is not held centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

 The Insular Authorities in Guernsey are aware of their obligations under international conventions on discrimination and have undertaken, in a Billet d'Etat in September 2000, to propose legislation on race discrimination. My officials have recently met representatives of the Insular Authorities to discuss the form the legislation should take. The authorities have also prepared a draft sex discrimination law which is currently subject to consultation.

 The National Criminal Intelligence Service has received additional Government funding to run a project aimed at tackling organised motorcycle theft. Crime prevention messages specifically aimed at motorcyclists will be included in the next phase (starting in the next financial year) of the national vehicle crime reduction communications campaign. Local authorities now have powers to provide secure parking for motorcycles under the Road Traffic Regulations Act 1984 (as amended). The Vehicles (Crime) Bill currently before Parliament provides for statutory regulation of the motor salvage industry, which will help to prevent vehicles, including motorcycles, from being stolen to be broken up for spare parts or "rung" (ie taking on the identities of vehicles which have been written off in accidents).

<a name="10108w22.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Steinberg: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what percentage of offenders were convicted of further offences during the two year period after they have been released from prison in each of the last five years.  [143912]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10108w22.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Two-year reconviction rates for standard list offences following release from prison are shown in the table. The rates are based on a sample of all discharges from prison each year. The 1997 rate is based on a sample of discharges during the first quarter of the year.
<P>

<a name="10108w22.html_para0">About one percentage point of the increase in the rate between 1993 and 1994 can be accounted for by the addition of a number of offences to the standard list. The effect of this change in offence coverage was a little more pronounced on the rate for the 1995 and 1996 data (around 1.4 and 1.9 percentage points respectively).

 I refer the right hon. Member to the reply I gave him about Police Service and Prison Service expenditure in Wales on 30 November 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 927W.
<P>

<a name="10108w22.html_para1"><P>

<a name="10108w22.html_para2">In 1999-2000, revenue expenditure by police authorities on the police service in England, supported by Government grant was &#163;7,074.920 million, in cash terms. This is 94.96 per cent. of total police net revenue expenditure in England and Wales and &#163;142.20 per head of population in England. Spend on the Prison Service in 1999-2000, on other than the prisons in Wales referred to in the earlier reply and including all headquarters expenditure was &#163;1,791.685 million in cash terms. This represents 97.03 per cent. of the total Prison Service expenditure or &#163;36.01 per head of population in England.

<P>

<a name="10108w22.html_para4">The Government have made tackling racist crime a priority.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of <i>(a)</i> the level of cover provided by the fire service in Worcestershire and <i>(b)</i> the central Government funding available for this service; and if he will make a statement.  [144512]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10108w22.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The provision of fire cover is a matter for the local fire authority, in this case Hereford and Worcester Fire Authority, which was established on 1 April 1998 to cover the areas of Herefordshire district council and Worcestershire county council. Fire brigades are inspected periodically by Her Majesty's Fire Service Inspectorate. The most recent inspection of Hereford and Worcester was made in June 1999. A copy of the inspection report is held in the Library.
<P>

<a name="10108w22.html_para6">The Government have responded to fire service concerns about future funding pressures by increasing the fire service element of standard spending assessments (SSAs) in England by &#163;189.2 million over the next three years, including more than &#163;69 million for 2001-02. Planned credit approvals for the fire service in England and Wales have been substantially increased from their present level of &#163;35.7 million to &#163;59.7 million in 2001-02.
<P>

<a name="10108w22.html_para7">Hereford and Worcester Fire Authority received a 3.5 per cent. increase in its fire SSA for the current financial year. Its provisional fire SSA for 2001-02 is &#163;15.266 million, an increase of 2.4 per cent. I understand that the authority has made representations to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions about the level of its provisional SSA figure.

 Two-year reconviction rates for standard list offences following release from prison are shown in the table. The rates are based on a sample of discharges from prison each year. Rates for 1978 and 1979 exclude prisoners discharged from sentences of three months or less. Figures for 1987 onwards are not directly comparable with those for earlier years owing to a change in methodology used to calculate the statistics; if the old methodology were used it is estimated that these reconviction rates would be five to six percentage points lower. A change in the coverage of standard list offences has resulted in an increase in the reconviction rates for 1994 onwards by between one and two percentage points. The 1997 rate is based on a sample of discharges during the first quarter of the year.

<a name="10108w23.html_para1">Data are not collected centrally to enable reconviction rates for prisoners that have attained a degree while in prison to be calculated.

This information relates only to teaching provided by education providers in public sector prisons and does not include private study, distance learning or vocational training.

 The Department uses advertising on television and in various other media to inform the wider public about how they are affected by departmental legislation, about the availability of NHS services and also to effect attitudinal change in such fields as smoking and teenage pregnancies. Advertising is also used to support the National Health Service recruitment and retention programme.

<a name="10108w24.html_para9">During 2000, we have put arrangements in place through a phased roll out to extend this high-quality service to all urgent suspected cancer referrals. Head and neck cancers were included in the fourth tranche of the roll out which was introduced on 1 December 2000. Data on the number of oral cancer patients seen within two weeks of referral were not collected centrally in 1997, but arrangements are being put in place to monitor performance of the all cancer two week standard, including head and neck cancers, from 1 January 2001.

<a name="10108w25.html_para0">Beef from France may be imported into the United Kingdom under the rules of the single European market. It must have been produced in accordance with the requirements of the Fresh Meat Directive (Directive 64/433/EEC), and those of Commission Decision 2000/418/EC on specified risk material controls which came into effect on 1 October 2000. The European Commission is currently carrying out inspection missions to all member states to ensure that the European Union specified risk material controls have been fully implemented. In addition, under British law, the Fresh Meat (Beef Controls) (No 2) Regulations 1996, as amended, prohibit the sale for human consumption of beef from any animal aged over 30 months at time of slaughter. These regulations apply to imported as well as to home produced beef, with certain limited exceptions.

<a name="10108w26.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We are aware of the recent difficulties regarding the delayed discharge of patients from acute beds in York and North Yorkshire. We have recently injected a substantial amount of new money into the local health and social service systems which will enable agencies to work together to provide the appropriate levels of care for those who need it.

<P>
<a name="10108w26.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We have allocated &#163;62 million extra resources to health authorities to address winter staffing issues and support transitional or interim care to minimise "blocked beds" and prevent unnecessary emergency admissions. The money has been allocated on the basis of joint plans with social services. Each National Health Service region has appointed a team of change agents, including representatives of the independent sector, to target areas with (among other indicators) increasing delayed discharge rates and support them in achieving sustainable reversals to these figures.
<P>

<a name="10108w26.html_para13">The Northern and Yorkshire Region was allocated &#163;6.6 million in October for schemes to enhance capacity in intermediate care, transitional care and related cases. Of this, the North Yorkshire Health Authority received &#163;546,000 to facilitate discharges. More recently the North Yorkshire Health Authority received &#163;1.086 million for winter capacity and of this &#163;717,000 went to social care.
<P>

<a name="10108w26.html_para14">Additionally, the Department asked the Winter Emergency Services Team (WEST) to examine the situation in North Yorkshire. WEST visited the North Yorkshire Health and Social Care Community and York Health Services NHS Trust on 6 November and, while it made several suggestions for action, it found that systems and relationships were robust.

<a name="10108w26.html_para15">The ACNFP has also considered the practicality of post-market health surveillance for all novel foods, including GM foods. Based on their advice a feasibility study started on 1 July 2000, which will test the

 Aggregate data on numbers of incidents of methicillin resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) voluntarily submitted by National Health Service trusts for specialist microbiological tests since 1996 are shown in the table. These data are routinely available on a regional basis only. Data on <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> bacteraemias (blood infections) showing the proportion resistant to methicillin in England and Wales are published quarterly by the Public Health Laboratory Service in the Communicable Disease Report, copies of which are available in the Library. More comprehensive information about bacteraemias, including MRSA, will be collected from all acute trusts from 1 April 2001 and data will be published from 1 April 2002.
<P>

<a name="10108w26.html_para16">There are no centrally held statistics on deaths caused by hospital acquired infections (HAI), including MRSA. Different doctors will have different views on the role of HAI in a patient's death as MRSA infection can take the form of many different diseases from trivial skin infection to pneumonia or septicaemia. In addition, the causative micro-organism is often not specified on the death certificate.

1. For 1996 and the first half of 1997 data have been amalgamated to the approximate boundaries of the new Regional Office areas. This allows for comparison with subsequent years.<P>

2. An incident is three or more patients infected or colonised by the same strain of MRSA in the same month from the same hospital.<P>

3. The criteria for submission of isolates of MRSA (and other isolates of <i>staphylococcus aureus</i>) to the PHLS for specialist tests have been revised twice since 1996 (in January 1998 and in January 2000).<P>

4. These revised criteria have led to a fall in the number of incidents of MRSA that were reported to the PHLS. <P>

 No. While we recognise the important role that "very sheltered housing" plays in the provision of long term care, there will continue to be a need for good quality residential care.

<P>

<a name="10108w27.html_para7">A child may be on the register of more than one authority at a time if the protection of the child merits it. This may occur, for example, where the child is looked after by one authority but placed with foster parents in another authority, or where the child's family has moved between authority areas on many occasions.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if all bovine carcases imported from EU countries have been subject to post mortem tests of <i>(a)</i> brain tissue and <i>(b)</i> the central nervous system; and if he will identify those parts of the central nervous system that are tested.

<P>

<P>
<a name="10108w27.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 December 2000]:</i> Such testing has not taken place in the past. However, post mortem tests for BSE on bovine carcases aged more than thirty months and entering the food chain will be a Community requirement from 1 January 2001. When this requirement is implemented the tissues taken for testing will depend on which test is used. The validated tests available are Prionics and CEA tests on samples of brain or ENFER tests on cervical spinal cord. The carcases will be retained until the test results are known.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10108w27.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 December 2000]:</i> The preferred method of disposal for BSE suspects, offspring cull animals, and selective cull carcases is incineration at a commercial incinerator. However, prior to 1991, when there was insufficient carcase incinerator capacity, some were disposed of by incineration on waste ground or local authority site, incineration on farm, or burial on farm or on a local authority landfill site.
<P>

<a name="10108w27.html_para9">In the early stages of the selective cull, a large number of cattle had to be sent to OTMS plants for slaughter and the carcases disposed of by rendering prior to final incineration.
<P>

<a name="10108w27.html_para10">Up to 30 November 2000, the total number of cattle disposed of in anti-BSE measures is 4,364,664, of which 6,246 have been buried. The remainder were rendered or incinerated.

<P>

<a name="10108w27.html_para11">To date some 470,000 animals have been consigned for direct incineration under the over-thirty-month and selective cull schemes (SCS). The vast majority of animals, however, which have been processed under these two schemes have been slaughtered and rendered prior to final destruction by incineration.
<P>

<a name="10108w27.html_para12">There is no unit cost for disposal. It varies according to the charges at each incinerator and how far the carcase has to be transported.
<P>

<a name="10108w27.html_para13">The total disposal cost incurred between 1 August 1988 and 30 November 2000 is approximately &#163;711 million of which &#163;660 million has been spent on the slaughtering, transport and disposal of OTMS and SCS animals.

<a name="10108w28.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 December 2000]:</i> Flood defence is a devolved responsibility. No research has been undertaken to provide the information sought. However in 1995 MAFF commissioned the then Institute of Hydrology to provide estimates of potential flood risk areas in England and Wales. As part of this work, the Institute estimated the likely depths of flooding of land that would occur in a flood event with (a) an annual probability of approximately 1 per cent. and (b) an assumption that no flood defences were in place.
<P>

<a name="10108w28.html_para1">These estimated depths of flooding are based on theoretical models of flooding and on published information about ground levels. While they provide a general indication of the degree of risk it is important to note that they are based on the assumption that no defences are in place but, in fact, much of the land is defended.

 In the 12 months to 30 November 2000, payments for land in the UK in set-aside claimed under the Arable Area Payments Scheme (AAPS) totalled &#163;144,733,633, including the first two instalments of agrimoney compensation in respect of 1999.
<P>

<a name="10108w28.html_para3">It should be noted that under scheme rules claimants do not necessarily have to be land owners and that it is not possible to identify separately those who are. In addition, because of the timing of agrimonetary compensation and the fact that EU regulations allowed payments in 1999 to start one month earlier than in 2000, the total paid in this period may not be fully representative of similar periods at other times.

<P>

<a name="10108w28.html_para4">Cattle under 30 months of age enter the food chain only after stringent meat hygiene inspection in line with EU rules and after removal of any visibly infected parts of the carcase. This practice is of long standing, applies across the EU and is considered to pose no significant risk to consumers. The Food Standards Agency has the responsibility to advise Ministers if there are any food safety considerations raised by this policy and practice.

 The figures are set out in the table. They cover expenditure on: Arable Area Payments Scheme (cereals, oilseeds, linseed and protein), Sheep Annual Premium Scheme, Beef Special Premium Scheme, Suckler Cow Premium Scheme and Beef Deseasonalisation Scheme, and include both national and EU contributions. The major increase in expenditure in 1993-94 reflects the switch from price support to production subsidies in the MacSharry reform. The farming industry also benefits from higher food prices as a result of the CAP, which are paid for by consumers.

This provides for a transitional tariff quota regime for banana imports, leading to a tariff only system from 2006, with the Commission authorised to adopt implementing measures to manage the tariff-quota.

 In England, just under 19,800 producers submitted a 2000 Scheme year Suckler Cow Premium Scheme (SCPS) claim. Of these around 15 per cent. had received their first advance payments by 5 January.
<P>

<a name="10108w29.html_para8">Although the Citizen's Charter deadline for making advance payments is 6 March 2001, we fully expect that all producers who submitted a correctly completed claim will receive their advance payments during January. In addition, we have taken advantage of a very recently agreed Commission Regulation to make suckler cow advance payments at a rate of 80 per cent. of the total amount due, rather than the usual 60 per cent.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10108w29.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 No such assessment has been made. In response to points raised during the consultation process, the Chancellor announced in Budget 2000 that the rate of climate change levy (CCL) on liquid petroleum gas (LPG) would be reduced by half in recognition of its use in rural areas and to discourage fuel switching from LPG to more environmentally damaging fuels.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10108w29.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Combined heat and power (CHP) generation can make a valuable contribution to achieving emissions reductions and the Chancellor therefore announced in the pre-budget report 1999 that electricity generated in "good quality" CHP plant would be exempt from the levy. The majority of CHP schemes will be exempt from all levy payments on the fuel input and on the heat supplied. Qualifying electricity generation from CHP schemes will also be exempt from the levy where that electricity is consumed on site or sold directly to another customer.

<P>

<a name="10108w30.html_para1">

<BR>
The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions about the national minimum wage (NMW) and people aged 18 to 21 earning between specific hourly rates of pay (144111, 144114, 144112). I am replying in his absence.
<BR>
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has estimates of the number of jobs being paid below NMW rates (&#163;3.00 per hour aged 18-21 and &#163;3.60 per hour aged 22 or over) for Spring (March-May) 1998, 1999 and 2000. These are based on an improved methodology which uses data from both the New Earnings Survey (NES) and the Labour Force Survey (LFS).
<BR>
Using this methodology, ONS estimate that there were 1.5 million jobs in the UK paid at less than NMW rates in spring 1998.
<BR>
This estimate does not measure the number of jobs entitled to higher pay as a result of the NMW since it makes no allowance for wage inflation. For example, some people's hourly earnings might have increased to above the NMW rates between Spring 1998 and Spring 1999 without the implementation of the NMW. In addition, it is not possible from either the LFS or the NES to identify whether an individual is eligible for NMW rates. For example, it is not possible to identify people such as apprentices, those undergoing accredited training or those with accommodation supplied who are exempt from the NMW or are entitled to lower rates.
<BR>
Information on the number of 18 to 21 year olds earning between specific pay bands using the revised methodology is not currently available. However, this information for Spring 1998, Spring 1999 and Spring 2000 will be posted on the National Statistics website from 11 January 2001.
<BR>
No information is available on the number of people who would earn less than &#163;3.60 an hour in the absence of the NMW.

 Around 11 million winter fuel payments have already been made this winter and the latest information shows that 16,278 payments were made in the Vale of Clwyd to those entitled. However, we are still receiving, processing and making payments on claims for this winter, so figures are not exact.

1. Figures for the minimum income guarantee are based on a 5 per cent. sample and are therefore subject to a degree of sampling error.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Owing to very small sample sizes, reliable population estimates based on receipt of Severe Disablement Allowance do not exist.<P>

2. All figures are estimates and are taken from the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data set which is derived from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). The FRS does not include Northern Ireland, and 1998-99 is the latest year for which data are available.<P>

3. The estimates are sample counts, which have been adjusted for non-response using multipurpose grossing factors that control for region, Council Tax band and a number of other demographic variables. Estimates are subject to both sampling error and to variability in non-response. All numbers are rounded to the nearest 100,000 and proportions to the nearest per cent.<P>

4. The income measure used is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income (that is to say income that is adjusted to reflect the composition of the household).<P>

5. For those receiving disability benefits, no allowance has been made for the extra costs that may be incurred owing to the illness or disability. In these families, the measure of income may not be such a good guide to their living standards.<P>

6. The estimates are presented on both a Before Housing Costs (BHC) and an After Housing Costs (AHC) basis in line with HBAI conventions.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will make a statement on the impact on an individual's ability to claim the winter fuel allowance of being in full-time employment after the age of 60 years.  [143886]

<P>
<P>
<a name="10108w33.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Following the European Court of Justice ruling on the case of Taylor, in December 1999, we decided to equalise the age--at 60--from which winter fuel payments could be made. If we had equalised the age at 65, around 1 million women would have missed out.
<P>

<a name="10108w33.html_para2">To enable payments to be made from age 60 it was also necessary to remove the need to be in receipt of state retirement pension. Therefore payments are made to those entitled regardless of whether they are getting a social security benefit or whether they are in employment.
<P>

<a name="10108w33.html_para3">An information campaign, which aims to ensure that those eligible know how and when to make a claim--if they choose to do so--has been running from April 2000.

<sup>(55)</sup> The term 'life award' is a misnomer since such awards have always been subject to change on review if entitlement changes and are not therefore payable for life. A clarification, introduced by the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999, provides that such awards are now described as 'for an indefinite period' instead of, as previously 'for life'.<P>

1. Information is available only for cases where a review has resulted in a reduction in the award.

 My Department has not made a formal analysis of the impact of the performance of the Crown Prosecution Service on the overall time taken by the criminal justice system to deal with juvenile criminal cases. The Attorney-General has ministerial responsibility for the performance of the Crown Prosecution Service. We and Home Office Ministers are working closely with the Law Officers to ensure that practical measures are in place at local level which will reduce delay in dealing with young offenders, in particular persistent young offenders. In their joint letter of 30 November last year, to all Chief Constables, Chief Crown Prosecutors, Justices' Chief Executives, Circuit Administrators, Group Managers, Crown Court Centre Managers, Youth Offending Team Managers and Chief Probation Officers, the Lord Chancellor, Home Secretary and Attorney-General set out key items where effective local efforts by particular agencies and good joint working can make a real difference to reducing delay. The key items were identified as a result of ministerial visits to areas with a high caseload and work undertaken by consultants.
