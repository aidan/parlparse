 We are reviewing the arrangements for the transfer of Scottish Homes' houses in the light of the Government's commitment to give tenants choice in their landlord.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what plans he has to tackle homelessness in Scotland; and if he will make a statement. [2724]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70611w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Chisholm: </B> 
 A revised Code of Guidance on Homelessness will shortly be issued. It will give clear encouragement to local authorities that they should seek to secure, either at their own hand or from other housing providers, permanent rather than temporary accommodation for unintentionally homeless people in priority need. We have also allocated an additional &#163;1 million for the Rough Sleepers Initiative this year, bringing the total available funding to &#163;16 million over three years; and we are making available a further &#163;2 million as the first instalment in a new long term initiative to bring empty homes back into use. Subject to a satisfactory evaluation, we will make additional funding available to the Scottish Homeless Advisory Service to extend it throughout Scotland.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70611w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Chisholm: </B> 
 The Government are committed to mounting a concerted attack against the multiple causes of social and economic decline. For many, the best path out of poverty is work, where it is appropriate. Our New Deal initiative will give young people opportunities to do

so as part of our Welfare to Work programme. We also intend to provide help for people over the age of 25 who have been out of work for 2 years or more.
<P>

<a name="70611w01.html_para0">The Government's commitment is not restricted to those seeking work, but to all of the most deprived in our society. A significant way in which this is taken forward in areas with the worst concentrations of deprivation is through the multi-agency partnership approach to regeneration, established under Programme for Partnership, where comprehensive strategies are taken forward to improve the conditions in which local people live.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70611w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Chisholm: </B> 
 No subsidy is provided by either central or local government for scheduled air services to and from Islay.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70611w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. David Stewart: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what response the Government have made to the recommendations of the Pennington report. [3509]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70611w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 The Government accept all the recommendations in the final Pennington Report. We are fully committed to introducing the measures which we believe will help strengthen existing food safety legislation.
<P>

<a name="70611w01.html_para1">Central to the Pennington Report are the recommendations to license butchers who are handling raw and cooked meat to ensure adequate separation. The Government are actively considering the detail of these proposals and will shortly seek views from health professionals, consumer organisations and the trade on issues such as the premises to be covered, the degree of physical separation and on timescale for implementation. Final decisions on all these matters will have as its overriding concern the protection of public health.
<P>

<a name="70611w01.html_para2">The Government will also promote the introduction of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles into the meat production chain, from slaughterhouse to butcher shop. This internationally recognised approach to identifying and controlling food hazards will secure improved levels of food safety in the longer term.
<P>

<a name="70611w01.html_para3">As Professor Pennington has recognised, many of the recommendations will require careful development to ensure that they are effective when introduced. At the same time we are fully aware of the need to have the measures in place quickly to strengthen food safety and restore public confidence, particularly given the recent new outbreaks of E.coli in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="70611w01.html_para4">Finally, the Government wish formally to record its appreciation of the work carried out by Professor Pennington and the members of the expert group. Our acceptance of all the Group's recommendations illustrates our commitment that the safety of public health will be of the highest priority.

 My right hon. Friend has no plans to review police use of CS at this stage. In 1969, the then Home Secretary, my noble Friend Lord Callaghan, set up an inquiry into the medical and toxicological aspects of CS following its use in Londonderry. The report of the inquiry was published, in two parts, in 1969 and 1971 (Cm 4173 and Cm 4775 respectively). The possible use of CS cartridges and grenades by police forces as a last resort in dealing with serious disorder is the subject of confidential Home Office guidelines. The Home Office Police Scientific Development Branch reviewed all the available scientific data relating to CS which, along with advice from the Chief Medical Officer and the Ministry

<P><I>11 Jun 1997 : Column: 443</I><P>
of Defence, was taken into account by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) in deciding to recommend CS spray as an aerosol incapacitant for police defensive use. ACPO has provided chief officers with guidance on the use of CS spray, copies of which are in the Library. The use of any force by officers is governed by section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967, which provides that a person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime.

 No document falls due for transfer to the Public Record Office until it is 30 years old. The suitability of a document for selection for permanent preservation under the terms of the Public Records Act 1958 will be reviewed during that period. The Act does not require statistics to be kept in the form requested. To do so would incur disproportionate cost.

<i>Terms of Reference</i>
<BR>
The purpose of the review, to be submitted to the Paymaster General by 13 June, is to make recommendations as to how best to accelerate the flow of sound PFI (Public/Private Partnership) projects. Taking as its starting point the 12 point plan for partnership, published originally in Labour's Business Manifesto, it will address in particular:
<BR>
(i) The role that can best be played by a new public/private taskforce within the Treasury, reporting to the Paymaster General.
<BR>
(ii) The respective roles and effectiveness of the Private Finance Panel, the Executive to the Private Finance Panel and the departmental officials active in advancing partnership projects across the public sector.
<BR>
(iii) Generic obstacles to progress and recommendations for their removal in ways that maintain value for money as the litmus test for what is acceptable and what is not.
<BR>
(iv) The extent to which a lack of skills in the public and private sectors is a barrier to progress and what could best address that.
<BR>
(v) How best to learn the lessons of success (and failure) so that public and private sector practitioners do not constantly reinvent wheels.

Regarding (a) and (b), records passed to this Office in 1965 were subject to a fifty year rule. The thirty year rule came into force in 1968, under the Public Records Act 1967.
<BR>
Regarding (c) and (d), records passed to this Office could not as the same time have been 'retained' by government departments. Retentions were for specified periods, which were renewable.
<BR>
Regarding (e), 44 Cause Books of the Chancery Division of the Supreme Court (J 12), dating from 1939, were destroyed in 1972, following the recommendations of the Committee on Legal Records in 1966 (Cmnd 3084). In addition, items from among the War Office, Registered Papers, General Series (WO 32), dating from 1855 to 1925, were destroyed in 1967 following a re-review of the contents of the class, as were a small number of items from the War Office reports and Miscellaneous Papers (WO 33), dating between 1925 and 1930, in 1968.
<BR>
Regarding (f) and (g), no records passed to this Office in 1965 have been disposed of otherwise than by destruction, or are otherwise unaccounted for.
<BR>
Details of the records transferred to the Public Record Office in 1965 appear as appendix II to the Report of the Keeper of Public Records for that year, laid before Parliament in 1966.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what percentage and how many documents in 1996 he estimates were <i>(a)</i> passed on to the Public Record Office intact, <i>(b)</i> passed on to the Public Record Office in censored form, <i>(c)</i> retained by his Department in full, <i>(d)</i> retained by his Department in part, <i>(e)</i> destroyed, <i>(f)</i> otherwise disposed of, and <i>(g)</i> otherwise unaccounted for.

 No document falls due for transfer to the Public Record Office until it is 30 years old. The suitability of a document for selection for permanent preservation under the terms of the Public Records Act 1958 will be reviewed during that period. The Act does

<P><I>11 Jun 1997 : Column: 451</I><P>
not require statistics to be kept in the form requested. To do so would incur disproportionate cost. However, in order to comply with their duties under the Act, departments are obliged to make arrangements for the safekeeping of their records, with a view to their possible selection and transfer to the Public Record Office and eventual release to the public. The general arrangements for extended closure or retention of public records are set out in Chapter 9 of the White Paper Open Government of July 1993 (Cm 2290).

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what plans the Government have to extend the eligibility for civil legal aid to hearing before <i>(a)</i> industrial tribunals and <i>(b)</i> social security appeal tribunals; and if he will make a statement. [2843]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70611w04.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 There are no immediate plans to increase the scope of the legal aid scheme. There is to be a review of civil justice and legal aid and we will be able to consider the current scope of the scheme in the light of the outcome of that review.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70611w04.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The effectiveness of the Office for the Supervision of Solicitors is, in the first instance, a matter for the Law Society. My Department intends later this year to carry out the first review of the office of the Legal Services Ombudsman since it was established at the beginning of 1991.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70611w04.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 It is the courts not the Legal Aid Board that consider applications for legal aid in criminal cases. The Central Criminal Court granted legal aid in the case of Mr. Gokal. I obtained a report from the court about Mr. Gokal's application for legal aid in the light of the publicity following the jury's verdict in the case. I have since asked the Administrator at the court to review the court's procedures in relation to legal aid. I have also asked for all Crown Court centres to be alerted to the need for great care in the processing of applications for legal aid.

To ask the Secretary of State for National Heritage (1) if he will change the rules of the television licence concessionary scheme for retired persons in sheltered complexes with wardens to enable the concession to continue once granted in circumstances where the warden's hours of work are reduced; [2883]
<P>

(3) what plans he has to extend the television licence concessionary scheme to retired residents in sheltered complexes with wardens working on site for 16 hours each week. [2882]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70611w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Fisher: </B> 
 Entitlement to the concessionary television licence fee is linked primarily to the accommodation occupied and the way in which it is provided or managed, rather than being a personal and portable benefit. The requirement for qualifying sheltered accommodation to have a carer who either lives within the scheme or works on site for at least 30 hours a week is designed to limit the scheme to sheltered housing directly comparable to a residential home. The Government has no current plans to amend the concessionary licence fee regulations.

 In 1996 records for 1965 held by this Department were due for transfer to the Public Record Office in accordance with the Public Records Acts of 1958 and 1967. Ninety-seven per cent. of those records selected for permanent preservation amounting to some 636 feet were opened to public scrutiny. Figures on the number of documents involved are not kept owing to the disproportionate cost of keeping such statistics. 1.5 per cent. of these records were released with parts blocked out and a further 1.5 per cent. were withheld in their entirety. All withheld documents will be re-reviewed at intervals of not less than 10 years and will be released when their sensitivity is judged to have passed. The criteria for release are set out in the White Paper on Open Government of July 1993 (Cmd 2290).
<P>

<a name="70611w07.html_para0">This Department generally selects records for permanent preservation when they are 27 years old. In 1996 402 feet of records were selected for permanent preservation and 2,743 feet were destroyed. This destruction rate of 85 per cent. was unusually high owing to the volume of duplicated material between the files of the Colonial, Commonwealth Relations and Foreign Office in that year. No records were otherwise disposed of and all were accounted for.

 No document falls due for transfer to the Public Record Office until it is 30 years old. The suitability of a document for selection for permanent preservation under the terms of the Public Records Act 1958 will be reviewed during that period. The Act does not require statistics to be kept in the form requested. To do so would incur disproportionate cost. However, in order to comply with their duties under the Act, departments are obliged to make arrangements for the safekeeping of their records, with a view to their possible selection and transfer to the Public Record Office and eventual release to the public. The general arrangements for extended closure or retention of public records are set out in Chapter 9 of the White Paper Open Government of July 1993 (CM.2290).

<a name="70611w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 British Energy is responsible for meeting all the liabilities associated with its assets. There is no public liability for British Energy's current or historical operations. These liabilities will be financed by British Energy out of its own earnings and cashflow or through a segregated fund. The recently concluded contract for future AGR supplies potentially involves BNFL taking on liability for some of the waste arising from AGR reprocessing although the terms and value of the contract fully reflect this option.

 The Department is aware of the proposals of Professor Carlo Rubbia for the development of a nuclear waste burning reactor, generally known as an energy amplifier. The Euratom Scientific and Technical Committee, which has members from all the member states of the EU, has reported to the European Commission on the proposals, and the report will be published shortly. The conclusions, with which my Department concurs, are that it is unrealistic, on the grounds of both cost and technical risk, to pursue the whole system at once, but that there are several aspects which may merit further work at this stage.

 Many organisations involved in the Single Regeneration Budget Challenge Fund have asked about the Government's future intentions towards this scheme. There is a clear desire for a more strategic approach to regeneration initiatives and for a system which responds to need whilst keeping the innovation that was the result of the competitive process. In addition, therefore, to the interim arrangements which we have already announced for Round 4, my right hon Friend the Deputy Prime Minister announced on 3 June a comprehensive review of the Government's regeneration policies, which will include a review of the SRB Challenge Fund.

<a name="70611w09.html_spnew8"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 HFC-134a and other HFCs are greenhouse gases but do not damage the ozone layer. They have an important role to play in phasing out the use of ozone depleting substances controlled under the Montreal Protocol. The Government fully supports the concept of minimising emissions of HFCs and has voluntary agreements with the refrigeration, foam, fire, aerosols and vehicle air conditioning sectors to do so. Whilst the Government recognises that the responsible use of HFCs as replacements for ozone depleting substances can be justified, it is unlikely to be convinced that any new emissive applications of HFCs are necessary. Recent reports of plans to market self-chilling drinks cans, which would use and emit HFC-134a, are a very worrying development and the Government is urgently considering what action should be taken.

 Abstractions by water companies from aquifers and surface water sources have to comply with the maximum quantity and any other operational conditions specified in the licence for each abstraction. The Environment Agency has made plain that it will expect water companies to have in place a full range of demand management measures, including the imposition of hosepipe bans, before applying for variations in abstraction licence conditions under drought orders or permits.

 We do not collect information on wastage. Dentists are independent contractors and as such are free to choose the amount of work they carry out for the National Health Service. Their level of commitment to the NHS may vary for a number of reasons driven by personal choice and circumstances, including part-time working, early retirement and varying balance between private and NHS work.

<P>

<a name="70611w12.html_para11">Ivermectin is authorised in the EU for use in bovines, pigs, sheep and horses following thorough assessments of all required safety data by the Committee of Veterinary Medicinal Products (CVMP) in order to set a maximum residue limit (MRL).

<a name="70611w12.html_para13">The Veterinary Medicines Directorate tests for ivermectin in salmon under its non-statutory residues surveillance scheme.

The LOQ of the method used is 2 g/kg. None of the 415 salmon samples collected under the 1996 non-statutory programme contained quantifiable residues of ivermectin.

<BR>
I have been asked to reply to your question about the number of monkeys which have died since 1996 in Ministry of Defence research establishments since as Chief Executive of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) this matter falls within my area of responsibility.
<BR>
An essential but relatively small part of the work of DERA involves a number of experiments with animals, mainly rodents, in order to ensure that the protective measures provided to the Armed Forces are effective and safe.
<BR>
I can assure you that all experimental work is carried out in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. In compliance with this Act all animals used in scientific procedures are reported annually to the Home Office, the responsible authority for overseeing the implementation of provisions of the Act. The Home Office publish national annual statistics about the number of animal experiments in the UK in Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals in Great Britain.
<BR>
A very small number of non-human primates are used in essential DERA research work and a total of 14 monkeys were reported in the 1996 annual return to the Home Office as used in experiments and were, or will be, humanely killed in accordance with the provisions of the 1986 Act. The 1997 return has not yet been made. In recent years our figures have usually represented significantly less than 1% of the number of non-human primates reported as being used in scientific procedures.

<P>
<a name="70611w13.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Sector Ltd. does not hold a current licence for the exploitation of British Army parachute training items. The company terminated its previous licence by joint agreement on 8 May 1997 after many years in which no sales under the licence were reported to MOD. Accordingly, no special facilities are currently available to Sector Ltd. They will be accorded the same treatment as any other company approaching MOD for access to its facilities. No other company has been licensed by MOD to exploit the parachute training items formerly licensed to Sector Ltd.

 As at 31 March 1997, the most recent date for which figures are available, the Ministry of Defence held a stock of 65,800 Service families quarters in Great Britain of which 13,142 were empty. In addition, the Department has 3,059 families quarters in Northern Ireland of which 222 were empty.

<a name="70611w14.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 No document falls due for selection and transfer to the Public Record Office until it is at least 30 years old. The suitability of a document for permanent preservation under the terms of the Public Records Act, 1958, will be reviewed during that period. The Act does not require statistics to be kept in the form requested. To do so would incur disproportionate cost. However, in order to comply with their duties under the Act, Departments are obliged to make arrangements for the safekeeping of their records, with a view to their possible selection and transfer to the Public Record Office and eventual release to the public. The general arrangements for extended closure or retention of public records are set out in Chapter 9 of the White Paper on Open Government (Cm 2290) published in July 1993.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what percentage and how many documents in 1996 he estimates were <i>(a)</i> passed on to the Public Record Office intact, <i>(b)</i> passed on to the Public Record Office in censored form, <i>(c)</i> retained by his Department in full, <i>(d)</i> retained by his Department in part, <i>(e)</i> destroyed, <i>(f)</i> otherwise disposed of, and <i>(g)</i> otherwise unaccounted for.

<a name="70611w15.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ron Davies: </B> 
 No document falls due for transfer to the Public Record Office until it is 30 years old. The suitability of a document for selection for permanent preservation under the terms of the Public Records Act 1958 will be reviewed during that period. The Act does not require statistics to be kept in the form requested. To do so would incur disproportionate cost. However, in order to comply with their duties under the Act, departments are obliged to make arrangements for the safe keeping of their records, with a view to their possible selection and transfer to the Public Record Office and eventual release to the public. The general arrangements for extended closure or retention of public records are set out in Chapter 9 of the White Paper Open Government of July 1993 (Cm 2290).

Countryside and Agricultural Information Service (CAIS) and ESA Project Officers all promote the scheme. I estimate that 2.4 staff years are spent on this activity.

(16) As the reporting of cases by laboratories is a continuous process the level of completeness of the figures shown may vary. Data may include some GP referrals. The number indicated are patients identified with MRSA (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus). Only a proportion of these will have clinical illness (estimated at 50 per cent.) due to MRSA infection. The remainder will be carriers of the organism. Cases where the area of residence of the patient was not provided have been included with data for the Health Authority in which the reporting laboratory is located.<P>

 One of our key aims is rebuilding integrity in, and public support for, the Social Security system and the way in which public money is spent. Research by the Department indicates that we may be paying &#163;0.5 billion a year to people who are not entitled to receive it. We need to focus on those who are properly entitled to benefit.
<P>

<a name="70611w16.html_para0">This is why we have set up the Benefit Integrity Project. However, we do regard it as essential that disabled people are treated fairly and with respect, and in an unthreatening way. The administration of this programme is a matter for Peter Mathison, Chief Executive of the Benefits Agency. He will write to the hon. Member with further details.

<BR>
The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions about the Benefit Integrity Programme.
<BR>
The Benefit Integrity Project was set up in response to the recent Benefit Review of DLA. Over the next two years, specially trained staff will make enquiries by postal questionnaire or home visit in around 425,000 cases to establish whether Disability Living Allowance (DLA) is being paid correctly.
<BR>
The Benefit Integrity Project is a completely separate operation from the processing of new claims to DLA and as such, will have no effect on the staffing and delivery of the normal claims process.
<BR>
The Benefit Integrity Project is intended to confirm that the correct rate of benefit is in payment. Where it appears that the incorrect rate is in payment, the case will be passed to an independent Adjudication Officer to consider a review of the existing decision. Any new decision will be based on all the available evidence and where appropriate will lead to an increase in the rate of benefit. All new decisions will carry the normal rights to seek a further review or appeal.
<BR>
Visiting Officers for the Benefits Integrity Project will be drawn from existing experienced staff located at Disability Benefit Centres. If there is a need to transfer experienced staff currently processing claims to the Project, they will not be released until their 



<P>

It may help if I explain that at as you copied me your letter of 8 May to the Director of Disability Benefits, I arranged for the issues raised to be investigated. The acknowledgement letter of 12 May from the Disability Benefit Director should have advised you that I would be responding by 9 June and not by 27 May. Unfortunately this was a mistake for which I apologise. My reply was issued on 9 June. The Benefits Agency Business Plan states that the Agency will reply to MPs within an absolute target of 20 Working days from the date of receipt of the correspondence.
<BR>
Due to a reorganisation of the Disability Benefits Unit Official Correspondence Section, one of the direct line numbers, 01253 337792, was disconnected earlier this year. Immediate action was taken to amend existing stocks of stationery. Unfortunately this did not happen in the acknowledgement sent to you and I offer you my sincere apologies. I can assure you that procedures are in place to prevent a reoccurrence.

However, we will be looking closely at this and other areas of the Agency's operations over the coming months to consider whether improvements can be made.

 The Government will pursue policies to promote economic growth and job creation, and we will offer young people constructive alternatives to benefit. In particular, the New Deal is our pledge to 18-24 year olds who have been unemployed for over six months, to enable them to develop and realise their potential. They will be offered training and employment opportunities with employers, the voluntary sector and an environmental task force. I believe that both young people and industry will be keen to make the most of these new opportunities.

Friend the Prime Minister has said that the Framework Documents published by the previous administration and the Irish Government in February 1995 provide a reasonable basis for discussion, but these issues are all for consideration in the multi-party negotiations and can only be taken forward by agreement among the parties and subject to a referendum in Northern Ireland.

 BSE has been confirmed in a Highland cow born in Wales on 17 January 1994. This animal was two years and 10 months old when clinical signs were first observed. This is the first case of BSE in an animal born in 1994 but is unlikely to be the last as the risk of exposure through feed was not significantly different in the early months of 1994 compared with the closing months of 1993 when cases have already been confirmed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70611w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer given on 10 June 1997]:</i> The Over Thirty Months Scheme (OTMS) is a measure to protect public health, not to eliminate BSE. On the other hand, the selective cull is aimed at reducing the number of cases of BSE by culling cattle which as young calves may have been exposed to the same feed as animals that have already succumbed to BSE. We estimate that the selective cull might prevent a maximum of 1,500 confirmed cases of BSE up to the end of 1999. The OTMS might prevent between one third and a half of that number, although the number of animals slaughtered under OTMS is many times greater than under the selective cull.

 European law requires draft national legislation to be notified to the European Commission (and through them to other member states) to ensure that it does not introduce new technical barriers to trade. The Bread and Flour Regulations 1995 were a simplification of earlier Regulations. They did not introduce any new standards and at the time it was considered that they did not need to be notified.
<P>

<a name="70611w18.html_para3">However, the ECJ has recently ruled that even a simplification of existing Regulations should be subject to the notification procedure.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how many and what percentage of feed compounders currently list full ingredients when labelling animal feeding contents; and if he will make a statement. [2694]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70611w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 A survey by UKASTA, the trade association representing compound feed manufacturers, has indicated that around 90 per cent. of the animal feed manufactured by its members is now subject to full ingredient listing. The Government is continuing to monitor the situation and will take action if necessary.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what actions he plans to take to support <i>(a)</i> beef prices and <i>(b)</i> the beef production industry. [2530]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70611w19.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The current problems of the UK beef market are not simply the result of BSE, but reflect the fact that there is significant structural imbalance between supply and demand on the EU market. In discussion with Commissioner Fischler and representatives of other Member States on the Agriculture Council, the Government has repeatedly stressed that reform of the beef regime is urgently necessary to address that imbalance. In the meantime, we are urging the Commission to make progress towards lifting the export ban and to introduce controls on beef production in other Member States equivalent to those applied here. In the absence of agreement on such controls, we will not hesitate to take unilateral action to ensure that any beef imported onto the UK market and competing with the domestic product meets the same high standards as apply in the UK.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70611w19.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 All fresh meat produced in or imported into the United Kingdom must be produced in accordance with harmonised hygiene rules laid down in Council Directive 64/433/EEC (as amended). Also, meat derived from bovines which, at the time of slaughter, were more than 30 months old is prohibited under the Fresh Meat (Beef Controls) (No 2) Regulations 1996 for sale for human consumption unless it comes from animals covered by the Beef Assurance Scheme, or born, reared and slaughtered in those third countries specifically excluded by the Regulations where there is no known risk of BSE.
<P>

<a name="70611w19.html_para1">In addition, since 1989 there has been a requirement for specified bovine material (SBM) to be removed from bovine animals which have died or been slaughtered in the United Kingdom. SBM is currently defined in the Specified Bovine Material Order 1997 as the whole head (excluding the tongue), spinal cord, spleen, thymus, tonsils and intestines of cattle over six months old and the thymus and intestines of calves under six months. The SBM may not be used in food, animal feed, cosmetic, pharmaceutical or medical products. It has to be stained and disposed of under strictly controlled conditions.

<a name="70611w19.html_para2">On 5 June, following advice from the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, my right hon. Friend, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food announced the opening of consultations on an amendment to the 1997 Order, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>227-28</i>, which would extend these controls to imported beef, other than from those countries excluded by the Fresh Meat (Beef Controls) (No 2) Regulations 1996. This is not an import ban. We intend to implement these measures in late July if agreement to introduce similar Community-wide controls is not forthcoming by then.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70611w19.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Department has paid &#163;1,559,803 to date in respect of three outbreaks of Newcastle disease near Ross on Wye and &#163;21,235 for two outbreaks in Sussex which occurred during 1996-97.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70611w19.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The State Veterinary Service has conducted an epidemiological investigation into the cause of three outbreaks of Newcastle disease in Ross on Wye and one in Sussex which occurred in January this year. It has not been possible to confirm either a definitive source for the infection or how the virus had spread between premises. However, it is believed that the virus may have originated from migrating birds and was subsequently spread between premises by the movement of people, vehicles or equipment.
<P>

<a name="70611w19.html_para3">An outbreak of Newcastle disease in a pheasant farm in Sussex in May 1996 was attributed to contact with wild pigeons or doves which were infected with the PMV1 virus.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70611w19.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Yes. However, in cases where the parties are in dispute as to the apportionment of quota or where the Intervention Board has reasonable grounds for believing that a correct apportionment of quota may not have been made, the Dairy Produce Quotas Regulations 1997 provide for the matter to be referred to arbitration. Once the arbitrator has arrived at his decision on the appropriate apportionment, the quota register held by the Intervention Board will be amended, if required, in accordance with the arbitrator's findings.

 Where harmonised Community rules exist, imports must comply with the EU legislation designed to protect public and animal health.

 There is a great deal of circumstantial evidence that badgers are implicated in the transmission of bovine tuberculosis to cattle.
