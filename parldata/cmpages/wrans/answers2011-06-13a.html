 There is a robust statutory framework in place for managing the impacts of dry weather. Water resources legislation enables Government to manage water abstraction demands, taking account of water availability, and the needs of businesses, consumers and the environment. In addition, water companies prepare and maintain statutory drought plans that set out the actions they will take in response to drought in order to maintain the public water supply.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 9 June 2011]:</i> It is a crime to drop litter, and the offender can be prosecuted in a magistrates court and fined. Littering from a vehicle, especially when it is travelling at speed, presents particular difficulties for local authority enforcement officers in clearly identifying the offender.</p>

               <a name="11061316000238"> An amendment tabled during the Commons Report stage of the Localism Bill proposes to extend the scope of the current offence of littering to make the registered keeper of a vehicle criminally liable whether or not they were present or personally responsible for the littering. That approach raises serious concerns over fairness and proportionality.</p>

               <a name="11061316000239"> A key element in tackling litter is changing littering behaviour. That is why the Government are supporting, through their grant to the charity Keep Britain Tidy, the Love Where You Live campaign which draws together business, communities, local authorities and civil society organisations in partnership to secure a lasting change in behaviour. As part of this, we will be looking to work further with business and others to develop ways of tackling vehicle litter.</p>

This will result in a reduction in the cost of facility time from 2011-12 (an annual saving of £89,000).

Further work is planned to reduce the cost and streamline the management of trade union activity within DEFRA and its Agencies.

 The regulations transposing the revised Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC) in England and Wales came into force on 29 March 2011 and no assessment has yet been made of their implementation. Article 37 requires member states to submit reports on their implementation of the directive to the European Commission every three years and the first report must be submitted by 30 September 2013. The transposing regulations will be monitored in order to prepare that report and will be reviewed in the light of the report that is submitted.</p>

 We have no plans to introduce a statutory right of access to inland water for unpowered craft for recreational purposes. We are keen to achieve far greater levels of access to waterways for canoeists and other users by encouraging locally agreed, voluntary, access agreements. This fits very well with the big society agenda as it will give access where it is needed and meet the needs of all users and interested parties.</p>

 2 Signal Regiment conducted their Transfer of Authority on 15 January 2011. It is standard practice to stagger the arrival and departure of a unit's personnel to and from Afghanistan, in order to maintain operational capability, balance troop movements across theatre and aid in ensuring a smooth handover from one unit to another. Therefore, the unit requested their personnel be transported home on four flights, departing theatre on 14, 17, 19 and 21 January 2011.</p>

RDAs submitted their asset and liabilities plans to Government for approval on 31 January 2011. These plans have been drawn up and assessed, against the principle of achieving the best possible outcome for their regions consistent with achieving value for the public purse.</p>

The Government's view is that infrastructure investment should be primarily financed by the private sector and driven by commercial considerations. However, we acknowledge that there could be instances where market failures might justify the award of limited public funding for priority projects. It will, however, be important to ensure that criteria are agreed governing the award of any such funding so that it is properly targeted and does not displace commercial financing.</p>

 One of the primary objectives of the current review of feed-in tariffs is to ensure that the Feed-in Tariffs (FITs) scheme does not cost more to consumers than the amount set in last year's spending review (i.e. around £900 million over the period 2010-11 to 2014-15 in nominal undiscounted prices). This includes a saving of £40 million (around 10%) in 2014-15 compared with original projections carried out before the start of the scheme. It also represents a significant further saving compared with our estimation of likely spend in the absence of a review this year.</p>

 While the Homes and Communities Agency does not have specific targets, all providers bidding for funding to the Agency's Affordable Homes programme are required to submit an Employment and Skills Statement. Encouraging providers to support delivery of new jobs in this way is in line with this Government's belief that delivery is best optimised by reducing bureaucratic burdens and top-down targets to free up local partners, the private and the voluntary sectors to drive growth and opportunity. As result of the Homes and Communities Agency's investment programme, around 2,700 apprenticeships were created or safeguarded in 2010-11. A break-down by year for 2009-10 is not available.</p>

 The Department has made available grants of £20,000 to each Neighbourhood Planning Front Runner. These grants may be spent in any way that the recipient council considers appropriate in connection with delivering its project and this may include procuring support from the property profession. In addition, the Department will shortly award grants totalling £3.2 million to four organisations to enable them to provide advice, guidance and other support to community groups and individuals wishing to engage with the planning system. That may include advice, guidance and other support derived from the property profession. We would encourage property professionals and others to engage positively with the Front Runner project by contacting the relevant councils.</p>

 The Government have a long-standing policy of not making or facilitating substantive concessions to hostage-takers. We maintain this consistent policy because we believe that to make substantive concessions such as paying ransoms would reward the act of hostage-taking and encourage future kidnaps of British nationals. Although the payment of a ransom by a third party to a criminal gang is not illegal under UK law, the Government are firm that we do not, and will not, become involved in activity that could facilitate such a payment. Payment of a ransom to a United Nations designated terrorist group or individual would contravene the al-Qaeda and Taliban sanctions regime established by UN Security Resolution 1267 (1999).</p>

 It is a matter of public record that Libyan nationals were involved in fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. Throughout the time of British military engagement the information available suggests that the relative ease of travel to Iraq in particular meant that Libyan nationals contributed to the foreign fighting contingent in the country. UK and international partners have worked together over the last 10 years to ensure that foreign fighters from Libya and elsewhere could not travel with ease to Iraq or Afghanistan to enter into military action against British forces.</p>

 The number of reported disappearances has reduced significantly since the end of the military conflict in May 2009. However cases are still occurring. We are concerned that there has been little visible progress in investigating cases that took place before or after the war and the recent report by the UN Secretary General's Panel of Experts also recommends the Sri Lankan Government investigate and disclose the fate and location of persons reported as being forcibly disappeared.

R. 110(3) using a mobile phone while supervising the holder of a provisional driving licence to drive a motor vehicle on the road.
<sup>(2)</sup> The figures given relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offence for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences, the offence selected is the one for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.
<sup>(3)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.

 The Government have no such plans. It is not possible to disaggregate UK aid spending for safe abortion from wider expenditure on areas such as reproductive health care, maternal and neonatal health and health personnel development. This is because the Department for International Development (DFID) works to improve access to effective and integrated health services.</p>

 International food prices have increased significantly over the past nine months, reaching their highest levels since 1990, but the recent picture has been mixed. The Food and Agriculture Organisation's (FAO's) Food Price Index (FFPI) showed that a sharp increase in international grain prices in April more than offset declines in dairy, sugar and rice, while oils and meat prices were mostly unchanged.</p>

               <a name="11061330000042"> Local food prices follow global food markets, albeit with a slight time lag. Analysis of the domestic prices of staples in developing countries again shows a mixed picture. In Nigeria, prices of sorghum and maize in Kano, the main market of the country, rose by about 11% in March from the previous month. However, in Mozambique, prices of main staple maize declined markedly between March and April in all monitored markets reflecting the start of the 2011 harvest. In Malawi, prices of maize rose in March but are 50% below the levels of the previous year following the 2010 bumper crop and expectation of another good harvest in 2011.</p>

Food supply and prices are affected by a number of factors including global energy prices, global stock levels, the size of harvests, changes in exchange rates and national agricultural trade and marketing policies. On balance we are sceptical about the degree to which speculation has played a significant causal role. The Government continues to monitor relevant research in this area with interest.</p>

               <a name="11061330000079"> It is also important to note that trading in commodities markets plays an important role in providing liquidity (the volume of trades being made in a market) in these markets and that liquidity is essential to the effective functioning of these markets. Against the backdrop of climate change, and the possibility that international agricultural prices may become more volatile over time, the role of agricultural futures and options markets, and the liquidity they rely on, become more important.</p>

 Electoral registration officers (EROs) are under a duty to take all necessary steps to ensure an accurate and comprehensive register. The Electoral Commission is responsible for providing guidance to EROs. The Commission recommends that the electoral registration office and contact staff are trained to deal with inquiries from people who have low level reading and writing skills and suggests that EROs may want to produce easy-read literature to enable greater understanding of the registration process.</p>

 From April this year, in agreement with the General Practitioners Committee of the British Medical Association, we have amended the existing Directed Enhanced Service arrangements to provide practices with additional flexibilities for them to offer patients appointments at more convenient times to see a general practitioner or nurse within their practice. It is therefore now a matter for practices to consider and respond to meet their patients' expectations to be able to see a health care professional in their practice outside of normal opening hours.</p>

 The collection of data from the national health service is regulated by the process called review of central returns (ROCR) administered on behalf of the Department by the NHS Information Centre. This process was started by the previous Administration and continues under this Government. The ROCR process supports Government policy to minimise the burden to the NHS of central data collections. It ensures that collections fit with national health policies in England, requests for the same information are not repeated and NHS organisations can complete returns in as little time as possible. Information is collected for a number of purposes, notably accountability to Parliament, performance management of the NHS and informing policy developments.</p>

 As part of the Department's arrangements to keep the burden of data collection under control, all these returns were due for routine review or renewal in the period and no strong case could be made for retention. For some this reflected the intrinsically temporary nature of the original case. Others had been needed to monitor specific targets and policies that were no longer relevant. In the case of 18-week referral to treatment, the main return on which published National Statistics are based has been retained but a subsidiary Patient Tracking List return designed to support detailed performance management is no longer centrally needed.</p>

These measures include the use of antibiotic stewardship programmes to minimise the unnecessary use of antibiotics and thus reduce the selection pressure for resistance to develop accurate and prompt detection of resistant strains of bacteria and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus screening to reduce the risk of onwards transmission in hospitals and other settings. The Department's expert Advisory Committee on Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infection (ARHAI) undertake ongoing horizon scanning and advise on emerging problems: for example the committee recently issued guidance with the Health Protection Agency on the control of newer highly resistant carbapenemase producing bacteria such as those with New Delhi Metallo Beta Lactamase. The Department and ARHAI also actively promote good antibiotic prescribing.</p>

 In the European Union, genetically modified (GM) foods undergo a rigorous pre-market evaluation that includes the safety of components introduced into GM crops, such as Bt proteins. The safety of Bt proteins has also been assessed during the authorisation of pesticides that contain the bacterium <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i>. The assessment of the Bt proteins that are present in authorised GM foods is based on tests in animals and does not include human trials to examine whether the proteins pass into the blood supply. However, the available data from in vitro tests have shown that Bt proteins are rapidly broken down by digestive enzymes in the same way as most other proteins in the diet.</p>

If the finding is correct, the design of this study did not provide any evidence of the source of the protein, which is present in commercial pesticide preparations as well as in some GM crop varieties. The detection of trace levels of Bt proteins in people does not necessarily imply any risk to health.</p>

FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.
<sup>(2)</sup> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) contains records of all out-patient appointments, whether these are attended or not, or cancelled by either the hospital or the patient. For the purposes of this report, only attended appointments have been included. It should be noted that it is possible for an out-patient to have and attend more than one appointment in any given year, so this figure does not represent the total number of patients seen. Out-patient data are only available from 2003-04 onwards.

In these circumstances, the UK Border Agency will write to notify the individual affected and provide them with the opportunity to offer information that may inform the relocation arrangements. In a recent exercise involving the expiry of a number of accommodation contracts across the UK Border Agency, re-housing proposals which necessitate a change of schooling proceed only with the approval of the relevant regional director in the UK Border Agency.</p>

 People who are unemployed may claim a working age benefit (jobseeker’s allowance or employment and support allowance) and receive employment help from Jobcentre Plus until they become eligible for state pension. This year, we have given Jobcentre Plus staff more flexibility to help people find and keep jobs. We are rolling out a range of new measures aimed at getting Britain working, including Work Clubs to help jobseekers share skills or experiences and the new enterprise allowance for those considering self-employment. From this summer, the Work programme will provide personalised help for people unemployed for longer or who need early intensive support.</p>

               <a name="11061333000189"> The Government have introduced legislation this year to phase out the default retirement age (DRA), which will mean that employers can no longer retire people compulsorily at 65 years using the DRA. This change will help people to extend their working life until they become eligible for state pension, or beyond if they choose to. The legislation will still allow employers to use compulsory retirement ages, which can be earlier than 65 years, providing they can objectively justify it.</p>
