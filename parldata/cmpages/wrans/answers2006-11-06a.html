the context of achievements against the office&#146;s target of
securing for the taxpayer &#163;8 savings for every &#163;1 spent.
The auditors concluded that the National Audit Office was more rigorous
than any other similar organisation worldwide in the way in which it
measured, recorded and reported the financial impact of its
work.</p><p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="61106w0001.htm_para1"><a name="06110637000033">The Commission

the financial impacts achieved by the office and of its plans to
increase the target to &#163;9:1. I believe that the Comptroller and
Auditor General and the National Audit Office provide an excellent
service and excellent value for money for the

those vehicles so as to provide facilities for the stowage of a

it.</p><p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="61106w0004.htm_para3"><a name="0611072000236">The TPI schemes

research (by the Marine Biological Association/Cefas) on basking sharks
is using modern satellite telemetry to provide valuable information on
movements and behaviour of basking sharks in the north-east Atlantic.
Information uncovered to date on the geographical movement of
individual sharks suggest that despite making long-distance movements
they remain in the vicinity of the continental shelf around the UK,
Ireland and northern France. These findings have been consolidated with
sightings data from UK charities (MCS, IFAW, Shark Trust, Wildlife
Trusts, Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust) as part of a three-year
Esmee Fairbairn Foundation-funded grant to MBA. The project is bringing
together in a single database all recent data on basking shark
distribution and this means that it is now possible to undertake
comprehensive analyses of
trends.</p><p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="61106w0006.htm_para4"><a name="0611076000248">Nevertheless,
there is no current reliable population estimate for basking sharks in
UK (or the European) waters. This is due to the difficulties in
relating surface sightings to actual population size. While the broad
distribution patterns of basking sharks in UK waters are being
uncovered by sightings data, new research using telemetry data suggests
there are considerable differences in the density distributions of the
animal, with animals 60 times more likely to be at the surface (and
thus sighted) in mixed water fronts than stratified water fronts.
Genetic research is also under way to determine whether populations of
basking sharks are discrete or if there is population mixing between
the N-E Atlantic region and
elsewhere.</p><a name="qn_66"><a name="61106w0006.htm_wqn3"><p><a name="0611076000249"><b><a name="61106w0006.htm_spnew6"><a name="0611076001101">Joan

similar fuel duty incentive for bioethanol. These have led to a steady

two major biodiesel production plants in operation in the UK (the
ArgentEnergy plant near Motherwell and the Biofuels Corporation plant
in Teesside), which between them are capable of producing some 300
million litres of high quality biodiesel a year, some of which is
exported. A number of other biodiesel plants are at the planning and

due to come on stream in 2007. No bioethanol is yet produced in the UK,

The postcode of the dental practice was used to allocate dentists to
specific geographic areas. PCT and strategic health authority (SHA)
areas have been defined using the Office for National Statistics all

directory.<br>2. The data
in this report are based on NHS dentists on PCT lists. These details
were passed on to the BSA who paid dentists based on activity
undertaken. A dentist can provide as little or as much NHS treatment as
he or she chooses or has agreed with the PCT. In some cases, a NHS
dentist may appear on a PCT list but not perform any NHS work in that
period. Most NHS dentists do some private work. The data do not take
into account the proportion of NHS work undertaken by
dentists.<br> 3. PDS
schemes had varying registration periods. To ensure comparability with
corresponding GDS data, PDS registrations are estimated using
&#147;proxy registrations&#148;, namely the number of patients seen
by PDS practices in the previous 15 months. PDS proxy registrations
were not estimated for periods before September 2003&#151;actual
registrations were used before this
