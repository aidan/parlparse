To ask the Solicitor-General what percentage of documentation used by his Department is <i>(a)</i> made from recycled paper and <i>(b)</i> collected for recycling.  [111611]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 In the Crown Prosecution Service, 100 per cent. of paper and documents procured and specified for use by the CPS are recycled. It is assessed that 80-85 per cent. of waste paper, documents and card is presently collected for recycling.
<P>

<a name="00228w01.html_para4">The use of recycled paper in the Treasury Solicitor's Department and Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers is not quantified, but staff are encouraged in both departments to use electronic media where possible, to save paper by double sided printing and to place used paper in bins for recycling.
<P>

<a name="00228w01.html_para5">The Serious Fraud Office does not currently use recycled paper for its documentation, because of problems experienced in trials to date. It does seek to maximise the recycling of waste paper, but cannot quantify its use of recycled paper as a percentage of total paper used. It is anticipated that the amount of paper consumed within the department will be reduced with the developing use of electronic media for the transfer of cases to the Crown court. Two cases have been successfully transferred in this way so far, and, principally through the implementation of the DOCMAN project, it is hoped to build on these numbers.

[110200]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The A3 Hindhead study is expected to report in autumn 2000. The Regional Planning Body will advise the Secretary of State on the way forward in the light of 



<P>
<P><I>28 Feb 2000 : Column: 3W</I><P>
the study's conclusions and recommendations. The cost of the bored tunnel solution was estimated at the time of the Roads Review as being &#163;110 million. Sufficient funds have been put aside from the Highway Agency's budget to cover the cost of the current study. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has no plans to include a local planning conference as part of the study process. However, the study is to be undertaken in an open and inclusive manner ensuring that the voice of the local community and other interests are heard. My right hon. and noble Friend the Minister for Transport met the right hon. Member on 13 September, when they discussed all the principal issues associated with the problems on the A3 at Hindhead. He undertook to visit the area when his diary permitted.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what monitoring of key pollution indicators takes place at sites within the Yeovil constituency; and if he will make a statement. [110804]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 My Department published a set of indicators for a strategy for sustainable development for the UK last December <sup>1</sup> . In that report, almost all of the environmental indicators are presented at a national level and there are only a few which are based on site information. One of these is the water quality headline indicator of rivers of good or fair quality (H12) which is derived from measurements at thousands of river quality monitoring sites across the UK. The location and quality of water at sites in the Yeovil area can be found in the "What's in your backyard" section of the Environment Agency's website <i>http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk</i>.
<P>

<a name="00228w01.html_para6">This section also shows the location and emission details of sites which are regulated by the Environment Agency under the integrated pollution control regime. Data on emissions for these sites and large combustion plants are used in the compilation of the indicator of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions (P3). The National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory can be found at the following web address, which is funded by my Department. The address is:
<i>http://www.aeat.co.uk/netcen/airqual</i>
<P>

<a name="00228w01.html_para7">The headline air quality indicator of days of moderate or higher air pollution (H10) and the indicator of concentrations of selected air pollutants (P1) are based on data from air quality monitoring sites, but there are no pollution monitoring sites funded by my Department within the Yeovil constituency. Monitoring does take place in the wider region of South-West England and further information can be located under the "Frequently Asked Questions" section at the following web site address funded by my Department. The address is: <i>http://www.aeat.co.uk/netcen/airqual</i>
<P>

<a name="00228w01.html_para8">Part IV of the Environment Act 1995 requires local authorities to review and assess the current and likely future air quality in their areas. Where a local authority considers that one or more of the air quality objectives, as prescribed in regulations, is unlikely to be met by the required date, it must declare an air quality management area, covering the area where the problem is expected. It must then draw up an action plan setting out the measures it intends to take in pursuit of the air quality objectives in 



<P>
<P><I>28 Feb 2000 : Column: 4W</I><P>
the area. The Secretary of State has reserve powers to require local authorities to take action where they are failing to make sufficient progress.
<P>

<a name="00228w01.html_para9">The Yeovil constituency is covered by South Somerset District Council, who are working with three other authorities, Mendip, Taunton Deane and West Somerset, on a joint air quality review and assessment in their areas. They submitted a Stage 1 report to the Department for consultation in February 1999. South Somerset have indicated that the area of Yeovil has been identified as having potentially significant sources of nitrogen oxides and this will be investigated further in their Stage 2 report, which they are currently working on.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what plans he has to encourage people in rural areas to use public transport;  [110776]
<P>
<UL>(2) what plans he has to improve access to bus services in rural areas.  [110777]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Government are committed to improving bus services in rural areas. The 1998 Budget provided an additional &#163;50 million a year for three years for rural public transport in the UK as a whole. This was increased by &#163;10 million a year for 1999-2000 and 2000-01 in the 1999 Budget.
<P>

<a name="00228w02.html_para0">In England, the majority of this funding, &#163;32.5 million per year, is being allocated to local authorities through the Rural Bus Subsidy Grant. Over 1,800 new and enhanced bus services were supported in the first year. We have also given support to 104 innovative rural transport schemes, totalling some &#163;28 million, from the Rural Bus Challenge competitions. There will be at least one further Challenge competition.
<P>

<a name="00228w02.html_para1">Rural areas also receive assistance for public transport, including modes others than bus, through two schemes administered by the Countryside Agency. The Rural Transport Partnership scheme provides support for partnerships between the public, private and voluntary sectors to develop and implement transport strategies for rural areas. The Rural Transport Development Fund encourages the provision of innovative solutions to local transport needs in rural areas, meeting the start-up costs of new services and providing revenue support to services in danger of being lost.
<P>

<a name="00228w02.html_para2">The Transport Bill now before Parliament contains a range of measures to ensure that public transport plays its full part in an integrated transport policy, in town and country alike.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the steps taken by Thames Water to prevent leaks, with particular reference to the timescale for changing all lead pipes in street areas <i>(a)</i> in Leyton and Wanstead and <i>(b)</i> elsewhere in London, including those from mains to house stop-cocks; if he will indicate for each London constituency the amount of such piping which is deemed to need changing; how much Thames Water (i) has spent on this in each of the last five years and (ii) it is committed to spend in the next five years; and if he will break down (i) and (ii) by (1) Leyton and Wanstead and (2) other London constituencies; what incentives Thames Water provides to home owners to change old pipes; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="00228w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The new Drinking Water Directive (98/83/EC) tightens the standard for lead in drinking water from its current 50g/l to 25g/l by 25 December 2003 and to 10g/l by 25 December 2013. Where action is necessary to meet these standards, water companies will first treat water to reduce its ability to dissolve lead from pipes, or will optimise that treatment where it is already in place. Replacement of company lead pipes will be needed where water treatment fails to achieve the standards--mainly in soft-water areas. This will become fully apparent only after optimised treatment has been in place for some months. Water companies have no 



<P>

responsibilities for the pipework within the property boundary, which will remain the responsibility of property owners.
<P>

<a name="00228w02.html_para4">Thames Water has met targets for leakage reduction for 1997-98 and 1998-99, reducing leakage over that period by 29 per cent. Under targets set by the Director General of Water Services, this should be reduced by a further 24 per cent. by March 2001.
<P>

<a name="00228w02.html_para5">Information about spending on leakage and lead pipe replacement is not publicly available, and would need to be requested from Thames Water. However, in Ofwat's publication, "1998-1999 Financial Performance and Expenditure of the water companies in England and Wales", Table 26 states that a total of 86,850 communication pipes were replaced by Thames between 1990-91 and 1998-99.

<a name="00228w02.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 About 99 per cent. of all printing procured through my Department's Print Procurement Unit is on recycled paper, containing at least 75 per cent. post consumer waste. Use of recycled paper by staff generally reached 50 per cent. in 1998-99. Recycling schemes now cover 80 per cent. of staff. Further action is planned to increase the use of recycled paper and to promote improvements in recycling paper and other items.

<UL>(2) what assessment he has made of the <i>(a)</i> advantages and <i>(b)</i> disadvantages of completely electrifying the main rail connection between London and Dublin via Holyhead.  [111430]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The possibility of electrifying the North Wales line was investigated as part of the plans for the West Coast Main Line upgrade and it was considered that the expense of doing so could not be justified by the current or potential rail traffic over this line. Railtrack are committed to work which will increase the line speed considerably and some of this work has already been carried out. Both First North Western and Virgin Trains, who are the main operators over this route, are in the process of introducing new rolling stock, with tilting technology in the case of the Virgin Trains, and this will enable the line speed to be raised to between 90 and 100 mph over many sections.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The requirements for aircraft approaching Heathrow Airport to land are specified in the Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP).
<P>

<a name="00228w02.html_para6">Aircraft approaching Heathrow to land from the west are individually directed by air traffic controllers at West Drayton, and for noise mitigation purposes may not descend below an altitude of 2,500 feet before being established on the Instrument Landing System (ILS) localiser, which corresponds to the extended runway centreline. The ILS also includes a radio signal describing a 3o final approach descent gradient (or glidepath) along the extended runway centreline. The ILS glidepath reaches an altitude of 2,500 feet at approximately 7&#189; nautical miles (nm) from touchdown. At night (between 2300-0700 local time) aircraft are required to intercept the extended runway centreline no closer than 10 nm from touchdown (approximately 3,000 feet). In general, the altitude of an aircraft on final approach to Heathrow would be ca. 6,000 feet at 20 nm out, ca. 4,500 feet at 15 nm out, and ca. 1,500 feet at 5 nm out.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w02.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Government's policy on application of the precautionary principle is based on the Rio Declaration, and is set out in Chapter 4 of the Strategy for Sustainable Development for the UK, "A better quality of life" (page 23), a copy of which can be found in the Library of the House.

<P>

<a name="00228w02.html_para7">A better quality of life specifies the precautionary principle as one of the 10 guiding principles and approaches that the Government will take account of in policy development. Based on the Rio Declaration definition, the Government's definition makes it clear that precautionary action requires assessment of the costs and benefits of action, and transparency in decision making. It also sees precaution as being relevant beyond environmental damage, to include affects on animal and human health.

 The Highways Agency is responsible for the purchase of land under blight and compulsory purchase provisions, and it retains the ownership of all land and properties needed for the BNRR scheme.

 We will be considering the future of the consultation duty under the Local Government Finance Act 1992 as we develop proposals on the local authority-business partnership arrangements that will be required before local authorities can raise a supplementary local rate.

 The National Conditions of Carriage, overseen by the Rail Regulator, govern all rail journeys regardless of the train operator involved. In addition, train operators are required by their franchise agreements to publish a Passenger's Charter, which provides compensation for passengers whose journeys are delayed for reasons within the control of the industry. The arrangements for compensation must be no less favourable than they were under British Rail.

 No central records of the use of such notifications are kept. However, given the nature of most of the Department's research, the numbers will have been very small. The standard contract does not give the Department powers to prevent public statements by contractors unless such a statement would jeopardise the commercial exploitation of intellectual property. As is made clear in clause 15.5, the purpose of clause 15.3 is to ensure that the Minister has prior knowledge of a statement being made on a potentially sensitive matter relating to research which he is funding.

No standards have been set in relation to the adventitious presence of such material, although EU legislation provides a procedure for a maximum limit to be determined.
<P>

<a name="00228w05.html_para1">UKROFS has established a working group to consider how best to reflect in UK standards the provisions of the EU regulation on the presence of GM material in organic produce. It is also participating in discussions between the organic and GM sectors under the chairmanship of MAFF officials with a view to identifying practical means of protecting the interests of both. These discussions are addressing questions relating to the separation of GM and organic crops and are taking account of research on cross-pollination by insects and bees.

Schemes to recover waste paper are in place at over 95 per cent. of the Ministry's (including its Executive Agencies') key sites (those where there are over 50 staff) covering approximately 95 per cent. of staff.

 Breeding companies select for a wide range of traits and I am aware of no evidence to suggest that leg strength is not accorded sufficient priority. However, since the Farming Animal Welfare Council reported on broiler welfare in 1992 we have taken a range of measures to address leg weakness, including an extensive research programme and improved training for veterinarians conducting welfare inspections. The industry itself is conducting a survey of leg health, the results of which it is reporting to the Farm Animal Welfare Council.

 The Ministry has had a policy since 1993 to substitute the use of peat with suitable alternative organic wastes such as compost, manure, leaf mould, bark chippings or coir. Advice on how to replace or minimise the use of peat has been circulated to all MAFF sites. The policy was updated in June 1999 and applies to all sites where the Ministry is responsible for grounds maintenance, including those of its Executive Agencies. We will be using the Green Ministers' Biodiversity Checklist (which encourages the use of peat substitutes and which is due to be published early in March) to raise awareness and to reinforce further our policy. The Ministry has specification clauses included in its contracts covering this issue.

 A large number of representations has been received from Members of Parliament, industry organisations, individual meat plant operators, farmers, consumers and others about the cost burden facing the UK meat industry in comparison with that in other member states.




<P>
<P><I>28 Feb 2000 : Column: 21W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00228w06.html_para1">The Government have, on a number of occasions, made clear to the European Commission its concerns over the lack of transparency in the charging arrangements applied in other member states and its doubts as to whether such charges are being set on a common basis throughout the European Union, in accordance with Community Law.
<P>

<a name="00228w06.html_para2">We have passed to the Commission copies of both our own survey of meat inspection charges in other member states and the Meat and Livestock Commission's report on meat inspection charges and other enforcement costs. These have been published and copies are available in the Library of the House. My right hon. Friend the Minister and officials continue to press the Commission to carry out a thorough investigation of the way in which the EU Charges Directive has been implemented in all member states and to establish the level of inspection charges in each country.
<P>

<a name="00228w06.html_para3">At the same time, the Government do recognise the difficulties faced by the industry and has acted on the concerns of the meat industry over the impact of increased inspection costs. As the hon. Member will know from my right hon. Friend the Minister's announcement on 20 September 1999, charges for Specified Risk Material controls will now not be imposed before 2002-03 at the earliest. In addition, on 1 December 1999, he announced that Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) hygiene inspection charges for the whole of 1999-2000 were to be held at the level fixed for 1998-99. This will result in a saving to the meat industry of some &#163;7 million in charges in 1999-2000. We also gave a commitment that the rates of MHS hygiene inspection charges in 2000-01 will not rise by more than the rate of inflation above the levels charged in 1999-2000. These measures represent a considerable cost saving for plant operators.
<P>

<a name="00228w06.html_para4">The cost burden faced by the industry was one of the main issues considered by the Meat Industry Red Tape Working Group, whose report was published on 13 December 1999. Of its 35 recommendations, 32 have been accepted, or are under further consideration, including the establishment of a small task force to explore all the issues surrounding a "capping" approach to charging. This is being pursued urgently.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what steps he has taken to ensure that paper and timber products purchased by his Department come from a sustainable source.  [110147]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Ministry's Greening Operations Strategy, which was updated and re-published in June 1999, has among its key aims to conserve resources and minimise waste by reducing the use of materials from non-renewable resources and to ensure that any products derived from nature, such as paper and timber, are derived from sustainable resources and comply with EU and international trading agreements such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).




<P>
<P><I>28 Feb 2000 : Column: 22W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00228w06.html_para5">To help meet these aims the Strategy includes objectives to use recycled paper comprising genuine post-consumer waste and to ensure that any virgin pulp used in its manufacture comes from sustainably managed woodlands. It also, for example, requires the introduction of procedures to ensure as far as possible that timber and timber products come from sustainable resources by requiring documented proof or, if available, independent valuation under an internationally recognised certification or ecolabelling scheme.
<P>

<a name="00228w06.html_para6">As part of continuing efforts to raise awareness and promote best practice across Government the Ministry is represented on inter-departmental groups concerned with the procurement of timber and paper and, in addition, is a member of The Sustainable Office Forum which is a cross-industry group interested in improving ogranisations' environmental performance through consideration of issues in forestry papermaking, recycling and printing.

<a name="00228w07.html_para1">Responsibility for approving countries from which poultry meat may be imported into the European Community, and for collecting information on practices within those countries to aid decisions on approval, rests with the European Commission. In deciding whether to approve countries, the Commission must, in particular, take account of information on the state of health of the livestock, other domestic animals and wildlife; the provision of information on incidence of certain diseases; the country's rules on disease prevention and control and how these are organised and implemented; the structure of the veterinary services; and legislation on the use, authorisation, distribution and marketing of substances which might be administered to livestock. The quality of feedstuffs used is not a specific consideration.

 The Ministry's policy on all slow renewables such as peat is to substitute them with suitable organic wastes such as compost, manure, leaf mould, bark chippings or coir. This policy is included in MAFF's Greening Operations Strategy, which was updated and reissued in June 1999.

 None. Although we are pleased that members of the Air Training Corps (ATC) often go on to become high quality recruits for the RAF, the ATC is a national youth organisation, not a recruiting agency of the RAF.

 Although the Air Training Corps (ATC) is not a recruiting agency, it is an important source of high quality recruits for the RAF. 16.1 per cent. of the overall intake during Financial Year 1998-99 were ex-air cadets, as the table shows.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>On the question of contractual provisions in the event of US withdrawal from the programme, the collaborative arrangement with the United States on the TRACER programme is governed by a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). Whilst the framework of the MoU allows for the programme to progress through to a Production Phase, neither the UK nor US Government has made any formal commitment beyond the current Project Definition phase. Accordingly, compensation would not be payable should either nation decide not to proceed beyond the current phase. However, as is normal for collaborative programmes, provisions have been made in the MoU which would allow the remaining nation to continue to the end of the current phase in the event that either partner withdraws prior to completion of it. Specifically the MoU requires that <i>'The terminating Participant will pay all Contract modification or termination costs that would not otherwise have been incurred but for the decision to terminate'.</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>On the question of whether the United Kingdom will continue with the development of the TRACER system if the United States ceases to participate, I should confirm that the Project Definition phase, a phase to which the United States and the United Kingdom remain committed, is not due to finish until July 2002. At the end of the Project Definition phase, the programme will be formally reviewed, taking account of all relevant factors, before a decision on how the TRACER requirement might be pursued is made.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>On the question of programme costs, UK expenditure to date on the TRACER programme is around &#163;39M. We currently estimate the overall cost to the UK of the Project Definition phase to be &#163;130M.</FONT></UL>

 Files are stored in the Ministry of Defence archives in a variety of means, generally, by date of review and, within that, by branch. This method of storage ensures that a systematic review programme, consistent with the procedures recommended by the Public Record Office, is in place. On review, records are assessed on the basis of continuing administrative and potential historical value. Records falling into the latter category are transferred into the custody of the Public Record Office and generally become available to researchers after 30 years, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Records Act, 1958 and 1967.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what progress there has been in the National Radiological Protection Board study on the incidence of multiple myeloma among UK nuclear test veterans.  [111689]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w10.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 I am pleased to report that work on the study into the incidence of multiple myeloma in the nuclear test veteran population is under way. The first meeting of the independent Oversight Committee took place on 8 November 1999, at which matters such as methodology, scope and timetable were agreed. An observer from my Department and another from the British Nuclear Test Veterans' Association were present. It was originally intended that the study should examine only the incidence of multiple myeloma. However, the Oversight Committee has recommended that, as the information will be available, the scope of the study should be extended to cover other causes of death and other forms of cancer. My Department accepts this recommendation.
<P>

<a name="00228w10.html_para3">The National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) have begun to gather the necessary data from military and other national records and the data collection phase is expected to complete by the middle of this year. Thereafter, the data will be validated and analysed. The NRPB report will then be peer reviewed and the findings published early next year in a suitable scientific journal. This is slightly later than was first envisaged and is due essentially to the NRPB's existing commitments and the time taken to constitute the Oversight Committee.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what conclusion investigators reached about the possibility of an unforeseen technical malfunction that would not have left any physical evidence as having occurred in the final flight of RAF Chinook ZD576 on 2 June 1994.  [108759]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The initial stage of the Board of Inquiry acknowledged that an unforeseen technical malfunction, which would not necessarily have left any physical evidence, was a possibility and could not be discounted. They concluded however that technical failure was unlikely to have been the direct cause of the accident, although they considered it possible that a technical malfunction or indication could have provided a distraction to the crew.
<P>

<a name="00228w10.html_para4">None the less, after careful consideration of all the available evidence the RAF Board of Inquiry concluded that the most probable cause of the accident was that the crew selected an inappropriate rate of climb to safely overfly the Mull of Kintyre, and the actions of the crew were thus held to be the direct cause of the crash.

<a name="00228w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 February 2000]:</i> For strictly planning purposes we have assumed that a Public Private Partnership for the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency will generate a credit to the Defence Budget; the actual size of any credit will ultimately depend on the PPP option chosen.

 The Government believe defence exports foster a healthy, technologically capable and competitive UK Defence Industry. Competition for defence contracts has helped to stimulate efficiency in UK firms to the benefit of our own defence needs while enhancing their ability to innovate and compete successfully in international markets. Defence exports can also contribute to international stability by strengthening bilateral and collective defence relationships. MOD officials are currently working, with independent academic support, on an assessment of the costs and benefits of defence exports to the UK for completion later this year.

<P>

<a name="00228w10.html_para5">The equipment being supplied to units in the Balkans will mostly be installed in fixed locations and will provide a wide area network in support of peacekeeping operations. BOWMAN has a much wider scope. It seeks to provide mobile, tactical, war-fighting communications, to a military specification, for use by all three Services. In order to be suitable for a hostile environment, the BOWMAN military communications system must be capable of operating without being dependent on a fixed, static infrastructure.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hanson: </B> 
 In February 1997, the Welsh Office set up the Resource Allocation Working Group (RAWG), comprising Welsh Office officials and NHS representatives. The purpose of the group was to evaluate the existing formula for allocating health resources and, if appropriate, recommend an alternative method.
<P>

<a name="00228w12.html_para0">The group took account of many factors and recommended that a modified version of the English Department of Health method should be used. This method took account of socio-economic variables.
<P>

<a name="00228w12.html_para1">Following this an analysis was undertaken to quantify the financial impact of applying the RAWG recommendations and it became apparent that it would exacerbate the financial problems faced in the NHS. At the same time the Department of Health announced a review of the English formula. In view of that, changes were postponed.
<P>

<a name="00228w12.html_para2">Since 1 July 1999, the responsibility for the allocation of health funding has become the responsibility of the National Assembly for Wales, and I understand that they have recently decided to set up a technical group and a steering group to review the NHS revenue allocation formula.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The provisions of the Convention as a whole are relevant to our consideration of ECGD support for the Ilisu dam. The UN Convention has yet to enter into force.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 ECGD seeks the views of DFID and other interested Whitehall Departments (including FCO, DTI and DETR) as appropriate when considering applications for export credits cover. This is in order to ensure consistency of policies, for example the White Paper on International Development makes it clear that the full range of the Government's policies affecting developing countries, including environment, trade, investment and agricultural policies should take account of its sustainable development objectives.
<P>

<a name="00228w13.html_para1">The consultation between ECGD and the Department for International Development (DFID) is carried out in a number of ways. DFID is a member of the Export Guarantees Committee and in this capacity sees high value applications for ECGD support in certain markets as a matter of course. DFID are also involved in assessing the productive expenditure implications of all applications for ECGD support for business in Heavily Indebted Poor Countries and countries who are eligible to borrow from the World Bank on International Development Association terms.
<P>

<a name="00228w13.html_para2">With regard to the Ilisu project, at the beginning of last year DFID provided advice on the environment and resettlement aspects of the project and how these concerns could be addressed.

<a name="00228w13.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1) in relation to the conduct of arms brokering from the United Kingdom, what research his Department has <i>(a)</i> carried out and <i>(b)</i> commissioned to ascertain (i) what countries are buying arms by such arrangements, (ii) how much business is transacted with each country and (iii) if the countries involved are on the UN embargo list;  [111420]

(3) what assessment the Government have made of the number of <i>(a)</i> UK nationals and <i>(b)</i> non-UK nationals who are involved in conducting arms brokering from the UK.  [111418]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w13.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Government already have powers to control trafficking and brokering under the United Nations Act 1946 where this is necessary to implement a binding UN Resolution. Additionally, under the European Communities Act 1972 the Government have the power to provide for enforcement of a Council Regulation prohibiting trafficking and brokering of specified goods, e.g. dual use goods where there is Community competence. However, competence to prohibit trafficking and brokering of arms or military equipment lies with the member states.
<P>

<a name="00228w13.html_para3">The Government's White Paper on Strategic Export Controls, published in July 1998 (Cm 3989), proposed new legislation to extend the Government's power to control trafficking and brokering in several areas, including with respect to the supply of military equipment and other controlled goods to destinations subject to any form of embargo and the supply of equipment the export from the UK of which has been banned because of evidence that goods of the same type have been used in torture.
<P>

about trafficking and brokering activities conducted in the UK or by UK nationals abroad, and this is being taken into account in the review. The Government have not commissioned external research on this issue. We will announce proposals for new export control legislation in due course, following conclusion of the review of the White Paper proposals in the light of the responses received.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w13.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Restrictions on the holding by a service provider of shares in a client company relate to the nature of the service rather than to the type of entity through which the service is delivered. In other words, the general rule would be that any such restrictions placed by statute or by a regulator on a company or a partnership would apply equally to a Limited Liability Partnership.
<P>

<a name="00228w13.html_para5">For example, the conditions applying to the appointment of auditors operating as LLPs will be governed by the Companies Act 1989 (which will be applied to LLPs by regulation) and by the byelaws and ethical guidelines of the appropriate supervisory body. These byelaws preclude an audit firm--and this would include LLPs--from reporting on any company in which it or any partner has a beneficial investment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make it his policy to encourage the EU to make progress towards the elimination of subsidies on exports in relation to the forthcoming round of WTO agriculture negotiations.  [110963]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Government support further liberalisation of agricultural trade in the WTO. This is firmly linked to further reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, where the Government support the phasing out of all forms of production-related support, including export subsidies, accompanied by targeted measures to conserve and enhance the rural environment and promote the rural economy.
<P>

<a name="00228w15.html_para2">However, although negotiations on agriculture are getting under way as part of the built-in agenda, progress is likely to be slow outside a Round. The Government therefore remain committed to launching a new comprehensive Round of trade negotiations, including agriculture, as soon as possible.

 Dentists are required to display in a prominent position information about National Health Service charges.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The cost of palladium-based precious metals used in dental appliances depends on the prices negotiated in contracts between purchasers and suppliers. These will be affected by the price quotations in the metal markets. The average price for palladium in the London market in 1988-89 was about $130 or &#163;75 and in 1998-99 was about $310 or &#163;190. Palladium is only one constituent with fine gold and platinum in precious metal appliances.
<P>

<a name="00228w16.html_para2">Precious metal casting alloys for use in the General Dental Services must contain not less than 33 per cent. fine gold, platinum or palladium. The available data do not distinguish between the constituents of precious metal alloys and the incidence of precious metal dental appliances cannot therefore be broken down further.

(12) Capital cost defined as: total capital cost to the private sector consortium which includes cost of land, construction, equipment and professional fees but excludes VAT, rolled up interest and financing costs such as bank arrangement fees, bank due diligence fees, banks lawyers fees and third party equity costs.<P>

<P>

(13) The figures for Swindon and Marlborough are estimates; the scheme reached financial close in October and the figures for advisers costs have yet to be finalised.<P>

<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Before May 1997 nearly &#163;18 million was spent on these 15 schemes, but none were delivered.<P>

2. Since May 1997 we spent &#163;27 million delivering 15 new hospitals.<P>

3. This represents only 2.2 per cent. of total cost of these 15 schemes.<P>

4. Detailed breakdown of the pre-May 1997 costs are in the table.<P>

The numbers of hospital medical doctors employed in Shropshire has steadily increased since 1993. However, as new classification methods were introduced in 1995, information for later years is not directly comparable with earlier years (see notes).

 The information requested is not available centrally. We have asked all health authorities to review their eligibility criteria for continuing health care following the Coughlan judgment. Where authorities revise eligibility criteria following any review, they should consider what action they need to take to reassess service users against the revised criteria contained in HSC

 The National Health Service Executive conducted a survey of violence in NHS trusts in 1998-99. The survey found that, on average, seven violent incidents were recorded each month per 1,000 staff. This is equivalent to approximately 65,000 violent incidents against NHS Trust staff each year. Details of the survey can be found in Health Service Circular 1999/229: "Managing Violence, Accidents and Sickness Absence in the NHS", copies of which are in the Library.
<P>

<a name="00228w20.html_para0">A cross-Government campaign, "NHS zero tolerance zone", was launched last October to tackle violence against staff working in the NHS. The campaign is underpinned by National Improving Targets for reducing incidents of violence against NHS staff by 20 per cent. by 2001 and 30 per cent. by 2003.
<P>

<a name="00228w20.html_para1">Information about the number of incidents of violence against social workers is not collected centrally. However, we are determined to reduce substantially the incidence of violence towards everyone working in social care. We have set up a taskforce to produce a national action plan by November 2000 with recommendations and timescales for action to reduce violence against social care staff and to promote the safety and welfare of social care workers.
<P>

<a name="00228w20.html_para2">In particular, the taskforce will advise the Department on the setting of targets that social care employees will be set for the reduction of violence against social care staff, and the arrangements for monitoring of progress. They will also advise social care employers on the development, implementation and monitoring of strategies to reduce violence, to train the workforce in handling confrontational situations, and to support staff who have been the victims of violent incidents.

 We are committed to ensuring that access to social care services is not limited by where people live.
<P>

<a name="00228w20.html_para3">Last year the social services inspectorate published "Care in the Country", which reported on community care arrangements for older people and people with disabilities in eight rural shire counties. While the report highlights the ways in which rurality can sometimes make it difficult to deliver services it highlights many examples of good practice and offers councils key messages to consider and a checklist to use in evaluating their own services.
<P>

<a name="00228w20.html_para4">One of the aims of the Fair Access to Care Services guidance, which will be issued for consultation in the summer, will be to set out the principles authorities should follow when devising and applying eligibility criteria for social care services. This will ensure more consistency around the country in the way people are judged eligible for services.

 In 1997-98, the Serious Hazards of Transfusion scheme for the confidential audit of adverse transfusion incidents (SHOT) analysed 114 reports where a patient was transfused with an incorrect blood component.

Four patients were reported to have died from the underlying condition.

London Borough of Richmond ex parte Wilson (HSC 2000/003: LAC (2000)3). Local authorities still charging for services provided as part of after-care under section 117 of the Mental Health Act 1983 are advised that they should immediately cease to do so. This is consistent with previous informal advice given by the Department and with the response to recent representations by the Association of Directors of Social Services (ADSS) on this issue made on behalf of local authorities.

COT first considered dental amalgam in 1986 when they reported that the use of dental amalgam was free from risk of systemic toxicity, with only a very few cases of hypersensitivity occurring. COT's 1997 review included evidence in a recent report of an ad hoc working group of experts established by the European Commission to consider dental amalgam within the context of the Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC.

<a name="00228w21.html_para2">In their latest statement, published in April 1998, COT stated that the conclusions they had reached in 1986 remain unchanged.

 <i>[holding answer 22 February 2000]:</i> As at 17 February 2000, a total of 983,146 doses of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine were held by the National Health Service's vaccine distributor. This amount is in single doses, enough to immunise 983,146 people with a single dose of vaccine or half that number with two doses. Children are recommended to receive two doses of MMR, the first at around 12-15 months, the second before school entry at around 3 to 5 years of age.

 <i>[holding answer 11 February 2000]:</i> The total value of sponsorship is approximately &#163;160 million. A final and definitive figure will be confirmed when the New Millennium Experience Company's final accounts are audited. Where sponsorship has been received during the period 1 April 1999 to 31 December 1999, that will be confirmed in the company's accounts for that period, due to be published in June 2000. The timing of sponsorship cash receipts, and of the value attributable to value-in-kind contributions which replace a budgeted expenditure within the &#163;758 million cash budget, is dependent on the terms of the contractual arrangements negotiated with each sponsor. In terms of cash payments, most contracts provide for an initial payment on signature followed by further payments subject to a range of contractual provisions. Two sponsors (Boots and BSkyB) have yet to sign their contracts but remain committed at Board level to the sponsorship agreement.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced on 21 February 2000 that free television licences for people aged 75 or over will come into effect from 1 November this year. The main details of the scheme, which will be administered by TV Licensing as agent for the BBC, have also been via a news release issued by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Further details will be published by TV Licensing, who will also write to all households in good time before 1 November, with an application form to be completed and returned if a member of the household is 75 or over. The BBC have indicated that appropriate arrangements will be included for claimants who are housebound.

 A new funding package for safety improvements at rugby league, rugby union, cricket and non-league football grounds was announced on 12 April 1999. That package is worth &#163;7.5 million over three years, and the administrative arrangements for its distribution have recently been finalised. A new committee of Sport England's Lottery Panel will shortly take over the work of the Sports Ground Initiative in channelling public funding for safety improvements in these sports.

 The National Foundation for Youth Music's remit is to support activities for children and young people that take place outside the formal education sector. The number of schools which benefit during the Foundation's first year of Lottery funding will depend to a large degree on the number of applications made to the Foundation's programmes, the first of which--Music Maker--is currently welcoming applications, with other programmes due to be announced in the next few months. The Foundation will report publicly at the end of its first year of distribution of Lottery funds, on the number of children, young people and schools who have benefited from its support.

 It would not be right to seek a direct correlation between the numbers of tickets bought in a constituency and value of Lottery awards made as Lottery funding should be distributed according to need. The Government are, however, committed to ensuring that Lottery funding is distributed fairly both geographically and across all groups of society. This is reflected in the changes made to Lottery distribution through the National Lottery Act 1998, and through the revised Policy Directions which I issued in summer 1998.

 <i>[holding answer 9 February 2000]:</i> In my Department, secondments and attachments are part of the Interchange Initiative, which promotes the exchange of people and good practice between the Civil Service and other organisations. All sectors of the economy are involved: Voluntary, Education, Health, Public and Private. Interchange is a key component of the reform agenda. The Modernising Government White Paper committed us to increasing interchange, in particular by bringing in more people on secondment and sending more of our people out.

 I published on 28 July 1999 targets for the employment of ethnic minority staff in the Home Office and its service areas, that is the police, fire, prison and the probation services. The purpose of these race equality employment targets is to help ensure that these organisations are representative of the communities they serve, and thereby better able to serve them.
<P>

<a name="00228w27.html_para1">In the targets publication a commitment was given to report on progress annually. It is expect that the first report will be published in October this year. This is the date by which up to date information on progress within the financial year 1999-2000 on the targets from all the services will be available; such information is not readily available at the moment.

 <i>[holding answer 16 February 2000]:</i> Some 450 press releases were issued in 1999. The primary cost of issuing press releases relates to their electronic distribution which is carried out through the Central Office of Information, and postage. Electronic news distribution charges amounted to &#163;21,095 and postage approximately &#163;12,000 for the financial year 1999-2000. No central record of other costs which might be involved (eg faxing, e-mail) is available. The variation in the distribution and length of press releases and in their

The figures do not take account of any locally funded initiatives undertaken by individual prisons nor all those funded by Non-Departmental Public Bodies, as such details could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. The table does not include specific grants to bodies where these were first initiated before May 1997.

 The information requested is not held centrally and could be obtained only at a disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="00228w28.html_para0">Although there is no requirement for police officers to obtain ill health or accident insurance, or for police authorities to provide such cover, I understand that some forces have set up their own contributory health trusts and that others encourage police officers to take out private health insurance. All forces also offer medical support services and can provide additional specialist medical treatment for police officers where necessary.

<P>
<a name="00228w28.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Prison Service has recognised the responsibilities placed on it by the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and has already adopted good practice in the areas of recruitment, training and promotion of staff. It welcomes the establishment of the Disability Rights Commission and the role it will play in protecting the rights of disabled people. As a disability symbol user it demonstrates the importance it places on achieving equality of opportunity for people with disabilities.
<P>

<a name="00228w28.html_para2">The Prison Service has a duty of care to all prisoners and its policies towards disabled prisoners have been developed to meet the requirements of Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (Goods, Facilities and

 Gammahydroxybutyrate (GHB) is not licensed as a medicinal product in the United Kingdom but is regarded as an unlicensed "medicinal product" under the provisions of the Medicines Act 1968. The Medicines Control Agency investigates reports of the unlawful manufacture, advertising sale and supply of GHB in the United Kingdom and has brought a number of successful prosecutions in the last few years.

 Smoke detectors make a significant contribution to the protection of life and property from fire and we would want all households to have them.
<P>

<a name="00228w28.html_para5">Current Building Regulations require all new dwellings in England and Wales to have a smoke detector system installed. Publicity and education have in recent years helped raise smoke alarm ownership levels from less than 10 per cent. of households in 1987 to over 80 per cent. But we are determined to increase this further and the Home Office National Community Fire Safety Centre will be running a fresh campaign with the fire service later this year to reaffirm the value of smoke detectors in giving early warning in the event of fire.

Since then, the Institute had its official launch in November, and has been engaged in recruiting staff, locating premises, and building a strategy and corporate plan. A key focus for these first months is developing awareness of the role and vision of the NFPI, and raising the profile of parenting and family issues in the media.

 The available information, relating to removals and voluntary departures of persons who have applied for asylum at some stage, is given in the table. Failed asylum seekers are removed only once all their rights of appeal in the United Kingdom have been exhausted. It should be noted that the figures include those removed on a third country basis and may include some persons who withdrew their asylum application or appeal before a decision or determination had been reached. Section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, which provides for the administrative removal of certain categories of persons currently liable to deportation, has yet to be brought into force.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w29.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Improvements to the way nursing services are organised and delivered in prison are an essential part of the reforms to prison healthcare now underway following the Government's acceptance of the recommendations in the joint Prison Service/ National Health Service Executive report, 'The Future Organisation of Healthcare' published in March 1999.
<P>

<a name="00228w29.html_para0">Prisons and health authorities are jointly assessing prisoners' health needs at establishment level in order to identify, among other things, ways of delivering nursing services which both meet those needs and are integrated with local provision. One particular objective will be to ensure that nursing staff who work in prisons enjoy the same level of professional involvement, clinical supervision and training as their colleagues who work in the National Health Service. To assist this my right hon. Friend, the Minister of State for the Home Office asked Ms Liz Haggard of the Office of Public Management to chair a working group to consider the development of the prison nursing workforce, with particular reference to healthcare officers, and report, with recommendations, by mid-March 2000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w29.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The various control and restraint techniques and the authority for their use on prisoners in England and Wales are contained in Prison Service Order 1600 (Use of Force) and Standing Order 13 (Health Matters), copies of which are in the Library. The Orders make clear that only reasonable force may ever be used and that on every occasion that it is a formal record must be made and kept. Whenever the use of force is planned it is authorised by the governor. However, officers may use force in immediate response to violent incidents when it is impractical to obtain the prior authority of the governor.

 Records on the volume of documentation or the percentage of paper recycled in my department are not kept. Trials are being undertaken into various types of recycled paper to establish the practicalities of committing to a policy that stipulates the use of recycled paper. All offices in my department's Central London headquarters buildings have green bins for recycled paper and most of the key buildings across the estate have paper recycling schemes. The department will shortly be undertaking pilot waste minimisation schemes in three different buildings on the estate with the aim of reducing the amount of waste sent to landfill.
<P>

<a name="00228w30.html_para0">The Prison Service has recently set up a Service wide waste management project. The project will identify areas where wastage can be reduced and will address the efficient and effective disposal of prison waste and the recycling of usable waste. Recyclable materials, such as paper will be reprocessed.

<a name="00228w30.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Since it began operating in April 1995, the National DNA Database, operated by the Forensic Science Service on behalf of the police, has proved a highly effective intelligence tool in the fight against crime.
<P>

<a name="00228w30.html_para1">The Database identifies possible suspects of a crime through matching DNA from unsolved crime scene stains with DNA profiles of convicted or suspected people held on the Database. The average match rate is more than 40 per cent. and approximately 500 matches are reported each week to the police for investigation.

<P>
<a name="00228w30.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Public relations and marketing consultants are used only where new knowledge and experience is needed which adds value to the Home Office's activities and where the expertise is not available in house or from another source. Cost for the period since 1997 is &#163;111,919.00.

 The findings of the independent research report on policing sparsely populated rural areas were considered by a Home Office chaired Working Group, which included representatives of the police service, police authorities and local authorities, last summer. There was no single view within the Working Group on the conclusions of the report. There was general agreement that a sparsity factor had been detected, but less agreement about how to include it appropriately in the police funding formula.

<P><I>28 Feb 2000 : Column: 119W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00228w30.html_para2">We have also taken into consideration the need for stability in the police funding system to enable police authorities to plan ahead. In the July 1998 White Paper, "Modern Local Government--In Touch With the People", my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister said that we would not expect to make fresh changes to the method of calculation of Standard Spending Assessments (SSA) while a fundamental review of the local government grant distribution system is being conducted. This applies equally to the method of police grant distribution, as a common formula is used for distribution of police grant and SSA.
<P>

<a name="00228w30.html_para3">In the light of these factors we have not made any changes to the method of police grant distribution for 2000-01. The Government do not intend to make substantive changes to the funding formula during the more general review of the local government grant distribution system that is being taken forward in consultation with the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association of Police Authorities.
<P>

<a name="00228w30.html_para4">Rural police forces will continue to benefit from the existing 'sparsity' element of the funding formula. This element allocates 0.5 per cent. of the available funding (about &#163;35 million) on a judgmental basis.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w31.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The overwhelming majority of police authorities in England and Wales, 39 out of 43, have already indicated that they intend, subject to satisfaction with the terms, to sign service contracts for the Public Safety Radio Communications Service (PSRCS). On the basis of their support, my right hon.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what proportion of the cost of the Public Safety Radio Communications Project will be met by police authorities.  [111379]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w31.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The cost of the core service for the Public Safety Radio Communications Project represents approximately 80 per cent. of the total service charges for police forces in England and Wales. This is to be funded centrally by means of deduction from total police grant provision.
<P>

<a name="00228w31.html_para1">The cost of services additional to the core service, the so called 'menu services', which all forces will purchase according to their own requirements, accounts for the remaining 20 per cent.
<P>

<a name="00228w31.html_para2">Separately from the core and menu service charges, forces will need to purchase control room and radio terminal equipment along with system integration services. Based upon our understanding of the police service's overall requirements, it is estimated that the initial purchase and subsequent replacement costs total around &#163;300 million in Net Present Cost terms over the Public Safety Radio Communications Service life.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will estimate the number of police officers who will be diverted from public duties to statistical operations as a result of new Home Office targets.  [111452]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w31.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The deployment of police officers is the operational responsibility of Chief Constables. However, the introduction of best value into the police service from April this year and the requirement 



<P>
<P><I>28 Feb 2000 : Column: 122W</I><P>
that year on year efficiency savings of 2 per cent. must be recycled into front line policing should allow Chief Constables to allocate more officers to the essential job of reducing crime. Information Technology systems being delivered under the National Strategy for Police Information Systems and new radio technology for the police being provided as part of the Public Safety Radio Communications Strategy, will also do much to free officers from administrative burdens.




<P>

<a name="00228w31.html_para3">Police authorities already set a wide range of targets for existing performance indicators. The new arrangements for crime targets are a refinement of this. The recently announced proposed targets for domestic burglary, vehicle crime and, for five police authorities, robbery, demonstrate the police service's commitment to setting challenging, but realistic five year reduction targets for the crimes which are of most concern to the public.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many officers from ethnic minorities <i>(a)</i> have completed the police service accelerated promotion scheme and <i>(b)</i> are currently on the accelerated promotion scheme.  [111481]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w31.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Three ethnic minority police officers have successfully completed the Accelerated Promotion scheme since its inception in 1992, and five are currently on the Scheme. These include two officers who were recently selected through an in-service competition to attend this year's Accelerated Promotion Course, which is an integral part of the Scheme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w31.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 On 1 April 1999, the Home Office wrote to the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) requesting that ACPO write to each Chief Constable in England and Wales to ask them to set up voluntary, internal registers of freemasonry membership among their police officers and civilian staff. ACPO duly wrote to each Chief Constable on 7 April 1999. As a result, 34 forces in England and Wales have established voluntary registers.

 <i>[holding answer 21 February 2000]:</i> Following the passage of the Police and Magistrates Courts Act 1994, the actual numbers of police officers at any one time is a matter for Chief Constables to determine. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary set out his policy on the number of police officers, in his reply to my hon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w31.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 At the National Conference for the Recruitment, Retention and progression of Black and Asian Police Officers (Dismantling Barriers) in April 1999, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary set out what the police service targets would be. All forces in England and Wales were set individual targets to reflect their local ethnic minority population within 10 years.
<P>

<a name="00228w31.html_para4">The targets and Dismantling Barriers Action Plan were published in August last year. The 25 point strategic plan was published as part of the Dismantling Barriers programme. The programme aims to remove

discriminatory practices in the Police Service and to make it more attractive to all groups that are currently underrepresented in the service.
<P>

<a name="00228w31.html_para5">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has also set employment targets for recruitment, retention and progression for the Home Office and all its service areas, that is, police, fire, probation and prison services. These targets were published on 28 July 1999.
<P>

<a name="00228w31.html_para6">Change will not happen overnight and that is why my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has set a 10-year agenda. The use of milestones and regular monitoring will allow the existing momentum to be maintained over the 10-year period. A Targets Working Group, chaired by the Home Office Race Equality Unit has been established to take forward the implementation of the targets. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary will also produce a report on progress annually.

<a name="00228w31.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 An equal opportunities audit is at present under way of the Extended Interview (EI) process by which officers are selected to attend the Strategic Command Course at National Police Training Bramshill. Successful completion of the Course is a requirement for promotion to the rank of Assistant Chief Constable or Commander. The audit will provide an independent assessment of the fairness of the process and will identify areas for further improvement.
<P>

<a name="00228w31.html_para7">The EI process involves a wide range of tests and exercises, designed to give every candidate maximum opportunity to demonstrate his or her competencies and also to promote maximum objectivity in assessment. All assessors receive training from the Home Office Assessment and Consultancy Unit for this task, and the Director and Co-Directors of Police Extended Interviews monitor the process to ensure consistent standards and fairness. Every effort is made to ensure that the questions and tests used are not unfair to any group of candidates.

 The information requested is not collected centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, the Audit Commission, in their report "Action Stations--improving the management of the police estate", published in March 1999, stated that in the two thirds of forces able to estimate the expenditure required to bring existing buildings up to a satisfactory state of repair, the maintenance backlog amounted to &#163;205 million.

<a name="00228w32.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Each police authority's Best Value Performance Plan will be audited each year between 1 April and 30 June. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary will then undertake a series of risk based inspections, an important element of which will be an assessment of the progress a police authority has made towards meeting its five year crime reduction targets. Where targets are not being met, this will have a direct bearing on the appropriate level of inspection.
<P>

<a name="00228w32.html_para0">The recorded crime figures will continue to be published every six months at both police force and Basic Command Unit level. The next publication will be July 2000. These figures will continue to give the public valuable information about how successful their local police have been in reducing crime and what progress has been made towards meeting their crime reduction targets.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many <i>(a)</i> police officers and <i>(b)</i> civilian staff there were in the establishment of the Hampshire constabulary in each year since 1991-92.  [111299]<P>

 Information on police force establishments after March 1995 is not available. Under legislation passed by the previous Government in 1994, police officer establishments for each force, set by Government, were abolished from April 1995. It became the responsibility of individual chief constables to determine the number of police offices in their force within the available resources. The Home Office has never set establishments for civilian support staff.

Under the Protection of Children Act 1978, the United Kingdom has an absolute prohibition on the production, circulation and possession with a view to distribution of any indecent photograph of a child under 16. These offences carry a maximum sentence of three years' imprisonment, an unlimited fine or both. The simple possession of an indecent photograph of a child is also an offence under Section 160 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 and carries a sentence of six months' imprisonment. Section 84 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 updated these controls to include indecent computer-generated photographs of children and they have been successfully applied to child pornography transmitted over the Internet.
<P>

<a name="00228w32.html_para2">We are determined to ensure that there are effective measures against child pornography. We support the work of the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) which passes to the police details of potentially unlawful material brought to their attention by members of the public via a specially established hotline. If the originators of the material are abroad, the Foundation passes the report to the National Criminal Intelligence Service who liaise with the enforcement agencies of the countries concerned. The IWF took action on 1,126 reports of alleged child pornography in 1999.
<P>

<a name="00228w32.html_para3">The Government also fully support international initiatives in the Council of Europe and the G8 to combat criminal misuse of the Internet.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the estimated cost is of a drug treatment and testing order per offender; and what the average cost is of a custodial sentence in such cases.  [111660]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w32.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The estimated average cost of a drug treatment and testing order per offender is approximately &#163;6,000. The cost of custody for all offenders, including drug misusers, will depend on the length of their sentences. The average annual cost of custody for all prisoners in 1998-99 was &#163;25,096 per place.

 As soon as we were aware that the leader of the Revolutionary United Front, Foday Sankoh, was travelling in South Africa in breach of UNSCR 1171, we raised our concern with the South African Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We requested that his visit visa be revoked. The South African Government responded quickly to ensure Foday Sankoh's prompt departure from South Africa. We understand he is currently in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire.

<a name="00228w34.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The EU is making a major contribution to international efforts in Kosovo. The EU makes the biggest contribution to reconstruction. In 1999, the EU pledged 127 million euros. This year, the EU will make available 360 million euros, almost half of international pledges.
<P>

<a name="00228w34.html_para1">The main priority of the UNMIK EU reconstruction pillar, under the leadership of Mr. Joly Dixon, a British national, has been the establishment of a coherent modern macro-economic framework.

<a name="00228w34.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 UNSCR 1244 charges the UN Mission in Kosovo with the establishment of provisional democratic institutions and the transfer of responsibility to the people of Kosovo. The Kosovar Albanian leadership agreed in December 1999 that they would participate in a new Joint Administrative Structure (JIAS). The Serbs have not yet joined the JIAS but the UN is hopeful that they will do so soon. Four of the 19 administrative departments under the JIAS have now been established. The Kosovo Transitional Council (KTC) will remain as a consultative body to UNMIK and has been expanded to about 40 to be more representative of Kosovo's ethnic composition including better representation of women. UNMIK intend to hold municipal elections this Autumn to provisional institutions and are preparing regulations to this end.

The Government will announce proposals for new export control legislation in due course, following conclusion of the review of the White Paper proposals in the light of responses received.

This report follows on from my statement to the House on Thursday 20 January.
<P>

<a name="00228w35.html_para1">I can confirm that--as predicted--it continues to be business as usual across Central Government. Twenty- seven Departments and Agencies logged 82 Millennium Bug related incidents over the new year period. Almost all the incidents were assessed as having a low or very low impact, principally because either the problems were fixed before the return to work on 4 and 5 January or because the errors were very minor, such as incorrectly dated reports.

<a name="00228w35.html_para2">There is no doubt this work on meeting the threat of the Millennium Bug had to be undertaken. The Bug was shown to have the capacity to wreak havoc among services, which, though essential, we take for granted. The Government's objective in that work was always to ensure that the Bug resulted in no material disruption to essential services. That objective has been achieved.
<P>

<a name="00228w35.html_para3">The Government will continue to lead by example and be open and transparent. I will report back to the House in March on the impact of the leap year date change on Central Government, which is expected to be low.

 <i>[holding answer 21 February 2000]:</i> The proportion of GDP spent on UK higher education for each financial year, both including and excluding the DTI/OST science budget, is given in the following table. The figures including the science budget are as in our reply to the noble Lord, the Lord Baker of Dorking of 27 January 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, <i>House of Lords,</i> column <i>WA206</i>. Both sets of figures include expenditure from public funds on tuition fees, maintenance awards and student loans. Figures for 2000-01 and 2001-02 are current spending plans. The proportions will vary depending upon the performance of the economy, which determines the level of GDP. Funding for higher education in England will increase by 11 per cent. in real terms over the four years to 2001-02.

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 21 February 2000]:</i> The Special Grant will target resources for the performance threshold additional to and separate from schools' delegated budgets. Schools will be able to draw additional funds from this grant via their local education authority for each teacher promoted to the upper pay spine. Such payments will not be affected if a school has set a deficit budget.

 The following table sets out the unit cost per head of population, based on the 13 to 19-year-old population for each authority in the north-west region, and in the Merseyside area, as these two regions are often presented together. These figures cover 1995-96, and 1997-98, the latest figures which are available. Information for unit cost per head of population for 1990-91 is not available because the Office for National Statistics (ONS) did not collect individual age band data at that time.

Under the "Pupil progress" standard the draft states that where external test data is not available teachers should use data internal to the school to show progress. This could include examination marks, general coursework marks or grades achieved.

 Almost all children currently holding assisted places in Shropshire will have completed their school education by the end of academic year 2003-04. We are providing continued support for existing assisted place holders for the remainder of the current phase of their school education. Those receiving secondary education will continue to hold their places until the completion of their secondary education. Those receiving primary education will normally hold their places until the end of their primary education, unless discretion is exercised under the Education (Schools) Act 1997 for individual children to have their places extended for a period in which they receive secondary education.

Many of those finding work so far through this New Deal have been out of work and on benefits for a long time. New Deal 50 plus will be available across the whole country in April.

 The Government are responsive to all reliable drugs-related evidence which is available. Recent statistics show encouraging signs that Government anti-drugs measures are having a positive effect.

The Prison Service has also seen a dramatic reduction in the rate of positive mandatory drug tests, from 24.4 per cent. in 1996-97 to 18.3 per cent. in 1998-99. Furthermore, recent Home Office drug seizure and offender statistics show that in 1998 we seized drugs with a total street value of &#163;710 million and dealt with 127,900 drug offenders--an increase of 13 per cent. on the previous year.

<a name="00228w39.html_spnew13"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Assistance with child care expenses is not restricted to parents who have access to registered childminders. The Childcare Tax Credit can be paid to parents in receipt of Working Families Tax Credit who use and pay for any form of eligible child care. For under eights, this includes child care provided by after school clubs, holiday play schemes, breakfast clubs and nurseries and playschemes registered with local authorities. For children aged eight and over it includes out of school care which is provided by the school, and from April 2000, care which is approved under the new accreditation scheme.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Answer to the honourable Member for the Vale of Clwyd, Official Report, columns 610-12W mentioned that, like all estimates from sample surveys, the figures were subject to sampling variability, and that care should be taken in interpreting short-term changes in the data. The apparent large increase in income in the North shown by the Family Expenditure Survey between 1997-98 and 1998-99 is almost certainly due mostly to random sampling variability. The estimated increase is &#163;58 a week but this is subject to sampling variability of plus or minus &#163;49 a week, this is the 90% confidence interval. There is only a one-in-ten chance that the true figure lies outside the estimated range. Published regional breakdowns from the FES are now based on three-year averages to reduce their sampling variability.</FONT></UL>

An alternative source, the Family Resources Survey, would normally be preferred for regional breakdowns because of its larger sample, more than three times that of the FES. It was not used for this question because it does not provide as long a run of data as the FES and because results are not yet available for 1998-99.

<P>

<a name="00228w41.html_para0">Estimating the impact of indirect taxes is imprecise as spending patterns vary widely between households with the same composition and income, with the consumption of the majority of goods and services far from universal. For example, only around one third of adults are smokers, just over half the adult population are in households paying vehicle excise duty and around 10 per cent. of households pay air passenger duty. This can be contrasted with direct taxes and benefits where at specified earnings and for particular household types there is a known benefit entitlement or tax liability.

(57) Includes the effects on Working Families Tax Credit and Disabled Persons' Tax Credit.<P>

<P>

(58) The NIC effect was produced by the Government Actuary's Department.<P>

<P>

(59) The income tax estimates are based on the 1997-98 Survey of Personal Incomes.<P>

<P>

(60) &#163;2,730 is the difference between &#163;7,115 and the non-aged personal allowance of &#163;4,385.<P>

<P>

(61) It is not possible to give an estimate of the impact on Exchequer revenue of increasing the National Minimum Wage to &#163;4.94 per hour. Such a move could have significant adverse effects on the employment of low-skilled workers. Therefore any Exchequer gains through increased tax revenue could to some extent be offset by increases in benefit payments.<P>

1. All money amounts are given in &#163; per week, at July 1997 prices.<P>

2. Single pensioners are defined as single (non-cohabitating) people over State pension age (65 for men, 60 for women); pensioner couples are defined as couples (married or cohabiting) where the man is over State pension age.<P>

3. For any given decile of the income distribution, the average amounts refer to the median net income before housing costs within that decile.<P>

4. The distribution of income is calculated on the net income before housing costs measure. Separate distributions are calculated for pensioner couples and single pensioners in each year. Figures are not available for the distribution of pensioner couples and single pensioners combined.<P>

5. Information is given for all years for which comparable Pensioners' Incomes data, derived from the Family Expenditure Survey, are available. Information for 1997-98, based on the Family Resources Survey is available but has not been included because it is not comparable with Family Expenditure Survey based estimates.<P>

6. All years up to and including 1993 are calendar years, except 1990-91 which refers to the combined calendar years 1990 and 1991. All years from 1994-95 onwards are financial years.<P>

7. All estimate are subject to a high degree of sampling error, since they are based on small sample sizes, and should therefore be treated with caution. In particular, these figures should not be used to estimate changes over time, unless over a period of several years.<P>

8. Estimates are given for the United Kingdom. Estimates are not available for Shropshire due to small sample sizes.<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Estimates are rounded to the nearest 1 per cent., but are not necessarily accurate to that degree. Estimates of less than 0.5 per cent. are denoted by "*". Columns may not sum to 100 per cent. due to rounding.<P>

2. Income is defined as the net income before housing costs of the benefit unit, expressed in July 1999 prices. Benefit units are defined as a single person or couple (married or cohabiting) and any dependent children.<P>

3. Percentage estimates relate to the proportion of individuals aged over 65, whose benefit unit income falls into a given category.<P>

4. Income amounts are "unequivalised" (i.e. they have not been adjusted to take account of the size and composition of each benefit unit). This means that a comparison between the benefit unit incomes of someone in a couple and a single person does not give any indication of relative living standards. Therefore, results are provided separately for people in couples and single persons. The table for people in couples and single persons combined can be used only to look at changes in income level over time--it should not be used as a measure of the distribution of incomes in the context of relative living standards.<P>

5. Most components of income are reported in the Family Expenditure Survey as weekly or monthly amounts, which have then been converted to annual amounts for the purposes of this analysis. No account has been taken of variations in the income of a benefit unit over the year.<P>

6. Figures are given for the calendar year 1981, the combined calendar years 1990 and 1991, and the financial year 1996-97--the latest year for which comparable estimates are available.<P>

7. There is no information of this type readily available prior to 1979.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w43.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Malcolm Bruce: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many pensioners have benefited from a winter fuel payment this winter; and how many times the weather conditions activated a payment to be made for <i>(a)</i> Gordon constituency, <i>(b)</i> Aberdeenshire and <i>(c)</i> Scotland.  [111490]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w43.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The hon. Member will be aware that Winter Fuel Payments and Cold Weather Payments are different benefits. As the administration of benefits is a matter for Peter Mathison, Chief Executive of the Benefits Agency, he will write to the hon. Member.
<P>

<a name="00228w43.html_para0"><i>Letter from Peter Mathison to Mr. Malcolm Bruce, dated 22 February 2000:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your recent parliamentary question asking how many pensioners have benefited from a winter fuel payment this winter; and how many times the weather conditions activated a payment to be made for (a) Gordon constituency, (b) Aberdeenshire and (c) Scotland.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Winter fuel payments were introduced in the winter of 1997/98 for an initial two years. The Government subsequently decided to continue the scheme, and in addition, increased the amount of the payment to &#163;100 for every eligible household. Delivery of this winter's payments was broadly similar to the last two winters, other than the payments were made before the new year, with the Generalised Matching Service being used to compare addresses to determine whether &#163;50 or &#163;100 was payable to eligible non Income Support/Income based Jobseekers Allowance pensioners. Eligibility is not determined by the severity of the weather conditions.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Where official records showed more than one eligible pensioner as living at an address, each received &#163;50. Other eligible pensioners received &#163;100. Determining the correct amount of payment involved the cross matching of around 13 million records on 8 benefit systems.</FONT></UL>




<P>
<P><I>28 Feb 2000 : Column: 168W</I><P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In Great Britain a total of 10.2 million pensioners in over 7.5 million households received a Winter Fuel Payment. In Scotland 905,638 pensioners received a payment. The Benefits Agency does not keep statistics in exactly the format you require. However, according to available information the constituencies in Aberdeenshire are Banff & Buchan, Gordon, Aberdeen Central, Aberdeen North, Aberdeen South and West Aberdeenshire & Kincardine, though their boundaries may not exactly match. The attached table shows payments issued to customers in each of the constituencies.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Cold Weather Payments (CWP) are however dependent on the severity of the weather and are paid to people in receipt of Income Support or Income-based Jobseekers' Allowance who have a pensioner or disability premium, or a child under 5 in the household. A CWP is currently &#163;8.50. No separate claim is needed for a CWP.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>CWPs are triggered if the temperature has been recorded as an average of 0oC or below over any seven consecutive days, or a forecast shows the temperature is likely to average 0oC or below oever the next seven days, for a weather station area. The payment process can start without awaiting actual recorded temperatures. Payments are not recalled if a forecast is not confirmed by recorded data.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Again BA does not keep information in the format requested but we are able to provide numbers of estimated qualifiers by weather station (and linked postcodes), and actual payments by BA Districts.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Because of the way in which information is held in respect of Cold Weather Payments, we are unable to identify pensioners as a specific group. Therefore, any information provided refers to all customers, i.e. people who are entitled to IS or JSA(IB) for one day in the period of cold weather, and who receive one of the qualifying premiums (Pensioner, Higher Pensioners, Enhanced Pensioner, Disability, Severe Disability, Disabled Child), or, an amount for a dependent child under five.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>So far this winter, periods of cold weather have been declared and payments made as shown in the attached tables.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I hope this is helpful.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will <i>(a)</i> raise the savings limit of &#163;2,500 for all benefit claimants and <i>(b)</i> establish a higher limit for those with special needs.  [110713]<P>

<P>
<a name="00228w44.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The capital limits in the income-related benefits are reviewed regularly but are not uprated annually. The lower limit of &#163;3,000 was introduced in April 1988. From April 1996 this was increased to &#163;10,000 for people living permanently in residential care and nursing homes. The rules are designed to ensure that help is targeted on those who need it most while not entirely denying benefit to those with only a modest amount of capital. We have no plans to establish a higher limit for other people with special needs.

[111683]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w44.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The compensation recovery scheme was reformed in October 1997 when the provisions of the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997 came into force. The main objectives of the reformed scheme were that a person should not get compensation twice over for the same need; the taxpayer should receive the fullest possible protection; the scheme should allow damages for pain and suffering to be paid in full; the scheme should not result in Government becoming directly involved in the compensation process; and the simplicity of the previous scheme, which helped ensure that administration costs run at less than 5 per cent. of the amount recovered, should be preserved.
<P>

<a name="00228w44.html_para0">The objectives have been achieved: the main changes in the scheme brought about by the Act are that compensators are liable to repay benefits in full; compensators may reduce compensation payments to take account of the liability to repay benefits, but only where benefits and compensation are paid for a like need; compensation for pain and suffering cannot be reduced. The reformed scheme has been designed so that the negotiation process can be as flexible as possible, 



<P>
<P><I>28 Feb 2000 : Column: 173W</I><P>
allowing claims to be settled quickly. Administration costs continue to be less than 5 per cent. of the amounts recovered, which in 1998-99 was &#163;201.5 million.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what is the cost of <i>(a)</i> a CT scan and <i>(b)</i> a chest x-ray when evidence is sought as to whether a person has an asbestos-related disease.  [111703]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w44.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 There is no standard cost for either investigation. Claimants for an asbestos-related disease under the Industrial Injuries Scheme are referred to Medical Services for advice, which will often necessitate their taking and reporting upon plain chest radiographs. If a CT scan was felt to be necessary, Medical Services would provide one. In either case, Medical Services is recompensed for the investigations it supplies through its overall contract with the Benefits Agency, which does not specify fees for particular investigations.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00228w44.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Worthington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will accept a privately-commissioned CT scan as evidence when a person is seeking to prove that he has an asbestos-related disease.  [111686]<P>

<P>

 Claimants for Social Security benefits may ask the decision maker to consider whatever evidence they wish to produce in support of their claims. The decision maker will consider any evidence upon its merits. This includes medical investigations carried out in the private sector.

 Commissioner Anna Diamantopoulou and I discussed a number of issues.

 The information is not available in the format requested. Such information as is available is as follows.
<P>

<a name="00228w45.html_para0">From April 2001, young people disabled before the age of 20 (or 25 if they have been in education) will be able to qualify for Incapacity Benefit without having to have made National Insurance contributions. Rates of Incapacity Benefit are higher than Severe Disablement Allowance (to which such young people would currently be entitled)--after a year on benefit, the rate is over &#163;26 a week more. It is estimated that in Great Britain the change will bring approximately 6,500 young people into Incapacity Benefit each year. If the national pattern of receipt were replicated in Shrewsbury and Atcham, and in Shropshire, the numbers moving into Incapacity Benefit each year in those areas would be some 10 and 25 respectively.
<P>

<a name="00228w45.html_para1">Also from April 2001, the higher rate mobility care component of Disability Living Allowance (DLA) will be extended to severely disabled children aged three or four. It is estimated that approximately 7,000 children in Great Britain will become entitled in the first year and approximately 8,000 in each subsequent year. If the national pattern of receipt were replicated in Shrewsbury and Atcham and in Shropshire, the numbers of children qualifying in those areas in each year would be some 10 and 50 respectively.

 Poverty and social exclusion are complex multi-dimensional issues, affecting many aspects of people's lives--their income, health, housing, the quality of the environment, opportunities to work and to learn. There is no single measure which can capture the complex problems which need to be overcome.

1. Results for individual countries are not accurate to the degree of precision presented in the tables.

2. Results for children are sensitive to the precise way in which household incomes are adjusted for household size and composition; the figure for the United Kingdom is higher than official UK estimates for the "50 per cent. of median income" income level. <P>

 The latest figures published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for household income by county are for 1995 and were published in Table 9 of Regional Accounts 1996: Part 2, Economic Trends No. 535, June 1998. Estimates for household income by region, up to 1997, were published in Regional Accounts 1997: Part 2, Economic Trends No.551, October 1999. Both of these publications are available in the House of Commons Library. No figures are available at constituency level.

<a name="00228w46.html_para2">The published figures are normally presented in terms of total gross annual household income per head of population.

These figures on incomes of the household sector are defined on a national accounts basis, which includes persons living in private households and in institutions.

 The vast majority of occupational pension scheme members are part of schemes that include provision for early retirement on grounds of ill-health. Only around 1 per cent. of occupational pension scheme members have no such provision. This means that around 10 million people are covered by arrangements for early retirement on grounds of ill-health. We do not expect the introduction of stakeholder pensions to affect that number.

<BR>
I am writing in reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions about the service at our Sutton office over the Christmas and New Year period.
<BR>
We are committed to improving the quality of service we provide to all who use or rely upon our Service. We deal with many thousands of appeals every year without incident, but I recognise that each appeal is of great importance to the individual who makes it. We strive, therefore, to provide the best service possible to every appellant in their given circumstances, whatever the period of the year. Over holiday periods we maintain sufficient--if inevitably lower--levels of staffing at all our offices.
<BR>
There were 39 staff working our Sutton office on 4 January 2000. The Sutton office is situated next door to the local Post Office and it is our practice to collect mail from them every working day morning. Staff did collect incoming recorded delivery main on 4 January 2000 and the letters were distributed to the appropriate staff during the course of that morning.
<BR>
I am unable to say how many faxes were received at the Sutton office over the Christmas and New Year period. There are three fax machines in the Sutton office and because of the volume of activity, a log of incoming faxes is not kept. Faxes received are regularly taken from the machines and distributed to the relevant processing teams. It is not possible to say when each of the faxes was processed.
<BR>
I hope that this reply is helpful. Please contact me should you require any further information.
