 The UK had &#163;67 million development assistance available to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in financial year 2006-07. Approximately half of these funds have been spent on emergency humanitarian support through the UN and non-governmental organisations, with the remainder on supporting the 2006 electoral process, improving transport links to some isolated areas, supporting police and justice reform, supplying anti-malarial bednets and basic health, education, water and sanitation services and tackling HIV/AIDS. Additionally, through the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool, we are supporting the EU mission advising on reform of the army; the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of militia groups; and the provision of tents, water and sanitation and human rights training to soldiers in the new integrated brigades (and their families and local communities) to try to stop them preying on civilian populations to make ends meet.</p>

Many commercial banks are part of the &#145;London Club&#146; and offer debt relief under the HIPC framework. However, a survey of 24 HIPCs in 2006 led the IMF and World Bank to estimate that only a limited number of commercial creditors (holding approximately 5.5 per cent. of the total commercial debts) have provided their share of HIPC debt relief directly.</p>

By mid-2006, over $4.5 billion worth of commercial debt owed by HIPCs had been eliminated in this way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_347"><a name="70321w0002.htm_para6"><a name="07032167000099">However, some of the remaining commercial debt is bought by vulture funds.

We are working bilaterally and multilaterally with HIPC Governments to raise awareness of this issue and encourage preventative action. DFID is co-funding a Debt Management Capacity Building programme and supports a wide range of other activities to strengthen public financial management and accountability. DFID also supports the World Bank&#146;s DRF, and we have recently agreed to provide a contribution of  $3.5 million to a package that will help Nicaragua buy back over $1.3 billion-worth of commercial debt.</p>

assessments of performance and financing needs in individual sectors and an annual Public Expenditure Review in which development partners and civil society are consulted about budget plans for the next year and the medium term. Allocations to the Poverty Action Fund, through which poverty reduction expenditure is prioritised, are now nearly 40 per cent. of the Government&#146;s budget compared to about 20 per cent. at the end of the 1990s. DFID&#146;s Poverty Reduction Budget Support (PRBS) supplements the Government&#146;s own resources in the budget. Decisions about PRBS take into account the Government&#146;s commitments to poverty reduction, strengthening financial management and accountability and respecting human rights and international obligations.</p>

The provision of services at district level is largely funded by the central Government. Ensuring that the criteria for allocating resources to districts take proper account of poverty is a priority for DFID. We have worked closely with the Government in different sectors to improve allocation criteria so that the distribution of funds and the provision of services better reflects needs. In recent years there has been a shift in the allocation of resources in favour of poorer districts, although there is scope for further improvement. A recent National Audit Office study noted the contribution DFID has made to bringing about positive changes in the district budget allocation system.</p>

These additional needs have largely been met by the donor community. We have pressed the Government to do more. The Government responded in the 2006-07 budget by making available an extra &#163;5.3 million (approximately) for the districts of the north affected by conflict.</p>

For transportation of 1,299 tonnes of parliamentary estates waste, this amounts to a GHG emission of between 0.48-0.65 Teq.

The resulting percentages are labelled as &#147;registration rates&#148; on the table and this term is used in the remainder of this reply. These data provide the closest available approximation to the information you requested. It is not possible to calculate the percentage of the eligible population who are registered to vote: the resident population aged 18 and over is not the same as the number of people eligible to vote.</p>
</ul><a name="70321w0004.htm_brev3"><a name="07032178000772"><ul><p class="tabletext">These &#147;registration rates&#148; are not published as National Statistics: there are a number of issues that mean care needs to be taken when interpreting the data. In particular, care needs to be taken when considering areas where the usually resident population differs radically from the population eligible to vote. An example of such an area might be one containing prisons (as is the case for Lostock ward) or accommodation for a United States Air Force base, as prisoners and American citizens are not eligible to vote. These people are however included in the population estimates as they are usually resident. Therefore, the estimated &#147;registration rate&#148; calculated for such areas is considerably reduced.</p>
</ul><a name="70321w0004.htm_brev4"><a name="07032178000773"><ul><p class="tabletext">Please note that the population estimates have a reference date of 30 June, and electoral data a reference date of 1 December.

</ul><a name="70321w0004.htm_brev5"><a name="07032178000774"><ul><p class="tabletext">There is also inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate (both parliamentary and local/European) as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. This is one of the main reasons some areas show rates in excess of 100 per cent.</p>
</ul><a name="70321w0004.htm_brev6"><a name="07032178000775"><ul><p class="tabletext">The population data are estimates and as such are subject to a margin of confidence. The ward level population estimates are derived from estimates for a different geography that have been published with the status of experimental statistics. Therefore, the estimates, and electoral registration rates derived from them, should not be treated as being exact. The latest derived available ward estimates are for mid-2004 and therefore data are shown for this year.</p>

They work closely together with NHS colleagues to provide nursing care, with special emphasis on military patients.

This is used for people who are returning to benefit within 12 weeks and whose circumstances (in relation to the claim) are unchanged. Rapid re-claim supports the incentive to take up employment, including short-term periods of full-time work, by allowing the completion of a shortened claim form. To be able to move quickly back into benefit also eases the concerns felt about re-claiming benefits if the work suddenly comes to an end.</p>

Interviews are typically undertaken with 48 hours and people being required to confirm their circumstances remain as previously stated in writing.</p>

The sector&#146;s main contractors and specialist engineering innovation activity is largely of a site-based problem-solving form, although some also undertake formal research and development.</p>

 Our 10 Year Childcare Strategy has highlighted the need for further Government support to increase the child care options open to parents especially in rural or disadvantaged areas. Since April 2005, our emphasis has been on local authorities sustaining existing good quality child care places rather than creating new ones. While Sure Start children&#146;s centres in the most disadvantaged areas must offer integrated early learning and day care provision as part of their core services, we have never intended centres to set up in competition with good existing provision. Local authorities must consult private, voluntary and independent providers when planning their children&#146;s centres strategy and, by working in partnership with them, plan to make the best use of the experience and expertise of local providers.</p>

 After careful consideration we no longer intend to run the Youth Opportunity Card pilots. We have carried out, with excellent support from the  10 pilot local authorities, detailed and extensive work to assess whether the Youth Opportunity Card is deliverable and the associated costs, benefits and risks. Our conclusions are that the costs outweigh considerably the money being provided to young people, considerable risks and uncertainties remain and there is no off-the-shelf technological solution or one that can be developed with certainty at the present time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_425"><a name="70321w0011.htm_para6"><a name="07032184000163">Therefore we do not believe that going ahead with the card at this point in time would provide value for money. However, I am absolutely committed to opening up new ways of giving young people the means to make their own choices and a real say over what is provided for them. I want to continue to work with the local authorities to develop alternative means of achieving the same ends.</p>

 The average net farm income for all types of farms in the United Kingdom is expected to be around &#163;20,600 in 2006-07, about 20 per cent. higher than 2005-06 in real terms. Incomes are forecast to have doubled for cereals and general cropping farms due to better prices for crops, while lowland livestock farms and mixed farms also benefited from improved prices. Specialist poultry, specialist pigs and dairy farm incomes are expected to fall, as are incomes for less favoured area (LFA) grazing livestock farms.

 Human trafficking through the EU is an issue which has been raised regularly at EU Councils and my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has discussed it with a number of EU partners bilaterally. Human trafficking has not been on the agenda of formal Council meetings since the accession of Bulgaria and Romania. However, the principal work at EU level to tackle human trafficking is being taken forward at official level on the basis of the EU action plan on human trafficking which was adopted during the UK Presidency of the EU. The EU action plan provides a comprehensive approach to tackling this problem and the impact it has on its victims. A report on progress is due to be received before the end of 2007. The UK's action plan on tackling trafficking in human beings, which will be published soon, reflects the work being done by the UK. The UK announced on 22 January its intention to sign the Council of Europe Convention on trafficking in human beings; both Bulgaria and Romania, the newest EU member states, have signed the Convention and Romania has additionally ratified it.</p>

Private sector organisations using PVS do so via a call centre, they provide PVS with the details from the passport in front of them and PVS confirms or denies whether this information matches our records.

 As planned, the NOMIS Programme Board reviewed an independently assured plan for developing and testing the versions of C-NOMIS that are to be rolled out across England and Wales, including the timing of the upgrading of the IT infrastructure and how all of these are underpinned by a strengthened contractual arrangements with our suppliers. Lessons learnt from the highly successful introduction of the early version of C-NOMIS at HMP Albany on the Isle Wight were also taken into account.</p>

 The Government do not hold the information in the format requested. However, the 2001 census gives information about the place of birth of those living in Northern Ireland on 29 April 2001: Of the 1,685,267 people living in Northern Ireland on census day, 1,534,268 are recorded as having been born in Northern Ireland, 81,389 were recorded as having been born elsewhere in the UK and 39,051 were recorded as having been born in the republic of Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_488"><a name="70321w0017.htm_para2"><a name="07032187000228">Place of birth does not, of course, determine citizenship. Entitlement to British citizenship is regulated by the British Nationality Acts and Irish citizenship is a matter for the Irish authorities. However, under the terms of the Belfast Agreement, the British and Irish Governments recognised the right of the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves as Irish or British or both, as they so choose, and confirm their right to hold both British and Irish citizenship. Annex 2 to the Agreement signed by the two Governments defines &#147;the people of Northern Ireland&#148;, for this purpose, as meaning &#147;all persons born in Northern Ireland who had, at the time of their birth, at least one parent who is a British citizen or an Irish citizen or is otherwise entitled to reside in Northern Ireland without any restriction on their period of residence&#148;.</p>

 The Standards Board has no remit to impose sanctions on local councillors; this is a matter for either local standards committees or, in the most serious cases, the Adjudication Panel.

 Groups of tenants of local authorities have had a right to manage their homes since the introduction of The Housing (Right to Manage) Regulations 1994. A local authority is required to provide reasonable support to the group to assist it to set up a tenant management organisation. The tenant empowerment programme (TEP), now administered by the housing corporation, provides financial support to developing tenant management organisations. In the main stage of development, the local authority is required to contribute 25 per cent. of the TEP funding.

<p><a name="stpa_558"><a name="70321w0023.htm_para2"><a name="0703224000214">Substitute prescribing using methadone and buprenorphine is recognised as the recommended treatment for the majority of individuals requiring opiate substitution treatment. For a small number of heroin users who do not respond to other types of substitute prescribing, it is appropriate, when clinically assessed to be the case, to prescribe heroin. Doctors who prescribe heroin to drug misusers require a Home Office licence.</p>

treatments, have to be a matter for local national health service providers and practitioners as they are best placed to know their community's needs. In making such decisions, they have to take into account evidence for the safety, clinical and cost-effectiveness of any treatments, the availability of suitably qualified practitioners, and the needs of the individual patient. Clinical responsibility rests with the NHS professional who makes the decision to refer and who must therefore be able to justify any treatment they recommend. If they are unconvinced about the suitability of a particular treatment, they cannot be made to refer.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many electronic patient records she expects there to be; and how many she expects to have <i> (a)</i> sealed and <i> (b)</i> sealed and locked data on them. [119873]</p>

<p><a name="st_398"><a name="0703224000685"><a name="70321w0025.htm_spnew4"><a name="0703224001127"><b>Caroline Flint:</b>
 In the future, each person using the national health service will have an electronic NHS care record which will be made up of detailed care records, held locally by the NHS body that provides care to the patient, and a summary care record. At the local level detailed care records will be built up over time into a comprehensive health and care history.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_569"><a name="70321w0025.htm_para5"><a name="0703224000686">The objective of sealing, and sealing and locking information is to reduce the number of people who might otherwise feel the need to opt-out completely of having a summary care record because of their concern about only a small amount of sensitive information in their record. It will be open to any patient to ask to limit access to such information, including to request that specific sensitive information is accessible only with their consent. The sealed envelopes approach has the confidence of the professions in being able to provide appropriate controls for the support of patient confidentiality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_570"><a name="70321w0025.htm_para6"><a name="0703224000687">It is not possible to predict with any certainty how many people may in future choose to exercise this option as this will be the first time such an approach has ever been used. However, there is ample evidence to suggest that only a small minority would have concerns about the content of their medical records that would lead to their choosing to seal information. In response to a Consumer Association Survey (October 2002) question on this subject 60 per cent. of respondents said that they would remove nothing, around a quarter (24 per cent.) said they would remove a little,  and around four per cent, said they would remove &#147;a lot&#148; or &#147;all&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_571"><a name="70321w0025.htm_para7"><a name="0703224000688">This is paralleled by the available evidence about the likelihood of people to opt out of having a summary care record at all. The Scottish emergency care summary, which extracts data from general practitioners&#146; records and hospital notes, currently contains records for nearly 4.93 million patients and less than 500 have opted out. Similarly, in the course of a consultation on establishing an electronic health record in the Wirral, of patients invited to opt out if they had concerns, only 25 opted out whilst 350,000 records were uploaded. And of the 1.3 million patients likely to be affected by a similar proposal in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, only some 1,150 decided not to have their records included in the data repository.</p>

 The spine is the colloquial name given to the national database of key information about patients&#146; health and care. It forms the core of the national health service care records service (NHS CRS). It also supports other key elements of the national programme for information technology, such as choose and book, the electronic prescriptions service (EPS), and 'GP to GP' record transfer, each of them using the spine&#146;s messaging capabilities as part of their own services.</p>

Set-up (capital) costs are incurred in phases as functionality is added to the spine through staged software releases over the implementation period. The ongoing service (revenue) costs average around &#163;45 million a year, although this will fall in a range between &#163;30-60 million in any particular year. These sums are in line with the contracted value of the work concerned, which is some &#163;620 million over nine years.</p>

 Existing national health service information technology (IT) systems and databases are typically incompatible with each other.

<p><a name="stpa_595"><a name="70321w0026.htm_para18"><a name="0703224000845">By contrast, the defining characteristic of the national programme for IT is provision of fully integrated systems that are interoperable, and ensure transmissibility of patient data across organisational boundaries. The national infrastructure will also speed up and make more certain the processes of identifying and contacting patients.

 Deployment of new hospital systems under the national programme for information technology involves several key stages between initial preparation for implementation through to go live, during which a number of important organisational and technical activities have to be completed, including planning, training, testing and clinical safety assessments. All the stages in the run-up to completion of go live involve some transfer of data from legacy systems to local service provider systems, though legacy systems remain live and in service until the process is complete. These arrangements are quite typical of major information technology systems deployments in both the public and private sectors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_597"><a name="70321w0026.htm_para20"><a name="0703224000849">The process will normally take several weeks, involving anything between 0.5 million and up to 10 million records. The time scale in each particular case is dependent on a number of factors, largely to do with the size of the trust and any complexities identified during data migration. These might include difficulties in collating data from legacy systems, or the need to incorporate specific local requirements late in the process of implementation.</p>

 There is no specific numerical target for year-on-year spending by national health service organisations on local implementation of the national programme for information technology. Each NHS organisation is free, and expected, to use its resources in the way that delivers the best possible value for money. However, evidence from the Department&#146;s most recent (2006) survey of investment in information management and technology in the NHS shows that the combined total of current and predicted future local NHS and central spending reflects significant progress towards the level anticipated in the 2002 Wanless Report &#147;Securing our Future Health&#148; as being necessary to deliver the breadth and quality of healthcare services envisaged in the report. Detailed information from the 2006 survey is available in the Library.</p>

In addition, savings have been achieved in the prices paid by the NHS for information technology goods and services due to the central buying power of NHS Connecting for Health, as well as in NHS staff time saved through using the programme&#146;s systems and services. The National Audit Office have acknowledged savings of &#163;860 million achieved through centrally-negotiated enterprise wide arrangements.</p>

 The alternative to a central database for patient records has existed and continues to exist in the status quo prior to the inception of the national programme for information technology. It is characterised by information technology (IT) that does not support the transfer of information between systems, encourages the creation of multiple records for the same patient within a single organisation, tolerates the loss and delay of records during their slow transit by hand, the unavailability of key information when needed, and the compromise of security and confidentiality of patient data. These shortcomings regularly result in clinical decisions taken on the basis of incomplete or inaccurate information, suboptimal quality of care, avoidable inconvenience to patients and doctors, and additional administrative costs.</p>

 Inhaling nitrous oxide produces a rush caused by oxygen starvation which may result in unconsciousness. There are also thought to be long term effects on the nervous system. All of these risks are likely to be exacerbated if the drug is combined with alcohol or other narcotics. The risks are particularly severe for pregnant women.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_606"><a name="70321w0027.htm_para5"><a name="0703224000978">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has been alerted to increasing reports that nitrous oxide is available for sale in pubs and nightclubs. A number of reports have come from Trading Standards departments within local councils. Local authorities are responsible for the licensing of premises in the pub and nightclub sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_607"><a name="70321w0027.htm_para6"><a name="0703224000979">Officials from MHRA have met with representatives from Local Authority Co-ordinator of Regulatory Services and Trading Standards (LACORS) to discuss the extent of the problem and to explore ways of tackling it. A strategy has been agreed involving joint action by MHRA and Trading Standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_608"><a name="70321w0027.htm_para7"><a name="0703224000980">MHRA is also contacting manufacturers of nitrous oxide and investigating how supplies come to enter the recreational market.</p>
