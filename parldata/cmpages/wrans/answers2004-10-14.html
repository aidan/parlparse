 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many complaints from former staff of his Department employed by TNT have been raised with regard to the new process for handling departmental records and their security.  [173660]</p>




<p><a name="41014w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 The Ministry of Defence Contract Management Team (CMT) has received a very small number of verbal criticisms concerning TNT&#039;s new processes for handling departmental records and their security from former MOD staff now employed by TNT. To facilitate investigation, written confirmation of the complaints was requested. None has yet been received.

<p><a name="41014w01.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Gerald Howarth: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what role he expects Galileo to play in providing the Future Rapid Effects System requirements with optimum battlespace awareness.  [190058]</p>




<p><a name="41014w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Galileo is intended to be a civilian system under civil control. The Department expects the GPS military code to continue to meet defence requirements for a robust, secure satellite navigation system. Accordingly, there are no plans for the use of Galileo by the MOD&#039;s Future Rapid Effects System.

<p><a name="41014w01.html_wqn3"><b> Llew Smith: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what screening tests have been established for <i>(a)</i> British troops, <i>(b)</i> British medical auxiliaries and <i>(c)</i> Iraqi civilians to assess the degree of inhalation and ingestion of depleted uranium dust during the military action in Iraq in (i) the Gulf war in 1991 and (ii) Operation Telic in Iraq in 2003; what resources have been committed to this testing; and if he will make a statement.  [190206]</p>




<p><a name="41014w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 On 22 September 2004, the independent Depleted Uranium Oversight Board (DUOB) announced the establishment of a retrospective testing programme for the analysis of uranium isotopes in urine 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>14 Oct 2004 : Column 326W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
and, if Depleted Uranium (DU) is found to be present, how much. The test is available free of charge to eligible individuals, including medical staff, who served in the Gulf area between 1 August 1990 and 31 July 1991 or in the former Republic of Yugoslavia on or after 5 August 1994. The total cost of the testing programme will depend on demand but is expected to be in the order of &#163;1 million.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41014w01.html_para0">
This retrospective test is entirely separate from MOD&#039;s own Biological Monitoring policy, under which all UK military personnel returning from theatres where DU munitions have been used&#151;including Operation Telic&#151;are offered a test for uranium in their urine. So far over 350 individuals have taken up this offer and have been tested. Of those, only a small number have been found to be excreting DU in their urine. These are personnel who were injured in accidental attacks by friendly forces and have embedded shrapnel. The cost to date of this programme is estimated to be &#163;250,000. There will be a further annual staff cost of &#163;25,000 for the duration of the project.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41014w01.html_para1">
Assessing the degree of inhalation and ingestion of DU dust arising from the military action in Iraq among Iraqi civilians is a matter for the Iraqi Interim Government. Nevertheless, the MOD would offer advice if requested.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the total amount was paid in each of the past three years to farmers and other landowners for the use of their land by his Department.  [190278]</p>




<p><a name="41014w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 I assume my hon. Friend is referring to the total amount paid by the Ministry of Defence to farmers and other landowners for the use of their land in respect of military training. In the last three years this has amounted to approximately &#163;1.7 million per annum. This figure includes the costs of: the leasing of land outside of Army Training Estate (ATE) boundaries; the long term leasing of land within ATE boundaries; the purchasing of necessary Commoners Rights; and the use of other facilities such as safety buoys and electric/water cables.

<p><a name="41014w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Military personnel attend a wide range of promotional events, as required as part of their duties. Such events may include UK and overseas defence exhibitions as well as equipment demonstrations and displays.

</p>



<p>(2) which media were informed, and when, about an impending announcement concerning the airfield review and RAF Kinloss prior to the letter sent to the honourable Member for Moray on 12 October.  [191358]</p>




<p><a name="41014w01.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The Defence Airfield Review was announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence on 21 July 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 348. I sent letters to a number of hon. Members early on 12 October, including the hon. Member for Moray, detailing how we would be conducting the review with regard to the airfields in their constituencies. Hon. Members were therefore notified before any statement to the press, the exception being the hon. Member for Moray whose published contact details were incorrect.

 Lottery distributors are, and are intended to be, independent of Government, but they are obliged to take into account policy directions from the Secretary of State. These directions set out the framework for the wider aims of Lottery funding, and include the need for the distributing bodies to further the objectives of sustainable development when awarding Lottery grants. The Lottery distributing bodies are strongly committed to sustainable development, including the procurement of timber from legal and sustainable sources.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what factors underlay the decision to set the salary for the Chief Executive of the Rural Payments Agency at its present level.  [189618]</p>




<p><a name="41014w04.html_spnew1"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Rural Payments Agency brought together functions from the former Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food&#039;s regional centres and the former Intervention Board. The purpose was to streamline, modernise and reduce the costs of administering Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) schemes, while delivering a high-quality service to farmers and traders. This new agency required a leader with a successful track record of delivering radical change in a substantial delivery organisation and it demanded someone who could sustain a high level of performance. The Chief Executive post was therefore advertised in 2000 as an Open Competition. Since then there has been the additional challenge of delivering successful implementation of CAP reform. The external market and the high expectations of the post holder were factors in determining the salary. The salaries of chief executives are reported to Parliament in the usual way.

<a name="41014w04.html_para1">
The current draft does not refer to individual species of fish and nor does it suggest preferred catch methods but it does suggest that the method of catch should be labelled so that paying customers can make an informed choice when choosing dishes of food.

<p>
<a name="41014w04.html_para2">
Defra supports the sourcing of sea bass from responsibly managed fisheries. Hand lining is a relatively low impact method of fishing and so can help fisheries to remain sustainable. Advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas on sea bass has been that the level of exploitation of the stock appeared to be sustainable. New advice is due shortly which we will be considering carefully to ensure that this stock remains sustainably exploited. There are also currently no restrictions at a UK or community level on the method of fishing that can be used to target bass.

<p><a name="41014w04.html_spnew4"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Government have consistently pressed for early and radical reform of the EU sugar regime, which is now seriously out of line with the decoupled, market-based approach already adopted for virtually all of the rest of the Common Agricultural Policy. The current regime also gives rise to major distortions in international trade, some of which are under active challenge in the WTO.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41014w04.html_para4">
Negotiations are beginning in Brussels on a European Commission approach to reform which would mark a step change in the operation of the regime, bringing prices significantly closer to world levels and moving towards a more liberalised and competitive system based on comparative advantage rather than historic production and national self-sufficiency. We have welcomed this as an important step on the right direction.

 The Galileo satellite navigation system is being developed by the European Union and the European Space Agency as a civil project for transport and other non-military applications. It has been stated by successive Transport Councils that Galileo is a civil programme under civil control. A Joint Action of the Council has been agreed which enables referral of aspects of the Galileo programme that relate to the security of the European Union or its member states to an appropriate formulation of Council, i.e. Pillar II, where unanimity applies.

 The European Commission published a proposal for a Third Directive on driving licensing on 5 December 2003. The Directive aims to promote free movement of citizens, improve road safety and increase the security of the driving licence system. My officials consulted fully and widely on these proposals during spring 2004. After detailed discussions in the Council Working Group, at which the European Commission was present, on 7 October the Transport Council reached a general approach on the Directive, which meets most of the Government&#039;s key objectives. The European Parliament is expected to complete its First Reading of the proposal in January 2005. I shall be writing shortly to the Chairmen of the Lords and Commons European Scrutiny Committees to bring them up to date on progress.

 On 13 October, the Secretary of State launched a consultation paper, &quot;Increasing Diversity in the Judiciary&quot;, which examines the current lack of diversity in the judiciary and asks for views on a wide range of issues, including whether increased opportunities for flexible working would encourage people with other commitments, such as child care responsibilities, to apply for judicial office. One idea offered for discussion in this context is whether court sittings at the weekends or in the evenings might offer a means of introducing greater flexibility into the working arrangements of the judiciary. Were such a suggestion to be seriously considered in the future, it would be necessary to balance the interests of other groups, in particular our customers, against those of potential candidates for judicial appointment.

 Carers of any age may be entitled to the full range of social security benefits depending on their individual circumstances. The most common benefits for carers of pensionable age are carer&#039;s allowance, retirement pension and pension credit. Many carers reaching pension age who are entitled to carer&#039;s allowance are also entitled to a retirement pension of an equal or higher amount. In these circumstances the overlapping benefits rules preclude the payment of carer&#039;s allowance. However, entitlement to carer&#039;s allowance is retained, allowing for extra help to be given to those entitled to pension credit.
