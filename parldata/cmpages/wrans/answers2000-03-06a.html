<a name="00306w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 March 2000]:</i> The then Countryside Commission presented its advice to Government on the future care of National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs) in 1998. This included recommendations on planning policy guidance regarding AONBs. We announced our response on National Parks on 29 September 1999 and we will announce our proposals for a package of measures for AONBs when we have finalised our detailed consideration.

Authority contracts under Best Value, with an option of access to the Local Government Pension Scheme so that transferring employees can retain their membership of that scheme while they are engaged delivering outsourced local authority services. I have so far received some 24 representations about the future pension status of employees in local authorities who work on the delivery of privatised water company services through agency agreements established under the terms of the relevant Water Acts. The scale of these agreements, and the alternative pension arrangements available to those employed under them, are being established with the co-operation of the United Kingdom Steering Committee on local government pensions. In the light of that exercise, I will consider carefully the appropriate next steps.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 Last year we published draft regulations which determine which items of plant and machinery are assessed for business rates. The regulations reflect the recommendations of the second Wood Committee. In particular, generating plant and machinery belonging to the power industry will benefit from a "tools of the trade" exemption although such items which are in the nature of a building or structure will continue to be rateable.
<P>

<a name="00306w01.html_para0">We have now decided that plant and machinery used to generate electricity (such as turbines and engines) in all Good Quality Combined Heat and Power (CHP) schemes, including those used in wider industry, should benefit from this exemption.
<P>

<a name="00306w01.html_para1">De-rating such plant and machinery in CHP installations will ensure that those items are treated equally across all sectors. It also illustrates our continued support for the increased take up of CHP technology which can bring considerable environmental and economic benefits.
<P>

<a name="00306w01.html_para2">We will introduce the exemption from 1 April 2001 when the CHP Quality Assurance programme for assessing the quality of all types of CHP will be fully operational. The programme will determine the eligibility of CHP schemes for a range of benefits including exemption from the Climate Change Levy. The rating exemption for CHP plant and machinery will require a change in secondary legislation which we will publish in draft later in the year.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the recent RAC survey on the relative costs to families of using their car and using public transport; and if he will make a statement.  [113118]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 My right hon. and noble Friend the Minister for Transport was pleased to have provided the foreword to the RAC Report on Motoring 2000 which offered a useful insight into what motorists think are the relative costs of car and public transport. As the report showed there was considerable uncertainty among motorists about the full cost of their travel by car, and of the real costs of public transport. A more accurate picture of actual costs for households is given in table 1.15 "Household expenditure on transport: UK 1987-1997 in Transport statistics in Great Britain; 1999 Edition". We are currently undertaking research to probe what impact costs, both actual and perceived, have on people's travel decisions.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when work will begin on the <i>(a)</i> A2/A282 Dartford Improvement, <i>(b)</i> A2 Bean to Tolgate widening, <i>(c)</i> Tolgate to Cobham widening and <i>(d)</i> M60, junctions 5 to 8 widening.  [113104]<P>

<P>
<P><I>6 Mar 2000 : Column: 456W</I><P>
Improvement schemes have yet to complete their statutory procedures. The start of works dates will therefore depend on the satisfactory completion of these procedures.
<P>

<a name="00306w01.html_para3">We currently plan to award the construction contract for the M60 Junction 5 to 8 Widening in 2003-04. The precise timing of the start of work will be a matter for the contractor.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what factors underlay the decision not to include <i>(a)</i> the widening of the M25 between junctions 12 and 15, <i>(b)</i> the A1(M) Wetherby to Walshford road scheme, <i>(c)</i> the A46 Newark to Lincoln improvement and <i>(d)</i> the A63 Selby bypass in the list of road schemes planned to start in 2001-02.  [113100]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Owing to the time needed to complete the necessary contract procedures, construction of the M25 Junctions 12 and 15 Widening scheme could not take place any earlier than 2002-03.
<P>

<a name="00306w01.html_para4">The A1(M) Wetherby to Walshford road scheme is to be constructed as part of a Design, Build, Finance and Operate (DBFO) contract. The amount of work needed to prepare the contract documents and undertake the subsequent procurement process means that the contract cannot be awarded before 2002-03.
<P>

<a name="00306w01.html_para5">The contracts for the A46 Newark to Lincoln Improvement scheme and the A63 Selby Bypass are programmed to be awarded in the financial year 2001-02.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what impact the road schemes announced in the recent local transport settlement will have on the Government's objective of reducing traffic growth; and if he will make a statement.  [113098]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 In order to tackle congestion and pollution, the Government want to see a reduction in road traffic growth, and an absolute reduction in road traffic where its damage is greatest. The schemes will, on their own, have a very small impact on total traffic growth. However, the local bypasses will help relieve communities of inappropriate traffic and all of the schemes form part of wider local strategies to improve choice and provide better alternatives to the car, thereby reducing traffic growth.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the start dates and completion dates of the 37 schemes on the Government's list of targeted trunk road and motorway improvements.  [113117]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Of the 37 schemes in the Targeted Programme of Improvements, 26 have completed their statutory procedures. I have listed the financial years in which we currently plan to award construction contracts for these schemes.
<P>

<a name="00306w01.html_para6">Because Design and Build contracts will be used, the precise timing of the start of works will be a matter for the contractor. The construction periods will depend on individual contracts.
<P>

<a name="00306w01.html_para7">The start dates for the other 11 schemes will depend on the outcome of the remaining statutory procedures.

<a name="00306w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 In England there are 33 bridges and three tunnels with a length greater than 600 m, carrying 21 different trunk roads. This figure excludes trunk roads transferring to the Greater London Authority in July 2000 as these will be de-trunked.
<P>

<a name="00306w02.html_para1">All these structures have long residual lives and there are no plans for their renewal in the foreseeable future. There is an ongoing programme of works to ensure all structures remain safe and serviceable.

In granting permitted development rights, we have to strike a balance between giving freedoms to individual householders to improve their homes, and protecting the amenity of neighbouring properties. We are not aware of any significant problems in the exercise of permitted development rights relating to windows and therefore have no plans to change these at the present time. We will, however, continue to monitor any representations received on this issue.

energy and climate change, which are central to achieving sustainable development, while continuing to protect the landscape. This was underlined in "New and Renewable Energy: Prospects for the 21st Century: Conclusions in Response to the Public Consultation", published by my right hon. Friend, the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe, on 1 February 2000.
<P>

<a name="00306w03.html_para0">In order to promote this strategic approach from the regional level downwards, the Government Offices for the Regions are initiating work to prepare regional assessments and targets for renewable energy provision based upon--and, where necessary, updating--existing resource studies. On 9 February 2000, DETR published "Guidance on Preparing Regional Sustainable Development Frameworks". The guidance indicated that the Government hope that the frameworks will draw upon this work and elaborate a regional approach to renewable energy, including regional targets which flow from the assessments of each region's capacity to generate electricity from a range of different sources. The Government would like to see frameworks in place in all regions by the end of 2000.
<P>

<a name="00306w03.html_para1">The frameworks will work alongside Regional Planning Guidance (RPG) and Regional Development Agencies' Economic Strategies in promoting sustainable development. Thus we envisage RPG taking forward in land-use terms a region's strategy for delivering renewable energy targets by defining broad locations for renewable energy development and setting criteria to help local authorities select suitable sites in their plans. We would encourage regional planning bodies to set targets in RPG, where sensible to do so, for the structure plan and unitary development plan areas within the region consistent with the regional targets provided by the regional sustainable development frameworks. Advice on this will be set out in the final version of the revised "Planning Policy Guidance (PPG) note 11: Regional Planning". This will be published shortly.
<P>

<a name="00306w03.html_para2">Together with the national planning policy guidance in "PPG 22: Renewable Energy", RPG--as taken forward through structure plans and Part I unitary development plans--will provide a strategic framework for policies and proposals for renewable energy development in local plans, including the identification in those plans of suitable sites. This, in turn, will feed through to decisions on individual planning applications.
<P>

<a name="00306w03.html_para3">More positive planning at regional and local levels will contribute to greater public familiarity with, and acceptance of, prospective renewable energy developments. It remains important, however, for operators to prepare the ground with local authorities, environmental organisations and local people before formal planning applications are submitted and to develop proposals in consultation with them.

To ask the Solicitor-General what criteria the Director of the Serious Fraud Office is required to follow in exercising his discretion not to institute criminal proceedings in return for the person concerned giving evidence for the prosecution; what administrative procedures must be carried out before the exercise of his discretion, in particular if he is required to carry out inquiries into the antecedents of such a person; how many times the Director has exercised his discretion since 1995; if the prohibition against convicted criminals being able financially to benefit by their crimes extends to such a person; and if he will make a statement.  [112407]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w03.html_spmin1"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 In deciding whether to prosecute, the Director of the Serious Fraud Office applies the evidential and public interest tests set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. Because fraud cases present particular problems of complexity it is sometimes necessary for investigators to have the assistance of one of the participants in a fraud in order to break it. Usually such a participant is on the periphery of the wrongdoing. In such cases the Director will consider all the information available at the time (including any information as to the financial or other benefits received as a result of the participation in the fraud) and may consult the Law Officers for advice. The Director will always consult the Law Officers before granting a formal written immunity from prosecution. [If the offence does not relate to serious or complex fraud the Director will seek the assistance of the Director of Public Prosecutions.] The number of times the Director has exercised his or her discretion since 1995 cannot be ascertained without incurring disproportionate cost.

<a name="00306w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Liddell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 March 2000]:</i> I understand that BNFL has reviewed all the records for quality assurance checks carried out on MOX fuel supplied to its German customer, Preussen Electra. In the case of the record for one of the pellet lots concerned, BNFL found that in 1996 a set of data collected from a secondary manual sample check of pellet diameter 



<P>
<P><I>6 Mar 2000 : Column: 465W</I><P>
measurements, which had already been confirmed as acceptable, was inadvertently deleted from a computer. The lost data were replaced with data collected from the same check carried out on a previous pellet lot. BNFL considers that all other secondary pellet diameter checks for MOX produced for its German customer have been properly carried out and recorded. The MOX supplied by BNFL has been operating satisfactorily in the reactor in Germany since 1997. The HSE states in its report that it is satisfied that the fuel manufactured in the MOX Demonstration Facility will be safe in use. This view is based on the robustness of the fuel manufacturing process and the totality of the checks made on the key parameters. However, BNFL's customer has decided to shut the unit down and replace the fuel assemblies concerned.

 On the initiative of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, British Trade International set up the joint Government/private sector Kosovo Taskforce to co-ordinate and promote the UK's response to the reconstruction opportunities in the province. The 



<P>
<P><I>6 Mar 2000 : Column: 466W</I><P>
Taskforce has done much to publicise the opportunities for British companies to play a part in the regeneration of Kosovo. Indeed, arising out of the Taskforce's activities, a consortium of British companies, with financial support from British Trade International, was awarded the concession to manage Kosovo's power sector over the seven months from last October; this is helping ensure that the people of Kosovo get through the harsh winter. Through help from the Taskforce, another British consortium was awarded the contract for the first phase of the upgrading of Pristina airport.
<P>

<a name="00306w04.html_para2">During my visit to Kosovo last October, it was clear that the good will arising out of both contracts should help UK companies compete for other business, not only in these two sectors but also in other areas of activity. This will be particularly important as Kosovo moves into the next phase of recovery, with strategic infrastructure projects, designed to help secure its longer term future, being put out to competitive tender by the international agencies. I am confident that I will see UK companies making even more progress when I again visit Kosovo in June. British Trade International has posted an official to the British Office in Pristina on a short-term basis to draw the attention of appropriate companies to opportunities in Kosovo and to assist those seeking to capitalise on them; resources have been secured for the next financial year to fund this post for the longer term.
<P>

<a name="00306w04.html_para3">To keep the business community abreast of commercial developments in Kosovo, British Trade International has set up a website: its address is www.brittrade.com/kosovo/. This includes information on the activities of the Taskforce and the international funding agencies--including information on projects they are funding. Kosovo has been an early and demanding test of British Trade International; it has been widely praised by the private sector for all its initiatives there.
<P>

<a name="00306w04.html_para4">Many companies regard Kosovo as the springboard for entry to the wider South East Europe region (the Balkans) which presents significantly more business opportunities; these are highlighted on the Kosovo website. Through promotional events such as seminars, support for trade fairs and missions, British Trade International continues to draw the attention of UK companies to commercial opportunities generally in all the markets of the region.

Anecdotal information suggests that EMAs are helping young people from disadvantaged backgrounds remain in education, when otherwise they may not have participated. A number of institutions have also reported that EMAs have had a positive effect on attendance, effort and discipline. Students recognise that if they want to have the allowance, they have a responsibility to attend regularly and adhere to their learning agreement.

 The Government fully support the aim of the Clubhouse movement which engages members and staff together in order to get people with mental health problems back into open paid employment. We are currently considering how the New Deal for Disabled People can best develop and will consider as part of that what role the Clubhouse movement could play.

 This information is not collected centrally by my Department. Section 14 of the Education Act 1996 places a duty on individual LEAs to ensure that there are sufficient school places for all children of compulsory school age in their area. Each LEA must produce annually a School Organisation Plan, which is a 5 year rolling plan, setting out how they propose to remedy any excess or insufficiency of school places and to make provision for children with special educational needs. Plans are approved at local level by the School Organisation Committee for the area or, if they cannot agree, by an independent Adjudicator. All but two London boroughs have had the Plans they published in 1999 approved by their local School Organisation Committee.

 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2000]:</i> Analysis undertaken by the FEFC as part of its monitoring of potential risks to adequacy and sufficiency of provision indicates that there are seven, out of a total of 33 colleges funded by the FEFC within the East Midlands, assessed as category C.

<a name="00306w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wicks </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 March 2000]:</i> We have taken steps to ensure that both colleges in the FE sector and schools with sixth forms have the resources they need to introduce the revised post-16 qualifications from September this year. At the Government's request, the Further Education Funding Council has revised its funding system so as to offer colleges a clear incentive to provide students with broader programmes of study than the traditional norm. In addition, &#163;35 million was added to the overall education standard spending settlement for 2000-01 to reflect the potential costs to local education authorities nationally of implementing the reforms in the schools they maintain.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 March 2000]:</i> There are no specific instructions in existence regarding the receipt by prisoners of printed materials dealing with political subjects at Maghaberry Prison. The admission of all printed material to HMP Maghaberry is governed by Rule 67 of the Prison and Young Offenders Centre Rules (Northern Ireland) 1995. HMP Maghaberry is a fully integrated prison with no segregation on grounds of political, religious or paramilitary affiliation. As a result, the Governor may use his discretion, under Prison Rule 67, to refuse admission to printed material dealing with political subjects if he believes it could prejudice the security, or control, of the prison by raising tensions between such affiliates.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence for what reason the Ministry of Defence Performance report 1998-99 published on 20 December 1999 includes River Class minesweepers transferred to Brazil in 1998; and if he will make a statement.  [112431]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence Departmental Performance Report 1998-99 covers the period 1 April 1998 to 31 March 1999. The River Class Patrol Minesweepers--Blackwater, Itchen, Spey and Arun--were reported in two sections of the Report: Paragraph 41 and Annexe B. Paragraph 41 noted their hand-over to the Brazilian Navy, which occurred between the end of April 1998 and mid October 1998. Annexe B, the Royal Navy Force Structure table, detailed all Fleet Force Elements in-service during the period of the Report. Annexe B correctly included three of these four vessels which were still in service between April and July 1998, but failed to include a footnote on their pay off dates. The fourth vessel--Itchen--was paid off at the end of February 1998, outside the reporting period, and should not therefore have been included in this table.
<P>

<a name="00306w09.html_para0">A further error has been found in the Royal Navy Force Structure table at Annexe B of the Performance Report. The section detailing the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Force Elements shows only one Roll-on Roll-off vessel, Sea Crusader, in service during the period. In this case, the strength of the Fleet was understated as the second vessel in the class, Sea Centurion, entered Immediate Operational Service on 19 October 1998.

<a name="00306w10.html_para0"><i>Letter from G. E. Willis to Mr. Menzies Campbell, dated 6 March 2000:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your Question to the Secretary of State for Defence about the RAF Training Group Defence Agency performance against its 1998-99 Key Targets as these matters fall within my responsibility as Chief Executive of the Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency had 4 Key Targets which were published in the Training Group Defence Agency Annual Report and Accounts 1998-1999, a copy of which was placed in the Library of the House.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Key Target 1--Quality of Product. This target is concerned with the achievement of customer satisfaction with the quality of graduate trainees, as reflected in Customer Advisory Committee reports to the Air Officer Commanding in-Chief. The specific target for 1998-99 was the development of a quality monitoring system by 31 March 1999, which was achieved.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Key Target 2--Efficiency. The target was to deliver the savings that accrue from the efficiencies planned for FY 98-99. The requirement for 1998-99 was a saving of &#163;10.042M. The actual savings made of &#163;11.529M means this target was also achieved.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Key Target 3a--Quantity of Output (Flying Training). This target concerns the percentage of trained personnel delivered against RAF requirements. The target set for 1998-99 was 96.0%. The actual achievement was 78.8%. Full output was only achieved in the case of Air Engineers. The reasons for shortfalls in other areas of flying training were as follows:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Fast jet pilots--operational commitments, which took qualified flying instructors away from the flying training task and a temporary problem with aircraft serviceability were the main factors.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Multi engine pilots--student numbers had to be reduced because a backlog was developing due to the delayed delivery of the C130J impacting on the ability of the front line to absorb newly trained pilots.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Rotary Wing pilots--a shortfall arose as the failure rate of trainees was slightly higher than forecast.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Navigators--a temporary instructor shortage and poor weather resulted in the cancellation of one course. Additionally, some navigator recruits were switched to pilot training during their Initial Officer Training to meet increased demand for pilots.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Airmen Aircrew disciplines--insufficient recruits to meet the full requirements.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Key Target 3b--Quantity of Output (Ground Training). This target also concerns the percentage of trained personnel delivered against RAF requirements. The target set for 1998-99 was 97.0%. 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>6 Mar 2000 : Column: 487W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The actual achievement was 96.3%. The shortfall was due to recruitment difficulties in certain trades, most notably the RAF Regiment.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Key Target 4--Development of Output Costings and Unit Cost Measures. This target covered the need to provide full output costings and associated unit cost and efficiency measures for the Agency by FY 00-01. The 1998-99 target which was to produce an Output Costing Model was achieved.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You ask what action is being taken to improve performance. The remedial actions taken by the Training Group Defence Agency are as follows:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>All non-essential flying tasks cancelled to maximise the flying training hours available.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Management action has increased the serviceability of aircraft and improved the provision of spares.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Hercules Multi-Engine Operational Conversion Unit's planned output is being increased to eliminate the backlog of students.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The RAF Personnel Management Agency has addressed the availability of instructors.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Recruiting strategy has been reviewed and as a result we are targeting populations where recruitment has been poor.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In addition to the recruitment measures other actions to improve performance against Ground Training targets include pre-training course visits by potential recruits to the RAF Regiment Depot and the development of new training courses that provide the opportunity to gain Modern Apprenticeships. I am pleased to say that these are proving very popular with the recruitment of aircraft technicians.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your question to the Secretary of State for Defence, about the targets for the Defence Communication Services Agency, as this matter falls within my area of responsibility, being the Chief Executive of the Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am pleased to report that the DCSA achieved all of its Key Targets for the Financial Year 1998/99. Further information is contained on Page 10 of the DCSA Annual Report 1998/1999, a copy of which is in the Library of the House. The DCSA Key Targets for 1998/99 were essentially developmental targets for the first year of the Agency's existence. They were primarily concerned with <i>system</i> availability as opposed to measuring of a <i>service</i>. This was a reflection of the approach historically taken by Defence in the provision of information services. However, it is the quality and availability of the <i>services</i> which are of importance to Defence customers and the Key Targets for FY 1999/2000 therefore focus on measurement of these services. Clearly, the new Key Targets needed to be both quantitative and measurable. I have included details of them at Annex A for your information.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Given the need to focus upon the provisions of services, the DCSA has changed its internal management processes accordingly and reviews the performance of its services against the new Key Targets on a monthly basis. The information is presented to the Management Board using a Balanced Scorecard approach, supported by a comprehensive monthly report, which provides detailed 



<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>analysis of Agency performance against its Business Plan and all 4 Key Targets. The Agency has improved performance against the targets by designing and then refining the internal business processes that are needed to deliver services. The proposed Key Targets for Financial Year 2000/01 will not change as radically as the change between the Agency's first years with the exception of the inclusion of a new efficiency target: to achieve an improvement in efficiency by reducing the average unit cost of output for current DCSA products by 5% per annum.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>DCSA Key Targets For 1999/00</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. The details of those targets for 1998/99, which were achieved are shown below:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a. The Key Targets of this Agency for 1998/99 which were achieved:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(1) Key Target 1. To build, completed and to time and within budget, for all three Services, 95% of the programme for kits, outfits and packs, as defined in endorsed Equipment Tables and as directed by Director Medical Programme and Plans, at the Surgeon General's Headquarters.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(2) Achievement and factors affecting the outcome. The build programme originally defined was met apart from one tranche. In terms of modules completed this represented a 98% success, so the Key Target was achieved. The one tranche not completed was deferred by Director Medical Programme and Plans, because of other urgent operational commitments. These accounted to more than the postponed tranche, but were successfully completed by the Medical Supplies Agency.</FONT></UL>




<P>
<P><I>6 Mar 2000 : Column: 489W</I><P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(3) Key Target 2. To meet 100% of the Services' requirements for stocked medical material blood products for operations.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(4) Achievement. As at the fourth quarter of 1998/99, all requirements for stocked medical material and blood products for operations had been met despite heavy operational commitments.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(5) Key Target 3. To meet 98% of the Services' requirements for stocked medical material and blood products for exercises and training.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(6) Achievement. The services' planned requirements for exercises and training were fully met by the fourth quarter of the financial year 1998/99.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(7) Key Target 5. To improve the ratio of stock held from 1.30 to 1.72.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(8) Achievement. The Stockturn figures for the financial year 1998/99 was 1.96.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(9) Key Target 6. By 31 December 1998, the Medical. Supplies Agency will have set in place a mechanism, which communicates the full cost of the drugs and medical material supplied. The communicated costs will be in a format which is acceptable to the Agency's major customers, whether or not they have a Service Level Agreement.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(10) Achievement. The means of communicating costs was in place by 31 December 1998. The format has been continually developed by the Agency and its customers.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>b. The Key Target of this Agency for 1998/99 which was not achieved with factors affecting the outcome are as follows:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(1) Key Target 4. to meet 85% of demands for Category B items, within the Medical Supplies Agency's new charter standard (next day delivery of priority demands; 72 hours for routine); and 95% within one week.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(2) Achievement and factors affecting the outcome. The Annual Report for 1998/99 recorded an overall improvement throughout the year. The success rate for the fourth quarter was 78% achieved within 1 week for priority demands, with 56% within 1-3 days. Overall the figures show 54% of all demands were achieved within 1 week and 45% of demands were achieved within 1-3 days.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(3) Comment: This new Charter Standard was introduced at the start of the year, which was a step change form the MOD standard of 28 working days for routine delivery. The standard was regarded as aspirational and the first target speculative. In the event, our plans suffered because of an unforecast and substantial increase in the number of demands presented over the period: up from 66,000 in the first quarter of 1997/98 to 78,500 in the last quarter of 1998/99. Had the volume of demand remained constant, it is probable that this target would have been met. In the overall assessment of this Agency's performance Surgeon General accepted these difficulties.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>3. Details of the actions taken by the agency to improve target achievement performance in 1999/2000 are as follows:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a. A complete review of the inventory to ensure the correct balance between items supplied from stock and those procured to order (benefit all Key Targets).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>b. The extension of E-Commerce to cover a larger range of high volume items in the inventory (Key Target 4).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>c. The introduction of the use of production orders in the modular build programme (Key Targets 1, 2 and 3).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>d. An extensive programme to dispose of unwanted items (Key Target 5).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>e. The introduction of computerised interim stock management at the Medical Distribution Centres (Key Target 4).</FONT></UL>
<P>

It was not possible to ascertain the reduction in the cost of a productive hour in 1998-99 because there was no agency-wide system available to record man-hours. Although the LSSA Task and Resource Accounting Management (TRAMS) System was introduced to perform this function, its roll out was delayed by technical problems.
<BR>
b. Action taken:
<BR>
The targets for 1999-2000 in the Corporate Plan, which has been placed in the library of the House, remained the same as those for 1989-1999. This was recognition of the immaturity of our target setting. However, the 2000-2001 targets had been made more challenging as follows: serial 1--90%, serial 2--85%, serial 3--92%. The target for serial 4 remained unaltered at 3%. However, TRAMS is now is use in the majority of LSS business areas and the data recorded during 1999-2000 will establish a productive hour baseline for future years.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Performance Against Key Targets</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. I am replying to your Question to the Secretary of State for Defence concerning the Defence Secondary Care Agency's (DSCA) performance in meeting its 1998/99 Key Targets and the steps the Agency is taking to improve upon this in 1999/2000. This matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief Executive of the DSCA.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. The Agency's Key Targets for 1998/99 and its performance in delivering these is set out on page 21 of the Agency's 1998/99 Annual Report, a copy of which has been placed in the Library of the House. The 1999/2000 Key Targets are shown on page 22.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>3. I am aware that Key Targets are designed to set and stimulate year-on-year improvement in Agency performance and I am committed to meeting challenging targets for the DSCA. However, these targets must also be realistic.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>4. In 1998/99 the DSCA believed that real performance in patient waiting times was masked by inadequate data reporting systems and that improvements would emerge both by better reporting and better achievement. Neither assumption materialised and it became clear that some targets were out of reach and that adjustments had to be made when setting the Agency's 1999/2000 Key Targets. Accordingly, the performance measurement in respect of Key Target 2 was reduced to the 1997/98 level. However, continuing shortages of clinical manpower, coupled with operational demands upon a limited resource, mean that achievement of the Agency's 1999/2000 Key Targets, even where reduced to 1997/98 levels, continues to pose a stiff challenge.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>5. Nevertheless, as a result of great effort, the Agency has to date achieved its Key Target 1, which it regards as the highest priority for the Agency, and it is taking active steps to improve waiting time performance. A senior officer has been appointed with specific responsibility for performance management and the Agency meets regularly with representatives from the single Services to discuss ways of improving patient throughput, for example, by reducing the incidence of Service 'Did Not Attend' appointments. Other patient filtering mechanisms have also been introduced, for example, in the field of orthopaedics, the speciality most in demand by the Services. This aims to identify those patients whose conditions do not require them to see a consultant and who could be treated outwith the Agency by primary care physiotherapists, thereby enabling the DSCA to treat more patients. Again manpower difficulties, coupled with the need to introduce new financial accounting systems, have hindered progress in developing new efficiency targets for the Agency but this is being addressed. The Agency is making great strides in the field of Clinical Governance. Individual military training requirements have been reflected in the Agency's Corporate Training Plan and the Agency is discussing with the single Services ways of de-conflicting exercise requirements to spread the impact on the Agency, thus enabling it to meet its obligations in the area most easily.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Pay & Personnel Agency is responsible for providing pay and personnel services for the Ministry of Defence. The Agency's performance against its key targets for 1998/99 was reported in the Agency's Annual Report and Accounts, House of Commons Paper No. 595, which was laid before the House on 16 July 1999.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The key targets covered performance in the areas of service delivery, customer satisfaction, efficiency, systems, and people. All targets were achieved except those covering the timeliness of payments, where performance ranged from 97.3% to 99.9% against the aim of 100%, and the achievement of Investors in People accreditation. With several million payments to make each year across all areas of the PPA's business these shortfalls were the result of inevitable but minimal processing errors. Recognising this realism but also the need not to abandon the aim of payment on time every time, the key service delivery targets for the current year have included just a single Agency wide target of 100%. During 1998/1999 the Agency launched a major internal efficiency review which has now delivered efficiency savings well above the Departmental target but which persuaded us to defer the Investors in People assessment in view of the temporary turbulence caused by the review. Training was also a factor and the Agency is carrying out an intensive training programme which is intended to improve performance across the range of services provided and which will contribute to the Agency's aim to achieve Investors in People accreditation before the end of this financial year.</FONT></UL>

Section 64 grants awarded by health authorities are subject to the rules and scrutiny processes for propriety and regularity that govern all health authority expenditure. Section 64 grants awarded by Ministers to national voluntary organisations include a condition that a voluntary organisation, and anyone acting on its behalf, must comply with the law for the time being in force in the United Kingdom.

<P>

 Welfare to Work is a key priority for us. We believe in a modern welfare state which encourages and helps people to work when they can, as well as providing support for them when they cannot. We have already set in place many innovative projects, some involving the public and private sectors working in partnership, to do just that.
<P>

<a name="00306w17.html_para2">We have a wide range of initiatives already in place, including the New Deal for Young People and the New Deal for Lone Parents which have helped over 200,000 find employment, and the New Deal for Disabled People which is providing practical help enabling those who want to work to realise their ambitions. Two million disabled people already work and over one million more want to. From April this year, the New Deal for the Over 50s will be rolled out nationally.
<P>

<a name="00306w17.html_para3">In addition, the ONE Service is currently being tested in 12 pilot areas around the UK. This offers personalised advice and support through a Personal Adviser to those of working age. Participation in ONE is, at present, voluntary but, from April this year, participation in a work-focused meeting with a personal adviser will become part of the normal process for people of working age claiming benefits in the pilot areas.
<P>

<a name="00306w17.html_para4">These reforms link in with the wider Government agenda. Colleagues in the Treasury and the Inland Revenue are ensuring that work pays by improving in-work incomes through initiatives such as the National Minimum Wage and the Working Families Tax Credit.

<P>

<a name="00306w18.html_para0">There are no administrative obstacles to backdating awards of benefit to April 1999. However, the prescribed time limit for claiming Income Support would prevent any claim made today being backdated to that date. That time limit, even with an extension for special circumstances, could result in payment for no more than three months prior to the date of claim.
<P>

<a name="00306w18.html_para1">Anyone who claims Income Support can be considered for entitlement from the date of his or her claim. Generally this will be the first date that they contact the department to let the Secretary of State know of their intention to claim, provided that they then complete the appropriate claim form and provide the necessary evidence within one month of that first contact. If the customer is in receipt of Retirement Pension, Income Support will be paid on the same day as that Retirement Pension. In such circumstances entitlement to Income Support will begin on the first such payday, which may be later than the date of claim.

 The Financial Services Authority and the Building Societies Commission are the independent prudential supervisors of banks and building societies respectively.

 I announced on 26 January that the Treasury would give the Financial Services Authority (FSA) responsibility for regulating most residential mortgages. All mortgage lenders, including those which specialise in the non-status market, will have to be authorised by the FSA, with specific permission to lend on mortgage. All mortgage lenders will have to satisfy the FSA that they are honest, competent, trustworthy and solvent, before permission can be given. 



<P>
<P><I>6 Mar 2000 : Column: 518W</I><P>
The FSA will regulate mortgage advertising and require all mortgage lending activity to include specific disclosure of the main features of the loan.
<P>

<a name="00306w18.html_para6">I also announced on 26 January that the Treasury would set new benchmark, CAT standard (cost, access, terms) mortgages for variable and fixed or capped interest rate mortgages. Although voluntary, these will provide a yardstick to help borrowers make better informed, confident mortgage choices and avoid products which have in some cases caused detriment in the past. It is expected that CAT standards will be finalised shortly, following discussions with the mortgage industry.
<P>

<a name="00306w18.html_para7">The FSA will embark on a formal consultation process in the early summer and will consult on detailed rules for mortgage regulations towards the end of the year. Unauthorised mortgage providers will need to apply to the FSA by the middle of 2001, and the FSA expects to have the new regime in place by the third quarter of next year. The Treasury is in frequent contact with the FSA to discuss how these matters are progressing. However, it will be for the FSA to decide whether to initiate investigations into particular areas or firms in the mortgage market, once it has the powers to do so.
<P>

<a name="00306w18.html_para8">In the meantime, all mortgage lenders in the non-status market have to comply with the guidelines issued by the Director General of Fair Trading in November 1997. These guidelines include the need for transparency in all dealings with potential and actual borrowers, and to ensure they do not engage in unfair business practices. Failure to comply with the guidelines could call into question a firm's fitness to hold a consumer credit licence.

 <i>[holding answer 2 March 2000]:</i> Paying WFTC through the pay packet is central to demonstrating the rewards of work and making work pay for families on low incomes. From April employees awarded tax credits will generally receive them with their pay except where they have opted for the credit to be paid to their spouse or partner or where their employer does not operate a PAYE scheme or only operates a simplified PAYE scheme for domestic staff. The Inland Revenue is providing an extensive range of direct practical help and support for employers who will be paying tax credits through the pay packet.

<a name="00306w22.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Paice: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what scientific studies he has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> evaluated regarding the import of bees from New Zealand; what assessment he has made of the probability of such an importation carrying Kashmir Bee virus into the United Kingdom; and what advice he has received concerning the role of varroa mites as vectors for KBV.  [110125]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w22.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Central Science Laboratory's National Bee Unit was requested to undertake a formal qualitative risk analysis on the importation of package bees from New Zealand. This was completed in March 1999. The importation of queen bees from that country which has high bee health standards, has been allowed under licence since 1980 without problem. Germany also allows imports of bee packages from New Zealand. However, the risk of importing Kashmir Bee virus (KBV) cannot be ruled out and the virus may already be present in UK bees. It has not yet been proven that KBV is vectored by varroa. There is certainly no indication from those major honey-producing countries where both varroa and KBV are endemic that the virus is causing concern, or measurable damage, to industry.

 Flood and coastal defence legislation is permissive, empowering the Environment Agency (and the other operating authorities) to carry out works but not requiring them to undertake such works, either at all or to a given standard. The Government nevertheless expect operating authorities to exercise their powers, and respond to flood risks, in a responsible way, and to be ready to explain their policy in this regard.
<P>

<a name="00306w22.html_para3">We have provided operating authorities with guidance to allow them to take prioritised decisions on flood defence provision within a strategic framework. This has been further developed through the Government's High Level Targets for flood and coastal defence, published in November 1999, which include a requirement for all operating authorities to prepare a publicly available policy statement setting out their approach to flood and coastal defence.
<P>

<a name="00306w22.html_para4">The Environment Agency has a duty, under section 6(4) of the Environment Act 1995, to exercise a general supervision over all matters relating to flood defence in England and Wales. The way in which this duty will be exercised acknowledging other operating authorities' responsibilities was elaborated, alongside the High Level Targets, in November 1999.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what steps would have to be taken to lift the prohibition on winter use of glufosinate ammonia; and in what circumstances the lifting of the ban would be considered.  [111354]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w22.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2000]:</i> The prohibition is contained in the five approvals for the commercial use of glufosinate ammonium products on oil seed rape. Lifting the prohibition would only be considered if an application, accompanied by information to demonstrate that this particular use posed no unacceptable risk to people, wildlife or the wider environment, were received. Experimental approvals, allowing strictly limited use but no sales, may be granted in order for experimental information to be collected to support such an application.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Employees consists of salaried managers, regular workers and seasonal/casual workers.<P>

2. Total labour consists of employees and principal farmers, spouses, other farmers, partners and directors.<P>

3. In 1998, fundamental changes were introduced to the labour questions on the June Agricultural and Horticultural Census in England, Wales and Scotland. It appears that this change in questions may have led to the recording of additional Labour who were not previously included in the returns. The change in questions has also led to a redistribution of labour between the various categories, most notably for salaried managers.<P>

4. We therefore advise caution when comparing the 1998 results with previous years.<P>

<P>
<a name="00306w24.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Baldry: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food when he will reply to the letter from the hon. Member for Banbury dated 23 December concerning Mr. C. Lane of Village Farm, Bletchingdon. [112654]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w24.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 I replied to the letter from the hon. Member for Banbury on 2 March 2000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w24.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Hawkins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department on what grounds he authorised the early release of Christopher Snelling, the murderer of Police Sergeant Robertson; and if he will make a statement.  [111786]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w24.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Christopher Snelling was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment for conspiracy to rob and the manslaughter of Police Sergeant Robertson. No decision as to his release has yet been taken.
<P>

<a name="00306w24.html_para0">His application for release on parole is currently being considered by the Parole Board, pursuant to the authority delegated to it under the Parole Board (Transfer of Functions) Order 1998. I have asked the Chairman of the Parole Board to write to the hon. Member directly once the Board has concluded its deliberations, setting out its decision.
<P>

<a name="00306w24.html_para1">When considering a case such as Mr. Snelling's, the Parole Board takes into account Directions as to the release of determinate sentence prisoners given by the Secretary of State, under section 32(6) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. These focus primarily on the risk to the public of a further offence being committed at a time when the offender would otherwise be in prison. This is balanced against the benefit, both to the public and the offender, of early release back into the community under a degree of supervision which might help rehabilitation and so lessen the risk of reoffending in the future.

<P>
<a name="00306w24.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department which EU member states currently support the establishment of a European public prosecutor; and what is the position of the Commission on this matter.  [112339]

<a name="00306w24.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 In its Opinion for this year's Intergovernmental Conference, the Commission proposes the creation of a European Public Prosecutor to investigate and prosecute before national courts cases of fraud against the European Community's budget. I have made clear that I am not persuaded of the case for a European prosecutor and see a number of significant difficulties in such a proposal. To date, I am not aware that other member states have publicly declared positions.

<a name="00306w24.html_sbhd3"><H4><center>Europol</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w24.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is the cost in the next financial year of the increase in remuneration, pensions and other financial entitlements to Europol employees of December 1999.  [112509]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w24.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Total personnel costs, including salaries, pensions and other staff allowances, in the Europol budget for 2000 is 17,261,000 euro in respect of 185 posts. These figures compare with a personnel budget for 1999 of 11,130,500 euro for 139 staff. A copy of Europol's draft budget for 2000 (reference 2210-87r6) giving a detailed breakdown of costs was deposited with the Parliamentary scrutiny committees on 20 September 1999.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w24.html_wqn4"><B> Dr. Harris: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what powers his Department <i>(a)</i> has and <i>(b)</i> will have after 1 April compulsorily to acquire local government properties used to house asylum seekers, (i) if it needs further such accommodation for such purposes and (ii) if it needs such accommodation on a longer basis than the local authority plans to use it for such purposes.  [112477]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w24.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Section 101 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (which comes into force on 3 April) provides that the Secretary of State may by order designate areas in England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland as reception zones. The Secretary of State may direct a local authority of the Northern Ireland Executive to make available any suitable housing accommodation within such a zone for the purpose of providing support to asylum seekers under section 95 of the 1999 Act. The period for which such accommodation is to be made available cannot exceed five years.




<P>
<P><I>6 Mar 2000 : Column: 541W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00306w24.html_para2">In relation to Scotland, the Secretary of State may not direct a local authority to provide accommodation unless Scottish ministers have confirmed that the criteria specified in a designation order are in their opinion met in relation to that authority.
<P>

<a name="00306w24.html_para3">Housing accommodation will be suitable for the purposes of the provisions of section 101 if it is unoccupied, likely to remain unoccupied for the foreseeable future if not made available, and appropriate for the accommodation of asylum seekers.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w24.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) if he will list those local authorities which are currently supporting asylum seekers who are unaccompanied minors, indicating how many such people are being supported by each such local authority;  [113318]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will list those local authorities which are currently supporting asylum seekers, indicating how many asylum seekers are being supported by each such local authority.  [113316]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w24.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Information on local authority-supported asylum seekers is available only for the Greater London local authorities. I refer the hon. Member to the reply I gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Coleman) on 9 February 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 166-67W, which gives the available information, as at 7 January 2000, on asylum seekers supported by each London borough, split between families, singles and unaccompanied minors.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w24.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what changes he has made since 2 May 1997 to the list of countries where, in terms of section 1 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996, there is in general no serious risk of persecution;  [113322]
<P>
<UL>(2) which countries are designated by him under section 1 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 as ones where there is in general no serious risk of persecution; what plans he has to amend that list; and if he will make a statement.  [113321]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w24.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The countries designated as ones where there is in general no serious risk of persecution are Bulgaria, Cyprus, Ghana, India, Pakistan, Poland and Romania. No changes have been made to this list since 2 May 1997.
<P>

<a name="00306w24.html_para4">When Part IV and Schedule 4 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 are brought into force later this year, the list of designated countries will cease to operate. Cases from these countries will then be dealt with, where appropriate, using the fairer and more effective case-specific procedures in the 1999 Act for dealing quickly with unfounded claims.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w24.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department for what reason payments to Scottish local authorities for supporting asylum seekers differ from such payments to English and Welsh local authorities.  [113319]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w24.html_spnew7"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 In England and Wales, local authorities may recover costs associated with supporting asylum seekers subject to unit cost limits of &#163;140 a week for single adults and &#163;240 a week for families. These unit costs have been agreed with the Local Government Association and the Association of London Government.




<P>
<P><I>6 Mar 2000 : Column: 542W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00306w24.html_para5">In Scotland, asylum seeking adults are supported under the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 and families and children under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995. The Home Office and the Scotland Office agreed with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, for the 1999-2000 financial year, to continue previous arrangements under which a flat rate grant of &#163;165 per person is paid for support of asylum seeking adults and families. In future, there will be United Kingdom arrangements for asylum support under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w24.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement about his Department's investigation into allegations of the misuse of public money to house asylum seekers in Northamptonshire.  [113355]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w24.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 I understand that Northamptonshire County Council is currently conducting an investigation into these allegations to determine whether there are matters that should be referred to the police for possible criminal investigation. It would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this stage.
<P>

 I propose to bring in the new support arrangements on Monday 3 April 2000 for asylum seekers who make their applications at a port of entry from that date. The entitlement of new port applicants to cash, social security and housing benefits will thereupon cease; in-country applicants do not have this entitlement.
<P>

<a name="00306w24.html_para6">Those who apply for asylum from that date and who are then detained at Oakington reception centre, whether their application is port or in-country, will go on to the new support arrangements.
<P>

<a name="00306w24.html_para7">I shall also make arrangements for asylum seekers who claim asylum and support from 3 April in Scotland or Northern Ireland and who are eligible for support to come on to the new support arrangements.
<P>

<a name="00306w24.html_para8">It is my intention to bring the new support arrangements on stream as soon as possible for other asylum seekers who make in-country applications for asylum in England and Wales and for those in England and Wales who claim asylum at their port of entry prior to 3 April 2000 who receive a negative decision and who then go on to appeal. Until then, responsibility for providing support will continue under the terms of Schedule 9 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.

 The welfare of all prisoners, including those housed in the five Private Finance Initiative Design, Construct, Manage and Finance (DCMF) prisons now open, is assessed according to the same procedures and standards. Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons conducted 21 full inspections in 1999 including three DCMF prisons, Parc, Altcourse and Lowdham Grange. Conditions for prisoners in directly managed prisons were reported to range from the unacceptable to the excellent. In his report on Parc, the Chief Inspector stated that Parc was a challenging place and that there was still much to do but that he was impressed with the potential and the obvious willingness of most staff to make the prison successful. The reports on Altcourse and Lowdham Grange prisons have not yet been published.

<P>
<a name="00306w26.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Commissioner of the Metropolitan police has informed me that, between May 1991 and 2 March 2000, 381 individuals have been investigated under the War Crimes Act 1991. He also informs me that two allegations under section 134 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (the offence of Torture) have been investigated.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many Metropolitan police officers are assigned to the investigation of cases referred to the Metropolitan police under <i>(a)</i> the War Crimes Act 1991 and <i>(b)</i> the International Convention on Torture; and if he will make a statement.  [112926]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w26.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Commissioner of the Metropolitan police has informed me that no officers are currently assigned to the investigation of cases under the War Crimes Act 1991.
<P>

<a name="00306w26.html_para9">He also informs me that no officers are assigned specifically to the investigation of allegations of torture. Officers are assigned, principally from the Organised Crime Group, as and when allegations are made.

<a name="00306w26.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Corbyn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many accidents involving police vehicles there were in each police area in each of the past three years; and what was the severity of the injuries incurred in each case.  [112924]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w26.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The information set out in the table has been provided by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, to which forces submit statistical returns. The statistics collect all incidents in which a police vehicle sustains damage, including those where no other vehicle is involved. Figures for the injury classifications are available only for collisions where the police vehicle was responding to an emergency call or in pursuit of another vehicle.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department for what reason the Charity Commission took no action following their investigation of the financial affairs of the Romanian Orphans Trust in 1998.  [112929]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w27.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 After a comprehensive review of the Romanian Orphanage Trust's activities and administration, following allegations of financial impropriety in 1998, the Charity Commission concluded there was no evidence to substantiate the allegations. The Commission decided that, while the charity was having to operate in extremely difficult circumstances, charitable funds were protected and proper safeguards and management controls were in place.
<P>

<a name="00306w27.html_para0">The Charity Commission has been in contact with the charity about new allegations which have recently come to light and is evaluating them carefully. Commission Investigation officers will continue to seek to ensure that charitable funds are used appropriately and properly.

<UL>(2) how many <i>(a)</i> police officers and <i>(b)</i> constables there will be in the Essex Constabulary at the time when the new boundaries for the Metropolitan police come into force; and if he will provide the equivalent figures for the same enlarged area for 31 March in <i>(a)</i> 1997, <i>(b)</i> 1998 and <i>(c)</i> 1999.  [113111]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w27.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The information has been provided by the Chief Constable of Essex. I understand that the force is only able to provide figures as at 1 March for each year for the number of officers in the Colchester and Tendering Divisions. These are set out in the tables.
<P>

<a name="00306w27.html_para1">Ministers have no direct control over police numbers. Under legislation passed by the previous Government in 1994, it is for individual chief constables to determine the number of police officers in their forces within the resources that are available. It is not, therefore, possible for us to estimate how many officers Essex would have had if the boundary changes had been implemented in earlier years. I understand from the Chief Constable that for 2000-01 it is estimated that the Essex Police will have 2,995 police officers (115 more than on 1 March 2000) following the boundary changes on 1 April; 2,307 out of this total will be constables (90 more than on 1 March 2000).
<P>

<a name="00306w27.html_para2">I understand from the Chief Constable that the reduction in police numbers in Colchester and Tendering Divisions is a result of centralisation of the force information room and

<P><I>6 Mar 2000 : Column: 555W</I><P>
the civilianisation of non-operational police posts. This has contributed to an increase in the number of operational officers that are available.

 On 1 April 2000, the responsibility for policing the part of Epping Forest District currently policed by the Metropolitan Police Service will transfer to the Essex Police. This area is defined in legislation as the parish of Waltham Abbey and the area of the former urban district of Chigwell. It includes Waltham Abbey, Chigwell, Loughton and Buckhurst Hill.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w27.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 On 15 October 1999, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary wrote to the Chief Executive of each local authority about the provisions in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, including the anti-social behaviour order, to tackle problems caused by unruly behaviour. An action group was subsequently established, involving representatives of local authorities and others, to consider issues relating to the use of anti-social behaviour orders. That group is now arranging a series of 10 regional seminars. The seminars will be held over the next few weeks and will provide an opportunity to share good practice, based on the rising number of successful applications for anti-social behaviour orders, and to consult on the terms of a model agreement, or protocol, which local partnerships can use as a basis for effective co-operation in tackling anti-social behaviour.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is the total cost to public funds of his Department's current recruitment advertising campaign for <i>(a)</i> press officers and <i>(b)</i> internal communications advisers; and if he will make a statement.  [113208]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00306w27.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The total cost of current press officer recruitment advertising is approximately &#163;31,700, including VAT. The Government Information and Communication Service has funded this advertising centrally, as the appointed press officers will be members of the Service and the recruitment process is likely to provide candidates for other Government press offices. There has been no cost to the Home Office. The total cost of advertising for internal communication advisers is &#163;26,555 plus VAT. In addition, Capita RAS has charged the Home Office &#163;15,300 plus VAT for its recruitment services, which include sifting and preparing interview panel facilities for the internal communication posts.

<a name="00306w27.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. Roche </B> 
 <i>[pursuant to her reply, 6 December 1999, c. 379-80W]:</i> I propose to bring in the new support arrangements on Monday 3 April 2000 for asylum seekers who make their applications at a port of entry from that date. The entitlement of new port applicants to cash, social security and housing benefits will thereupon cease; in-country applicants do not have this entitlement.
<P>

<a name="00306w27.html_para5">Those who apply for asylum from that date and who are then detained at Oakington reception centre whether their application is port or in-country will go onto the new support arrangements.
<P>

<a name="00306w27.html_para6">I shall also make arrangements for asylum seekers who claim asylum and support from 3 April in Scotland or Northern Ireland and who are eligible for support to come on to the new support arrangements.
<P>

<a name="00306w27.html_para7">It is my intention to bring the new support arrangements on stream as soon as possible for other asylum seekers who make in-country applications for asylum in England and Wales and for those in England and Wales who claim asylum at their port of entry prior to 3 April 2000 who receive a negative decision and who then go on to appeal. Until then, responsibility for providing support will continue under the terms of Schedule 9 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.
<P>

<a name="00306w27.html_para8">The new support arrangements comprehensively change the system by which asylum seekers are supported. A phased implementation of the kind described in this answer is the sensible course, drawing on the lessons from previous experience in implementing major change. The arrangements have been tested in simulated trials. Bringing port applicants on to the scheme first will enable the National Asylum Support Service to deal with any teething difficulties before rolling out the scheme fully.
<P>

<a name="00306w27.html_para9">The new support arrangements provide that asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute may be supported by the National Asylum Support Service. Support will consist of the provision of accommodation on a no-choice basis in cluster areas in the United Kingdom. Essential living needs will be met either in kind 



<P>
<P><I>6 Mar 2000 : Column: 558W</I><P>
or by the provision of vouchers. There will also be a cash voucher valued at &#163;10 per person per week which can be exchanged for cash.
<P>

<a name="00306w27.html_para10">The scheme is intended fully to meet the United Kingdom's international obligations in relation to those who are genuinely fleeing persecution while, at the same time, deterring those who are seeking to evade immigration control by using the asylum process.
<P>

<a name="00306w27.html_para11">During the passage of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, we gave an undertaking that new asylum applications from families with children would not be brought on to the new support arrangements in April 2000 unless we are satisfied that the targets of delivering most initial asylum decisions within two months and most appeals in a further four months could be met in such cases.
<P>

<a name="00306w27.html_para12">We have put in place arrangements to identify and deal promptly with new asylum applications from families with children: the arrangements are being closely monitored. As a result, provisional figures show that, of the new family applications made in eight weeks after 1 November, over 70 per cent. have received an initial decision within two months of receipt. At the end of January, the average waiting time for all asylum appeals to be dealt with by an adjudicator was 13 weeks. On this basis, I have decided that from 3 April, the new asylum support arrangements should apply to new applications from families with children as they apply to other applicants.
<P>

<a name="00306w27.html_para13">I have also decided that some modification of the targets is necessary for applications which might be the responsibility of another European Union member state under the Dublin Convention. In these cases, the process of consulting other member states normally takes more than two months, but there is then no suspensive right of appeal if another country accepts responsibility for consideration of the substantive claim. For that reason, the target for reaching an initial decision in potential Dublin cases will be to resolve most cases within four months of receipt. The normal further four month target for dealing with an appeal will apply in the event that the case is not transferred and there is a substantive refusal.
