To ask the Prime Minister what are the arrangements for hearing appeals from those who need to have access to protectively marked Government assets and have been refused security clearance or have had that clearance withdrawn. [4979]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70619w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 An independent Security Vetting Appeals Panel, chaired by Sir Anthony May, will be established on 1 July to hear appeals against refusal or withdrawal of clearance at Security Check (SC) or Developed Vetting (DV) levels and to advise the head of the organisation concerned. The Panel will be available to all those, other than recruits, in the public and private

sectors and in the Armed Forces who are subject to security vetting at these levels, have exhausted existing appeals mechanisms within their own organisations and remain dissatisfied with the result. Separate arrangements are available to staff of the security and intelligence agencies. The establishment of the Panel therefore brings to an end the role of the Three Advisers who, since 1948, have been available to consider cases where security clearance was refused or withdrawn on the grounds of subversion.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70619w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Government have expressed reservations about the principle of contracting out the management of prisons. It is generally accepted that responsibility for the incarceration of offenders must remain with the state. The issue is whether that responsibility should, as a matter of principle, be discharged through direct management in the public sector or whether it can properly and effectively be discharged under a regulatory framework. This was addressed in the recent report on prison management by the Home Affairs Select Committee; and the Government now wish to give further and careful consideration to the arguments deployed in that report before settling their overall approach to this issue.
<P>

<a name="70619w02.html_para1">Existing management contracts will be honoured, as I have already made clear. But we are considering ways in which the current regulatory framework might be strengthened. At present, all disciplinary hearings in contractually managed prisons are conducted by a state official--the Controller, a Prison Service governor, who also monitors the performance of the contractor on behalf of the responsible Prison Service Area Manager. This is an important principle from which we will not depart; and we are currently reviewing the scope for extending the Controller's powers in respect of prisoners' requests and complaints, sentence calculation, scrutiny of security classifications and frequency of security audits.

<P>

<a name="70619w02.html_para2">On the letting of new contracts and the renewal of existing contracts, our immediate approach is necessarily determined by current expenditure plans, to which we are committed, and by operational requirements.
<P>

<a name="70619w02.html_para3">We have inherited a prison population rising sharply, (well above projections) with expenditure provision for new prisons limited to establishments to be designed, constructed, managed and financed by the private sector. Even with the new prison ship, Her Majesty's Prison Weare, there is huge pressure on capacity. We have therefore decided to proceed with existing procurement plans to provide additional new places on this basis by 1999-2000. This is an urgent operational requirement to overcome projected shortfalls in accommodation and to avoid dangerous levels of overcrowding and the use of police cells. We will shortly be launching competitions to provide an 800 place Category B local prison at Agecroft, Salford, and a 400 place Young Offender Institution at Pucklechurch, near Bristol.
<P>

<a name="70619w02.html_para4">I have also authorised the renewal of the contract for the operation of Her Majesty's Prison Blakenhurst with the private sector operator, United Kingdom Detention Services. The existing contract expires on 25 May 1998; and we are required to give the operator one year's notice of a decision to renew the contract. The prison has been performing well against the current contract requirements and in comparison with comparable prisons in the public sector; and I am satisfied that the terms that have been negotiated for renewal of the contract offer value for money. The establishment could not be returned to public sector control without incurring additional expenditure, which would require offsetting savings elsewhere; and in the light of the current budgetary pressures on the Prison Service and pending our consideration of the Select Committee report, I am persuaded that no other course of action could be justified in current circumstances. However, in order to ensure that future options are kept as open as possible while our overall policy is under review, I have decided to renew the contract for 3 years only, the minimum practical--and contractually permissible--period.
<P>

<a name="70619w02.html_para5">Moreover, before further decisions are made on prison procurement beyond the extra places within existing plans or on the renewal of any other existing contracts, I have asked the Prison Service to:

I have asked senior Prison Service managers to engage in consultations with the Prison Service unions to this end.

<a name="70619w02.html_para6">Proposals for private sector area involvement in other areas of the Prison Service, which do not raise the same issues of principle, will be treated on their merits. I have authorised the extension of the contract with Group 4 to operate the court escort and custody service in Area 7. This is essentially a specialist service, distinguishable from the management of prisons; and I am satisfied both with the quality of the service being provided and with the terms negotiated for extension of the contract.

<a name="70619w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Fisher: </B> 
 Test matches involving England are among the events listed under the Broadcasting Act 1996. Rights for live television coverage of these events must be made available to broadcasters offering a generally available free to air service: currently the BBC and Channels 3 and 4. The provisions do not apply retrospectively, and consequently only contracts agreed after the Act came into force are affected. I announced in the House on 19 May that the Government was initiating a review of this list of events and the work is under way in my Department. The review will include a consultation with all interested parties.

Wherever possible such advice will make clear the present realities in Burma, including the political and human rights situation and the state of the economy. It will also draw to businessmen's attention statements by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other pro-democracy leaders discouraging trade and investment in Burma.

 <i>[holding answer 17 June 1997]:</i> I refer the hon. Member to the reply I gave to the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz) on 12 June, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>545</i>. We deplore this coup and shall continue to work for the restoration of the legitimate government in Sierra Leone without further bloodshed. Those who led the coup have no support from their own people or from the international community. International stability and respect for human rights are core parts of the FCO mission statement. They have an evident relevance to the situation in Sierra Leone.<i></i>
 
<P>

<a name="70619w03.html_para1">Several West African states, including Ghana, Nigeria and Guinea, are working together to find a peaceful settlement to the current crisis in Sierra Leone. We strongly support their efforts, which are likely to include an early high-level regional meeting to identify a way forward. I discussed the situation in Sierra Leone with the Ghanaian Deputy Foreign Minister on 18 June. I am also in touch with the Sierra Leone High Commissioner in London. We are active within both the UN and the Commonwealth about their respective roles in the search for a negotiated settlement in Sierra Leone. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs met Mr. Annan, United Nations Secretary General, on 4 June. They discussed Sierra Leone and expressed the strong hope that a negotiated settlement would be found. With partners in the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) we will consider Sierra Leone at the next CMAG meeting on 10-11 July. I discussed the prospects for this meeting with the Commonwealth Secretary on 19 June. CMAG will report to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Edinburgh in October.
<P>

<a name="70619w03.html_para2">Nigeria has long maintained a military presence of around 1,000 troops in Sierra Leone under bilateral and multilateral agreements. Twenty-four Nigerians died defending President Kabbah. Extra deployments after the coup followed appeals to regional states by President Kabbah and by the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) to assist in restoring constitutional order. We encourage Nigeria now to play a constructive role in the regional efforts to secure a negotiated settlement.
<P>

<a name="70619w03.html_para3">We are concerned that the coup in Sierra Leone should not have a destabilising influence elsewhere in the region. In particular we are watching events in neighbouring Liberia where democratic elections are due on 19 July. The universal condemnation of the coup by African states offers some reassurance that the region itself is determined not to allow the instability in Sierra Leone to spread.

 My hon. Friend will be aware that these events relate to a previous Administration.

<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what was the highest muzzle velocity of the plastic baton rounds recently found to exceed the upper limit in the equipment specification; and what is that upper limit; [4541]
<P>
<UL>(2) how often stocks of plastic baton rounds in operational use before April 1997 were tested to ensure that muzzle velocities were in line with the equipment specification; [4538]
<P>
(3) what tests were carried out by his Department on the faulty batch of plastic baton rounds supplied in 1994 and recently withdrawn from service; [4543]

<P>
<P>
<a name="70619w06.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The highest muzzle velocity of plastic baton rounds recently tested was 76 metres per second; the upper limit specified in the contract is 70 m/s.

<a name="70619w06.html_para4">In addition to initial Contractor proofing, the following tests were carried out. In 1995 trials were carried out on a number of rounds manufactured in 1994 as a part of the ongoing baton round development programme. Assessment of these initial tests in early 1996 indicated that some of the rounds were going marginally faster than the specified velocity, but the tests were not considered conclusive. Reproofing trials of the 1994 rounds started in April 1997 and the results have yet to be established. Further tests were carried out in 1996 on rounds manufactured in 1996 which indicated that those rounds did not exceed the maximum specified velocity.
<P>

<a name="70619w06.html_para5">The issue of possible action against the manufacturer will be considered when all of the facts have been established.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what are the rules for the use of plastic baton rounds by members of the armed forces in Northern Ireland; on how many occasions they have been used by members of the armed forces in Northern Ireland since the batch with and excessive muzzle velocity was supplied in 1994; and if he will list the dates on which and the places where they were used; [4546]
<P>
<UL>(2) what estimate he has made of the number of plastic baton rounds used by the armed forces in Northern Ireland since the batch with an excessive muzzle velocity was supplied in 1994. [4545]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70619w06.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The use of force in Northern Ireland is governed by the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967 which provides that "A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime, or in effecting or assisting the lawful arrest of offenders or suspected offenders or of persons unlawfully at large". Plastic baton rounds are used by the armed forces in situations of violent disorder where life or property is at risk and their use is judged to be minimum and reasonable force in the circumstances. They must be fired at selected persons and not indiscriminately and should be aimed so they strike the lower part of the body. Soldiers are fully trained in their use.
<P>

<a name="70619w06.html_para7">As at 17 June 1997, a total of 1,424 plastic baton rounds had been used by the armed forces in Northern Ireland since the batch with an excessive muzzle velocity was supplied in May 1994, not all of which were from that batch.
<P>

<a name="70619w06.html_para8">I will write to my hon. Friend with a schedule of the dates and places where these baton rounds have been used, once this has been prepared.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70619w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Government support market testing as one of several means at their disposal to secure better value for money in the provision of public services. There is, however, no dogmatic preference for private over public provision or vice versa, or for market testing where it is not appropriate. On this basis we have reviewed the Department's market testing programme and have set out our conclusions in a policy statement on getting the best value from defence resources. This is being widely distributed within the Department, to the Trade Unions and other staff representatives and to industry associations. I am placing a copy of the statement in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="70619w07.html_para1">The statement emphasises the imperative for continuous improvements in efficiency; pays tribute to the huge contribution made by the Department's Service and Civil Service personnel working together; welcomes private sector involvement where this is cost-effective; and enjoins managers throughout the Department to pursue best value from defence resources in a manner which is rigorous, undoctrinaire, open minded and scrupulously fair.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what steps he is taking to recruit more speech therapists in Wales. [4459]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70619w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 The recruitment of NHS staff is a matter for individual Trusts. Additional funding is being provided from 1997-98 onwards to increase the numbers of students being trained and to enhance the number of clinical placements across Wales. This will encourage recruitment in areas where qualified Speech and Language Therapists are required. I will be keeping a close watch on progress in recruiting qualified Speech and Language Therapists.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70619w09.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Plastic baton rounds were first used in Northern Ireland in 1973, and a total of 65,204 rounds have been used. There have been 14 fatalities associated with their use.

[4551]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70619w09.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The use of plastic baton rounds is governed by section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967 which provides that "A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime, or in effecting or assisting the lawful arrest of offenders or suspected offenders or of persons unlawfully at large."
<P>

<a name="70619w09.html_para8">The RUC's operational guidelines specify that baton guns will be used only "in accordance with the principle of the minimum and reasonable amount of force necessary in the protection of life and property, the preservation of the peace and the prevention and detection of crime." They also place limitations on the firing of baton rounds at a range of less than 20 metres to situations where the safety of police officers or others is seriously threatened, direct that firing should be at selected persons and not indiscriminately at the crowd, and aimed so that they 



<P>
<P><I>19 Jun 1997 : Column: 279</I><P>
strike the lower part of the target's body direct. A higher point of aim is permitted only if the safety of police officers or others is seriously threatened and the attacker's body is shielded from the firer.
<P>

<a name="70619w09.html_para9">In his 1996 Inspection of the RUC Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary reported that "The RUC conditions/restrictions in use are clearly defined and accord with those issued by the Home Secretary to Forces in England and Wales, save that the authority levels for use of baton rounds and their subsequent operational controls are lower."
<P>

<a name="70619w09.html_para10">The RUC, in conjunction with ACPO colleagues, in England and Wales is currently revising guidelines on the use of baton rounds with a view to recommending common guidelines for use by police throughout the United Kingdom.

In addition to work on internal systems and with its suppliers, NATS has also initiated discussions on the Year 2000 problem with its customers and related air traffic control organisations.

it is not presently illegal to advertise a mileage correction service. Equally, it is not illegal to tamper with an odometer and there may be legitimate reasons for wanting to do so. Tampering might be an offence if, on evidence, it is found that such an action assisted in the commissioning of an offence.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70619w10.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Strang: </B> 
 I am today launching the Roads Review. The objective of the Review will be to determine the role which roads should play in an integrated transport policy and to establish a forward investment programme for the trunk road network in England.
<P>

<a name="70619w10.html_para0">The Review will be broadly based. Unlike reviews carried out by the previous Government, it will not merely consider what road schemes should be added to or deleted from the trunk roads programme. It will look afresh at the environmental impact of roads and take into account parallel work on developing an integrated transport policy for the UK which my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister announced recently, including, in particular, work on issues such as whether steps should be taken to manage demand for travel by road, and if so, what means should be used; and, the extent to which we should encourage the use of other modes of transport. It will also consider the role which new technology and improved information systems can play; and the impact which investment in roads could have on regional development. The Roads Review, work on an integrated transport policy and the comprehensive spending review will be very closely co-ordinated.
<P>

<a name="70619w10.html_para1">We intend to consult widely during the Review. During the next few weeks my Department will be consulting key representative bodies both about the range of issues which need to be covered and how we might involve them effectively in the Review. We then intend to launch a public consultation in July, inviting responses by the end of October. We would particularly value contributions from the Regional Planning Conferences, local authorities and other regional bodies. We shall consider in due course what arrangements will be appropriate for continuing 



<P>
<P><I>19 Jun 1997 : Column: 282</I><P>
regional consultations on trunk road planning beyond the Review, taking account of the comments received in response to the previous Government's proposal to bring trunk roads within the Regional Planning Guidance system.
<P>

<a name="70619w10.html_para2">We hope to announce the conclusions of the Review next Spring. In the interim the Highways Agency will continue to take forward maintenance work, small safety schemes, and two re-signing projects in line with existing plans. Schemes on which construction is already well advanced will continue, but preparatory work on new major schemes will be put on hold at the end of the current stage, except in the relatively few cases in which some procedural step needs to be taken to ensure that work done to date is not lost should we ultimately decide that the scheme should be taken forward. Work on developer funded schemes will also continue as these schemes either have been or will be scrutinised thoroughly in the appropriate planning processes and they are generally small improvements which do not have any wider strategic significance.
<P>

<a name="70619w10.html_para3">There are also 12 cases on which urgent decisions are pending. We therefore propose to carry out an accelerated review of these cases against the criteria of accessibility, safety, economy and environmental impact and announce our decisions on them in July. It may be that in some of these cases we decide in July that a decision cannot be taken in advance of the main Review. In the majority of cases we will take a decision either to take the scheme forward or to abandon it. The cases in question are:

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what further steps the Government plans to take to stop the illegal trade in wild animals and plants. [3800]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70619w11.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Police and HM Customs are Excise are primarily responsible for enforcing the controls on the trade in wildlife. The Government is committed to supporting their work and recognises that controls on trade will contribute to wildlife conservation only if they are fully and effectively enforced.
<P>

<a name="70619w11.html_para0">The Government will continue to contribute to efforts to crack down on the illegal wildlife trade both at home and abroad, through its participation in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Police and Customs officers are part of the UK delegation to the CITES Conference currently taking place in Zimbabwe. The UK signed a Memorandum of Understanding on enforcement with the CITES Secretariat on 12 June. This will secure more rapid and effective exchange of information between the Secretariat and UK enforcement agencies during investigations into the illegal wildlife trade.
<P>

<a name="70619w11.html_para1">A new EC Regulation on the wildlife trade came into force on 1 June. The UK fully supports the new Regulation, and will continue to make a full contribution to the new EC Enforcement Working Group which was established last year.
<P>

<a name="70619w11.html_para2">A new Statutory Instrument, The Control of Trade in Endangered Species (Enforcement) Regulations 1997, also came into force on 1 June. It strengthens enforcement officers' powers, and increases penalties for breaches of the EC Regulation.
<P>

<a name="70619w11.html_para3">The Government also attaches importance to the Partnership for Action Against Wildlife Crime. This has already shown that the Department of the Environment, the Crown Prosecution Service, the statutory enforcement agencies and responsible voluntary bodies can work together effectively in this field.

 The Secretary of State is the competent authority of transit for the whole of the United Kingdom for transfrontier shipments of waste under Council Regulation (EEC) No. 259/93. He has delegated the day-to-day administration of this function to the Environment Agency. Also, section 84(2)(b) of the Water Resources Act 1991 places a statutory duty on the Environment Agency to consult, in such cases as it may consider appropriate, with the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency over water quality objectives.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70619w11.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 We have today issued a consultation paper to all local authorities in England. That paper sets out our proposals for the distribution of any additional spending between local authorities.
<P>

<a name="70619w11.html_para5">We wish to ensure that spending generated under the receipts initiative will be directed towards priority housing needs. Capital receipts themselves, however, have not always been generated in the areas of greatest need. Some authorities have generated significant volumes of receipts but have relatively low needs. Others have had little or no scope to generate significant receipts, yet have particularly high needs. We are, therefore, proposing that resources should be allocated on the basis of one third according to the proportion of eligible set-aside receipts and the remaining two thirds in accordance with assessed need.
<P>

<a name="70619w11.html_para6">The paper also sets out our objectives for spending. Our intention is that the resources will be targeted on housing and housing-related regeneration schemes. We, therefore, wish to ensure that local authorities integrate the additional spending into their housing strategies, plan for badly needed repairs to dilapidated stock and support new provision where it is needed.
<P>

<a name="70619w11.html_para7">It is also our intention that this initiative should contribute to and complement this Government's wider policy of increasing training opportunities and leading the young unemployed into work and financial independence.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70619w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 A consultation paper was issued last November on a proposal that householders should in future be able to extend their gardens onto adjacent land, without needing to submit a planning application. The Department received 425 replies, copies of which have now been placed in the Department's library. Three hundred and sixty-one expressed opposition and only 34 



<P>
<P><I>19 Jun 1997 : Column: 287</I><P>
offered support. Many objections concentrated on the damage impact that such a proposal could have on the open countryside with the creeping suburbanisation of specially protected areas such as the National Parks and the Green Belt. Concern was also expressed about the resulting lack of control over the erection of ancillary buildings and the absence of any size limit on the land which could be added to a garden.
<P>

<a name="70619w12.html_para0">The Government's view is that the impact of a proposed garden extension is best considered, as at present, through the normal planning process and my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Wales and I have therefore decided to withdraw this proposal.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70619w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradley: </B> 
 There is no national limit on the amount of rent which can be covered by Housing Benefit for single people under 25. The single room rent is determined by independent Rent Officers for the locality in which the claimant lives. The single room rent restriction was introduced by the previous administration in October 1996. They initiated a monitoring exercise and we will look at the results carefully. The Government has also commissioned research to gauge the impact of this, and other measures. The results are expected next year.

<P>
<a name="70619w12.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Commission Regulation 716/96, under which the over-30-months scheme (OTMS) operates, expressly prohibits the purchase of animals showing any clinical signs of BSE. BSE suspects are being sent for direct incineration under entirely separate arrangements. Nevertheless, it is now the practice of the Intervention Board, which has executive responsibility for the day to day operation of the OTMS, to consult the Environment Agency and the local authority about the suitability of any dry or tallow storage facilities offered to it for OTMS material. The local Member of Parliament is also informed that these consultations are taking place. Contracts would be let only for stores which comply with the waste management provisions of Part II of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and related Regulations and which have, or where appropriate, are likely to be granted, local authority planning approval which would allow for the storage of meat and bone meal or tallow. No new cold storage facilities for OTMS carcases are under consideration.

 The Department is aware that where badger setts undermine farm tracks or fields they can pose a serious risk to farm machinery. In such cases, farmers should apply to the relevant Regional Service Centre for a licence under the provisions of the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 to close down those holes of the sett which pose a risk.

 The Government accepts that in general the export of live animals is a legal trade. However we have made clear our strong preference for meat to be exported on the hook rather than on the hoof; that we will seriously consider banning the export of calves for rearing in narrow veal crates if the European Court of Justice in its forthcoming judgment finds this to be legal; and that we wish the new EU rules on welfare in transit, as now implemented through the Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997, to be strictly and scrupulously enforced. We are also reviewing current procedure relating to the inspection and certification of live animals for export.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70619w13.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 June 1997]:</i> The amino acid tryptophan occurs naturally in a wide range of crops, including soya. In assessing the safety of the genetically modified soya, the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes compared the levels of tryptophan present with those found in non-GM varieties of soya and concluded that they were equivalent. The committee also considered the results of a range of animal feeding studies, none of which showed any adverse effects. As a further safeguard, the company which applied for the authorisation has agreed to monitor the genetic stability of the crop by providing periodic updates on the levels of nutrients in both the genetically modified and related non-genetically modified forms.

 No. In general, patients should be given sufficient information to enable them to make an informed decision before any diagnostic test. For hepatitis C, this would include discussion of the treatment options, the consequences of a positive test and advice about lifestyle. However, when the Chief Medical Officer wrote to all doctors on 3 April 1995 about the "Look Back" exercise to identify those infected with hepatitis C through blood transfusion, the letter specified that counselling should be made available before and after testing for those found to be infected in this way.

 An amendment to the regulations covering the provision of malarial prophylaxis came into force on February 1995 and since then travellers have to pay for their anti-malarial drugs. The number of cases of malaria reported in the United Kingdom for the last 10 years is given in the table. There have been 325 cases of malaria reported to the Malaria Reference Laboratory for the period January to March 1997; this compares to 397 cases reported for the same period in 1996 and 314 in 1995. The number of cases of malaria varies each year and reflects the variations in transmission in the endemic areas as well as the number of people travelling to malarious areas. We will continue to monitor the situation.

 General Practitioner exercise on prescription schemes are being adopted at local level.

Individual local health care teams are best placed to decide which facility would deliver the greatest benefit to the patient. Detailed guidance for primary health care teams is contained in the Health Education Authority's document "Promoting Physical Activity in Primary Care".

 The Department obtains advice on the health implications of exposure to electromagnetic fields from the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) and other sources including its own funded research. The primary focus of concern has been on power lines and childhood cancer where the results have not shown a proven link: the NRPB's Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation conducted an extensive review of the subject in 1992 and concluded that there was no firm evidence of a carcinogenic hazard from exposure that might be associated with residence near major sources of electricity supply, the use of electrical appliances or work in the electrical, electronic and telecommunication industries. The Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment has endorsed the Advisory Group's report. A supplementary report in 1994 was published by the NRPB to take into account the results of epidemiological

 The total number of HIV positive individuals (including those with AIDS) receiving treatment in 1995 in England was 13,146. In Wales the corresponding total was 197. These data are derived from the National Survey of Prevalent Diagnosed HIV Infections, and record all identified HIV infected patients treated by statutory services during 1995. This is the latest year for which figures are available. The data cover all areas in England but there may be a small element of under reporting. The breakdown of numbers treated in each Regional Office area in England is as follows:

<a name="70619w15.html_para3">The funds are no longer ringfenced and it is up to health authorities, taking account of local needs assessment and priorities, to determine their local priorities for expenditure. The allocations for AIDS treatment and care in England for 1996-97 totalled &#163;185.7 million, the reduction was because the latest AIDS projections report indicated that the number of people alive with AIDS and severe HIV disease in 1996-97 would be around 10 per cent. lower than previously projected. The allocations for 1997-98 are &#163;199.6 million. This increase represents a contribution towards the costs of new combination therapies. In 1995-96 &#163;49.6 million was allocated to health authorities in England for HIV prevention. These funds continue to be ringfenced, and the corresponding totals for 1996-97 and 1997-98 are &#163;51.3 and &#163;52.3 million respectively. In Wales the majority of expenditure on HIV/AIDS is targeted at preventative measures. The expenditure in 1995-96 totals &#163;2.2 million.

 Scottish Environment Ministers have attended three Environment Councils since 1992. In line with our Manifesto commitment that a Labour Government would mean Scotland's concerns being heard at the heart of Europe, Scottish Ministers work closely with their colleagues to ensure Scotland's interests in European matters are taken fully into account. Their attendance at Council meetings, where matters of interest to Scotland are to be discussed, clearly contributes to the delivery of our commitment.

 The information requested is not held centrally and the data could be collated only at a disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="70619w16.html_para3">Up to 1995-96 the information requested is within the annual reports of individual river purification boards, which are available in the House Library. However, information on convictions in the former island council areas is not held centrally. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency is presently considering the information which should be contained within its 1996-97 annual report and we will bring this issue to its attention.

 There are no present plans to modify the Control of Pollution Act 1974. The Act may however need to be amended in the light of developments in relation to the EC water framework directive currently under negotiation.

 Aberdeen and Northern Marts carried out a feasibility study on a computerised tracing system for Scottish cattle in 1994. This voluntary system was considered by the Department, as were contributions from other sources. Circumstances have changed considerably since then. Both the Government and the industry ascribe great importance to the introduction of a mandatory national system. We are proceeding urgently on this basis.

 Consistent with the practice of previous administrations and in order to protect the privacy of individuals, only aggregate information on the salaries of special advisers will be published. Once all salaries have been agreed the number of advisers paid in each of the appropriate &#163;10,000 bands will be published.
