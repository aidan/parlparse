<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Llwyd: </B> 
To ask the Leader of the House what recent changes there have been in the use of the Welsh language in the conduct of public business by the House; and if he will make a statement.  [158026]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The most recent change in the use of the Welsh language in the formal proceedings of the House followed the First Report of the Procedure Committee in 2000&#150;01 (HC 47). On 5&nbsp;March 2001, the House endorsed the Committee's recommendation that Welsh could be used by Select Committee witnesses giving evidence in Westminster, as well as in Wales.

To ask the Leader of the House if he will make it his policy to have senior Ministers reply to debates in Westminster Hall.  [160094]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Since its creation in 1999 Westminster Hall has proved itself a popular and valuable debating chamber covering a wide variety of political issues. Government Departments take into consideration the topic of the debate and the division of ministerial responsibilities when deciding which Minister should respond. It is not necessarily the case that the Minister most suited to responding will be the most senior Minister in any given Department. However, all Ministers who respond to debates in Westminster Hall do so with the full authority of the relevant Secretary of State.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w01.html_wqn2"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what action the Government are taking to improve air quality, with particular reference to use of alternative road fuels.  [159326]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Alternative fuels receive considerable support from Government, in the form of significant fuel duty incentives, grants for vehicle conversions under the PowerShift Programme, and reduced rates of Vehicle Excise Duty and company car tax for cleaner vehicles. In the December 2003 pre-Budget report, the Chancellor published the Alternative Fuels Framework, which sets out the basis on which support will, in future, be provided for clean, low carbon road transport fuels. In particular, it includes a commitment to provide three-year certainty on duty differentials for all alternative fuels from Budget 2004.

<a name="40308w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Paul Marsden: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will list in descending order airlines using British airports by their air safety records.  [159313]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The safety of UK airlines is overseen by the Civil Aviation Authority to a high standard. Foreign airlines operating to the United Kingdom are required to be operated in accordance with the minimum safety standards established by the International Civil Aviation Organisation. They are regulated by aviation authorities of their home states.

<P>
<a name="40308w01.html_wqn4"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment he has made of the impact of changes in grants for people to convert vehicles to run on liquefied petroleum gas.  [159322]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Currently, grants are available for the purchase/conversion of vehicles to run on liquefied petroleum gas under the Powershift and CleanUp programmes administered by the Energy Saving Trust. In 2003&#150;04 these two programmes provided grants for the purchase/conversion of around 3,000 vehicles. In response to this year's increase in demand for these programmes, the Trust have discussed the appropriate level of Powershift and CleanUp grants for next year with stakeholders, and estimate that a similar number of vehicles will be converted/purchased during 2004&#150;05.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w01.html_wqn5"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what steps the Government is taking to meet its targets on use of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;compressed natural gas and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;hydrogen as road fuels.  [159323]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Our plans for encouraging the promotion and use of clean, low carbon vehicles and fuels are set out in the Powering Future Vehicles Strategy, published in July 2002. The Government has no formal targets for the use of compressed natural gas (CNG) or hydrogen as road fuels. But it supports the development and use of these and other clean, low carbon fuels in a number of ways, including through fuel duty differentials and other fiscal incentives, and by means of purchase grants to offset the additional cost of vehicles operating on these fuels. The Chancellor of the Exchequer confirmed in the Pre-Budget Report in December 2003, for example, that compressed natural gas (CNG) would continue to benefit from the very low fuel duty levels it currently enjoys for at least another three years. We are also currently supporting the trials of three hydrogen-powered buses in London, and subject to the outcome of these trials the Government intends to exempt hydrogen from fuel duty for a limited period in the future to encourage further development and uptake.

<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Paul Marsden: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will list for each local authority the cost of a bus pass for pensioners.  [159349]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Under the Transport Act 2000, all local authorities are required to issue a bus pass free of charge to older and disabled people entitling the holder to local bus travel within their district for at least half the single journey bus fare. However, local authorities are able to offer more generous schemes or alternative schemes to the statutory minimum if they wish. Many local authorities offer alternative travel schemes, which 



<P>
<P><I>8 Mar 2004 : Column 1238W</I><P>
entitle older people to greater travel benefits and in some cases an annual fee is charged for the pass for these alternative schemes. The cost and extent of the alternative pass varies from one local authority to another. Those that charged for the pass for an alternative scheme, following the introduction of the statutory minimum scheme in June 2001, are listed in the following table, which is reproduced from Transport Statistics Bulletin "Concessionary Bus Fares Schemes England 200l", a copy of which is available in the House of Commons Library. This is currently being updated and the latest information will be published later this year. Other authorities providing an alternative scheme may offer the pass free of charge.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what the <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;expected in-service delivery date and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;cost of the computerised MOT test were when the contract was let; and what they are expected to be now.  [159594]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The information is as follows:
<P>

<a name="40308w01.html_para0"><i></i><i>(a)</i>&nbsp;in the original contract the expected start of roll-out date for the computerised service was May 2002 at a transaction charge per recorded test of &#163;1.07.
<P>

<a name="40308w01.html_para1"><i></i><i>(b)</i>&nbsp;the current contract stipulates that roll-out of the service should have started by mid-February 2004 with no increase in transaction charge. The start of the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency's (VOSA) testing has been delayed following slippage in SBS Software and an independent review of progress has recommended changes to plans to reduce risk and allow for additional testing. In the light of the review team's recommendations VOSA are discussing a revised programme with SBS. Discussions are not yet complete&#151;but on current expectations the service is unlikely to be rolled out until late 2004.

<a name="40308w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what penalty clauses are available for his Department to invoke should Siemens fail to deliver the computerisation of the MOT test <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;on time, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;within cost estimates and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;to the specification.  [159595]<P>
<P>

 This is a PFI contract between my Department's Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) and Siemens Business Services (SBS) and SBS bear the risk of late or unsatisfactory delivery of the service. The contract provides that if MOT Computerisation is not delivered:

<P>

<a name="40308w01.html_para2"><i></i><i>(a)</i>&nbsp;on time&#151;SBS would not receive payments under the contract until the computerised service is available to MOT stations and delay would reduce the term of the contract. Therefore SBS would be penalised by extra costs as well as reduced income and profit;
<P>

<a name="40308w01.html_para3"><i></i><i>(b)</i>&nbsp;within cost estimates&#151;under the contract SBS would bear the risk of increased development costs. They could also be subject to claims for liquidated and other damages for extra VOSA costs if they are responsible for delays;

<a name="40308w01.html_para4"><i></i><i>(c)</i>&nbsp;to the specification&#151;the system will not be rolled out to MOT stations until it has satisfactorily completed field trials against the specification. SBS would bear the cost of corrective action to meet the specification and of consequent delays and would not receive any payments until the service is operational. Under the contract VOSA can withhold some transaction payments from SBS if the operation of the system does not meet specified minimum service levels.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Transport and accessibility are vitally important factors in social exclusion in remote and rural areas. The Government's strategy for improving access to jobs and key services for people in remote and deprived areas is set out in the SEU Report "Making the connections" which the DfT is responsible for implementing. The strategy contains 37 key policies, which crucially do not just involve improving transport but changing where and how services are delivered. Sixteen of the policies have already been implemented 



<P>
<P><I>8 Mar 2004 : Column 1240W</I><P>
and a further thirteen policies and initiatives are under way, including a project to improve travel information and journey planning for job seekers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Good progress is being made on the government's message of safer driving, which is taken forward under the THINK! road safety publicity campaign. THINK! uses a range of media channels&#151;TV, radio, press, posters etc.&#151;to provide a national platform to complement regional police and local authority activities. In addition it encourages broader support from private sector partners and works to generate media interest in road safety issues. Current awareness of THINK! stands at 71&nbsp;per cent. among all drivers and 89&nbsp;per cent. among male drivers under 35-years-old.
<P>

<a name="40308w02.html_para1">The THINK! campaign covers various themes throughout the year. The dangers of driver distraction caused by use of mobiles phones while driving was a key safety message in spring last year. More recently, we ran promotional activity to publicise the new regulations regarding hand held mobile phones introduced in December 2003.
<P>

<a name="40308w02.html_para2">Activity included national radio advertising, national press advertising, e-mail information to the top 1,000 UK companies/central and local government departments, a national press release, plus use of Variable Message Signs on motorways. We also produced new guidance, including leaflets, posters and information on the THINK! and DfT websites, for road safety officers in Local Authorities and others.
<P>

<a name="40308w02.html_para3">Research carried out for the Department by TNS in February 2004 showed that 96&nbsp;per cent. of drivers were aware of the new mobile phones law. The research also showed that, there was an increase in the number of drivers claiming to keep their mobile phones switched off while driving, from 17&nbsp;per cent. in November 2003 to 23&nbsp;per cent. in February 2004.
<P>

<a name="40308w02.html_para4">The Department will continue to re-iterate the dangers of driver distraction surrounding the use of mobile phones, focussing on the simple message "Switch off before you drive off".

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what plans he has to introduce statutory regulation on emissions from <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;motorcycles and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;powered two-wheel vehicles.  [159179]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Emissions from new motor cycles and other powered two wheeled machines are already regulated by the Motor Cycles Etc (EC Type Approval) Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999 No. 2920) as amended by The Motorcycles Etc. (EC Type Approval) (Amendment) Regulations 2003. The former mandates the emissions standards in EU directive 97/24/EC to be met by all new machines entering service from 17&nbsp;June 2003. The 2003 regulations mandate the more stringent two stage standards in EU directive 2002/51/EC for new motorcycles entering service from 1&nbsp;July 2004 and from 1&nbsp;January 2007.

 I receive letters from time to time, from individual members of the public, requesting for reasons of safety, privacy and nuisance that helicopters and light aircraft should be restricted from flying over urban areas.
<P>

<a name="40308w02.html_para6">A number of respondents to the consultation in 2000 on "Control of Noise from Civil Aircraft" suggested that the height restrictions specified in Rule 5 (Low Flying) of the Rules of the Air Regulations 1996 should be tightened so as to lessen noise. However, that consultation did not specifically encompass the Rules of the Air regulations, which are primarily safety-related.

 The Government provides a number of incentives to encourage the purchase and use of clean, low carbon vehicles. The Vehicle Excise Duty regime, for example, is structured so that those who choose the cleanest, most fuel efficient vehicles can save themselves up to &#163;110 a year (or up to &#163;165 if they choose a fully electric car). The new company car tax system introduced in April 2002 provides very large incentives to encourage the purchase of clean, fuel-efficient cars. Early evidence suggests that it has already had a significant impact in the company car market. And, under the Government's PowerShift programme, which is administered by the Energy Saving Trust, purchase grants are available to incentivise the market for clean, low carbon vehicles and technologies. Officials in my Department work closely with their colleagues in the Treasury and Inland Revenue on these and other transport taxation issues.

New hybrid electric models have recently been launched, and manufacturers are predicting total sales in excess of 2,000 vehicles for 2004.

 Local authorities are able to use the Department's Rural Bus Subsidy Grant to support post bus services. These services may also be eligible to claim Bus Service Operator's Grant from the Department. Post bus projects have been awarded funding under our Rural Bus Challenge competition. I understand that the Countryside Agency has also provided funding to support post buses. In addition of course local authorities may use resources from the Revenue Support Grant for this purpose.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what action the Government have taken to give accredited recovery vehicles <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;higher priority in congested traffic and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;permission to run on the hard shoulder as set out at paragraph 3.143, of the White Paper, "A New Deal for Transport: Better for Everyone".

<P>
<a name="40308w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> Following discussion between the emergency services, officials from the Department for Transport and the Highways Agency and representatives of vehicle rescue and recovery operators, in November 2003 the Association of Chief Police Officers produced agreed guidance on use of the hard shoulder. The guidance makes clear that general use of the hard shoulder by recovery vehicles would not be appropriate where traffic is free flowing or where congestion has been caused by an unplanned incident. Where the latter has occurred, priority must be given to the emergency services. However, it identified certain circumstances where recovery services could be permitted to use the hard shoulder, for example where drivers or passengers of broken down vehicles are considered to be at risk and traffic is stationary or very slow moving for an extended period. Authority for such use is granted on a case by case basis by the police.

 As part of Defra-funded research, the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) has in recent years placed observers on UK vessels in a number of fisheries to monitor small cetacean by-catch.
<P>

<a name="40308w05.html_para1">As part of a new five year Defra-funded contract which started in 2003, SMRU has continued to place observers on UK vessels in the offshore bass fishery and plans to monitor other pelagic trawl fisheries and selected gillnet fisheries.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what progress has been made in developing an effective treatment against highly resistant varroa mites.  [157781]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Recent experience both on the European Continent and in North America has shown that there is a spread of resistance to most medicament treatments applied to control the varroa mite. Misuse of proprietary products or use of illegal treatments has been found to be the cause of resistance in most cases.
<P>

<a name="40308w05.html_para4">In the UK, resistance to the two pyrethroid-based varroacides, Apistan and Bayvarol, was first detected in Devon in 2001. Resistance was detected early through the monitoring programme conducted by the Central Science Laboratory's (CSL) National Bee Unit. This enabled action to be taken prior to the widespread colony collapse which has been experienced in other countries. Continued monitoring by beekeepers and CSL demonstrates that resistance is still localised. In many parts of the UK pyrethroids retain their high efficacy.
<P>

<a name="40308w05.html_para5">The introduction to the UK market in 2003 of Apiguard, a non-pyrethroid-based treatment for varroa, now means that beekeepers are able to apply this product to their colonies, ideally as part of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach to combating pyrethroid-resistant mites.
<P>

<a name="40308w05.html_para6">Measures funded by Defra to protect bee health include training and technical advice to beekeepers in order to help them become more self-reliant through improved bee husbandry, in particular dealing with varroa. Defra is also currently funding research investigating the use of entomopathogenic fungi as possible microbial control agents of varroa.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w05.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 DFID has received no representations to channel more aid assistance towards fighting malaria on the basis that HIV/AIDS rates are stabilising in Africa, or, any specific representations about trends in HIV/AIDS rates. The global UNAIDS epidemic update of December 2003 (available at www.unaids.org) records that among some populations in sub-Saharan Africa, for example in Zambia, and groups, for example, pregnant women, HIV rates are stabilising. However, UNAID's overall conclusions are that we are not witnessing a decline in sub-Saharan Africa's epidemic. Even if prevalence rates stabilise it may not mean that infection rates have dropped. Rather, it may mean that a persistently high number of new infections is offset by an increasing number of deaths. In such cases it will still be necessary to fully support prevention programmes, while scaling up provision for treatment and care. In terms of African countries where the UK's support is predominantly through budget support, decisions on the balance of investment between different public health priorities are for country governments to make.
<P>

<a name="40308w05.html_para7">DFID has contributed &#163;48&nbsp;million over the period September 1999 to March 2004 to Roll Back Malaria who operate globally but with priority given to sub-Saharan Africa where the burden is highest. We have committed $280&nbsp;million over eight years to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 Malaria is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in many developing countries, limiting economic and social development. It is understood to be both a disease of poverty and a cause of poverty. Annual economic growth in countries with high malaria transmission is lower than in countries without malaria and in some African countries it penalises economic growth by up to 1.3&nbsp;per cent. per year. This leads to substantial differences in GDP between countries and severely restrains the economic growth of the entire region.
<P>

<a name="40308w06.html_para1">The social impact of malaria includes the loss of earnings, human pain and suffering. It hampers children's social development and educational opportunities. The disease affects individual and household decision-making in ways that have a negative impact on economic productivity and growth.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w06.html_spnew12"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The security and integrity of the database are integral to maintaining trust in the identity cards scheme.

<P>

<a name="40308w06.html_para16">The specifications and design of the database and its security features will take into account security advice from the earliest stages. The design process will include threat and vulnerability assessments. Threats which will be assessed will include unauthorised internal and external access to data.

 The National Identity Register will link each individual's record to a biometric that is unique to that person. This means that even without a card being produced, it will be possible to check someone's biometric information directly with the National Identity Register to establish his or her identity. This could be done with the person's consent or without consent in certain limited circumstances such as establishing the identity of persons who have been arrested for deceiving an immigration officer as to their real identity.

 There is no national proof of age card and therefore no figures are held centrally for the number of cards issued by the various existing card schemes.
<P>

<a name="40308w06.html_para17">The Government's plans for a national identity cards scheme would provide a nationally accepted, useful and secure way of proving and determining age when young people wish to purchase age restricted products such as alcohol. However, this is some way in the future&#151;the introduction of plain identity cards on a phased basis would, on current plans, begin during 2007&#150;08.
<P>

<a name="40308w06.html_para18">In the shorter term, the Government have a strong interest in initiatives like the British Retail Consortium's Proof of Age Standards Scheme (PASS) which establishes a common standard for issuing the various proof of age cards that are available. This should go some way towards assisting retailers in recognising and accepting reputable cards when requesting proof of ID and for young people to prove their age.

 As at 26&nbsp;February, of a total of 1,808 family quarters in the Aldershot constituency, 247 were unoccupied. 113 of the properties had been unoccupied for more than three months. Unoccupied service family housing may be allocated or under offer to incoming families, awaiting modernisation or earmarked for disposal.

 The British Forces Post Office presently situated at Inglis Barracks and Frith Lane, Mill Hill is planned to move to RAF Northolt. The relocation of BFPO forms part of a wider consolidation of the MOD estate in London through Project MODEL (Ministry of Defence Estate London). The timetable for the relocation depends on the construction of a new operational facility at RAF Northolt, and the current project programme suggests that construction work will not be finished until the first quarter of 2007 at the earliest.

<P>

<a name="40308w08.html_para0">Following completion of the new facility, at RAF Northolt, there would then be a period of approximately six months to transfer operations to RAF Northolt and to decommission the Mill Hill site in readiness for disposal. These dates are subject to the MOD's usual project approval process.

<a name="40308w08.html_para1">Preliminary discussions have already taken place with the Local Planning Authority and others, such as English Partnership on the future re-use of the site with a view to developing over the next 12 months a development framework document for the Inglis Barracks site and the surrounding area. The negotiations will address the future of both the officers' mess and war memorial.

 The two Konver programmes which ran from 1993&#150;94 and from 1995&#150;99 were aimed at areas affected by the running down of defence-related industries and military installations, and the measures funded included training for new jobs, support for other businesses, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, and the conversion and re-use of ex-military land.

<a name="40308w09.html_para0">The Ministry of Defence's resettlement programme which supports Service leavers moving from the armed forces to civilian life predated the Konver programme and was not affected by the closure of Konver II in 1999. Until October 1998, the career transition services programme was managed in-house, and the current contract placed in 1998, is not due to expire until September 2005.

 At this stage it is not possible to give a meaningful average figure. Over 34,000 claims have been received, the majority by the Army Medal Office (AMO), which has had to spend more time than is usual to acknowledge the huge number of letters which have arrived in the last four months. This has delayed the assessing of individual claims, though the backlog of letters requiring acknowledgement has now been cleared. The AMO are aiming to process between 250 and 300 cases a week, but many variables can and do impinge on this target.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w10.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Calton: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether sufficient funds are available from the money committed by the G8 in Canada in 2002 for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries fund for top-up debt relief to provide the sum required for Ethiopia to meet the sustainable debt to export ratio set by the World Bank.  [158574]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w10.html_spnew0"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Following the enhancement of the HIPC Initiative in 1999, it became apparent that some countries would reach Completion Point with deteriorated debt indicators compared to the projections at Decision Point. As a result, the Initiative provides the option of additional debt relief, or 'topping-up', at Completion Point, beyond that committed at Decision Point, when exceptional and exogenous factors have caused a substantial deterioration in a country's long-term debt sustainability. At the G8 summit in Kananaskis, leaders agreed to fund the financing shortfall in the HIPC Trust Fund, pledging up to an extra US $1 billion, part of which would be used to cover additional costs of topping up.
<P>

<a name="40308w10.html_para0">Ethiopia is shortly expected to reach its HIPC Completion Point with a debt-to-export ratio in excess of the 150&nbsp;per cent. target set by the IMF and World Bank, and so should be eligible for consideration for topping up. The UK has been working closely with the Ethiopian government and supports the case for topping up. The potential costs have not been finalised, but it is expected that the resources pledged in 2002 will cover the costs for the HIPC Trust Fund.

 The Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 protect consumers against payment card fraud including credit cards. The Regulations apply to contracts made at a distance including on-line ones. The Card issuer is required to reimburse consumers the full amount in the event of fraudulent use of the consumer's card.

<a name="40308w12.html_para2">In addition, the Consumer Credit Act 1974 allows consumers to recover the cost of a purchase made by credit card from either the supplier or the credit card provider in the event of a breach of contract or misrepresentation. This provides additional protection should a consumer be unable to trace the supplier. The Banking Code says that the consumer's liability for misuse of a card will be limited unless there is evidence that the consumer has acted fraudulently or without reasonable care.

 Under the Fireworks Act 2003 we have already made the Fireworks Regulations 2003 which came into force on 22&nbsp;December. These Regulations make it an offence for the under 18s to possess fireworks in public places and for all members of the public to possess the large and powerful category 4 fireworks used at professionally organised displays.

<P>
<a name="40308w12.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government are taking action on a number of fronts to ensure equality between men and women in the workplace. We are continuing to improve the workings of the Equal Pay Act and the Sex Discrimination Act, for example through the introduction of the Equal Pay questionnaire in April 2003 and our planned consultation on speeding up and simplifying equal value tribunals. The Government are taking forward policies to tackle the pay gap that help secure equal pay, and broader causes of the pay gap, such as women's lower level of work experience and the part-time pay gap. The Government have led by example in committing all Civil Service departments and agencies to review their pay systems and produce action plans to close any equal pay gaps. The Government have also provided funding for the EOC to develop equal pay tool kits so all organisations can carry out equal pay reviews.




<P>
<P><I>8 Mar 2004 : Column 1282W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40308w12.html_para10">In addition, we are working to remove existing barriers to equality, such as our work to promote women's access to sectors where they are currently under-represented, and to increase diversity in the boardroom. We have introduced measures to help parents maintain links with the world of work and better balance their work and home lives, which will contribute to a reduction of the pay gap. The Government have provided funding to expand childcare provision to meet the changing needs of families. The Government also welcome the EOC's investigation into modern apprenticeships and the concentration of men and women in different professions.

 The DTI does not make these estimates. The Office for National Statistics provides statistics on the number of stoppages and days lost through industrial action.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Landfill Directive requires the introduction of a ban on the disposal of most whole used tyres to landfill from July 2003, and this has been achieved by The Landfill (England and Wales) Regulations 2002. Regulations have also been introduced covering Scotland and Northern Ireland. Shredded tyres are also due to be banned from disposal to landfill, and this ban will take full effect from July 2006.

 The data to compile used tyre statistics for 2003 are currently being collected. Provisional figures suggest that value was recovered from around 80&nbsp;per cent., based on 450,000 tonnes of used tyre arisings. This recovery rate is significantly higher than in previous years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w13.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The infrastructure to reprocess used tyres continues to grow, as evidenced by provisional statistics for 2003 showing a recover rate of around 80&nbsp;per cent. used tyre arisings. It follows that tyres are being increasingly diverted from landfill disposal, which figures suggest is running at around a quarter of 2001

The requirement to shred tyres, prior to landfill disposal until July 2006, should not therefore present undue difficulty for the industry.

The regulations are enforced by local Trading Standards Officers who work closely with the packaging industry and producers to advise them on best practice in packaging design and to resolve complaints of excessive packaging. A recent study commissioned by the DTI highlights the extensive changes brought about since the introduction of the Essential Requirements. These relate to improvements in packaging design, including minimisation.

 The Work Life Balance Challenge Fund has helped employers develop and implement flexible working policies through 448 projects, helping some 1.2&nbsp;million employees, at a cost of &#163;10.5&nbsp;million over the last three years. As a result over 80&nbsp;per cent. of these employers report that they permit some of their employees to adopt flexible working-time arrangements. The Work Life Balance Campaign has spent &#163;1.2&nbsp;million this year promoting flexible working, producing publicity materials such as our current "50 cases studies" booklet. This helps employers see how firms can adapt flexible work policies, and shows such policies are generally inexpensive but often produce substantial savings. The campaign also helps to sponsor events including the Work Life Balance Trust week-long awareness campaigns that take place each September, and increases awareness of the benefits of work-life balance for those who have to care for elder dependents.
<P>

<a name="40308w14.html_para1">In addition, from April 2003, mothers and fathers with children under six or disabled children under 18 have the right to request a flexible working pattern, which equates to 3.7&nbsp;million employees eligible to make a request.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State meets with the CBI on a monthly basis to discuss a variety of issues, including Working Time. To my knowledge, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has not discussed Working Time with either the British Chambers of Commerce or the Federation of Small Businesses; however, my hon. Friend the Minister for Small Business and Enterprise and I have with the Federation of Small Businesses very recently, although 



<P>
<P><I>8 Mar 2004 : Column 1288W</I><P>
they did not ask for Working Time to be on the agenda on either of these occasions. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has telephoned Stephen Hughes MEP about the Working Time Directive and I visited the European Parliament on 20&nbsp;January and saw several MEP's including Gary Titley and Claude Moraes. Officials in my Department frequently meet various organisations, representing all sides of business and employees, to discuss Working Time including the opt-out.

<a name="40308w14.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Stephen O'Brien: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what her policy is on the <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;reform and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;removal of the UK opt-out from the Working Time Directive.  [158846]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w14.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 The Government are committed to the retention of the opt-out from the 48-hour weekly working time limit. We are concerned to hear about possible misuse of the opt-out but do not believe that this is a reason to abolish it. It is better, we believe, if it were to be established that there are problem areas, to consider what safeguards are necessary to ensure that it works properly.

We will continue to monitor our operational processes closely and will make further changes if we see any evidence in future that these are not working effectively.

<a name="40308w15.html_para0">The New Deal for Disabled People (NDDP) supports the Government's commitment to "work for those who can and support for those who cannot" and is designed to help people with disabilities and health conditions in finding and sustaining paid employment. NDDP is the first programme specifically designed to support people on disability and health-related benefits into employment. Participation in NDDP is entirely voluntary.
<P>

<a name="40308w15.html_para1">The Access to Work programme is open to disabled people already in employment (including self-employment), people changing jobs and unemployed people about to start work. It helps towards the additional employment costs resulting from disability.

This is usually paid for six weeks but may be extended to a total of 13 weeks. The scheme is for use at the discretion of Jobcentre Plus staff in situations where a disabled applicant is considered suitable, but the employer has genuine doubts about the individual's ability to cope with the proposed job or place of work.

<P><I>8 Mar 2004 : Column 1293W</I><P>
National Insurance contributions to have been paid by the beneficiaries. The rules on the treatment of income and capital strike a balance between protecting people who are less well off and protecting the taxpayer by ensuring that help is directed towards people who need it most.
<P>

<a name="40308w15.html_para9">The Macfarlane and Eileen Trusts exist to help people who have been infected with HIV from contaminated blood products received as part of NHS treatment and are government funded. At the time the trusts were set up, there was considerable stigma attached to HIV and AIDS and it was considered inappropriate that people should have to disclose their condition to benefits staff. As such, it was decided that there should be no need to disclose payment from the Macfarlane or Eileen trusts.
<P>

<a name="40308w15.html_para10">The Thalidomide Trust is a private scheme funded by pharmaceutical companies responsible for producing thalidomide. It is treated in the same way as other personal injury payments; capital that is placed in trust for an individual can be disregarded. Income from an individual's trust can also be disregarded as long as the income is used for other than day to day living expenses. We have no plans to change these arrangements.
<P>

<a name="40308w15.html_para11">The financial assessment for residential accommodation is assessed by the Department for Health. Payments from the Eileen and Macfarlane trusts are disregarded; payments from the Thalidomide Trust are taken into account in the same way as they are for assessing means tested benefits. For Home Care charges, councils have a minimum requirement to follow the capital rules for residential care; however, councils can be more generous if they wish.

 The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) works with the Department for Transport to ensure that tourism priorities are given due consideration in transport policy.
<P>

<a name="40308w17.html_para0">On 1&nbsp;April 2003, the North West Regional Development Agency (NWDA) took on strategic responsibility for tourism in the North West region. DCMS has issued guidance to all the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) on how tourism should be incorporated in their Corporate Plans and Regional Economic Strategies; this includes the importance of linking regional tourism strategies with regional transport strategies.
<P>

<a name="40308w17.html_para1">I understand that the three northern RDAs have commissioned a 20-year transport vision for the North of England, due to be launched in April 2004.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w18.html_spnew1"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The New Opportunities Fund launched its Heroes Return scheme on 9&nbsp;February 2004. This scheme is providing &#163;10&nbsp;million funding for Second World War veterans their wives or husbands, widows or widowers, and, where required, carers to visit the overseas areas where the veterans saw active service. The main criterion is that ex-servicemen and women saw active service with or alongside the British Armed Forces in the Second World War. Further details on the Heroes Return can be obtained from the Veterans Agency on 0800 169 2277.
<P>

<a name="40308w18.html_para0">A second scheme, Home Front Recall, will be launched later in the spring. This will provide funding projects and events in the UK for veterans and others within the broader community to commemorate the events leading to the end of the Second World War. More details of how this scheme will operate will be available when it is launched.
<P>

<a name="40308w18.html_para1">The New Opportunities Fund has not previously operated a scheme in relation to veterans, but the National Lottery as a whole has provided over &#163;3&nbsp;million of funding to veterans and veterans organisations since 1995.

 On (i), the New Opportunities Fund will shortly be launching its Home Front Recall scheme, which will fund the costs of commemorative projects and events in the UK to mark the events that led to the end of the second world war. Details of the application process for grants will be announced when the scheme is launched later in the spring, but it will be a UK-wide scheme providing funding in all four UK countries.
<P>

<a name="40308w18.html_para2">On (ii), the New Opportunities Fund launched its Heroes Return scheme in February 2004. This scheme provides funding for second world war veterans, their wives or husbands, widows or widowers, and, where required, carers to visit the areas in Europe (and, indeed, other parts of the world) where the veterans saw active service. It is a UK-wide scheme and veterans from Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England are entitled to equal financial assistance.

<a name="40308w18.html_spnew3"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The New Opportunities Fund (NOF), as part of its role in developing the Heroes Return scheme, has discussed the scheme widely with veterans and veterans' organisations. In particular, the fund has worked closely with the Confederation of British Service and Ex-service Organisations (COBSEO), which is the representative body for the UK's veterans' organisations, since the Heroes Return scheme was first proposed. In addition, the fund has arranged meetings with many of the major veterans organisations, such as the Royal British Legion. COBSEO and NOF are currently running seminars across the UK to explain the nature of the Heroes Return scheme directly to a large number of veterans' organisations.

 Following a request from the S4C Authority, I have commissioned an independent review of S4C, to be carried out by Roger Laughton, Head of Bournemouth University Media School. He will be assisted by Meurig Royles as Welsh language assessor. I have asked Mr. Laughton to report back to me at the beginning of May.

<P>
<a name="40308w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 It is anticipated that the Prospectus will be released by the early summer. The first round of consultation last year produced a number of valuable contributions from stakeholders. These have been 



<P>
<P><I>8 Mar 2004 : Column 1304W</I><P>
reflected in a new draft, which will be sent out for final stakeholder consultation in the next few weeks. The Prospectus will be an agreed statement of actions and responsibilities between the major players in tourism, both in the public and private sectors.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w18.html_spnew6"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Broadcasters, through contracts with transmission operators, are responsible for maintaining the terrestrial network. But until the analogue signals are turned off, there will not be enough frequencies available to enable all the transmitters to carry digital terrestrial services. We believe that digital switchover could be achieved between 2006 and 2010, subject to our affordability and availability criteria being met.

 I am concerned about the reported poor condition of relocation camps in Burma. Most of the major relocation sites are in areas where there is still ongoing fighting, so accurate estimates and independent assessment of the conditions (or numbers involved) is not possible. From the information that we have, conditions in most of the camps are reported to be very poor&#151;inadequate housing, medical and educational facilities. Separation of villagers from their farmlands, and lack of alternative land in or near the camps, also causes great hardship.
<P>

<a name="40308w21.html_para6">In areas of Karenni State where there are now cease-fires some of the former relocation sites have been largely abandoned as people have returned to their villages. Some of those remaining, particularly where the relocation site is on the edge of a town, do so (semi) voluntarily because educational and other opportunities in the town are actually better than in their village.

 Our embassy in Bogota make regular representations to the Colombian authorities on issues relating to human rights concerns. Our ambassador called on the Vice President of Colombia on 4&nbsp;March and raised a number of concerns on human rights, trades unionist issues and tackling collusion with paramilitarism in Colombia. We are also seeking information from the Colombian Government on the case of Luz Perly Cordoba of the Colombian agricultural workers' union Fensuagro, who has recently been reportedly detained. I continue to raise relevant concerns in my own contacts with Colombian Ministers.

<P>
<a name="40308w23.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 We welcome the establishment of a domestic war crimes court in Serbia. However, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) assessed that the Serbian national judiciary lacked the capacity to conduct fair war crimes trials in accordance with universally adopted standards. We welcome OSCE recommendations and urge the Serbian authorities to ensure effective domestic trials through adapting legislation and providing for the protection of victims and witnesses of war crimes. The first major trial, beginning in March, will be an important demonstration of the Serbian authorities' commitment to tackling war crimes allegedly committed by Serbian citizens. It is vital that the accused receive a fair trial and that justice is seen to be done.
<P>

<a name="40308w23.html_para6">The transfer of lower level war crimes suspects for trial in domestic courts is an important part of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) Completion Strategy. However such transfers can only take place where the Tribunal is satisfied that the trials will be conducted in accordance with universally adopted standards. In order for ICTY cases to be transferred to a domestic tribunal, Serbia must first co-operate fully with the ICTY and allow the domestic judiciary to work independently and impartially.
<P>

 We have lobbied at the highest levels in Khartoum on this matter, and our ambassador in Khartoum has discussed the situation with the First Vice-President on a number of occasions in recent weeks. Through our embassy in Khartoum and the UK Special Representative for Sudan, we are in almost daily contact with the Government of Sudan and the various Darfur groups. The EU issued a statement on 25&nbsp;February appealing to the parties to ensure the protection of the civilian population and to allow humanitarian access to all those in need.

<a name="40308w23.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 It is not easy to distinguish former Taliban and their sympathisers from other groups hostile to the current political process in Afghanistan. We believe that at any given time the number of former Taliban sympathisers in Afghanistan and Pakistan is in the very low thousands. But the remoteness and geography of the Pakistani border region with Afghanistan, the difficulty of maintaining border controls, and the movement of people across the border makes it difficult to give an accurate assessment.

 Pakistan is a key ally in the war against terror. We strongly support the efforts of the Pakistani Army to round up members of al-Qaeda and extreme elements of the former Taliban regime. The recent military operations into the formerly inaccessible tribal areas bordering Afghanistan are a good example of the commitment of the Pakistani Army in taking action against these groups.

1. PDS figure covers dentists not already working in the GDS.<P>

2. Dentists are free to work in more than one PCT. Therefore, dentists who do some work in this area but more in another PCT have not been included.<P>

3. Dentists in the GDS include principals, assistants and vocational dental practitioners. These figures are on a headcount basis rather than whole-time equivalent (wte) basis and therefore take no account of part-time working. In the CDS, the amount of time spent working in the national health service varies greatly, with a large proportion of dentists doing some private work. Dentists working solely in private dentistry are not covered by these figures.<P>

4. These figures exclude dentists working in the community dental service, hospital dental service and salaried service of the GDS.<P>

Three of these are based on types of HIV prevalent in East and Southern Africa and one, in Botswana, on the type of HIV prevalent in Europe and the USA.

<a name="40308w26.html_para10">DFID supports the global effort to accelerate the development of safe and effective HIV vaccines as an important part of a comprehensive long-term response to HIV and AIDS. Trials currently underway in Africa provide an important contribution to these efforts, particularly in developing vaccines that will be appropriate for use by developing countries. The participation of African researchers in these efforts is particularly welcome. Given the difficult task of discovering and proving the efficacy of an HIV vaccine, it is important that a number of promising vaccine candidates are developed in parallel if chances of success are to be increased and efforts accelerated. As the current trials are completed DFID expects that decisions will be made regarding which of the candidates should progress to later stage trials to test vaccine efficacy. These decisions will be the responsibility of the sponsoring agencies.

<a name="40308w26.html_para11">Since 1998 DFID has provided funding to the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) to progress global HIV vaccine efforts, with a particular focus on vaccines developed for use by developing countries.

<i>[holding answer 2&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> A pilot of human papilloma virus (HPV) testing as triage for women whose cervical screening test results showed low grade abnormalities began in April 2001 as part of the pilot of liquid based cytology (LBC). In the pilot, women who were HPV positive were referred immediately for a follow-up examination by colposcopy. If the test showed women were HPV negative, they had a repeat screening test after six months and a second HPV test.
<P>

<a name="40308w27.html_para1">An independent evaluation of the pilot was commissioned by the Department from the Cancer Screening Evaluation Unit at the Institute of Cancer Research. The evaluation is covering all aspects of HPV testing as triage, including cost-effectiveness. As women who have low grade abnormalities but are HPV negative are retested six months later, the HPV arm of the pilot has taken longer than the LBC arm, as expected. Full follow-up of all women in the pilot is essential for completeness of the evaluation. The HPV evaluation report was due at the end of 2003, but the evaluation has proved more difficult than anticipated. It is important to get the evaluation right, as the cervical screening programmes involved four million women each year.
<P>

<a name="40308w27.html_para2">A draft of the evaluation report has been seen by the Advisory Committee on Cervical Screening, and will also go to the National Screening Committee, which originally commissioned the pilot, shortly.

The evaluators will also publish aspects of the results in peer reviewed journals.

<P>

<a name="40308w29.html_para2">The OECD places particular emphasis on: the importance of programmes designed to develop career management skills (as well as support when making decisions at key transition points); and access to impartial advice from an agency that is external to the learning institution in which the student is based.

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 5&nbsp;March 2004]</i>: There are no current plans to establish a legal presumption of contact, following separation or divorce, between children and both of their parents. The Government support the view that, in general, children benefit from a continuing relationship with both parents following parental separation where it is in the best interests of the child and safe for all family members. The fundamental principle of the Children Act 1989 is that any court decision must be based on what is best for the child. There is no automatic "right" to contact for either fathers or mothers, but in practice the courts have taken the view that in most cases the child's welfare is best served by contact with both parents. This was stated by the Court of Appeal in Re: O (Contact: Imposition of Conditions) [1995] 2 FLR 124 in the following terms:
<P>

<P><I>8 Mar 2004 : Column 1345W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40308w29.html_para6">In its first two years the Children's Fund programme had a record of underspend. Efforts to ensure that all the money was spent have now led to a projected overspend. Revised allocations to some partnerships for 2003&#150;04 were agreed following a mid year review of expenditure. This will ensure that the programme lives within its financial limits this year while honouring its commitments. However, Portsmouth's budget for 2003&#150;04 was not revised following the mid year review.
<P>

<a name="40308w29.html_para7">For 2004&#150;05 we have agreed revised allocations to all partnerships totalling &#163;160&nbsp;million. This is just below the originally announced total of &#163;164.6&nbsp;million. Portsmouth's revised allocation for 2004&#150;05 is &#163;981,768. We announced these allocations on 27&nbsp;February and we are currently working with partnerships, through our regional teams, to assess the impact. The Portsmouth programme has welcomed the freedom to bring forward underspend from 2003&#150;04 into 2004&#150;05 to support its programme. I have made some provision available in the form of a contingency fund which partnerships can apply to, if a serious risk to service delivery in key programmes remains an issue.
<P>

<a name="40308w29.html_para8">I will not be taking final decisions on 2005&#150;06 until I have consulted partnerships and discussed the future of the Children's Fund with key partners, in particular, the potential transition to children's trusts. However, I recognise that partnerships are keen to get some indication of funding levels for 2005&#150;06, in order to help them plan effectively. Therefore I have advised partnerships that the budget for 2005&#150;06 will be no less than &#163;110&nbsp;million. I will announce the final allocation in autumn 2004, following the outcome of the 2004 Spending Review.

[153242]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w29.html_spnew8"><B> Margaret Hodge </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9&nbsp;February 2004]:</i> The 2003&#150;04 mid year review of expenditure identified approximately &#163;12.5&nbsp;million in underpsend from quarters 1 and 2 that could be redirected from Children's Fund partnerships. This figure was collated nationally and has not been broken down by region.
<P>

<a name="40308w29.html_para9">This action was taken to ensure the programme kept within its budget. The Department has assessed the impact of the review, working with representatives from the main voluntary sector organisations involved in the Fund, the LGA and the ADSS as well as with partnerships' ability to meet contractural obligations, we revisited them. Furthermore, we set aside some money to assist where there was a likelihood of premature closure of services.

 There is a considerable amount of research over a number of years from the UK and overseas that indicates that contact with both parents is in the best interests of the child. This finding has been

<P><I>8 Mar 2004 : Column 1349W</I><P>
endorsed by a number of leading family court judgments. Studies have also indicated that it is the quality of the contact the child maintains with both parents rather than merely its quantity that has the most beneficial effect.

<a name="40308w30.html_para2">A thorough literature review of research available in this area can be found in the publication 'Researching Contact' by Joan Hunt, a Senior Research Fellow at the Department of Social Policy and Social Work, Oxford University. This work, by a well-known academic in the field of child and family law, provides a comprehensive summary of the research evidence that supports the view that contact with both parents is in the best interests of the child.

 The information is not available in the form requested. Day care figures for 2001 and earlier years for England and Government Office regions were published in DfES Statistical Bulletin 08/01 "Children's Day Care facilities at 31&nbsp;March 2001", which is available in the Library and on the DfES website, www.dfes.gov.uk/statistics. Latest childcare statistics were published in a report by OfSTED 'Registered Childcare Providers and Places in England, 19&nbsp;December 2003', which is available on the OfSTED web-site, www.ofsted.gov.uk/publications. The numbers of providers and places recorded by OfSTED are not directly comparable with the previous data made available by the DfES because they were collected differently.

 From April 2003, we have increased local flexibility and autonomy, in line with the Government's principles of reducing ring-fenced funding by consolidating the resources in the under-fives sub-block of Education Formula Spending Share (EFSS)&#151;the main source of funding for education. We have not received representations from Essex regarding funding to private providers. As funding in EFSS is unhypothecated it is the responsibility of the local authority to set funding at a suitable level to reflect local circumstances and in order to meet their statutory obligations. In the financial year 2004&#150;05, overall funding in the under fives sub-block is worth &#163;2.66 billion; overall education funding having increased by 5.5&nbsp;per cent.
<P>

<a name="40308w30.html_para5">Levels of funding increase every year, taking account of inflation and other pressures. All decisions on future funding will be considered as part of this year's Spending Review.

 Schools are not required to provide this information to the Department. The arrangements for managing such issues in schools are determined at local level. However, the Department, jointly with the Department of Health, has produced 'Supporting pupils with medical needs&#151;a good practice guide' and Circular 14/96 'Supporting pupils with medical needs in school', in 1996. The guide includes a section on anaphylaxis, with information about emergency adrenaline injection. These documents were written to help schools draw up policies on managing medication in schools and to put in place effective management systems to support individual pupils with medical needs, as well as to set out the legal background.

 The following tables show which community schools have closed to be replaced by schools designated with a religious character ("faith schools") since 1997, listed by LEA area. The first table shows single community schools that have closed and been replaced by single faith schools. The second table shows amalgamations or mergers where community and faith schools have closed, to be replaced by a single faith school. Reliable information is not available in relation to school re-organisations before 1997.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many civil servants in his Department are assisting with the review of family policy; which <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;advisers from outside the Department and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;other departments are assisting with the review; what body or committee within the Department is co-ordinating the review; when he expects to publish the review; and if he will make a statement.  [158076]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w31.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The review of family policy formed part of the work of two civil servants and a secondee from the voluntary sector. The views of a number of advisors from outside the Department and of local government have fed in to this work. The review of family policy is an internal DfES review by our Families Division. Its findings will not be published but they are contributing to relevant work in DfES and to the parenting strand of the Child Poverty Review currently being conducted by HM Treasury.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w32.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The national standards for under eights day care and childminding indicate that registered childcare providers should request information from parents about food allergies the child may have, and take heed of such information when providing children with food and drink. The standards also require that there is at least one member of staff with a current first aid certificate on the premises or on outings at any one time, and that the first aid qualification includes training in first aid for infants and young children. First aid

training has to be consistent with any guidance issued by the Secretary of State to local authorities, who are responsible for making training available to settings.

[159791]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w32.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Section 29 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 provides for a local education authority to propose the closure of any category of maintained school including a grammar school. The authority must first consult interested parties, including parents and governors. If, after considering the responses to consultation, they decide to proceed they must publish the proposals in the local newspaper, at the entrance to the school and in a local public place. Anyone may then submit comments or objections to the proposals. Where objections are submitted, the final decision on the closure will be taken by the local School Organisation Committee (SOC), or an independent

<P>

<a name="40308w32.html_para0">There is no requirement for a ballot of parents or the consent of the governors before proposals are published to close a grammar school. Ballots provide for the removal of selective admission arrangements, if enough parents vote in favour, from a school that is remaining open.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the proportion was of families with an income under <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;&#163;15,970 and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;&#163;33,500 with students going to higher education, broken down by local education authority, in the last academic year for which figures are available.  [153132]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w32.html_spnew3"><B> Alan Johnson: </B>

<P>

<a name="40308w32.html_para2">The figure of &#163;15,970 is an estimate of the income threshold below which students will receive the full combined grant of &#163;2,700 and above which the grant starts to be tapered away. Since the combined grant will be new in 2006&#150;07, and its threshold is lower than that for the existing tuition fee relief scheme, there are no out-turn data for past years. However, it is estimated that around 30&nbsp;per cent. of students will get the full grant. The figure of &#163;33,500 is the estimated income level at which&#151;in 2006&#150;07&#151;the combined grant will end and the means-tested element of the maintenance loan will begin to be tapered away. It is estimated that 50&#150;55&nbsp;per cent. of students will fall below this threshold and hence will receive some combined grant.
<P>

<a name="40308w32.html_para3">In 2001&#150;02, 59&nbsp;per cent. of students had a family income which resulted in them receiving part or full contribution to their fees i.e. an income below the threshold of &#163;29,785 for dependent students and &#163;25,440 for independent students. This is the latest year for which data are available.
<P>

<a name="40308w32.html_para4">Although the Department does not collect data on family income below various thresholds by LEA, we are aware that there are other organisations that do prepare figures of this nature. In particular, I understand that the House of Commons Library has access to some figures on family income by Parliamentary constituency, which hon. Members may be interested in. In addition, the Office of National Statistics has recently published some data on their website (www.statistics.gov.uk/neighbourhood) showing mean income at ward level, which hon.

<a name="40308w32.html_para7">Within the ICT curriculum and Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) there is sufficient flexibility to include teaching about internet safety to pupils of all ages and for discussion about potential dangers when using the World Wide Web.

<a name="40308w32.html_para8">The Department's Superhighway Safety guidance and website includes advice on all aspects of internet safety including key areas such as e-mails for students, filtering systems, school websites and chat rooms. Schools are advised to have an acceptable-use policy signed by students and their parents, guardians or carers, detailing the ways the internet can or cannot be used. School plans detail how they will implement internet safety measures such as filtering, monitoring and providing protected environments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w33.html_wqn3"><B> Simon Hughes: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will list the new schools agreed to be built in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;Greater London and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;each London borough.  [158457]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w33.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The majority of capital support is allocated to schools and local education authorities (LEAs) by formula, and they decide how to invest it in line with their asset management plans. The Department does not, therefore, have complete information about all the capital investments in each school; this should be held locally. Tables have been placed in the Libraries which set out the capital support made by this Government to each London LEA since 1997&#150;98, in total and by programme, including devolved formula capital grants to each school.
<P>

<a name="40308w33.html_para2">In addition to the funding programmes indicated overleaf, the Department will also invest significantly in secondary education facilities through Building Schools for the Future (BSF). The aim of this new approach is to rebuild and renew secondary schools in every part of England within 10 to 15 years from 2005&#150;06, subject to future spending decisions. During the course of BSF, we therefore expect London authorities to receive large-scale investment to transform their secondary school buildings. We have already approved funding in principle for BSF projects in Newham and Waltham Forest for 2005&#150;06, and we are also working on a BSF pathfinder project involving Greenwich, Southwark and Lewisham.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w33.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 In August 2003, the Department announced that incentive and support funding for the expansion of successful and popular secondary schools would be available from 2004&#150;05. To date, we have 



<P>
<P><I>8 Mar 2004 : Column 1359W</I><P>
received seven applications for funding under this programme, two from local education authorities (LEAs) and five directly from schools.
<P>

<a name="40308w33.html_para3">Provision of this funding is dependent on agreement to statutory proposals to expand a school by the local School Organisation Committee (SOC), or failing agreement by the SOC, by the Adjudicator. We are not aware that any of these seven proposals has yet been determined.
<P>

<a name="40308w33.html_para4">Where applications have the support of the LEA and are agreed, we will provide incentive funding of &#163;500,000 (&#163;400,000 if the school does not have a sixth form). Where applications are not supported by the LEA, we will provide the full funding required. We are currently working with the five schools in this position to determine the level of support needed to provide 21st century buildings for the additional pupils.

<P>
<a name="40308w33.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Secretary of State has had no discussions with Gloucestershire county council or Gloucestershire Learning and Skills Council on the local education authority's post-16 review. Nor has the Secretary of State exchanged any correspondence with either of these bodies on the matter.
<P>

<a name="40308w33.html_para5">Any proposals to re-organise sixth form provision published by the local education authority as part of this review will be decided locally by the local School Organisation Committee, or the Schools Adjudicator if the Committee cannot agree unanimously. The Secretary of State will play no part in the decision-making process.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State meets the Prince of Wales on an occasional basis. My right hon. Friend has received a copy of the report "Reaching the Hardest to Reach" and it is being considered by Ministers.Ministers and officials in the Department for Education and Skills are in regular contact with the trust to discuss areas of mutual interest and co-operation, including the trust's work on reaching disaffected young people.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what criteria will be used in assessing whether to grant permission for a private school to expand.  [158756]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w33.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Section 162 of the Education Act 2002 requires independent schools to gain approval from the Secretary of State before increasing the maximum number of pupils within the school. The approval process takes into account the findings of recent inspections, or the school's plans for building work, which are subject to building regulation controls. Approval confirms that issues such as overcrowding or understaffing will not compromise the health, welfare and safety of pupils.

 The Department is currently providing pump-priming funding for 29 Federation pilots involving around 150 schools. However, schools can (and do) federate without applying to the Department and without pump-priming funding. We do not hold centralised records for these federations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what earmarked funds are available for refurbishment of school kitchens.  [158495]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w34.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The only funds specifically earmarked for projects including the refurbishment of school kitchens relate to Voluntary Aided (VA) schools. This results from the reform of liabilities and funding arrangements at VA schools in 2002, when their governing bodies took on responsibility for some buildings (including kitchens) which were previously the responsibility of local education authorities. No other capital funding is earmarked by the Department, most being provided formulaically to support local prioritisation of need.

 Our proposals to restore stability and certainty to school funding include a guaranteed minimum increase in every school's per pupil funding of 4&nbsp;per cent. where pupil numbers remain unchanged. All authorities' School Formula Spending Shares are increasing by at least 5&nbsp;per cent. per pupil in 2004&#150;05. This gives headroom above the guarantee and flexibility to target funds towards schools facing difficulty. Information showing the increase per pupil for all local education authorities in England has been placed in the Libraries. It is for individual authorities to decide how

<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w34.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Condition funding was introduce in 2001&#150;02 as a capital grant allocation to all local education authorities for the investment needs of their maintained school buildings as prioritised through the local asset management planning process. It is allocated according to relative need based on condition data provided by all authorities, from a full survey of all their school buildings. It is for capital investment in buildings as defined in the current CIPFA Code of Practice on Local Authority Accounting in Great Britain: A Statement of Recommended Practice. Where authorities have satisfactory asset management plans, they have autonomy on how this grant is invested. Further details of this grant can be found in my Department's guidance on the programme which, along with guidance on other capital programmes, can be accessed through www.teachernet.gov.uk/schoolscapital. I am arranging for copies of this guidance to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="40308w34.html_para16">Although Condition funding is allocated according to condition need, we urge all authorities to join up all capital funding streams locally to achieve the greatest impact in raising school standards, and to secure cross-cutting gains and best value for money investment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment he has made of the extent to which statemented needs are being met.  [157284]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w35.html_spnew3"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The Education Act 1996 places duties on local education authorities (LEAs) and all LEA-maintained schools to identify, assess and make suitable provision to meet children's special educational needs (SEN). They may make and maintain statements on such children where appropriate, and section 324(5)(a)&nbsp;of the Act imposes a statutory duty on LEAs to arrange that the special educational provision specified in statements they maintain is made for the child, unless the child's parent has made suitable arrangements. We have no reason to believe that LEAs do not meet the needs of statemented children in the great majority of cases. However, it is open to parents and others to complain to the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if they consider that an LEA is failing in its statutory duties in relation to implementing and maintaining statements, with a view to him exercising his powers under sections 497 and 497A of the 1996 Act. We consider any such complaints carefully. In addition, the Office for Standards in Education (OFSTED) monitors the performance of LEAs in meeting their statutory duties, including those relating to children with special educational needs.

<a name="40308w35.html_para7">The Government's new SEN "Strategy Removing Barriers to Achievement", launched on 11&nbsp;February, will build on the improvements to the statutory framework brought about by the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act and the SEN Code of Practice, both 2001.

 There is no real concept of bad debt under the income-contingent loan repayment scheme. This is because repayments are in line with earnings, not in accordance with a credit agreement, and income-contingent loans repayments are collected through the tax system, apart from a few exceptions. Loans are written off only for policy reasons&#151;due to death, becoming disabled and unfit for work, or at the age of 65&#151;which are not considered as bad debt.

These policies have met the key concerns of teachers and are all designed to make the profession more attractive both to potential new recruits and those already in our schools. We are also funding recruitment strategy managers who are currently working in over 100 LEAs across the country helping to provide a co-ordinated local approach to recruitment and retention.

 The local authorities which have received approval under section 27 of the Housing Act 1985 to delegate their housing management responsibilities to an Arms Length Management Organisation (ALMO) are listed below. None of the ALMOs have a specific regeneration remit. The primary objective of all ALMOs is to bring the stock up to the Decent Homes standard and provide a high quality housing management service. The ALMOs work with their local authorities to ensure that the work to achieve Decent Homes is planned and implemented in parallel with other investment, including investment with wider regeneration objectives.

This is because the figures reported to central government on amounts collected for previous years are not broken down by financial year.

 A total of &#163;236,019,772 was collected in non-domestic rates from businesses in Lancashire in 2003&#150;04 of which &#163;16,592,430 was collected in Chorley.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assessment he has made of Tower Hamlets' decision to use its dedicated homelessness strategy funding to pay Cash Incentive Scheme grants to registered social landlords' tenants to relinquish their tenancy and buy a property on the open market.  [158550]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40308w37.html_spnew4"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is aware that Tower Hamlets has been paying grants to social housing tenants to enable them to purchase a property in the private sector. Such grants can be an effective way of releasing social housing to provide accommodation for homeless households and so relieve pressures on temporary accommodation and help to meet the Government's target to end the use of bed and breakfast accommodation for families with children. In 2003&#150;04 Tower Hamlets plans to use &#163;300,000 for such grants, out of a total allocation from the Homelessness Directorate of &#163;876,000. Other plans for use of the homelessness grant included: increasing the supply of temporary accommodation in the private sector; employment of additional staff to increase the homelessness prevention service; and establishing a homelessness forum.

This will be used to tackle the barriers to development which have deterred investment in the Gateway.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="40308w38.html_para2">The English house Condition Survey was re-organised as a continuous survey from financial year 2002&#150;03. First results from the survey will be available for analysis from end 2004 with a view to reporting in mid 2005 and based on data from the period 2002&#150;03 to 2003&#150;04. In future years, annual results will be available based on rolling combinations of two year data sets (ie next results will be available for analysis by end 2005 based on the period 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05). This approach will provide a robust base for analysis and monitoring of change.

<P>
<a name="40308w38.html_spnew6"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 To address the barriers to enterprise affecting the most disadvantaged communities in the country the Government has created 2000 Enterprise Areas, where businesses may benefit from one of several new or existing forms of Government assistance. These include help from the Phoenix Fund, which has been allocated &#163;140&nbsp;million to 2006 to provide finance for organisations providing funding for small businesses in disadvantaged communities, and encourages innovative ideas to promote and support enterprise in disadvantaged areas and in groups currently under-represented in terms of business ownership. Other measures designed to encourage enterprise include stamp duty exemptions, targeted support from the Inland Revenue and HM Customs, and neighbourhood renewal projects. Help is also available to community enterprises through the Adventure Capital Fund. Although it is not possible to put a monetary value on all these measures at this stage, they all provide real financial inducements for new businesses.
<P>

<a name="40308w38.html_para6">Regional Development Agencies, Local authorities, Business Link Operators and Local Strategic Partnerships play a significant role in boosting the awareness and uptake of relevant measures by local businesses and entrepreneurs.

 Central Government funding for waste disposal and recycling is provided mainly through formula grant (Revenue support grant plus redistributed business rates) to local authorities.
<P>

<a name="40308w38.html_para7">Recycling is the responsibility of both the waste disposal and waste collection authorities. It is therefore part of the group of services included in both the county-level and the district-level Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services (EPCS) Formula Spending Share (FSS). The formula used for both the county-level and District-Level EPCS FSS can be found in Chapter 4 of the Local Government Finance Report (England).
<P>

<a name="40308w38.html_para8">Formula Spending Shares are neither grant nor are they the Government's assessment of how much an authority should spend on a particular service. They are simply the formulae used in the calculation of formula grant. Formula grant is unhypothecated i.e. it may be spent by the authority for any purpose. It is up to each authority to decide how much should be spent on each service given its local priorities.
