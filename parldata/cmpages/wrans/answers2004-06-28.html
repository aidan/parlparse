<a name="40628w01.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>Archaeological Objects</h3>





<p><a name="40628w01.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Allan: </b> 
 To ask the Solicitor-General what guidance she issues to the Crown Prosecution Service in respect of calculating the value of archaeological objects that form part of a prosecution under heritage legislation.  [172210]</p>








<p><a name="40628w01.html_spmin0"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service has not issued guidance on the valuation of objects which form part of a prosecution for offences under legislation designed to protect the national heritage.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w01.html_para0">
Crown prosecutors review all cases submitted to them by the police, in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors. Prosecutors assess whether there is sufficient available evidence on all the elements of the offence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. They will ask the police to provide further evidence where necessary, which may include expert valuation if appropriate. Where there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, prosecutors will then go on to consider whether a prosecution is required in the public interest.

<a name="40628w01.html_sbhd1"><h3 align=center>Bribery</h3>





<p><a name="40628w01.html_wqn1"><b> Malcolm Bruce: </b> 
 To ask the Solicitor-General pursuant to her answer of 29 March 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1145W, on overseas bribery, how many cases of overseas bribery were referred to CPS Casework Directorate <i>(a)</i> between November 1997 and February 2002 and <i>(b)</i> since 14 February 2002.  [174284]</p>








<p><a name="40628w01.html_spmin1"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 CPS Casework Directorate does not record separately whether a corruption case received by it involves an overseas element. It is not therefore possible to provide accurate figures.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w01.html_para1">
However, in order to assist, the CPS has considered what information is available and indicates that it is likely that in the period November 1997 and February 2002, around 240 cases were referred to Casework Directorate, which involved or may have involved allegations of corruption. Similarly from February 2002 to the present, Casework Directorate has recorded a total of about 80 cases which involved, or may have involved, allegations of corruption either within England and Wales or overseas. In order to ascertain which of these cases specifically involved overseas corruption, each individual case file would need to be examined which would incur disproportionate cost and in any case may not provide a definitive answer.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Jun 2004 : Column 2W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w01.html_para2">
Casework Directorate is however able to say, having asked its staff, that they are currently advising the police in five cases, which involve allegations of overseas corruption. All the cases are still being investigated and no charges have yet been brought.

<a name="40628w01.html_sbhd2"><h3 align=center>Energy Efficiency Commitment</h3>





<p><a name="40628w01.html_wqn2"><b> Sue Doughty: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what terrawatt hour savings she estimates would accrue from the first phase of the Energy Efficiency Commitment (2002&#150;05) if the prevailing test discount rate were to be 3.5 per cent.  [179879]</p>








<p><a name="40628w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Morley </b> 
<i>[holding answer 22 June 2004]:</i> The 6 per cent. discount rate used for the Energy Efficiency Commitment (EEC) 2002&#150;05 was the standard rate used by Government at that time. The rate was reduced to 3.5 per cent. in January 2003 to reflect prevailing circumstances.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w01.html_para3">
Changing only the discount rate from 6 per cent. to 3.5 per cent., the fuel standardised lifetime-discounted savings from the Energy Efficiency Commitment 2002&#150;05 would change from 62 terawatt hours (TWh) to 81 TWh.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w01.html_para4">
However, some of the assumptions underlying average energy savings from specific energy efficiency measures have also changed, in addition to the change in the discount rate, as explained in the consultation document for the next phase of the EEC. If the illustrative mix of measures under EEC 2002&#150;05 were subjected to the same set of assumptions which are now being applied to the second phase of EEC (2005&#150;08) the TWh figure would fall from 81 to 66. The target level proposed for EEC 2005&#150;08 as part of the consultation process is subject to continuing analysis and will be finalised in the relevant Statutory Order following the public consultation.

The Advisory Council usually meets annually, at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Members are consulted on relevant policy issues and members can use the meeting to express their views and concerns. The next meeting takes place on 1 July.

 We have no current plans to use the powers in the Licensing Act 2003 to license the showing of live broadcast sporting events on large screens in licensed premises. Under the 2003 Act, all public houses and bars showing live sporting events on television will require premises licences because they sell alcohol and, as a result, will be required to take steps to ensure the promotion of the licensing objectives in relation to the premises. These objectives are the prevention of crime and disorder, public safety, the prevention of public nuisance and the protection of children from harm. If they fail to do so, they could face a review of the licence. Furthermore, it will be an offence under the 2003 Act to allow disorderly conduct on the premises and knowingly to sell, attempt to sell, or to allow alcohol to be sold to people who are already drunk. Finally, the police have powers (in certain circumstances) under the 2003 Act to close down instantly for up to 24 hours any relevant premises where a senior officer believes there is, or is likely to be, disorder on or in the vicinity of the premises, or alternatively where a public nuisance is being caused as a result of noise emanating from the premises.

From 17 December 2003 my right hon.

The eligibility for support under section 55 was considered by NASS for a total of 2,650 cases in the first quarter of 2004 (January to March 2004). The number of asylum seekers, excluding dependants, notified that they were ineligible for NASS support under section 55 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 in the first quarter of 2004 was 890.

The marked increases in travel costs since 2001 can be largely attributed to changes in strategy within the Immigration and Nationality Directorate where increased staff numbers and the need to travel as a result of new policy initiatives and targets for improved IND performance. Other contributing factors have been related to providing advice to the organisers of the 2002 Football World Cup in Japan and Euro 2004 in Portugal and the creation of new units to support the police reform agenda.

<p><a name="40628w07.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Oaten: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimate he has made of the number of passports in circulation which are <i>(a)</i> forged and <i>(b)</i> modified in order to serve as false identification.  [180164]</p>








<p><a name="40628w07.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 Given the nature of the problem it is difficult to estimate with any degree of accuracy how many false passports (or other travel documents in lieu of passports) of British or foreign origin are in circulation either in the UK or globally. The fraudulent use of travel documentation (including forged or counterfeit visas) is a serious global problem. The Immigration and Nationality Directorate&#039;s National Document Fraud Unit (NDFU) has the lead role in monitoring and combating this. The NDFU is recognised both at home and abroad as a leader in this field and works closely with its counterparts in other countries to counter this type of fraud.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w07.html_para5">
The NDFU has a comprehensive brief of conducting expert forensic level examinations of suspect documents, in delivering training programmes for the Immigration Service and other agencies in document fraud detection and in collation and dissemination of information about suspect documents and types of document abuse. Of the 7,985 abused travel documents of all nationalities detected at UK arrival controls in 2003, forged or altered documents represented 52 per cent. of the total. Completely counterfeit documents amounted to 15 per cent. whereas 27 per cent. of the total were in the hands of impostors. 724 abused documents were encountered in-country by immigration enforcement officers and a further 837 forged, counterfeit or fraudulently obtained documents were submitted to the Home Office with requests for leave to remain.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w07.html_para6">
The problem of identity fraud within the United Kingdom involving documents from all countries is one which affects not just the Home Office. For example, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency referred 1,071 suspect travel documents to the NDFU during 2003 of which 74 per cent. were found to be false or to contain false endorsements. Local offices of the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) referred 1,410 documents to that department&#039;s National Identity Fraud Unit of which 541 were found to be false. DWP referred 114 documents to the National Document Fraud Unit for an expert opinion. During the year 33,551 passengers were denied boarding by airlines (often after reference to members of the UK Airline Liaison Officer network). Many of these decisions were because the passengers held suspect documentation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w07.html_para7">
The NDFU makes a significant contribution to work being carried out internationally in the EU, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and G8 to disrupt the work of forgers by enhancement of international security safeguards and standards, including those for biometrics, for travel documents and their issuing processes. It also works closely with travel document issuing agencies in order to combat identity fraud and facilitate the operation of border controls.

<p><a name="40628w08.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Blunkett: </b> 
 The effective policing of sea and airports is the responsibility of the relevant Chief Constable. Airport security was the subject of a comprehensive review by Sir John Wheeler in 2002. Implementation of his findings is strengthening security across the board. Following his recommendation, the National Co-ordinator for Ports Policing (NCPP) has taken on a wider role to encompass the co-ordination of both uniform and Special Branch ports policing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w08.html_para5">
The NCPP provides a strategic overview of the requirements of port security and ensures that there is effective co-operation between forces. This covers the whole range of ports policing from major air and sea ports to a small ports policing strategy.

 The UK has some of the most developed and sophisticated anti-terrorism legislation in the world. The Terrorism Act 2000 re-enacted and made permanent powers which had developed over many years to deal with these threats and also established a framework to deal with international terrorism. Following the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act has toughened counter-terrorism legislation by giving the police more powers to support their work in the fight against terrorism, proscribed new terrorist organisations and frozen their assets. We have strengthened our immigration provisions to ensure that those who present a security risk cannot hide behind refugee protections and we have tightened port, airport and border security.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w09.html_para4">
As I outlined in my statement of 25 February 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 41WS, we have also reassessed and strengthened our contingency plans to ensure that the UK is in the best position to respond, react and recover from any single or multiple terrorist incident, including incidents involving the use of chemical, biological or radiological materials. Our new Civil Contingencies Bill will further improve the UK&#039;s ability to deal with the consequences of a major disruptive incident by setting out clear responsibilities to ensure that front line responders can deal with a range of emergencies.

<p>
<a name="40628w09.html_para5">
We have also substantially increased funding to the Security Service to boost their capacity to collect, analyse and act on information and intelligence.

[180261]</p>








<p><a name="40628w11.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 As the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for International Development, I regularly receive representations about genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and developing countries. Some representations, in the form of letters from the public, letters from non-government organisations or letters from Members of Parliament on behalf of constituents, discuss the role of GMOs in eliminating world hunger. GM technology will not in itself solve the problem of world hunger. But when managed responsibly, used safely and effectively, and applied to the crops important for poor people, it can be used to promote development and reduce poverty.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w11.html_para0">
The UK Government supports the implementation of international legislation to rigorously assess and manage the risks involved in the use of GMOs and GM technology. The Department for International Development (DFID) has worked with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and other Government Departments to achieve a successful conclusion to negotiations to the Biosafety Protocol. This will help both developed and developing countries 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Jun 2004 : Column 36W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
make informed decisions on the transboundary movement (including import and export) of GMOs. With its strong precautionary approach, the Protocol will help to ensure that developing countries are not disadvantaged by the development of GM technologies. 23 African Governments receiving UK development aid have signed the Protocol. The top three African bilateral aid recipients in 2002&#150;03 were Uganda (&#163;55 million), Malawi (&#163;52 million) and Kenya (&#163;45 million). These countries signed the Protocol in May 2000.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w11.html_para1">
DFID&#039;s approach to food aid is guided by the following principles:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Recipient Governments should be given adequate information on the type of food they receive and its characteristics, including whether genetically modified;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Recipient Governments should be allowed to decide on its acceptability; and</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Donors should accept the decisions of recipients and accommodate them as far as possible. For example, if milled cereals are preferred to whole grain (to avoid the risk of GM grain being used as seed), then this should be arranged for.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w11.html_para2">
The issue of GM technology arises regularly in discussions on food, agriculture and trade in Africa, to which DFID is party. Some Governments, such as Zambia and Angola, are opposed to GMOs. Others, such as South Africa and Uganda, have approved GM crops for planting and consumption. The New Partnership for African Development (Nepad) and Africa Union have both issued statements supporting the use of GM technology to promote agriculture and reduce hunger.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w11.html_para3">
In 2002, DFID&#039;s offices in Malawi and Zambia were involved in discussions with the World Food Programme and the respective Governments about the acceptance of food aid containing genetically modified material. In Malawi, the Government proposed that GM maize be milled before distribution. DFID and other donors discussed how to do this with minimum delay in distribution. In Zimbabwe DFID officials supported the World Food Programme in negotiations with the Government over the acceptance of such food aid but had no direct contact with the Government. The former Secretary of State for International Development, Clare Short, spoke and wrote to President Mwanawasa of Zambia on this issue, and DFID hosted a fact finding visit for Zambian scientists to the UK on 23 and 24 September 2002 to meet representatives from Government, the private sector and civil society. The Zambian scientists recommended to the Zambian Government that it should reject GM food aid and the planting of GM crops in Zambia.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w11.html_para4">
In Zambia, DFID has had representations from a number of non-government organisations operating there. They have expressed a range of views about (i) GM food aid, and (ii) the wider issue of GM crops. The main organisations were the Jesuit Centre for Theological Reflection (JCTR), CARE and CAFOD. JCTR published a report on (ii). The remaining representations were informal and concerned humanitarian supplies, but did not take a public position on either (i) or (ii) in Zambia. All representations upheld the key principle that Governments and their people should be supported to make informed decisions on both issues. This principle continues to inform the approach of DFID. The UK Government has received no representations on GM 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Jun 2004 : Column 37W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
food aid or GM crops from the World Food Programme (WFP) nor the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w11.html_para5">
The World Food Programme does not conduct GM-related initiatives. The World Food Programme does, however, receive significant in-kind contributions of food aid containing GM materials. It maintains a neutral position on the matter of GM food donations, and strictly respects the decision of potential recipient Governments whether or not to receive food that may contain GM materials. It is not possible to obtain precise data on the extent to which in-kind donations to the World Food Programme are GM. In part this is because testing for GM content is not called for under any existing Codex Alimentarius or other international agreement, nor is there any agreement on the GM content below which a shipment may be classified as GM-free. UK cash contributions to the World Food Programme operations have inevitably supported the delivery of GM foods to willing recipient Governments, but it is not possible to identify to what extent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w11.html_para6">
The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) uses the resources made available through its Regular Budget, which include the financial contribution from the UK and the rich technical expertise and experience of UK nationals in scientific and technical advancements and related institutional and policy issues, to promote sustainable agriculture for eliminating hunger and poverty. In relation to GMOs, its initiatives are directed at collecting, analysing and disseminating information. Examples include the ecological and human health effects of GM crops and GM food; providing a neutral forum through which its member countries can agree international standards (for example, the Codex Alimentarius Commission adopted principles of risk analysis and guidelines for food safety assessment of GM food in 2003, and the International Plant Protection Convention recently adopted guidelines for determining if a living modified organism poses a hazard to plants); and, on request, and technical capacities for GMO detection, biosafety and risk assessment. The Food and Agriculture Organisation does not provide financial assistance to countries for the development of GMOs.

 The Office of Law Reform published on 10 May 2004 an Analysis of Responses to the consultation paper, &quot;Civil Partnership: A Legal Status for Committed Same-Sex Couples in Northern Ireland&quot;. Overall 462 responses were received. Of these, 416 were from individuals and 46 from representative groups or bodies. Most respondents (86 per cent.) were opposed to the introduction of civil partnership in Northern Ireland. Most organisations (60 per cent.), however, including the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission were supportive of the proposal. Of those who opposed civil partnership, marriage issues featured as a significant reasons for objection (87 per cent.). There was an equal division in those who felt that civil partnership was in effect &#039;gay marriage&#039; and those who were concerned that it would undermine marriage. A considerable proportion of those who mentioned marriage cited traditional Christian beliefs and values and referred, in particular, to the sanctity of marriage. Many of those in opposition mentioned religious issues as a basis for objection (69 per cent.), with children&#039;s issues a prime concern for others (56 per cent.).

 There are number of ways in which the Government encourage people to resolve relationship difficulties in the interests of the child. For the financial year 2004&#150;05, the Marriage and Relationship Support (MARS) grant programme provided &#163;4.9 million to a wide variety of voluntary sector organisations providing marriage and relationship support.

Sure Start local programmes and Children&#039;s Centres through the range of family support and counselling services they provide often also provide opportunities for couples to discuss relationship issues.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what steps his Department is taking to reduce the amount of regulation in the provision of children&#039;s services.  [179761]</p>








<p><a name="40628w18.html_spnew7"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 My Department has embarked on an ambitious programme of reform in the provision of children&#039;s services. We want professionals to work together to improve local delivery, while ensuring that children receive high quality of care and education.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w18.html_para5">
The Green Paper, &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; sets out our commitment to achieving more coherent and effective children&#039;s services, reducing the amount of regulation where possible. The strategy therefore aims to encourage integrated planning, commissioning and delivery of children&#039;s services, with easier access to specialist services and duplication minimised through the development of a Common Assessment Framework and the use of lead professionals to bring together 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Jun 2004 : Column 63W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
packages of support from multi-disciplinary teams to meet the needs of children, young people and their families.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w18.html_para6">
As part of these wider reforms, my Department has introduced the Children Bill into the House of Lords in March of this year. Regulation is being kept to the minimum necessary to achieve a robust integrated framework of services with clear lines of accountability, inspection and intervention. But we do still intend to regulate where this is needed to sharpen arrangements to safeguard children, eg in the establishment of statutory Local Safeguarding Children Boards to replace the current non-statutory Area Child Protection Committees.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w18.html_para7">
The provisions are intended to strengthen local flexibility to meet local needs. So for example, a new power for local services to pool budgets will enable more flexible pooling of funds between local partners and make it easier for agencies to work together in the commissioning and delivery of services. The Bill also pursues the streamlining of statutory planning requirements by removing the requirement for a plan to cover services for children in need. We have committed in debate to moving towards a single plan for children&#039;s services and our intention is to lift most statutory education planning requirements at the same time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w18.html_para8">
My Department is committed to reducing bureaucracy&#151;and is working jointly with the Cabinet Office Regulatory Impact Unit to identify unnecessary bureaucracy to promote more efficient, streamlined processes. This work necessarily includes a consideration of the regulatory framework within which children&#039;s services are delivered and will aim to deliver a practical set of key outcomes with stakeholders to deliver the changes needed to reduce bureaucratic burdens.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w18.html_para9">
My Department is committed to evaluate any measures that are implemented, either through the Children Bill or through policy more generally and will look again at anything which proves to be unnecessarily bureaucratic in practice.

<p><a name="40628w19.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. David Stewart: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will give foster carers official recognition as part of the social care workforce.  [179464]</p>









<p><a name="40628w19.html_spnew3"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
We do recognise the invaluable contribution that foster carers make to some of the most vulnerable children and young people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w19.html_para1">
The Green Paper, &#039;Every Child Matters&#039; and the Next Steps document set out a vision for changing the delivery of services for children and young people. It included an explicit pledge to do more to attract new foster carers at the same time as retaining the excellent carers we already have.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w19.html_para2">
We are committed to working across a range of partnerships to transform the children&#039;s workforce&#151;and we see foster carers very much as part of that. The emerging Children, Young People and Families Workforce Council, now in shadow form, will be part of the developing UK-wide Social Care, Children and Young People&#039;s Sector Skills Council. The Children&#039;s Council will work closely with employers and employer interest organisations, including those representing foster carers, in its plans for workforce development, covering issues such as recognition, regulation, reward, support and training.


</p>







<p><a name="40628w19.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. David Stewart: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment he has made of the case for a national system of allowances for foster carers based on recommended minimum levels.  [179465]</p>








<p><a name="40628w19.html_spnew4"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 The national minimum standards for fostering services already require that: &#039;Each foster carer receives an allowance and agreed expenses, which cover the full cost of caring for each child or young person placed with him or her&#039;. Additionally some foster carers may receive a fee payment. We consider it is important for local authorities to maintain flexibility to reflect local differences in the cost of caring for a child.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w19.html_para3">
The Choice Protects Programme is supported by a &#163;113 million grant over three years. In 2004&#150;05 this amounts to &#163;30 million for local authorities. This money can be used to improve payments for foster carers.


</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what plans he has to increase the number of foster carers.  [179470]</p>








<p><a name="40628w19.html_spnew5"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 We are spending &#163;1.5 million of the Choice Protects Grant in 2004&#150;05 to develop a number of suggestions from the Green Paper to improve the status, support and training for foster carers.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Jun 2004 : Column 68W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w19.html_para4">
These include the development of a national award scheme, a national helpline for foster carers and support for foster carers facing allegations. We plan to invite bids from organisations to provide these resources shortly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w19.html_para5">
In February this year we produced a Fostering Publicity Pack designed to help local authority fostering teams to run targeted local campaigns to recruit new foster carers for looked after children. We have awarded the Fostering Network a three year grant of &#163;180,000 to support Foster Care Fortnight which has a particular focus on recruitment. We will also shortly be publishing an important new report that examines what we can learn from recent research on foster care. This will be accompanied by customised leaflets for all those involved in fostering.

<p><a name="40628w20.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Fallon: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what correspondence he and his Ministers have had with the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority on the decision of the Assessment and Qualifications Alliance to cease examining Latin and Greek after 2006.  [180630]</p>

<p><a name="40628w20.html_spnew1"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 Following the Youth Justice Board&#039;s commissioning decisions earlier this year, DfES carried out jointly with the Association of Directors of Social Services a survey of local authorities to gauge any hidden demand for welfare placements in secure children&#039;s homes. The response to this survey was disappointing, which may in itself demonstrate that unmet need is not a widespread issue of concern to local authorities. Of the 22 responses received, only a small minority expressed concern about unmet need.

 The teaching of multiplication tables is an important part of the daily mathematics lesson in primary schools. Teachers are provided with key teaching objectives through the Primary Strategy&#039;s yearly teaching programmes and are encouraged to give priority to multiplication tables.

 The Parenting Fund was announced in the 2002 Spending Review specifically as a fund to &quot;help parents improve their parenting skills&quot;. This focuses on supporting parents in their parenting role, rather than support of the couple relationship.

<p><a name="40628w20.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 The School Admission Appeals Code of Practice is statutory guidance for admission appeal panels and fully explains how they should hear appeals and reach their decisions. It is important that the panel should consider all the evidence and balance the needs of the school against the needs of the individual pupil.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w20.html_para5">
My Department has commissioned training materials for panel members and chairs of panels, which are available free of charge, and funded a number of events in recent years where training materials are disseminated. Over the next year this will be focused on those who train panel members at a local level. In addition, my Department funds a dedicated internet message board which provides a forum for discussion and the sharing of information and good practice on admission and appeals issues.

<p><a name="40628w20.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 We published the prioritisation criteria for Building Schools for the Future in July 2003; a copy of this guidance is in the House of Commons Library. We will consider Kent LEA&#039;s expression of interest against these criteria, along with all other authorities. The Department aims to announce which LEAs will make up waves 2 and 3 later this year&#151;probably in the autumn. We hope also to provide some further BSF information to help all LEAs plan their capital strategies.

<p><a name="40628w20.html_wqn7"><b> Mr. Austin Mitchell: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what systems are in place to ensure that children with learning difficulties are identified at an early age; and how many were identified in each local authority in the last year for which figures are available, as a proportion of the total school population.  [180038]</p>








<p><a name="40628w20.html_spnew7"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 Local authorities, maintained schools, early years settings and others have to have regard to the Special Educational Needs Code of Practice, published in November 2001, which gives practical advice on carrying out their statutory duties to identify, assess and make suitable provision for children with SEN.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w20.html_para6">
The Code of Practice emphasises the importance of early identification, assessment and provision for any child who may have SEN, and that assessment should be seen as a continuing process and not a single event. The 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Jun 2004 : Column 71W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
importance of early intervention is also a cornerstone of the Government&#039;s recently published Strategy for SEN, &#039;Removing Barriers to Achievement&#039;. This sets out our long term vision for SEN, together with a programme of sustained action and review, both nationally and locally.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w20.html_para7">
We want to ensure that children with learning difficulties receive the help they need as soon as possible. As part of our strategy, we are for example looking to embed in practice nationally the principles of the Early Support Pilot Programme for very young disabled children under three and their families, and to ensure that parents of children with SEN have access to suitable child care. It is also important to identify and disseminate good practice. That is why we have

The available information is given in the following table. It shows numbers of children for whom statements were made for the first time in 2003 together with the relevant LEA school populations. It should be noted that some children have a statement maintained by one LEA but attend a school situated in a different LEA. The school population figures are based upon location of school rather than home residence of the pupils and so cannot be used to produce reliable proportions. Information is not collected centrally on when pupils are first identified as having special educational needs.

 Attendance allowance and disability living allowance are paid as a contribution towards the extra costs of severely disabled people. Entitlement to the benefits is not based on disability itself, but depends on the extent to which disability gives rise to the need for personal care or supervision from another person and, in the case of disability living allowance, on the effect that disability has on a person&#039;s ability to walk. Decision makers dealing with claims for the benefits have access to guidance about laryngectomy from a number of sources.

Notes:<br>

1. From 1 April 2002, DWP delivery organisations were restructured from 13 administration areas to 11 regions. Prior to that date, London counter-fraud operations were divided between three areas, each of which was responsible for a part of Greater London, but also counties outside of London. It is therefore not possible to provide data for fraud operations in Greater London for that period. Data since 1 April 2002 is shown below and relates to the DWP London Region, which is not entirely coterminous with the Greater London Area.<br>

2. The figures for 2002&#150;03 included some successful cases from the former Area Directorates during the period of transition to the new regional structure.<br>

3. &quot;Prosecutions&quot; refers to the number of cases forwarded to solicitors and accepted by them for prosecution.<br>

4. In 2003&#150;04 reporting rules changed for instrument of payment investigations. Previously each offence was recorded, now each defendant is shown. Thus, a defendant committing five offences is recorded as a single case, not 5 cases.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. All figures are estimates and are taken from the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) dataset which is derived from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). Figures do not included Northern Ireland and 2002&#150;03 is the latest year available.<br>

2. The income measure used in HBAI is weekly net (disposable), equivalised household income (that is to say income that is adjusted to reflect household size and composition).<br>

3. The estimates are sample counts, which have been adjusted for non-response using multi-purpose grossing factors that control for region, council tax band and a number of other demographic values. Estimates are subject to both sampling error and variability in non-response. All percentages are rounded to the nearest per cent.<br>

<i>[pursuant to the reply, 21 April 2004, Official Report, c. 493W]:</i> Since 1997 allocations of capital funding to local authorities for housing purposes have risen consistently by about 15 per cent. per annum on average. This includes the Major Repairs Allowance we introduced in 2001&#150;02 specifically for the improvement of local authority stock alongside the Decent Homes standard which sets out minimum standards to be met by 2010. Wirral&#039;s allocations in the period 1997&#150;98 to 2003&#150;04 have risen by 60 per cent. In addition to this welcome increase there is support through the Community Housing Task Force and Government Office for the North West to help the local authority and its tenants to choose the best strategy for long-term improvement.

 It is only possible to list the 20 per cent. most deprived wards with reference to the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2000 (IMD 2000), which is now very out-of-date. Data on the IMD 2000 can be accessed on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s website at: www.odpm.gov.uk/indices
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w25.html_para0">
The Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004 (IMD 2004), revised on 17 June 2004, does not provide information on deprivation at ward level. The IMD 2004 has been produced at Super Output Area Lower Layer (SOA) level to transcend problems experienced with wards. Wards are not consistent in size, covering anything from 800 to 35,000 people. They are also subject to frequent ward boundary changes. SOAs, on the other hand, cover between 1,000 and 3,000 people and are designed to last for approximately 20 years. Following a wide public consultation in 2003, it was decided that producing the IMD at SOA level would provide consistency both in terms of size of population and over time.

The Committee on Safety of Medicines and its sub-committee on pharmacovigilance (SCOP) has kept the safety of synthetic (human) insulins under close review and has considered the available data on a number of occasions. Most recently in 2002, the SCOP considered the findings of an independent review of controlled clinical trial data by the Cochrane collaboration. The conclusions of the Cochrane review were that there is no difference in the incidence of adverse events between patients on synthetic insulin compared with patients on animal insulins. The SCOP confirmed its previous advice that there is no clear evidence of safety problem specific to human insulin. However, the issue will be reviewed again should further information become available.

Data on the number of people using these insulins is not collected. However, the table shows the number of prescription items that were dispensed in the community in England, in 2003.

2. Insulins are those defined in the British National Formulary (BNF) paragraph 6.1.1, &quot;Insulins&quot;. Insulin drugs have been grouped into highly purified animal and human sequence (GM) insulin in line with the BNF.<br>

3. Doctors write prescriptions on a prescription form. Each single item written on the form is counted as a prescription item.<br>

<i>[holding answer 24 June 2004]:</i> Food labelling rules are agreed at European Union level. The Food Standards Agency consults widely with interested parties, including groups such as the National Farmers Union, both during negotiations and implementation of legislative measures, as well as in drawing up guidance for industry.

Notes:<br>

1. Expenditure is taken from audited health authority accounts and primary care trust summarisation schedules which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total expenditure by the relevant health authorities for 1997&#150;98 to 2002&#150;03, and the commissioner costs of the primary care trusts for 2000&#150;01 to 2002&#150;03. Figures are given per weighted head of population.<br>

2. Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of health authorities.<br>

3. The total national health service expenditure cannot be identified by health authority area because the majority of general dental services expenditure is not included in the individual health authority accounts or primary care trust summarisation schedules and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board. An 



element of pharmaceutical services expenditure is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority and not by health authorities or primary care trusts.<br>

4. In many health authorities there are factors which distort the expenditure per head. These include:<br>

the health authority acting in a lead capacity to commission healthcare or fund training on behalf of other health bodies; and<br>

asset revaluations in NHS trusts being funded through health authorities or primary care trusts.<br>

For these reasons expenditure per head cannot be compared reliably between health authorities or between different years.<br>

 My right hon. Friend, the Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn), the then Secretary of State for Health, met Sharon Grant in October 2002. Since then, there have been regular meetings between Sharon Grant and the Ministers responsible for patient and public involvement, but no meetings with the Secretary of State. The most recent meeting with a Minister of the Department was on 17 June 2004. I also met Sharon Grant at the opening of a patients&#039; forum support centre in Leicester on 15 June.

<p><a name="40628w33.html_spnew2"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 Part two of the national service framework (NSF) for renal services is being developed and will be published in due course.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w33.html_para1">
The work programme for improving chronic disease management is complementary to NSFs and focuses on developing support to help maintain the health of people with a complex mix of health and social care problems, and supporting self-care so that people are better able to look after themselves. This approach recognises the complex interaction of multiple conditions and aims to manage the holistic needs of individuals. For example, good glycaemic control in people with diabetes and the treatment of high blood pressure can reduce the risk, or progression, of chronic kidney disease.

 Our major vehicle for improving standards for stroke services is through the older people&#039;s national service framework (NSF), which set specific milestones for improvement by April 2004 of stroke services in primary care trusts, specialist services and general hospitals that care for people suffering from a stroke. Our document, &quot;Improvement, Expansion and Reform&quot;, which sets for the national health service a priorities and planning framework for 2003&#150;06, makes clear that implementation of the older people&#039;s NSF is a top priority.

Implementation of the NSF for older people is leading to real improvements in stroke services and making a difference to people&#039;s lives.

<p><a name="40628w34.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 The decline in numbers of new displacements in 2003, rather than in numbers of internally displaced people as a whole (the latter continues to rise year upon year), can be contributed in part to the success of the Government of Colombia&#039;s democratic security policy. This policy has resulted in an expansion of the state security presence throughout the country. The armed forces have had marked success in their offensives against illegal armed groups since the change of Government in 2002, which saw a stronger commitment to tackle such groups head on. Research by independent human rights observers in Colombia indicates that the illegal armed groups caused the vast majority of displacements in 2003. The problem, however, persists; more needs to be done until overall numbers of internally displaced people can actually start to drop.

<p><a name="40628w35.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Mullin: </b> 
 None. Each regional group represented in the Commission on Human Rights has a certain number of seats allocated to it. Unless the group itself puts forward more candidates than seats, their nominations are passed without a vote. Sudan&#039;s membership of the UN Commission on Human Rights thus follows agreement by the African Group to put them forward as part of their pre-agreed regional nomination. Neither the UK nor any other country has any locus to influence the decisions of another regional group. That said, the Government believe membership of the Commission on Human Rights brings with it responsibilities and members should meet certain minimum standards of behaviour regarding the implementation of human rights in their own countries. We are working with others to identify ways to improve the quality of membership.

 A key component of the Defence Change Programme is the provision of a Defence Information Infrastructure (DII).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w37.html_para24">
A competition is currently under way to appoint a Delivery Partner under a Public Private Partnership (PPP) contract who will be responsible for the supply of the required infrastructure and services across Defence. It is intended that the programme will, in time, subsume and then replace the existing disparate IT infrastructures. It is anticipated that this contract will be in place by early 2005 with the entire programme completed by early 2009.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w37.html_para25">
The DII programme is not a privatisation of IT infrastructure. Under the terms of the Public Private Partnership arrangement, the Ministry of Defence will continue to own the infrastructure but the delivery of the sendee will be the responsibility of the Delivery Partner. Currently, much of the design, provision and management of our existing infrastructure is already outsourced, albeit under a number of different arrangements.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w37.html_para26">
The DII programme is crucial to the delivery of the Defence Change Programme and has the potential to support delivery of significant benefits across Defence. The DII programme will enable Defence to realise a greatly increased capability at reduced cost. It will provide pan-defence corporate processes that improve the way Defence conducts its business on a day-to-day basis. In addition, it will enable our battlefield systems to be more closely integrated with our support systems, leading to improved decision making and intelligence collection and analysis.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w37.html_para27">
The savings generated from the more efficient provision of computing facilities are being used to increase the capability of the infrastructure. This includes better resilience and provision for business continuity, the near doubling of the number of users supported by the infrastructure, the provision of a single point of contact for all services offered by the Defence Communications Services Agency (DCSA), unified records management, and much improved e-mail and collaborative working services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w37.html_para28">
The provision of new tools and new ways of working means that users of the system will have more powerful capability at their fingertips to enable them to be increasingly effective in delivering their objectives. DII will therefore have a significant impact on the way all 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Jun 2004 : Column 141W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
users are able to exploit the power of the infrastructure in delivering their outputs, both in the fixed and in the deployed environment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40628w37.html_para29">
Those civilians employed in support roles for the current infrastructure will be transferred to the Delivery Partner (DP) under TUPE arrangements once the DP takes control of the management of the system that they support. It is expected that there will be some exceptions to this in order to provide support for systems that have operational or specialist constraints and require the retention of in house support staff. There will also be those who need to be retained to form the core of the Intelligent Customer Function (ICF). The MOD will be retaining Military Service Providers (MSPs) to support the infrastructure when it is deployed for military operations.
