<P>
<a name="71105w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 Subject to parliamentary approval of the necessary supplementary estimate, the cash limit for class VIII, vote 6 will be increased by &#163;433,000 from &#163;7,003,000 to &#163;7,436,000. The running costs limit is also increased by &#163;712,000 from &#163;25,742,000 to &#163;26,454,000. The increases reflect the increased demand for services, machinery of Government changes and a transfer of an end year flexibility amount from the Crown Prosecution Service to take account of the costs of the CPS review falling on the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers. The increase in the cash limit will be charged to the Reserve and will therefore not be an addition to the planned total of public expenditure.

 The Transport Council met in Luxembourg on 9 October. I represented the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="71105w01.html_para0">The Council opened with a session of structured dialogue with Transport Ministers of the applicant central European countries--CECs. A report by the Commission on the recent Pan-European conference in Helsinki was followed by discussion of issues relating to market access. Three areas for future work were identified: the need to strengthen co-operation between the Community and the CECs; developing the mobility of citizens; and the need to take account of all modes of transport in negotiations in market access.




<P>

<P>

<a name="71105w01.html_para1">The Council discussed air transport negotiations with the US. The Commission's view was that, although Community discussions with the US on regulatory issues had been useful, further progress would not be made unless market access was brought within the scope of the negotiations. The UK noted that success in its current bilateral negotiations with the US would bring benefits for passengers from the UK and the rest of the EU. The UK and other member states expressed doubts about the Commission's approach. The presidency concluded that there should be further work by the Commission, and a report back to the December Council.
<P>

<a name="71105w01.html_para2">The Council took note of the Commission's progress report on air transport negotiations with the CECs.
<P>

<a name="71105w01.html_para3">The Council debated a draft directive on airport charges. The debate focused on two aspects of the directive: the use of charges for cross-subsidy of smaller regional airports; and the variability of charges to reflect environmental considerations. The Council invited the Committee of Permanent Representatives to continue its examination of the proposal.
<P>

<a name="71105w01.html_para4">The Council reached unanimous political agreement on a directive on access to the occupation of road transport operator. This directive will raise the standards required of lorry, bus and coach operators in the Community.
<P>

<a name="71105w01.html_para5">The Council agreed conclusions urging greater emphasis on the public-private partnerships approach to Trans-European Network projects.
<P>

<a name="71105w01.html_para6">The Commission presented its White Paper on extension of the provisions of working time legislation to excluded sectors, including transport. It was noted that consultation with interested parties was still in progress. The UK, with some other member states, urged a case-by-case approach to the extension to transport, taking account of the needs of each form of transport.
<P>

<a name="71105w01.html_para7">The Commission presented the case for a Community-wide blood alcohol limit of 50 mg per 100 ml. The UK expressed its determination to further reduce alcohol-related roads deaths, and noted that it was important to consider other ways of reducing drink-drive accidents as well.
<P>

<a name="71105w01.html_para8">There was a discussion of weekend lorry bans in member states; the Commission undertook to produce draft legislation on this issue by the end of the year. The Commission also presented its draft regulation extending the Community's competition rules to air services to third countries.

 Subject to parliamentary approval of the necessary winter supplementary estimate for Ordnance Survey, the cash limit will be increased by a token of &#163;1,000 from &#163;6,759,000 to &#163;6,760,000 and the net running cost limit increased from &#163;3,025,000 to &#163;3,026,000.

<P>
<BR>
(ii) the cash limit for class V, vote 2--Department of Transport: administration and transport services--will be increased by &#163;3,625,000 from &#163;158,075,000 to &#163;161,700,000. The increase results from the take-up of &#163;2,000,000 capital end year flexibility amount as announced by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on 17 July 1997, <i>Official Report</i> columns <i>245-50</i> and inter-vote transfers from class V, vote 1 of &#163;1,750,000 and from class V, vote 5 of &#163;85,000 for mobility unit expenditure to be re-classified as running costs, offset by inter-vote transfers from this vote to class V, vote 5 of &#163;60,000 for priority routes in London and to class XIII, vote 2 of &#163;150,000 for the Edinburgh City Car Club research project. Running cost provision for this vote increases by &#163;85,000 from &#163;86,436,000 to &#163;86,521,000.
<P>
<BR>
(iii) the cash limit for class V, vote 5--Roads and local transport--will be increased by &#163;1,675,000 from &#163;313,863,000 to &#163;315,538,000. The increase reflects the take up of &#163;2,100,000 structural funds end year flexibility amount as announced by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on 17 July 1997, <i>Official Report</i> columns <i>245-50</i> and an inter-vote transfer from class V, vote 2 of &#163;60,000, offset by an inter-vote transfer from this vote to class V, vote 2 of &#163;85,000 and a reduction in the provision for licence fee refunds to goods vehicle and public service vehicle operators and drivers of &#163;400,000.
<P>
<BR>
(iv) the cash limit for class V, vote 7--Passenger rail services--will be reduced by &#163;51,000,000 from &#163;1,516,385,000 to &#163;1,465,385,000. The reduction reflects a &#163;50,000,000 inter-vote transfer from this vote to class V, vote 3 for Metropolitan Railway Passenger Services Grant, and a &#163;1,000,000 reduction in respect of reduced expenditure on consultants.
<P>
<BR>
 (v) the DoT/LACAP (Local Authority Capital) non-voted cash limit will be increased by &#163;7,150,000 from &#163;349,193,000 to &#163;356,343,000, to fund works associated with the rebuilding of Manchester city centre comprising of improvements to the Inner Relief Road, the development of a bus strategy and traffic management scheme and improved routes for pedestrians. The increase of &#163;7,150,000 will be met by a call on the Reserve.
<P>
<BR>
As a consequence of the changes in (ii) above the gross running costs limit operating on class V, votes 1, 2, 4 and 6 will be increased by &#163;85,000 from &#163;373,274,000 to &#163;373,359,000.
<P>
<BR>
(vi) the cash limit for class VI, vote 1--housing and construction, England--covering sections A, D to G, I, J and L of that vote, will be decreased by &#163;3,325.000 from &#163;599,708,000 to &#163;596,383,000. An increase in the cash limit of &#163;220,000 is offset by a decrease of &#163;3,545,000. The increase is to meet residual additional administration costs the Housing Corporation is expected to incur in respect of the loan portfolio sale, funded from sale receipts. The decrease results principally from a reduction of &#163;2,935,000 in homelessness grants current expenditure provision to fund an increase in rough sleepers initiative capital allocations through the Housing Corporation, which falls outside the cash limit. Of the remaining reductions, Estates Renewal Challenge Fund provision will be reduced by &#163;500,000 to support registered social landlords' housing costs arising from the need to house people displaced from Montserrat as a result of volcanic activity on the island, and a reduction of &#163;110,000 results from a reclassification of extra receipts recovered from homelessness grants, so that voted provision takes account of those receipts and is adjusted accordingly. The DETR/HC (Housing Corporation) cash limit will consequently be increased by &#163;3,435,000 from &#163;673,050,000 to &#163;676,485,000.

(vii) a new DETR/CRI (Capital Receipts Initiative) cash limit will be introduced, subject to the passage of legislation, to cover the Government's initiative to release additional resources to support local authority spending on housing and housing associated regeneration. The limit on expenditure is set initially at &#163;174,270,000.
<P>
<BR>
(viii) the cash limit for class VI, vote 2--regeneration and countryside and wildlife, England--will be increased by &#163;36,116,000 from &#163;1,480,168,000 to &#163;1,516,284,000. An increase is required of &#163;14,000,000 for the Urban Regeneration Agency (English Partnerships) to continue with works at Greenwich for the Millennium Exhibition and &#163;7,230,000 for support for the regeneration of Manchester city centre; &#163;8,000,000 for payments to be made for ERDF projects in advance of grant; &#163;2,491,000 for the Teesside Development Corporation to meet a deficit as a result of judicial review; and &#163;4,395,000 on three capital projects which had slipped from previous years. The increase will be met by a call on the Reserve of &#163;17,991,000, the use of &#163;10,125,000 end year flexibility amount as announced by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on 17 July 1997, <i>Official Report</i> columns <i>245-50</i>, offset in part by the surrender of &#163;4,000,000 of receipts to the Exchequer and a transfer of &#163;8,000,000 from the DOE/ERDF non-voted cash limit.
<P>
<BR>
(ix) the DETR/ERDF (European Regional Development Fund) non-voted cash limit will be reduced by &#163;8,000,000 from &#163;146,332,000 to &#163;138,332,000. This reflects gross payments to be made for ERDF projects in advance of European Community receipts. As a consequence of (viii) above, there will be increases to external financing limits for the Urban Development Corporations of &#163;1,427,000 from &#163;199,784,000 to &#163;201,211,00; for the Urban Regeneration Agency (English Partnerships) of &#163;46,000,000 from &#163;204,779,000 to &#163;250,779,000 and for the Housing Action Trusts of &#163;512,000 from &#163;88,688,000 to &#163;89,200.00.
<P>
<BR>
(x) the cash limit for class VI, vote 4--local government and planning, England--covering sections A to F of that vote, will be reduced by &#163;321,000 from &#163;30,987,957,000 to &#163;30,987,636,000. This reflects savings on payments to meet the expenses of valuation tribunals in Section A (Valuation services), on grant in aid to the Local Government Residuary Body in Section B (Reorganisation of local government) and on the European Union Spatial Planning Initiative in Section D (Planning and minerals research). The saving will be used within vote 4, to cover residual payments of council tax transitional reduction grant in Section H (Council tax transitional reduction grant) and of special grant to authorities affected by the terrorist bombings of Docklands and Manchester and emergency financial assistance under the Bellwin scheme in section 1 (Other grants), which are outside the cash limit on the vote.

<P>
<a name="71105w02.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 I announced on 7 August that I had concluded that there was a strong case for the creation of a Next Steps Agency for the Rent Officer Service in England. I said then that before taking a final decision I would be consulting interested parties, including the Local Government Association, the trades unions representing rent officers and their support staff, and other interested parties. That consultation is now complete, and I am grateful for the 63 responses I received from individuals and organisations. I am placing a summary of these in the Library.
<P>

<a name="71105w02.html_para0">There is general agreement that the current arrangements are unsatisfactory, but views differ on the solution. Many respondents favoured the Agency proposal, but support was also expressed for various alternative proposals. I have given very careful consideration to all the views which have been submitted, but have concluded that none of the alternative suggestions would tackle satisfactorily the inherent problems of the Service, which are caused by the unclear pattern of accountability and local inconsistencies of approach. I have therefore decided to proceed with the establishment of a Next Steps Agency for the Rent Officer Service in England.
<P>

<a name="71105w02.html_para1">My Department will now go ahead, in consultation with interested parties, to make preparations for establishing the Agency. It will be necessary to ensure that the implementation costs can be contained within the available public expenditure provision. For this reason, and because of the amount of detailed planning yet to be done, I cannot yet say when the Agency will become operational, but it will be as soon as practicable.

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary met representatives of Caribbean Commonwealth Governments and discussed, among other things, their concerns about the implications of the World Trade Organisation ruling. He made clear that the UK would work for a new EC banana regime which was consistent with WTO rules and which took account of our obligations under the Lome convention. He did not discuss the potential effects of the ruling on other preferential effects of the ruling on other preferential trading arrangements provided for under the Lome convention. The Edinburgh economic declaration notes our support for the legitimate interests of the African Caribbean and Pacific banana producers and our resolve to work for a successor arrangement to the Lome convention which gives the ACP adequate transitional arrangements.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71105w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 October 1997]:</i> Instruments of ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam will be deposited with the Italian Government. No time limit has been set for ratifying the treaty.

 Subject to parliamentary approval of the necessary supplementary estimates the following changes will be made:
<P>

<a name="71105w03.html_para0">The cash limit for class II, vote 1 (Overseas Representation) will be increased by &#163;9,050,000 from &#163;619,826,000 to &#163;628,876,000. The increase is required to cover the costs of major conferences, specifically the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, the EU Presidency and the Asia Europe Meeting, which total &#163;9,000,000. There is also a transfer in of &#163;50,000 from the Home Office for a contribution towards the fight against international drug trafficking.
<P>

<a name="71105w03.html_para1">The gross running costs limit on class II, vote 1 will be increased by &#163;9,050,000 from &#163;525,763,000 to &#163;534,813,000.
<P>

<a name="71105w03.html_para2">The cash limit for class II, vote 2 (Other External Relations) will be increased by &#163;12,600,000 from &#163;217,215,000 to &#163;229,815,000. The increase is required to cover UK contributions to certain OSCE, United Nations and WEU Missions of &#163;12,000,000 and also for a transfer of &#163;600,000 from the Home Office towards certain Overseas Drugs Assistance Programmes.
<P>

<a name="71105w03.html_para3">In addition, the cash limit for class II, vote 3 (BBC World Service) will be reduced by &#163;2,558,000 from &#163;169,906,000 to &#163;167,348,000. This reduction takes account of transfers to the Ministry of Defence of &#163;3,444,000 and to the Cabinet Office of &#163;327,000 to reflect the movement of the BBC World Service Monitoring Service to subscription-based funding. This is partially offset by the take-up of a capital end-year flexibility amount of &#163;1,213,000 as announced by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on 17 July, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>245-50</i>.
<P>

<a name="71105w03.html_para4">The increases will be offset by transfers or charged to the Reserve, and will not, therefore, add to the planned total of public expenditure.

<a name="71105w03.html_para5"><i>Letter from Chris Thompson to Mr. Robert McCartney, dated 31 October 1997:</i>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question on the percentage increase, in 1996, of re-issues of girocheques.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The percentage increase in 1996-97 of re-issued girocheques to benefit customers in Northern Ireland which led to losses to the Department of Health and Social Services was 16.9 per cent. This percentage excludes 234 re-issues in 1995-96 and 982 re-issues in 1996-97 which are still under investigation. The percentage change for each Social Security Office is given in the attached table.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The main reason for the increase between 1995-96 and 1996-97 is that from November 1995, procedures in the Social Security Agency were brought in line with those of the Benefits Agency in Great Britain to reflect the legal position.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Case law in Great Britain on the treatment of claims and payments places the burden of proof on the Department to show that the customer has received benefit from an instrument of payment which has been lost or stolen. This means that the Social Security Agency cannot delay in making a replacement payment, for example, to await the trace encashment of the original girocheque. Within this procedure, all reasonable practical precautions are of course taken before a payment is reissued.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency attaches much importance to the prevention of fraud and the use of taxpayers' money and, taking account of the concern expressed, is reviewing its existing procedures.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I hope this explains the position for you but I would be happy to provide any further information you require.</FONT></UL>

 Monitoring information on the political activity of appointees to the Health and Social Services Councils has only been collected since July 1996. Of the 10 places, out of a full membership of 24, reserved on the Southern Health and Social Services Council for District Council nominees, five are held by SDLP members and five are held by members of the Ulster Unionist Party. The monitoring information held by the Department indicates that no political activity has been undertaken by the other members in the last five years.

 The Derbyshire Police Authority is independent from the county council, an arrangement which was consequent on the Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994. It is the Police Authority which is responsible for setting the budget. The budget is made up of police grant, revenue support grant, non-domestic rates (the business rate) and the police authority precept raised through the council tax. Providing the revenue support grant figure on its own would be uninformative and I have therefore provided a table which shows how the total spending power was made up in the three years referred to in the question.

<P>

<a name="71105w06.html_para2">The task force was asked last November to propose a five year strategy to reduce the number of fires and fire casualties in dwellings. It has highly commended the enthusiasm with which fire safety and prevention work is already undertaken by some brigades. It wants to build on their success by putting community fire safety at the centre of both policy and action. It recommends a more integrated and business like approach to community fire safety, with the establishment of a national centre to co-ordinate activity and an increased role for Her Majesty's Fire Service inspectorate to support brigades in the delivery of imaginative, well targeted messages. It also recommends that community fire safety should be made a statutory duty of the fire service.
<P>

<a name="71105w06.html_para3">I am grateful to task force members, who came from both the public and private sectors, for delivering an imaginative report in less than a year. I share their high regard for the enthusiasm and expertise of the fire service. It is a high performing service with an excellent record to which I pay tribute.
<P>

<a name="71105w06.html_para4">We must, however, all be concerned by the rising trend in domestic fires, deaths and casualties and the task force therefore makes a strong case for an increased and co-ordinated emphasis on community fire safety. Community safety is not solely about reducing crime. It is about our wider responsibilities to make our

<P><I>5 Nov 1997 : Column: 213</I><P>
communities safe and confident. This report is an important contribution to that overall aim and I note that it strongly endorses the multi-agency approach.
<P>

<a name="71105w06.html_para5">Before I take any decisions on the details of the strategy, I want to hear the views of chief officers, fire authorities and unions who have a crucial role to play in translating the strategy into action. We will therefore be consulting interested parties over the next few months before deciding how to respond to the report.

 At present, when juveniles--aged 10 to 16 years--are charged and not released on bail after a court appearance, they are remanded to local authority accommodation. The local authority may, if it can satisfy certain strict conditions, return to the court and seek a secure accommodation order to place the juvenile in local authority secure accommodation. Separate arrangements exist for 15 and 16-year-old boys who may be remanded direct to prison, again if strict conditions are met. The courts have no power to require any juvenile in this age group to be remanded directly to local authority secure accommodation.




<P>
<P><I>5 Nov 1997 : Column: 214</I><P>

<P>

<a name="71105w06.html_para6">There are, however, existing provisions on the statute book but not yet brought into force which would allow this to happen. Section 60 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 contains provision for the abolition of prison remands for 15 and 16-years-old boys, and gives courts a power to remand these boys. as well as 15 and 16-year-old girls, directly to local authority secure accommodation. Section 20 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 provides for the extension of court-ordered secure remands to 12 to 14-year-olds but only once the provision in section 60 of the 1991 Act has been implemented for 15 and 16-year-olds.
<P>

<a name="71105w06.html_para7">Before the Government can implement section 60 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 and the provisions in the 1994 Act, there must be available a sufficient number of places to meet the expected demand. This is not the case at the moment. Whilst a building programme was put in place to provide 170 new secure places in local authority accommodation for this purpose, the number of juveniles remanded in custody has increased significantly since the building programme began and prison remands now typically stand within the 250 to 300 range. The demand from this group alone would significantly outstrip the capacity of the local authority secure estate even once the building programme has been completed.
<P>

<a name="71105w06.html_para8">The Government are keen to begin implementation of those provisions and have decided to do so in stages. The Government will, therefore, implement the provision in relation to 12 to 14-year-olds as soon as practicable.
<P>

<a name="71105w06.html_para9">The Government, therefore, propose:
(a) that court-ordered secure remands for 12 to 14-year-olds and 15 and 16-year-old girls will be implemented as soon as practicable; and
(b) that the courts should be able to remand the most vulnerable 15 and 16-year-old boys direct to local authority secure accommodation rather than to prison, subject to certain criteria and if a place has been identified in advance.
<P>

<a name="71105w06.html_para10">Under the existing legislation court-ordered secure remands for 12 to 14-year-olds cannot be implemented without first doing the same for 15 and 16-year-olds. The Government intend to use this Session's Crime and Disorder Bill to make the necessary legislative changes; Royal Assent is unlikely before summer 1998. The Government remain committed to implementing the provisions in full and will keep the position under review, but we believe that our current approach is the most practical and effective way forward.
<P>

<a name="71105w06.html_para11">As part of the Government's comprehensive spending review, we are also conducting a study of the whole range of secure accommodation for young people, including the local authority secure units. The Government wish to ensure that the assets and other resources employed in the accommodation and care of accused, convicted and other juveniles who need secure accommodation are used to best effect, including in meeting their educational needs and, where relevant, in tackling their offending behaviour. We will want to see how the proposed court-ordered remands and the associated accommodation fit into our plans for coming to grips with the present range of facilities which make up the juvenile secure estate. Our aim is to press on with this work as quickly as possible.

<P>
<a name="71105w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 There are already powers available to the police to deal with the problem of illegal rave parties. Sections 63-67 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 empower the police to direct persons assembling on land to leave where it is believed that a large-scale gathering--of 100 or more--will take place and would cause serious distress to the inhabitants of the locality by the playing of amplified music during the night. Furthermore, in order to assist the police in preventing such events from taking place, the Act provides them with pre-emptive powers to direct people to leave the land where they reasonably believe that those people are preparing or gathering for such an event. The police also have powers to stop persons proceeding to a rave, or an intended rave, within a radius of five miles of its site.

 The information requested is not held centrally. The costs of specific activities carried out by the police is a matter for chief officers but police forces do not routinely hold information about the time spent on or the costs of individual operations. However, I understand from the Chief Constable of Cheshire that there were two rave parties in the last financial year at the M62 motorway service station at Burtonwood. A total of 220 officer hours was used in the policing of these events at a cost of approximately &#163;3,600.

 Yes. The purpose of the injunction which the High Court granted against <i>The Mail on Sunday</i> was to prevent it from publishing any further material which could damage national security. The terms of the injunction restrained the newspaper from publishing any information provided by Mr. Shayler, but expressly did not apply to the publication of any material in respect of which the Crown serves written notice that it does not seek to restrain publication. The Editor of <i>The Mail on Sunday</i> provided me with a draft of the article which he 



<P>
<P><I>5 Nov 1997 : Column: 216</I><P>
proposed to publish well in advance of the publication date. This enabled me to obtain an assessment from the Director General of the Security Service, who advised me that the article would not cause damage to national security if it were published. Notice was therefore given that we would not seek to restrain publication. The fact that the article was substantially wrong is another matter. The issue here is not necessarily whether a story is true or false as it is quite possible to conceive circumstances in which false accusations might nevertheless cause damage to national security.
<P>

<a name="71105w07.html_para0">This is entirely consistent with the position which the Government have adopted all along. Our concern is to ensure that nothing is published which is likely to damage national security. Former members of the Security and Intelligence Services are in a position to make disclosures which intentionally or unintentionally can cause real damage to national security. The Government cannot stand by and let that happen. We have, however, never sought to suppress criticism of the Security Service--even where that criticism is misguided or inaccurate--provided that national security is not damaged.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Employment Service conducts many different types of interview with jobseekers. These start at the new claims stage and develop as unemployment lengthens. The new jobseeker's interview is important in establishing whether jobseekers meet the labour market conditions for receiving JSA. It is normally at this stage that a Jobseeker's Agreement is drawn up and jobseekers are made aware of their responsibilities in order to receive JSA. Thereafter, entitlement to JSA is reviewed at interviews every fortnight. We also use these opportunities to offer jobseekers further advice and help in their search for work. Jobseekers are also asked to attend a Restart Interview at regular six monthly intervals at which they are offered further advice and information about employment and training opportunities. Beyond this interviews may take place for a variety of other reasons.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Questions about a jobseeker's entitlement to JSA could arise at any of the interviews referred to above. In these instances, there may be a reference to an independent Adjudication Officer for a decision on benefit entitlement.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Statistics on the numbers and types of decisions given by ES Adjudication Officers on labour market questions are recorded in a quarterly summary, the 'Analysis of Adjudication Officers' Decisions', a copy of which is held in the Library. As questions about a person's entitlement can arise during different types of interviews, it would be misleading to compare the total figures of disallowances with the total numbers of ES interviews in any given period. JSA claims can be disallowed on labour market grounds or because of failure to meet the conditions of benefit receipt. However, some broad indication of volumes can be given by comparing the total number of JSA new claims with the number of awards of "nil benefits". This means simply the number of JSA new claims that, following assessment by Benefits Agency who are responsible for JSA payment, result in no payment award. This could be for a wide variety of reasons for inadequate contributions, payments from previous employment, etc, to failure to meet the labour market conditions for receipt of JSA.
</FONT></UL><P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In the period from 1 April 1997 to 30 September 1997, 1,571,325 claims to JSA were processed and there were 239,567 awards of nil benefits.

 Full-time undergraduate students will be required to contribute up to a maximum of &#163;1,000 a year in tuition fees, depending on their parents', spouses' or own income. The requirement will apply to students resident in all parts of the United Kingdom and studying in publicly funded institutions throughout the UK, except for medical and dental students in the fifth and subsequent years of study.
<P>

<a name="71105w11.html_para0">Students resident in Scotland and studying in Scottish institutions on honours degree courses that are a year longer than equivalent courses elsewhere in the UK will, however, have their fees paid in the final year of the course by the Scottish Student Awards Agency. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland has decided to give special consideration to such students in the light of recommendations from the Dearing and Garrick reports and in recognition that many Scottish students have had only one year's education after statutory schooling before entering university, compared with the two years that students resident elsewhere in the UK have had.

The cash limit on class XIV, vote 1 will be reduced by &#163;750,000 from &#163;53,462,000 to &#163;52,712,000 as a result of lower than expected claims for local authority coast protection schemes.

This increase results mainly from the take-up of end-year flexibility entitlements for the Welsh Development Agency (3,400,000); the Grant Maintained and Voluntary Aided Schools captial programmes (&#163;2,720,000), an increase to the provision for Regional Selective Assistance of &#163;1,710,00 and a transfer of &#163;577,000 from class IV in respect of the Competitiveness Fund.

This increase is mainly a result of the take-up of end-year flexibility amounts for the Central Government Roads Programme (&#163;1,545,000), IT costs (&#163;603,000) and central administration (&#163;2,161,000).

This increase results mainly from the take-up of end-year flexibility amounts of &#163;8,000,000 for NHS Trusts and &#163;10,000,000 mainly for GP Fundholders and the &#163;9,548,000 additional resources recently announced for the NHS.

<P>

<a name="71105w13.html_para7">The cash limit on class XIV, vote 6 will be reduced by &#163;400,000 from &#163;10,105,000 to &#163;9,705,000 as a result of lower than expected expenditure on Nursery place inspections.
<P>

<a name="71105w13.html_para8">There is also an increase to the non-voted local authority capital cash limit, WO/LACAP. This cash limit has been increased by &#163;10,682,000 from &#163;422,680,000 to &#163;433,362,000 as a result of the take-up of end-year flexibility amounts, mainly to cover slippage on the Strategic Development Scheme and Capital Challenge projects.
<P>

<a name="71105w13.html_para9">All increases will be offset by transfers or charged to the Reserve and will not, therefore, add to the planned total of public expenditure.

Since the European Community (EC) has competence in external trade matters, United Kingdom interests in the subsequent proceedings at the WTO were represented by officials from the Commission Legal Services.

The framework for the conduct of the EC's common commercial policy is set out in Article 113 of the EC Treaty.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what estimate she has made of the expenditure by <i>(a)</i> her Department, <i>(b)</i> its agencies and <i>(c)</i> non-departmental public bodies on (i) tax consultants and (ii) other external tax advice in (1) 1995-96, (2) 1996-97 and (3) 1997-98; and if she will make a statement.

<a name="71105w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Field: </B> 
 Approximately &#163;10,000 has been spent in 1997-98 by the War Pensions Agency. Consultants were employed to review the procedures used by the Agency to account for VAT. This enabled under-deducted VAT to be identified and resulted in revised procedures being introduced. This will ensure that the Agency correctly reclaims those amounts that are due in future accounting periods within the statutory entitlements.

<a name="71105w16.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Malcolm Bruce: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what is her estimate of the additional expenditure by her Department, its agencies and other non-departmental public bodies in <i>(a)</i> 1997-98 and <i>(b)</i> 1998-99 as a consequence of higher uprating for inflation than was assumed at the time of the November 1996 Budget; if increases will be financed from the contingency reserve; and if she will make a statement.[13246]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71105w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Field: </B> 
 Higher inflation than expected in the 1996 Budget has no effect on 1997-98 benefit spending. 1998-99 benefit rates will be announced shortly. Increases in line with prices would mean an increase in benefit spending of about &#163;600 million above that assumed in the 1996 Budget. The Government are committed to staying within their overall spending plans.

<a name="71105w16.html_para0">The all items Retail Prices Index for September will be used as a basis to increase Retirement Pension from 6 April 1998. The new rate of benefit will be calculated by uprating the current rate by the increase in the index and rounding the resulting sum to the nearest 5p. The value of the basic pension is being considered as part of our pensions review.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if she will list each of the functions relating to payment for goods or services supplied for which her Department is responsible indicating the management systems purchased, all sub-contractors involved in the work, co-operative arrangements with other Departments; and the costs of the systems and processes in the last year for which figures are available. [12570]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71105w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Field: </B> 
 The majority of this Department's payments for goods and services are generated via integrated computerised accounting systems, either by bank transfers (CHAPS and BACS) or as system generated payable orders. All invoices are the subject of specific checks and authorisations in accordance with standard Government accounting practice, with responsibilities for verification and certification separated from the actual process of payment.
<P>

<a name="71105w16.html_para4">The Department's primary accounting system is FAMIS (Financial Accounting Management Information System) and amounts due for payment are picked up overnight via the Central Payments Package and issued accordingly. The FAMIS system is based on Millennium software, substantially modified to meet Departmental needs.
<P>

<a name="71105w16.html_para5">The Department does not use sub-contractors for payment work although a number of private companies providing facilities management for Departmental accommodation receive invoices and undertake their initial processing prior to authorisation and payment through Departmental systems. The Department does not 



<P>
<P><I>5 Nov 1997 : Column: 249</I><P>
provide payment services to other Government Departments except where it is the major occupier of accommodation, when, under established service agreements, it may meet the initial costs and recover any balance due. The Department does not use payment systems provided by other Government Departments except where it is a minor occupier under the arrangements described above.
<P>

<a name="71105w16.html_para6">A variety of circumstances can apply to individual payments each of which impact on the administrative cost, but high level information collected by the Department indicates that the total administrative cost of making each payment varies between &#163;2.30 and &#163;5.95. The accounts payable and cashier applications which support departmental payments form elements of much wider accounting packages and specific capital and development costs are therefore not readily available.

 The original European Staff Requirement for Development of Eurofighter (ESR-D) was shaped by the context of the cold war, when the requirement was for an aircraft to counter massed raids of bombers under fighter escort. Following a major review, the ESR-D was reissued in January 1994 having been rewritten to reflect the radically changed political and military situation in Europe since 1987. The review took into account the dangers of regional instability, noting that a potential enemy may still have highly capable fighter aircraft; and that Eurofighter still needs to be capable of performing multiple roles on deployed operations. The aircraft offers a significant contribution to our defence capabilities.

</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The 9.5 acre enclave retained by the MOD within Royal Clarence Yard primarily provides security for the oil pipe and working space to operate and service the facilities on the Oil Fuel Jetty. The waterfront provides essential berthing space for minor vessels while the major jetties within the Naval Base are being refurbished. It is not feasible to relocate these tasks in the area and therefore no figures on costs of relocation are available. In addition, the enclave provides car parking for entitled RN personnel quartered in Gosport but working on the other side of the harbour. The cost effectiveness of this was accepted by Minister (AF) (in the previous administration) as part of the submission to release the major part of the Royal Clarence Yard for sale.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Only 1.4 acres of the enclave are occupied by the furniture store. If this area of the site were released for sale, it is estimated that it would add no more than &#163;300,000 to the sale value of Royal Clarence Yard. The cost of relocating the furniture store on Crown owned land on the Gosport peninsula has been investigated and found to be in excess of &#163;500,000. The alternative of leasing a commercial storage facility in the area is estimated at in excess of &#163;50,000 a year. In the current financial climate neither option would be cost effective for MOD or the taxpayer.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The retained enclave will be the minimum required to meet MOD's needs and if future opportunities were to allow the MOD to relocate any or all of the above facilities in a cost effective manner, further areas would be released for sale.</FONT></UL>
