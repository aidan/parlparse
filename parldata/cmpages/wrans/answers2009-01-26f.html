 The new motorcycle test was due to be implemented on 29 September in accordance with the EU directive 2000/56/EC. However, the Driving Standards Agency (DSA) recognised that having 38 multi-purpose test centres (MPTCs) operational at the launch of the new test would mean candidates in significant parts of Great Britain would not have the expected access to a MPTC. 58 per cent. of the population would have been able to reach a MPTC within 45 minutes travelling time. Following consideration of representations from motorcycle interest groups, DSA decided to defer implementation for six months to allow consideration of delivery options which might help with the number of locations to offer the test when it was launched.</p>

In addition, there are outstanding planning approvals or legal negotiations on a further five sites that the Agency hopes to have ready in time. Not all of these sites are MPTCs. We will have operational sites in 94 per cent. of the original 66 search areas. This means that 89 per cent. of the population could reach a motorcycle testing site within 45 minutes travelling time.

 The enforcement of box junctions in London is carried out under legislation promoted by the relevant local authorities. The Secretary of State has, therefore, no specific powers under which to produce guidance. The remaining provisions in part 6 of the Traffic Management Act 2004&#151;which include the power to enforce box junctions&#151;will be brought into force in due course with regulations. These will be accompanied by statutory guidance setting out the matters to which local authorities using the powers must have regard.</p>

 The 20th IMC report underlines the very significant progress that Northern Ireland has made towards a more normal society; however, dissident Republicans remain active and committed to killing or injuring police officers.

The extension of the decommissioning scheme provides loyalists with a final opportunity to signal their commitment to move forward and give up their weapons.

<i> [holding answer 19 January 2009]: </i>Maintaining Harmony helps to relieve the stress and burden on our armed forces and their families. Consequently, the Service Chiefs expend considerable effort in increasing intervals between operational tours intervals and maintaining the Harmony Guidelines. As I stated in the House on 12 January 2009, breaches of the Harmony Guidelines have decreased, albeit not as quickly as I would have hoped for but, I am confident that the trend is heading in the right direction and that the Service Chiefs have measures in place to monitor and address the breaches while maintaining operational capability. The first table following gives an indication of mean unit tour intervals, which shows that the Royal Artillery, Royal Signals and the Royal Logistic Corps units are suffering greater commitment than most. However, the unit tour interval does not reflect the degree of trickle posting of personnel through these units or how much separation an individual incurs.</p>

<a name="90126w0006.htm_brev0"><a name="09012627001815"><ul><p class="tabletext">Less than 1 per cent. of Royal Navy/Royal Marines personnel were in breach of the single service guidelines.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="90126w0006.htm_para5"><a name="09012627001010">Owing to the introduction of the Joint Personnel Administration system, it is not possible at present to identify the exact level of breach of the Harmony Guidelines in the Army. Validated data will not be available until January 2010 but, for administrative purposes, the percentage is currently being held at 10.3 per cent. the last figure in which we can have confidence before the introduction of the new system. However, every effort is being made by all levels of the chain of command to ensure that soldiers are not overly committed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="90126w0006.htm_para6"><a name="09012627001011">The level of RAF breaches shows a significant drop from 9.4 per cent. to 6.1 per cent. The degree of change has been brought about by an amendment to the reporting criteria. The RAF Harmony Guideline has changed from 140 days separation in a 12 month period to 280 days in a 24 month period. Without increasing the level of separation commanders now have greater flexibility to deploy personnel on career courses, education and adventure training without breaking the Harmony Guideline.</p>

 The release of radioactive material to the environment is regulated by the Environment Agency (EA) under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 (RSA93).

 The basis for demonstrating the safe operation of nuclear facilities is that the requirements of good practice in engineering, operation and safety management are met. Risks from activities in the gravel gerties have to meet the legal requirement to be As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP). There are also in place numerical risk targets defined by the independent nuclear safety regulator, the Health and Safety Executive's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII).</p>

The risks for other on-site workers and the public are below the Basic Safety Objective. An ongoing programme of work in the gravel gerties, agreed with the NII, continues to drive risks down further. The NII is satisfied with this strategy and that operations continue to be completed safely.</p>

 In December 2008 I received a letter signed by the Chairman of the BNTVA John Lowe, the hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron) and my hon. Friend hon. the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson). That letter set out a case for an end to the atomic veterans litigation and for payment of damages to "nuclear test veterans and their affected offspring". While I have considered the points made, the Ministry of Defence has seen no general evidence of damage to nuclear test veterans' health, and therefore in my view the atomic veterans litigation must proceed at the High Court.

Both meetings were in clear agreement that compensation should not be discussed in advance of the forthcoming legal case.

 The Ministry of Defence has not settled any common law claims for compensation relating to participation in the British nuclear testing programme of the 1950s and 1960s. The MOD does, however, have a long established war pension scheme which pays no-fault compensation in the form of tax-free pensions and allowances for ex-service personnel injured or made ill as a result of their service before 6 April 2005. There are no time limits for making a claim under the war pension scheme. The scheme is administered by the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency (SPVA). Information on awards under the scheme is published quarterly by the Department's Defence Analytical and Services Agency (DASA) derived from data from the war pension computer system. That data does not enable injuries or illnesses to be linked to service at a particular location. It is not, therefore, possible to identify payments made to British nuclear test veterans under the war pension scheme. Nor is it possible to say how much has been spent on war pensions to nuclear tests veterans.</p>

 The objective of the New Technologies Demonstrator programme (NTDP) is to provide impartial information and impart industry experience to waste stakeholders on new innovative technologies not yet established in England. The intention is to overcome the real and perceived risks and barriers of introducing such technologies in England. This is being achieved through the provision of impartial technical, environmental and economic information and performance data for the project facilities. This includes real experiences of planning and permitting, reaching financial closure and on wider issues such as informing policy development, for example the renewables obligation.</p>

 The UK has tripled the amount of household waste it recycles in the last 10 years, and on the back of this there is a growing recycling and reprocessing industry in the UK, particularly for materials such as glass, newsprint and plastic bottles. Not all of the materials collected for recycling are re-processed into products in the UK: some are re-processed abroad, reflecting trends in the global economy. As with all commodities, the prices for recyclable materials rise and fall according to supply and demand. In the current economic downturn, demand for raw materials&#151;including recyclable waste&#151;has declined, leading to a fall in prices.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what progress his Department has made in sub-Saharan Africa towards meeting targets on the provision of bed nets by World Malaria Day in 2010. [250924]</p>

<p><a name="st_174"><a name="09012636000107"><a name="90126w0014.htm_spnew9"><a name="09012636001698"><b>Mr. Ivan Lewis:</b>
 Progress on halting and reversing the spread of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa has not been sufficient and there is a high risk that the target under Millennium Development Goal 6 will be missed. However, there has been some significant progress in some African countries. In Eritrea, Rwanda and Sao Tome and Principe, deaths from malaria have been halved by following the recommended measures, including providing bednets. Of the 647 million people at risk in Africa, the percentage protected by bednets rose from 3 per cent. in 2001 to 26 per cent. in 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="90126w0014.htm_para2"><a name="09012636000108">Between 2000 and 2007 the Department for International Development (DFID) funded approximately 40 million bednets worldwide (mostly for sub-Saharan Africa) and we estimate that these will have saved 660,000 lives. Over the course of 2008-11 we will provide at least 20 million bednets in sub-Saharan Africa and it is estimated that these should save 330,000 lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="90126w0014.htm_para3"><a name="09012636000109">Our support towards the provision of bednets is usually part of a larger package of measures to improve health and to combat malaria, through a number of programmes and health sector approaches which include the purchase and distribution of bednets. It is therefore difficult to disaggregate the costs of the bednets alone. For example, we contribute to the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) who estimate that they financed 120 million bednets between 2001 and 2006, during which period we provided approximately 8.7 per cent. of GFATM financing.</p>

 Entitlement to disability living allowance is not dependent on a diagnosis or condition but relies instead on the care and/or mobility needs arising.

3. Where more than one disability is present only the main disabling condition is recorded.<br>
4. A diagnosed medical condition does not mean that someone is automatically entitled to Disability Living Allowance.

These statistics are only collected for administrative purposes. For example, a customer would not be awarded Disability Living Allowance on the basis of a diagnosis of drug/alcohol abuse. The decision is based upon the care/supervision and difficulty getting around as a result of the substance dependency and any associated physical or psychological complications.<br>

One of these is the capacity to convert temporary employees to permanent status by a fair and objective process approved by the Civil Service Commissioners. This applies to employees at Administrative level at or after 12 months employment. DWP is currently writing a submission to the Commissioners on the process it proposes to use for the conversion of up to 300 temporary staff.</p>

This has taken place and Ministers announced their intention to make PSHE statutory in October 2008, in recognition of the key role it plays in equipping children and young people with the knowledge and skills they need to lead healthy and successful lives. At the same time, Ministers launched an independent review of how this might be achieved in the most effective and practicable way. Sir Alasdair Macdonald, head teacher of Morpeth school in Tower Hamlets, is conducting the review and will report to Ministers in April 2009. Proposals for the statutory implementation of PSHE will be the subject of a full public consultation.</p>

A new Frank Cocaine campaign was launched in December 2008. Awareness of Frank remains very high: in the latest tracking study (report July 2008) 83 per cent. of young people were aware of the campaign. This figure is unchanged from 2007.</p>

 The project is making good progress. The existing radio communications infrastructure has been enhanced to provide a more resilient network. The project has now moved into the next phase, the provision of new digital radios into fire and rescue service appliances and cars. The installation of radio equipment is almost complete in the first region on the rollout schedule, the North East. Users have welcomed the improved clarity of the system and the better reception compared to the previous analogue networks.</p>

 The stakeholder panel, which I chair, meets regularly to consider how to improve the home buying and selling process, including home information packs. My announcement of 8 December sets out, and makes clear how we plan to improve the content of HIPs to help realise their full potential for consumers. In particular, I have asked Ted Beardsall to convene a working group to consider local property searches. The group will consist of industry and consumer representatives and will consider consumer&#146;s needs, utility and presentation of existing searches information. We will also be working with RICS and other key stakeholders to look at how to ensure consumers receive appropriate information about a property&#146;s condition.</p>

 The effects of the economic downturn on the income of local authorities was an issue identified in a recent report by the Audit Commission entitled &#145;Crunch Time&#146;, which looked at the impact of recent economic changes on local authorities' finances.

Overall Government grant to local authorities will next year be &#163;73.1 billion which provides an increase of 4.2 per cent. on a like for like basis. This is the second year of a three year settlement which provides councils with an additional &#163;8.9 billion up to 2010-11 and gives them the certainty and flexibility they need to plan ahead and manage their budgets. We also expect authorities to deliver &#163;4.9 billion net cash-releasing savings over that period, which can be used to improve services and control council tax pressures.</p>

 Street cleaning is one of the services supported through formula grant. Formula grant, which comprises revenue support grant, redistributed business rates and principal formula police grant, is an unhypothecated block grant which means that councils have the freedom to spend it on any service provided that they meet their statutory duties. For this reason, and due to the method of calculating formula grant, particularly floor damping, it is not possible to say how much grant has been allocated for any particular service.</p>

<p><a name="st_305"><a name="09012646001445"><a name="90126w0030.htm_spnew11"><a name="09012646004992"><b>David Miliband:</b>
 &#147;Laptop diplomat&#148; is a phrase we have coined to describe a member of staff equipped, with mobile communications and a laptop computer, to work away from the embassy. He or she could be based in London or at a Post overseas, working in a single country or on a regional basis, but will have the capability to travel outside the capital city to often remote locations (for example Goma in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, or Juba in southern Sudan) in response to a specific need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="90126w0030.htm_para3"><a name="09012646001446">We are already doing a lot of &#147;laptop diplomacy&#148;. We have laptop diplomats operating in a range of roles and environments across the network, including as conflict advisors and analysts in Africa, in Pakistan&#146;s North West Frontier Province, or as roving envoys in the Pacific and Central Asia. Each scenario is different. But in each case, laptop diplomats give the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) a better understanding of events and a greater ability to influence those events by working more closely with the people who matter, whether they are UN agencies, non governmental organisations or local political figures. We are developing IT solutions that will enable us to do more of it and do it better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="90126w0030.htm_para4"><a name="09012646001447">Those solutions include the &#147;Virtual Embassy&#148;&#151;an interactive website which will build on many of the features of our current embassy websites. They will consist of an external, public-facing web page that provides basic information for visitors (UK or local); some of the services a real embassy provides (for example a click through to real (call centre) or virtual (self help) consular and visa services); and allows some engagement on political issues, through the creative use of tailored, local content and interactive features (such as blogs; videoconferences; discussion forums, and personalisation). In addition, they will include a set of internet-based tools that enable a laptop diplomat to carry out all the functions they could do at their desk in the embassy, anywhere where they have an internet connection. So virtual embassies will provide us with a means to engage with stakeholders and advance policy campaigns in countries where we have no physical presence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"><a name="90126w0030.htm_para5"><a name="09012646001448">Laptop diplomats and virtual embassies are examples of the way the FCO is modernising, helping us to build a flexible, agile overseas network that adapts quickly to new challenges and delivers for the whole of Government.</p>

It may feature age or developmental inappropriate expectations being imposed on children. These may include interactions that are beyond the child&#146;s developmental capability, as well as overprotection and limitation of exploration and learning, or preventing the child participating in normal social interaction. It may involve seeing or hearing the ill-treatment of another, serious bullying, causing children frequently to feel frightened or in danger, or the exploitation or corruption of children.

 No recent assessment has been made. The framework for the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) introduced in September 2008 requires staff to have the right language skills to support children from birth to five to develop communication skills in English and to help ensure that their welfare needs are protected. The requirements for providers working with older children set proportions for the number of staff required to hold level 2 and 3 qualifications in an area of work relevant to child care (and the Common Core Skills for the voluntary part of the Childcare Register). As part of the requirements candidates need to demonstrate competence in English. Ofsted inspects providers against these requirements. The requirements on settings are designed to help ensure effective standards of communication in settings and to enable parents to choose providers who also speak their home language.</p>

 There is strong evidence to show significant wage and employment benefits for young people achieving well at school, compared to young people who do not attain. These benefits persist throughout peoples' lifetimes. There are also clear benefits of higher skill levels to the economy and to society. There are a number of studies looking at wage and employment benefits of qualifications. For example, research by the Centre for the Economics of Education found that people with five or more GCSEs at A*-C earn on average around 9-11 per cent. more than those without and are around 3 percentage points more likely to be employed. People achieving one to four GCSEs at A*-C earn a positive wage return of around 5 per cent. and are around 1-2 percentage points more likely to be employed than those without.</p>

 The decision to install sprinkler systems in new schools is one for local authorities to make, in accordance with government guidelines contained in Building Bulletin 100. I refer my hon. Friend to the reply given on 7 January 2008, <i> Official Report</i>, columns 200-01W, which gave information on the first seven schools built under Building Schools for the Future. Currently 50 schools have been opened and although we do not hold information on which of these schools have incorporated sprinkler systems, Partnerships for Schools plan to centrally record which schools have sprinkler systems in the next financial year. I will write to my hon. Friend when this is available.</p>

 The Department has announced an independent review of home education. The review will assess the effectiveness of the current arrangements to ensure that any concerns about the safety, welfare or education of home educated children are addressed quickly and effectively. It will also investigate whether local authorities are providing the right type, level and balance of support to home educating families to ensure that they are undertaking their duties to provide a suitable full-time education to their children. Where necessary, the review will also make recommendations for improvements. The review will conclude with a published report in May 2009.</p>

 The Next Generation Learning campaign sponsored by Becta is designed to raise the awareness of parents or carers, employers and learners of the benefits of the use of technology in education and to drive greater demand for it. It demonstrates how greater engagement with parents or carers can increase a learner&#146;s potential, how effective use of technology can improve schools and colleges, and how to ensure children are safe online.</p>

 Reoffending is measured as a rate rather than in terms of numbers of offences or offenders. Frequency of reoffending per 100 offenders is now the main measure of reoffending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_404"><a name="90126w0046.htm_para7"><a name="0901277001156"><i> (a)</i> There are positive indications that offender behaviour programmes may be effective in reducing reoffending for offenders in the community. For example, Offender Management and Sentencing Analytical Services (OMSAS) conducted an analysis on accredited programmes in the community (Hollis, 2007). It compared actual reoffending rates in 2006 with rates predicted on the basis of 2004 data. The reoffending rate for all offenders who had undertaken interventions was 55 per cent., based on a two-year reconviction rate. Programme completers did statistically significantly better than those who did not start or who dropped-out of programmes. The rates were 38 per cent., 61 per cent. and 64 per cent. respectively. This analysis of management information, however, cannot determine whether these differences result from programme impact.</p>

 &#147;Latest Reception&#148; and &#147;Reception Closing&#148; times are locally agreed by all Prison Governors and Area Managers&#151;including those in the juvenile estate&#151;and communicated to escort contractors. Contractors incur performance measures for failing to deliver prisoners before receptions close. These performance measures can translate into financial payments if contractors are unable to demonstrate that the reasons for the failure are outside their control. Generally, the minority of young people who arrive later than the agreed time are nonetheless admitted to the establishment because of the emphasis placed on the primary need to safeguard vulnerable young people.</p>

This outcome was warmly welcomed by the English wine industry. The reform also provides for the UK to establish a national programme to assist the development of our domestic wine industry. After consulting with the industry, further funding is being provided through the Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE) to establish training programmes to help upskill this rapidly developing sector. The English wine industry is also able to access funds from the RDPE for a range of other activities and a number of applications have already been approved.</p>

<i> [holding answer 19 January 2009]:</i> Warm Front is the Government&#146;s main scheme for tackling fuel poverty in the private sector in England for vulnerable householders. It is administered and managed by Eaga plc. on behalf of the Government. The scheme provides grants for specified heating and insulation measures up to &#163;2,700 in value (&#163;4,000 where the work includes installation of an oil fired central heating system). Pensioners in receipt of qualifying benefits (such as pension credit) are eligible to full assistance under the scheme.</p>

Subject to survey of a property, suppliers are currently offering all households without insulation at least 50 per cent. discount from the Energy Saving Trust guide price for insulation measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_426"><a name="90126w0049.htm_para8"><a name="0901277001818">For reasons of equity, we oblige suppliers to meet 40 per cent. of their CERT in a priority group of vulnerable and low-income households. This means anyone over 70 years, or those in receipt of qualifying benefits (e.g. income, pension benefit) including those over 60 years. To meet their targets, suppliers currently offer priority groups such measures at little or no cost, subject to survey. People over 70 years are statistically shown to be increasingly at risk of falling into fuel poverty, and are therefore included in the priority group definition.</p>

The NDA&#146;s current planning assumption is that the plant will be able to generate until December 2010 and they expect shortly to seek the appropriate regulatory approval to extend generation to this date.

The Department has made initial estimates that continuing work on new, centrally recorded public capital funded hospital and other health care schemes will sustain and create over 7,500 construction jobs in 2009-10.

 Information is collected on the number of finished admission episodes to hospital. A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.</p>

The code &#145;X99&#146; includes cases where someone has been attacked using a sharp object (including but not exclusive to knives). The tables provide data which are broken down by each strategic health authority. It is not possible to provide a response to this question for each national health service trust as the numbers involved are mostly very small and many of them would need to be suppressed in order to preserve confidentiality.</p>

This is why we now have over 740 new community mental health teams offering home treatment, early intervention, or intensive support for people who might otherwise have been admitted to hospital, and now have 64 per cent. more consultant psychiatrists, 71 per cent. more clinical psychologists and 21 per cent. more mental health nurses than in 1997. In addition we are rolling out a programme to give more access to psychological therapies to people with depression and anxiety. The provision of all NHS services, including mental health treatments, ultimately rests with commissioning trusts and it is for primary care trusts, in conjunction with their strategic health authorities, to plan and develop services according to the needs of their local communities.</p>

These record levels of capital investment in the national health service estate have resulted in a quarter of the estate occupied by NHS trusts being replaced since 1997, and the proportion of the estate that predates the establishment of the NHS itself has fallen from 50 per cent. in 1997-98 to less than 20 per cent. in 2007-08.</p>

The majority of backlog maintenance relates to low priority work, which trusts will undertake through maintenance programmes. Where higher risks are present, work will be undertaken as a priority. While levels of backlog maintenance vary across the NHS, it is estimated that around 75 per cent. of the total costs to eradicate backlog maintenance is concentrated in 20 per cent. of organisations.</p>

 Care homes registered with the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) must provide a report of serious incidents to CSCI.

FDs were only introduced in 2001/02 and until 2004/05 there were relatively low numbers of qualifiers, which makes the figures inherently more volatile. It is also important to note that FD qualifiers tend to be older than qualifiers from other levels of study. Older qualifiers are less likely to go on to study for a first degree in the year immediately following qualification, because they are often already employed and tend to have other financial and domestic commitments. They may therefore be more likely to proceed to further study at a later date.</p>

 Transnational education&#151;the delivery of the courses and qualifications of one country in another one&#151;brings great benefit to the individual higher education institutions (HEIs) involved as well as to the country as a whole. It makes a major contribution to the high reputation enjoyed by UK higher education in other parts of the world. The overall value of transnational higher education to the UK is estimated to be some &#163;200 million per annum. A recent study commissioned by the Department and published by Sheffield Hallam University in May 2008 found that our institutions are well-engaged in making their high quality programmes and expertise available in other countries. The report, entitled &#147;Transnational education and higher education institutions: exploring patterns of HE institutional activity&#148;, is available on the research and analysis pages of the Department&#146;s website. As part of the second phase of the Prime Minister&#146;s Initiative for international education (PMI2), &#163;4 million has been allocated in 2007-08 to supporting HEIs in developing international partnerships and expanding their successful transnational education strategies to further improve the visibility of UK higher education on the international stage. Some 189 projects are being supported which involve UK HE institutions collaborating with institutions overseas.</p>

Increasing initial participation in higher education towards 50 per cent. of those aged 18 to 30 is challenging but is an essential investment in our future prosperity.

 Higher Education Institutions are responsible for their own banking and investment decisions and we have no data on the individual decisions they have taken. But the total level of annual income from all such investments is about 2 per cent. of the total income institutions now generate each year. The Higher Education Funding Council for England will keep the situation under review but has concluded that no institution is at risk as a result of any investment decisions it has taken. There is therefore no reason for students, prospective students, businesses or charities to reconsider their dealings with universities and other higher education institutions.</p>

</ul><a name="90126w0061.htm_brev2"><a name="09012749001871"><ul><p class="tabletext">2. We have always been aware that the scope of this first annual review, scheduled for December 2008, would inevitably be limited. We are only in the first year of the new arrangements, only a minority of the overall redeployment of funds have taken place and limited data regarding 2008-09 entry will be available at this point in time. One role of this initial investigation is therefore to provide a baseline for future reviews, but this should not rule out appropriate changes, if they are justified by the evidence.</p>
</ul><a name="90126w0061.htm_brev3"><a name="09012749001872"><ul><p class="tabletext">3. I am, however, also conscious that the economic climate has changed since John announced the Government&#146;s new policy on ELQ funding in September 2007. In an economic downturn it is more important than ever that individuals and businesses have access to high quality, affordable educational provision to improve competitiveness and to enable workers to enter growth areas in the labour market.</p>
</ul><a name="90126w0061.htm_brev4"><a name="09012749001873"><ul><p class="tabletext">4. As you review the implementation of ELQs, I would like the Council to consider whether there is evidence that any modification to the approach decided on earlier this year will help universities respond more effectively to the challenges of the economic downturn. The review should not, however, lead to a significant net increase in the overall number of ELQ students studying exempt or protected subjects because we will continue to give priority for public funding to those who have not yet obtained a first higher education qualification.</p>
</ul><a name="90126w0061.htm_brev5"><a name="09012749001874"><ul><p class="tabletext">5. As part of the review, I would like the Council to investigate whether there is any evidence available of changes in the flow of students as a result of ELQ policy. If there is concrete evidence of a large fall in demand at national level for a subject of national strategic importance, I would like the Council to advise us on:</p>
</ul><a name="90126w0061.htm_brev6"><a name="09012749001875"><ul><p class="tabletext">a. the scope to increase demand for that subject from those without an equivalent or higher level qualification</p>

</ul><a name="90126w0061.htm_brev8"><a name="09012749001877"><ul><p class="tabletext">c. the scope for labour market demand for graduates in that discipline to translate into increased employer funding to support students in that discipline; and only then</p>

</ul><a name="90126w0061.htm_brev10"><a name="09012749001879"><ul><p class="tabletext">6. In any such cases, the Council should also advise on the scope for removing exempted or protected subjects from the list. We will then work with you to agree any changes to the subjects that are exempted or protected.</p>
</ul><a name="90126w0061.htm_brev11"><a name="09012749001880"><ul><p class="tabletext">7. It is, of course, for the Council to decide on the best way of conducting this review but I would like it to take an evidence-based approach. I imagine the review will exclude Strategically Important and Vulnerable Subjects because the health of these disciplines rightly falls under the remit of your new Strategically Important Subjects advisory group, chaired by Peter Saraga. And, given your additional support for SIVS, it would be difficult (if not impossible) to establish a baseline for the review that would be comparable with other subjects. You will, no doubt, work with Peter&#146;s group as and when it is necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_509"><a name="90126w0061.htm_para5"><a name="09012749000641">Loans are also written off if a borrower dies, or receives a disability benefit and because of the disability is permanently unfit for work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_510"><a name="90126w0061.htm_para6"><a name="09012749000642">The significant rise on write offs for the financial year 2007-08 is due to &#163;3.2 million of backdated write offs for individual voluntary arrangements (IVAs) and bankruptcy, which the Student Loans Company did not have the functionality to process until that year. Since the Higher Education Act 2004 came into force, borrowers declaring themselves bankrupt have still been liable for their student loan debt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_511"><a name="90126w0061.htm_para7"><a name="09012749000643">The steady rise in the amount of public loan debt written off each year also reflects the growing maturity of the student loan book. In other words, there has been a year-on-year increase in the total number of loans which have been issued since the schemes began.</p>

<i> [holding answer 22 January 2009]:</i> In the last three months, Members have tabled five questions on this subject. The Department has also received representations from members of the public and the press.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_513"><a name="90126w0061.htm_para9"><a name="09012749000649">The legislative provisions for income contingent repayment student loans require that the rate of interest must: (i) be no higher than is necessary to maintain the value of the loan in real terms; and (ii) not exceed 1 per cent. above the highest of the base rates of a specified group of banks<sup>(1)</sup> (the &#145;low interest cap&#146;).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_514"><a name="90126w0061.htm_para10"><a name="09012749000650">The interest rate is normally set every September to equal the retail prices index for the previous March&#151;currently 3.8 per cent. Following the reduction in the Bank of England base rate by the Monetary Policy Committee on 4 December 2008, all the specified banks reduced their base rates to 2 per cent. and the low interest cap came into play. The Student Loans Company (SLC) therefore reduced the interest rate for income contingent loans from 3.8 per cent. to 3 per cent. with effect from 5 December 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_515"><a name="90126w0061.htm_para11"><a name="09012749000651">Following the latest reduction in the Bank of England base rate on 8 January 2009, all the specified banks have now reduced their base rates to 1.5 per cent. The SLC therefore reduced the interest rate for income contingent loans from 3 per cent. to 2.5 per cent. with effect from 9 January 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_516"><a name="90126w0061.htm_para12"><a name="09012749000652">The SLC published this information on their website and in national newspapers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_517"><a name="90126w0061.htm_para13"><a name="09012749000653">The interest rate for loans taken out before 1998 (known as &#145;mortgage style loans&#146;) is not affected as these loans are governed by different legislation.</p>
