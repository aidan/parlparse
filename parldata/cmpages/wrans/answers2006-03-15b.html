<p>
<a name="60315w01.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">Through engagement with the IADB and the World Bank, DFID is supporting greater involvement of civil society and local communities in IFI programmes and processes, such as consultations around development and evaluation of IFI country strategies. In Brazil, the UK is helping local communities give their own assessment of the impact of the Federal Government&#039;s conditional cash transfer programme, the Bolsa Familia. This programme provides a monthly cash benefit to a current total of 8.7 million poor families across the country, which is conditional on children attending school and immunisation programmes. The UK is also contributing to a programme to enhance the capacity of indigenous people&#039;s organisations throughout Amazonia. Indigenous leaders meet regularly, receive training together, and consider how to promote their entitlements to services and to strengthen social cohesion in Amazon communities.

 Latin America has high levels of persistent and severe poverty and inequality. According to 2004 national poverty line data collected by the United Nations, 42.9 per cent. of the population of Latin America live in poverty and 18.6 per cent. live in extreme poverty. The levels of extreme poverty are higher among indigenous and afro-descendant people.

<a name="stpa_12">DFID&#039;s strategy for Middle Income Countries (MIC) provides the framework for how DFID works to reduce poverty and inequality in Latin America. DFID&#039;s main financial contributions to Latin America are through direct contributions to the multilateral institutions (the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank, the European Commission and the United Nations). As recommended by the MICs Strategy, DFID uses its bilateral programme (&#163;11 million in 2005&#150;06 and &#163;12 million in 2006&#150;07) for Latin America to maximise the effectiveness of our multilateral contribution by working to enhance the overall impact of the international system in the region. DFID&#039;s assistance to Latin America from 2004&#150;07 is set out in the Regional Assistance Plan, copies of which are available in the Libraries of the House.

<p><a name="qnpa_3">(4) which 20 non-governmental organisations working in Latin America received the highest amount of grant from his Department for microfinance or microcredit projects in each year since 1997.  [58036]</p>




<p><a name="st_9"><a name="60315w01.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 Lack of access to affordable credit is a persistent constraint to livelihoods of the poor in Latin America. For both formal and informal small scale enterprises, which are the main employers of the poor in urban and rural areas, limited forms of formal collateral exclude them from access to borrowing from the formal financial sector. Microfinance institutions have an important role to play in meeting this gap for small enterprises and producers. However, microfinance institutions can also have high transaction and operation costs and frequently rely on external, often donor, financing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60315w01.html_para16">
<a name="stpa_16">Many donors, including the International Financial Institutions, are working on instruments that will guarantee loans to the poor, as well institutional models that will enable larger financial institutions to extend financial services to poorer communities and small enterprises. In the meantime, microfinance institutions continue to play a crucial role in meeting the demands of the poor for financial services tailored to their particular needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60315w01.html_para17">
<a name="stpa_17">If microfinance remains reliant on donor grants, it will always be limited and not reach the scale possible through involvement of the private sector. By combining the strengths of microfinance non-governmental organisations (NGO)s (microfinance expertise, community presence, commitment to serving very poor people) and those of banks (financial resources, information technology, payment systems), massive increases can be made in providing microfinance to the poor. The experience of ICICI Bank in India, the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh and Bancosol in Bolivia clearly demonstrate this. ProFund Internacional (ProFund), based in Costa Rica, targets the small and microenterprises (SMEs) of Latin America and the Caribbean. Major shareholders of ProFund include the InterAmerican Development Bank, IFC/The World Bank Group and CDC.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60315w01.html_para18">
<a name="stpa_18">Globally, DFID has supported microfinance and financial sector projects in 25 countries. In Latin America, DFID is working closely with partner governments to improve the institutional framework within which microfinance institutions operate. DFID&#039;s Regional Assistance Plan for Latin America aims to improve the impact of International Finance Institutions (particularly the World Bank and Inter American Development Bank (IADB) on poverty and inequality. This includes working with the IADB and the World Bank to strengthen the access of poor and excluded people to local and national markets, including access to micro-credit. In Nicaragua, DFID is providing $150,000 to an International Finance Corporation initiative to support the microfinance industry to develop new products and lending models specifically targeted at the small enterprise sector. In Bolivia, DFID is in dialogue with the new Government 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 Mar 2006 : Column 2249W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
on the institutional structure for microfinance, informed by an analysis of models for credit services to poor rural producers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60315w01.html_para19">
<a name="stpa_19">Microfinance has often tended to be a component of wider DFID projects. For example, the United Nations Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) Alternative Development project in the Lower Huallaga Valley, Peru (completed in 2004), which worked with farmers to increase their incomes from alternative livelihoods and avoid a reactivation of the illegal cultivation of coca. A similar project in San Martin region of Peru included microfinance and supported small-scale production, agro-processing and environmental education to improve incomes and employment of poor producers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60315w01.html_para20">
<a name="stpa_20">DFID&#039;s fund allocations are determined by country and region rather than by sector. The overall budget for microfinance and the proportion allocated for Latin America is therefore not readily available.

<a name="stpa_21">DFID has Partnership Programme Arrangements (PPAs) with six international NGOs for their programmes in Latin America and the Caribbean.

 There has been some slippage on progress towards Target 4 of DFID&#039;s Public Service Agreement Objectives and Targets for 2003 to 2006. Progress with the current round of trade negotiations is the main influence on this target, and this depends on the actions of the EU and others within the World Trade Organisation (WTO). After the failure of the Cancun WTO Ministerial in September 2003, there was no likelihood of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) being completed by 1 January 2005. Thus the original target, which was always challenging, was unachievable. However, the WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong in December 2005 delivered enough progress to keep the prospect of concluding the DDA in 2006 alive. The Government are therefore pressing for an outcome to these trade talks which delivers real gains for developing countries.

 The Post-Primary Review Working Group (Costello Group) considered the range of courses available in post-primary schools and found that the educational provision and choice available to pupils varied greatly, across Northern Ireland. To enable all post-primary pupils to reach their full potential and to gain the knowledge and skills necessary for life and work in the 21st century, the group considered it important to establish a framework of educational entitlement for every pupil.

<a name="60315w06.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">The group recommended that the minimum entitlement at key stage 4 and post-16 should be set at a level that is capable of being provided in a locality, ensuring that all pupils have choice from a wide range of courses including a blend of academic and vocational courses.

 The Permanent Secretary, in his/her role as Accounting Officer of a Department, is responsible for securing value for money for all departmental expenditure. Guidance requires that payments take account of the &#039;Better Payment Practice Code&#039; and also covers advance payments which may be sought in return for a price discount. Purchasing guidelines requires Departments to consider discounts as one element of the total cost of the purchase of goods or services. This is facilitated by arrangements which make use of specialist purchasing expertise. Experience suggests, however, that early invoice payment discounts are rarely offered, as standard contract terms tend to be used requiring that invoices are paid within 30 days.

I am aware that filling stations in the South West and East of England are already providing dedicated E85 pumps on their forecourts and that other retailers are considering doing so.

 The cost of moving the Highways Agency financial systems to the SAP system is being examined as part of the Department&#039;s shared services programme, taking into account the experience of moving the Agency from its legacy cash accounting systems to the Oracle system during 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04. As Highways Agency finance will not be migrating to SAP for another three years, the full costs will not be known until detailed technical work, planned for a later stage of the shared services programme, is complete.

A very broad estimate of the full costs of migrating Highways Agency finance of &#163;10 to &#163;15 million was given in oral evidence to the Transport Select Committee by the Agency&#039;s Finance Director on 15 February 2006. The migration costs reflected in the interim business case for the shared services programme assumed that it could be done for less, taking into account the work that would already have been carried out in establishing the core SAP platform.

This showed that, based on the total estimated economic investment cost of &#163;49.5 million (including &#039;optimism bias&#039; of &#163;5 million), the programme would pay back in 6 years with a net present value after 10 years of around &#163;46 million.

 The revised Northwest Regional Economic Strategy, to be launched in March, sets out the future approach to develop the economy of the region and is the key document in which the RDA&#039;s business plan and other documents will be based. The first port of call for business support is the Business Link network within the Local Business Link or through the national website (businesslink.com). Last April oversight of Business Link passed to the RDAs and a review is currently being undertaken by the North West Development Agency (NWDA) of its Business Support and Business Link activities to ensure that these services address the main issues identified in the new Rural Economic Strategy (to be launched in March). The NWDA is also investigating how private sector business support activities can be better incorporated and leveraged by the public sector to improve the overall access, level and quality of service to businesses. Core issues under review include improving client awareness and understanding of services, simplifying services and improving efficiency.

<a name="stpa_45">Business Link is a national brand&quot; delivered locally, with the RDA responsible for quality delivery. The Business Link service will be a key driver to improving access and the review specifically focuses on how the business model for this service can be extended to increase penetration and access, in part through utilising existing business support structures. The NWDA is also investigating ways in which access and support to &#039;harder to reach&#039; clients and those with different needs can be improved, such as mainstreaming where appropriate.

<p><a name="st_92"><a name="60315w15.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 It is the Ministry of Defence policy to encourage the civil use of defence facilities wherever possible, provided it is consistent with departmental requirements. Thus civil aircraft may land at most UK military airfields where they have prior permission, which is normally granted at local level. All such users are required routinely to give at least 24 hours notice. We also have arrangements to approve civil users for regular use of particular airfields.

 In 2002&#150;03, Manchester University carried out an evaluation of the care-planning system in place at that time&#151;the F2052SH. Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) was developed to address problems identified in that study as well as reflect wider developments in prisoner care. ACCT was introduced into five pilot prisons in January 2004. An internal, interim evaluation was conducted in the summer of 2004 and further improvements were made as a result. A full, independent, study of ACCT was commissioned from a consortium of researchers from Manchester and London Universities. The findings of this evaluation, alongside feedback from establishment staff, Area Safer Custody Advisers and the National Institute for Mental Health in England (NIMHE) regional leads, will be used to inform a review of ACCT and the suite of ACCT training courses that is being undertaken during 2006.

However there are a multitude of factors which may explain changes in self-inflicted deaths in particular establishments. Early indications are that the three year rolling average rate of self-inflicted death has fallen by 4 per cent. in the first five pilot prisons to introduce ACCT, and by 12 per cent. in the first 30 prisons to adopt the new system. There have also been encouraging results with regard to self-harm rates at these prisons. This information is provided to the steering board&#151;on which NIMHE is represented&#151;that oversaw the development of ACCT and continues to supervise its implementation and review.

 Sentences of custody plus will comprise a short custodial term (2&#150;13 weeks) followed by a minimum of six months on licence. The custodial period will be served in full (less remand time allowed and home detention curfew). Sentencing in individual cases is entirely a matter for the courts. For planning purposes, the impact of custody plus has been assessed under the broad assumption that the majority of those currently getting a custodial sentence of less than 12 months and half of those currently getting a custodial sentence of exactly 12 months will get this sentence. (For those currently getting very short custodial sentences (less than a month) it has been assumed that about half will get a community order or a suspended sentence order.) The distribution of the custodial element of the custody plus sentence has been assumed to follow a similar distribution to that of the sentences it replaces but within the two-13 week band.

An information leaflet about managing self-harm written by a prisoner for prisoners includes information on how to manage self-injury and how to get help within the prison context. Touch screen technology is being developed in prisons to inform prisoners of where to obtain support and how to support other prisoners.

<a name="stpa_95">The British Dental Association (BDA) has made recent representations about the contractual requirement for dentists to carry out an agreed number of (weighted) courses of treatment or units of dental activity, in return for their guaranteed annual contract value.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60315w22.html_para14">
<a name="stpa_96">The Department has indicated to the BDA that we regard the new contracts as offering a good deal for dentists. They will have a guaranteed annual contract value based on their current national health service earnings, which give an average net income of &#163;80,000 per year for a committed NHS dentist, for at least 5 per cent. fewer (weighted) courses of treatment compared with the current general dental services system. The Department has expressed concern that the BDA appears to be overlooking the evidence of the personal dental services pilots, which have shown that abolishing the fee-per-item remuneration system, also supports dentists in carrying out simple courses of treatment, with more time available for preventative work.

Notes:<br>

1.Finished admission episodes:<br>

A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

2.Main operation:<br>

The main operation is the first recorded operation in the hospital episodes statistics (HES) data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, for example time waited, but the figures for all operations count of episodes give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.<br>

3.Time waited (days):<br>

Time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

4.Ungrossed data:<br>

Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data, that is, the data is ungrossed.<br>

Notes:<br>

1.Patient counts<br>

Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier hospital episodes statistics identification (HESID). This identifier is derived based on patient&#039;s date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data is incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is 



therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patient may have episodes in more than one cell.<br>

2.All diagnoses count of patients<br>

These figures represent a count of all patients where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the HES record.<br>

<p><a name="st_185"><a name="60315w26.html_spnew3"><b> Bill Rammell: </b> 
 The Department does not hold figures for adult education funding at local or regional levels. The Department allocates funds for the post-16 education and training sector to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) working through 47 local offices. Some of the information you require is available on the LSC&#039;s website. The LSC was established in 2001 bringing the planning and funding of post-16 education together under one body within a framework set by Government. Mark Haysom, the council&#039;s chief executive has written to the hon. Member and a copy of his reply has been placed in the House Library.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what transfer of resources she proposes to make in respect of the transfer from April 2006 of responsibility from her Department to local education authorities for the provision of assistive technology to pupils with complex physical, learning and communication disabilities who are presently supported under the Communication Aids Project.  [58300] 
</p>



<p><a name="qnpa_17">Maria Eagle: None. We have always made it clear that the Communication Aids Project, which ends in 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 Mar 2006 : Column 2341W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
March 2006, was created to supplement, not replace, provision made locally for school-age children with significant communication difficulties.
</p>



<p><a name="qnpa_18">Local service providers have a central role in meeting needs, including the needs of individuals with severely impaired communication. Where children are concerned, we would be looking to children&#039;s services, through children&#039;s trusts, to provide appropriate support and equipment to all disabled children.</p>

<p><a name="st_186"><a name="60315w27.html_spnew0"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 Since it was launched in 2002, almost 30,500 copies of the Department for Education and Skills and Department of Health&#039;s Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASDs): Good Practice Guidance have been distributed on request and free of charge. It is not possible to say how many of these sent to private addresses were ordered on behalf of schools and local authorities, however at least 8,500 have gone to schools and at least 3,700 have gone to local authorities. The guidance has also been available on the Department&#039;s website since 2002. Three conferences were held in 2003 in London, Nottingham and Leeds to promote the guidance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60315w27.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_110">Through the work of the Department-funded Special Educational Needs Regional Partnerships the Guidance is being used to audit and develop provision. For example, the West Midlands has developed an early interventions framework for children with ASDs based on the Guidance, the North West is using the guidance to undertake peer supported self-reviews of support services across the region and the South West produced Aiming High&quot;, a video to illustrate the implementation of the guidance in schools. Individual authorities, such as Bolton and Worcestershire, have also worked with the guidance to develop provision in their areas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60315w27.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_111">The Department will, with the Autism Working Group which developed the Good Practice Guidance, look at how use of the Good Practice Guidance and its effectiveness can be evaluated and what can be done to build on it to encourage more good practice throughout the country.

 In Hendon constituency the rates of authorised absence (percentage of half days missed in 2004/05) were 5.3 per cent. in maintained primary schools and 5.6 per cent. in maintained secondary schools. The comparative rates for unauthorised absence were 0.9 per cent. in primary schools and 1.1 per cent. in secondary schools. The primary school rates for both authorised and unauthorised absence are above the local authority (Barnet) and National averages. Hendon secondary schools were below the National average for authorised and unauthorised absence, but were above the local authority average for unauthorised absence.

Data are given in the table for exclusions from Hendon secondary schools from 1999/2000 to 2003/04. Over the last three years the rates of permanent exclusions in schools in Hendon have been half of those for Barnet LA and for England, however the figures for Hendon are quite small and can fluctuate over the years.

 I have overall responsibility for the LSC; however the operations of the LSC are managed and overseen by Mark Haysom, the LSC&#039;s chief executive. Allocations to regional and sub-regional levels are a matter for the LSC. Mark Haysom, LSC&#039;s chief executive has written to the hon. Gentleman with further information and a copy of his reply will be placed in the House Library.

<a name="stpa_122">The following table shows the changes in total funding of the LSC between 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 by region. Note that the LSC are unable to disaggregate all of the funding between youth and adult, as much of the funding allocated to local offices is not specifically age-based. The figures in the table do not include budgets allocated specifically to the LSC&#039;s national office and national programmes.

They are expected to pay particular attention to development proposals for sites where there is reason to suspect contamination, such as from former landfill, and where particularly sensitive uses are proposed, including those involving children. When determining planning applications, local planning authorities should be satisfied that the site concerned is suitable for the new use and that the development does not create unacceptable risks. If a local planning authority is not satisfied on the basis of the information provided by the applicant, and available from other sources, including the responses of those consulted, planning permission should be refused.

DFID has been closely monitoring the cholera outbreak in Southern Sudan since it began in late January. The outbreak started in Yei town in southern Sudan and subsequently spread to Juba and a dozen other towns further east and north. To date (12 March 2006) 212 people have died from the disease from a case load of 6,744. The recent outbreak and its subsequent rapid spread to neighbouring towns underlines the threat of disease while the imminent onset of the rainy season will serve to increase the difficulties faced by vulnerable people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60315w35.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_159">DFID has been active in supporting the co-ordination of response efforts in the south and in monitoring the situation. The Emergency Preparedness and Response Unit managed by the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) together with the World Food Organisation (WHO) have been at the forefront of coordinating the response to the outbreak. DFID has been working closely with OCHA providing technical advice, support and funding.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60315w35.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_160">Through the Emergency Response Fund (ERF) of UNOCHA, DFID has provided over $350,000 to eightUN agencies and non-governmental organisations assisting with the response to the cholera outbreak. An additional $750,000 of FID funds remain with the ERF for continued assistance to agencies if the disease spreads further.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60315w35.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_161">To date, the large number of returns of refugees and Internally Displaced People predicted by the UN and others have still not taken place. There is still potential or significant movement in the run up to the rainy season though this is considered unlikely.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60315w35.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_162">The outbreak of cholera has affected the returns programme. The return programme for up to 4000 people from Juba to Bor has been suspended because of fears of further disease transmission. With DFID support, various agencies are responding to the cholera outbreak at Lologo returnee way-station near Juba and at Bor way-station which currently holds approximately 1000 returnees. Other DFID supported initiatives include health education, containment centres, and water and sanitation initiatives.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60315w35.html_para13">
<a name="stpa_163">In addition to supporting such chronic and rapid onset emergencies, the UK is providing early and significant contributions to the UN 2006 Work Plan, from which the UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator has already allocated over $40 million to the South, including an allocation of US$500,000 to the Emergency Response Fund. The UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator additionally holds an emergency reserve of $10 million (to which DFID was a significant contributor) which could be accessed to scale up the response to the outbreak should the need arise.
