 The Home Secretary has overall charge for UK resilience and chairs the Ministerial Committee responsible for providing co-ordination and oversight covering all multi-agency aspects. Sir David Omand, the Security and Intelligence Co-ordinator, is responsible for the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, and supports the Home Secretary in this work.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Goodman: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office how many people employed in his Department have claimed statutory sick pay for <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;less than one week, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;one to three weeks, <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;four to six weeks, <i>(d)</i>&nbsp;seven to 12 weeks, <i>(e)</i>&nbsp;13 to 20 weeks and <i>(f)</i>&nbsp;21 to 28 weeks in each year since 1997.

 It is not possible to obtain this information without incurring disproportionate costs.
<P>

<a name="40209w01.html_para9">Cabinet Office is committed to managing sick absence effectively. It has in place robust procedures that reflect the recommendations of the 1998 report "Working Well Together&#151;Managing Attendance in the Public Sector". These are supported by comprehensive in-house guidance and training for managers and individuals. The department is making good progress towards its target for reduced sickness absence of 30&nbsp;per cent. in 2010 compared with 1998 levels.

<P>
<a name="40209w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what arrangements she has put in place for <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;monitoring and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;reducing the administrative costs of communications regulation through (i) the running costs of Ofcom and (ii) the compliance costs of business.  [153035]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w01.html_spnew7"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Parliament has given Ofcom a large degree of financial autonomy appropriate to its independent status. That is normal with sectoral regulators and especially important in media regulation. Nevertheless it is also subject to a number of measures to ensure proper scrutiny of its expenditure, and that its own costs, and the compliance costs of regulated businesses, are no more than necessary to fulfil its statutory duties under the Communications Act 2003.
<P>

<a name="40209w01.html_para13">Ofcom is required to set its charges in a transparent way and justify them to industry. In exercising all its statutory functions, Ofcom is also required to have due regard, among other things, to the desirability of encouraging investment and innovation, and to the principles of good regulation such as consultation, proportionality and selectivity&#151;all of which are very relevant to compliance costs and overall expenditure. In addition, where it plans to introduce significant new regulation, Ofcom is required to carry out and publish an assessment of the likely impact of the measure, allowing a period for consultation, and to take account of responses to it.
<P>

<a name="40209w01.html_para14">Furthermore, Ofcom must produce an annual report and accounts (the latter subject to certification and report by the Comptroller and Auditor General) to be laid before Parliament; its activities can be scrutinised by the Public Accounts Committee and the relevant departmental Parliamentary Select Committees, and by the National Audit Office; its use of public funds is governed by, among other things, a financial memorandum agreed with the Secretaries of State for Trade and Industry and for Culture, Media and Sport; and its expenditure is subject to resource 'caps' agreed with HM Treasury.

 Broadcasters, through contracts with transmission operators, are responsible for maintaining the terrestrial network. But until the analogue signals are turned off, there will not be enough frequencies available to enable all the transmitters to carry digital terrestrial services. We believe that digital switchover could be achieved between 2006 and 2010, subject to our affordability and availability criteria being met, but we can't be more precise at this stage about which transmitters will be converted by any given date.

 The UK plays a major role in combating tuberculosis worldwide through its support for Global Partnerships, such as the Global Fund, and country programmes. Our strategy is to ensure a more coordinated and collaborative international and national effort in TB control. Much of our assistance is given through support to country health sector programmes or as General Budget Support to developing countries. We give significant core contributions to international agencies such as the World Health Organisation, some of which is used to tackle the disease. As a result it is not possible to disaggregate our bilateral expenditure on tuberculosis in the manner requested.

1. The costs for the first few years are shown and are very low because they relate to current public expenditure. The effect on the underlying fiscal position is larger because future public spending liabilities are being increased in respect of people of all ages.<P>

2. The costs given are the gross costs to the nearest &#163;10&nbsp;million, in 2003&#150;04 price terms, using 2004 benefit rates.<P>

3. The costs assume that the first year for which the contributions will be credited is 2004&#150;05.<P>

4. The costs take into account that men aged 60 to 64 are automatically awarded national insurance credits for those years irrespective of whether they are in work or not. These credits count towards state pension entitlement. <P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w03.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Fish reaction depends on the fish species, individual physiology, swimming capacity and condition. Throughout the capture process, the density of fish will be important in determining the reaction of individual fish. The environmental conditions such as temperature, light conditions and seabed type will also have an effect. Fishing gear will also influence fish reaction, mainly through the visual stimuli it creates 



<P>
<P><I>9 Feb 2004 : Column 1144W</I><P>
relative to the background. These fundamental mechanisms of fish reaction may be relatively constant whereas individual reactions will be determined entirely by the particular circumstances to which a fish is subjected at any given moment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs where the primary <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;sandeel, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;cod and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;haddock fisheries in the North Sea are.  [149134]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w03.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Sandeel fishing occurs on grounds where sediment type and oceanography facilitate high concentrations of sandeels. These grounds mainly occur on the western edge of the Dogger Bank, and around the Fisher Bank. A sandeel fishing area off the Firth of Forth is currently closed.
<P>

<a name="40209w03.html_para9">Cod fishing is more widespread. It occurs in the Southern Bight from the eastern Channel to the Dutch coast, off north east coast England from the Humber to Tyne, in part of the German Bight, and in a wide arc from the Skagerrak along the edge of the Norwegian trench to the northern North Sea and the waters east and west of Orkney and Shetland.
<P>

<a name="40209w03.html_para10">Haddock fishing is also widespread, from the Skagerrak to a large part of the northern North Sea, down the western side of the North Sea from Shetland and Orkney to the east coast of Scotland, as far as north east England. Haddock are sparse south of the Dogger Bank.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w03.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Catch per unit of fishing effort is an index that is approximately proportional to the abundance of the fishable stock. A time series of such data could describe stock trends, provided that the index is representative of the whole stock, and is not biased by year to year changes in vessel efficiency, selectivity, or fishing strategy. Such bias can affect the catch per effort of commercial vessels, whereas the index derived from research surveys that fish standard stations using a standard gear year on year is not affected in this way, and is therefore more suitable for tuning ICES stock assessments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w03.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 For optimal stock exploitation each species needs to be caught at a particular size and age, dependent mainly on its growth rate and maturity. The exploitation rate for each species is determined by the design of the gear used to fish it as well as the effort exerted on the stock. Technical Conservation Measures regulating the design of gear are the main method of limiting the catch of juvenile fish. Such controls are imposed by limits on codend mesh size and twine size, the number of open meshes around the codend circumference, the use of lifting bags, the length of 



<P>
<P><I>9 Feb 2004 : Column 1145W</I><P>
extension and the use of attachments. Also selective devices such as square mesh panels and grids may be mandatory.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what assessment she has made of the effectiveness of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;visual and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;aural devices attached to trawls to improve the selectivity of fishing in demersal fisheries;  [150250]
<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment her Department has made of the relative importance of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;aural and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;visual triggers in the escape responses of ground fish in relation to the approach of a towed trawl.  [150898]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w03.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Since the 1950s, studies have shown that vision is very important in determining fish reaction to gears at all stages of the capture process. A variety of experiments have been carried out at the FRS Marine Laboratory, for example on horizontal panels to separate species within a trawl or the use of different coloured twine in escape panels. These studies suggest that when used appropriately, and under certain circumstances (i.e. where light levels are sufficient for the fish to react) such visual devices can subtly improve selectivity. A review is currently being compiled through the ICES Fishing Technology and Fish Behaviour Working Group of the reactions and behaviour of fish to visual components of fishing gears and the effect on catchability in survey and commercial fishing gears.
<P>

<a name="40209w03.html_para12">Reactions of fish to aural stimuli are less clear although it is thought that,when they hear threatening sounds, fish adopt a state of heightened awareness such that they may be more ready to react to subsequent visual cues. There has been little research on the use of aural devices to improve selectivity.

<P>
<a name="40209w03.html_wqn15"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessments her Department has made of the effectiveness of turned-mesh netting in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;improving the escape rate of juvenile fish and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;reducing the attendant mortality; and what the operational disadvantages are of such netting.  [150252]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w03.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Turned mesh netting is standard diamond mesh turned through 90o. Because of the way the twine is knotted, turned meshes tend to remain wider open when under longitudinal tension than standard meshes. Knot slippage and mesh distortion may occur but these problems might be overcome by heat setting the knots or using double knots. Experiments in the Baltic have suggested that selectivity is improved when using turned mesh netting, i.e. more juvenile fish escape. No long-term trials have been carried out in the North Sea on these options although Seafish Industry Authority are planning trials in 2004 on the use of turned mesh in prawn trawl codends.
<P>

<a name="40209w03.html_para13">In April 2004, an ICES Working Group will examine all the recent experimental data from the Baltic on turned mesh selectivity to assess the effect of this netting type. The findings will be published. No information is available on the mortality of escapees from such netting.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment has been made of the effect of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;square knotless netting and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;knotted diamond-mesh netting used for escape panels on (i) different species, (ii) the proportion of escapees and (iii) the mortality of escapees.  [150253]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w03.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Square mesh netting is often used in escape panels because diamond mesh netting closes under tension. Diamond mesh netting can be used as square mesh netting by turning it through 45&#176;. However, in these circumstances the knots in knotted netting are liable to slip unless specially treated, leading to distortion of the meshes. Certain types of knotless netting have been found to be more stable. Legislation allows either knotted or knotless netting as long as knot slippage does not occur. No information is available comparing the selective properties or the resulting escape mortality of these two netting types used in escape panels.

[150294]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w03.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 At their Fisheries Development Centre in Hull the Seafish Industry Authority operate the only flume tank in the UK.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w03.html_spnew18"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 A sub-group of the ICES Working Group on Fishing Technology and Fish Behaviour reported on the selectivity of these Baltic panels in comparison with standard diamond mesh codends in 1995 and 1996. A comprehensive study of the selectivity of these devices was also conducted as part of the EU-funded 'Bacoma' project and published in 2000. It was found that selectivity for cod was better when the panels were placed in the top panel of the codend. A later joint UK and Danish project was funded by the EU to compare the selective performance of both side and top panels in North Sea fisheries. Cod and haddock selectivity was either as good or better with the top panels.

 A range of designs of selective gear could be used to reduce the cod catch in mixed cod and haddock fisheries. The choice of design will depend on the mix of species on the grounds, the species targeted by the fishermen and practical issues such as ease of

handling. Seldom are only cod and haddock caught. A fisherman will choose a design that is practical and gives him an economic return in terms of catch composition for his particular market. In each fishery (e.g. English, Irish, Scottish, Danish, French or Norwegian) fishermen will make different choices of gear design.
<P>

<a name="40209w03.html_para14">An EU-funded project (Recovery) involving most countries bordering the North Sea is currently developing such gears for several mixed species fisheries in the North Sea (Scottish whitefish, Danish whitefish, English Nephrops and Netherlands/Belgian beam trawl fisheries). The industries in each country are involved closely in these projects through industry liaison groups.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w03.html_spnew20"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Cod, other gadoid fish, and some shellfish, appear to be attracted to pipelines, thus creating higher density aggregations that attract fishermen. Cod may also be attracted to the vicinity of rigs, from which fishermen are excluded.

<P>
<P>

<a name="40209w03.html_spnew22"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 A whitefish grid system, the Eurogrid, suitable for use on board most North Sea trawlers for demersal towed gear fisheries has been developed and tested. The grid is made of polyamide, a material selected for high elasticity and strength.
<P>

<a name="40209w03.html_para15">To investigate the selective properties of the Eurogrid, experiments were conducted onboard commercial fishing vessels in all five participating countries (Denmark, France, Norway, Scotland and Sweden). The experiments covered four different species (cod, haddock, whiting, saithe) and five different bar distances. Efforts were made to determine the effective selectivity of the compound gear, consisting of both grid and codend combined, as well as individual components.
<P>

<a name="40209w03.html_para16">The large variability of vessel and gear sizes, deck layout and gear handling methods between individual national fleets necessitated the use of different experimental designs for measuring selectivity. These differences meant that no final conclusions could be drawn as to the selective properties of the Eurogrid compared to a standard 100 mm diamond meshed

codend. However, the results indicate that they are similar to those of other sorting grids used in bottom trawl.
<P>

<a name="40209w03.html_para17">The user-friendliness of the Eurogrid (the low weight, flexibility and ability to be wound around a net drum) makes this a good option in fisheries where grids may be made mandatory. Alternatively it could be used on a voluntary basis. To accompany the final report an installation manual explaining to each fishing industry how the grid is fitted into the gear is available in each of the five languages, together with a short videotape describing the project. In the UK the final design of Eurogrid was featured on the Fisheries Research Services (Marine Laboratory) stand at Fishing 2003 in the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, Glasgow. A paper summarising the final report is currently being prepared for a refereed scientific publication.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w03.html_spnew23"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Some claim that the assessment methods underestimate the amount of fish in depleted stocks subject to recovery plans, although some also appear to accept the results of the same methods applied to stocks that are either stable or increasing. An alternative 'paradigm', which is not about stock assessment but about how stocks should be managed, has been considered, but we do not accept that in the ocean the remedy to over-fishing is to fish even harder.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w03.html_spnew24"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B>

<P>
<a name="40209w03.html_spnew25"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Some species eat the eggs of other fish species, but the literature provides no evidence from around the UK that self-predation of spawn is a significant factor affecting commercial marine species with pelagic eggs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w03.html_spnew26"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Tagging experiments have demonstrated that mature cod aggregate in numerous parts of the North Sea during the winter spawning season, and disperse later to occupy more widely distributed feeding grounds in summer.

 Regional Advisory Councils (RACs) will be advisory bodies and will not at the outset have the power to take management decisions. Nevertheless, they will develop and prove themselves over time.

 Considerable research is going on in Europe to find solutions to the mixed fishery problem. Depending on the season and area, species such as cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, flatfish and Nephrops can be caught at the same time. In the waters round the UK, different solutions in terms of gear design may be required in Scottish, Irish, English or Danish fisheries, depending on the species present and their commercial importance to the fishermen.

Haddock and, to a lesser extent, whiting tend to rise in the mouth of a trawl as they tire. Cod, flatfish, monkfish and Nephrops keep low. Raising the footrope of the trawl or the use of semi-pelagic fishing gear may allow cod to escape under the net but other species may also be lost.

We are unable to disclose precise details of this claim for legal reasons, but we can confirm this claim is still under consideration. Plant disease campaigns over many years have not incorporated compensation for the destruction of affected plants. Our position has been that the limited resources of the plant health service are better deployed in detecting and identifying outbreaks, and in carrying out research on risks and risk management measures. However, we have recently received an approach from industry organisations wishing to discuss possible risk-sharing mechanisms to avoid disproportionate losses to individual enterprises when action has to be taken against plant pests or diseases. We welcome this opportunity to explore the available options. The outcome of these ongoing discussions could have an effect on any individual claims we receive.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;staff and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;resources of (i) the Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate and (ii) other departmental bodies are deployed to detect and control outbreaks of sudden oak death in the UK.  [151955]

 Defra's 75 Plant Health and Seeds Inspectors are already employed for about 20&nbsp;per cent. of their time on inspection and surveillance duties related to Phytophthora ramorum, known in the USA as sudden oak death. Therefore, although there is no specific budget allocation, this amounts to an expenditure of approximately &#163;1.8&nbsp;million in 2003&#150;04.
<P>

<a name="40209w04.html_para13">In response to the growing number of findings of this pathogen in England and Wales, Defra is redeploying around 20 additional staff to assist the Inspectorate in undertaking extra inspections at production nurseries, wild areas and ports of entry. They will be supplemented by the recruitment of six additional full-time Inspectors for 2004&#150;2005. This is part of a package of measures announced on 4&nbsp;December.
<P>

<a name="40209w04.html_para14">Defra is also funding a substantial increase in sample diagnoses undertaken by the Central Science Laboratory (CSL), an executive agency of Defra, which is estimated to cost in excess of &#163;750,000 to the end of 2004&#150;2005. CSL is also involved in ongoing research into "Phytophthora ramorum" to the value of &#163;370,000.
<P>

<a name="40209w04.html_para15">The Forestry Commission (FC) has redirected about 23 staff onto a woodland survey in England and Wales, to be completed by April 2004, which will help us to assess whether Phytophthora ramorum is present in the wider environment. FC will be contributing &#163;50,000 to CSL to fund diagnostics in support of this survey. Resources have also been redirected within the Forest Research Agency (FRA) into projects designed to help us better understand the disease. From January 2004 FRA is responsible for the co-ordination of an EU funded research project on "P. ramorum".
<P>

<a name="40209w04.html_para16">In the devolved administrations the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) 5 Plant Health Inspectors already spend approximately 20&#150;25&nbsp;per cent. of their time on "Phytophthora ramorum" inspection and sampling duties. From January 2004 this team has been brought up to complement with a newly trained inspector. Although there is no specific budget dedicated to Phytophthora ramorum inspections, the total amount to an expenditure for 2003&#150;04 is approximately &#163;90,000.
<P>

<a name="40209w04.html_para17">Seven Forestry Officers have been trained and, from January 2004, are spending approximately 10 per cent. of their time on Phytopthora. ramorum inspection and sampling work, primarily on DARD Forestry Service and private woodland sites with a budget of approximately &#163;65,000. In addition, a Principal Scientific Officer is spending approximately 25&nbsp;per cent. of his time in analysing samples for "P. ramorum". The budget for this work is approximately &#163;50,000.
<P>

<a name="40209w04.html_para18">For 2003&#150;04 the number of Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department staff spending part of their time on detection and control of "Phytophthora ramorum" is seven, including one scientific officer. The total management plan resource employed in this work for 2003&#150;04, to date, is &#163;37,626.

 The Plant Health (Great Britain) Order 1993 (SI 1993/1320, as amended) sets out the controls on the import, movement and keeping of plants within the EU. The Order requires all plants entering the UK from third countries to be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate and are subject to inspection at import. For trade within the EU, specific disease control measures are applied at the place of production and plant passports may be issued that travel with consignments allowing their free movement between member states. From May 2002 measures to control the movement of plants susceptible to Phytophthora ramorum into and within the UK where introduced under the Plant Health "(Phytophthora ramorum)" (England) Order 2002. Following the agreement of community wide measures this Order was superseded in November 2002, by the Plant Health (Phytophthora ramorum) (England) (No. 2) Order 2002 (SI 2002 No. 2573). The latter applied specific disease control measures at the place of production to rhododendrons and viburnums, the two types of plant which have been most often found to be infected in Europe.
<P>

<a name="40209w04.html_para19">Findings of "Phytophthora ramorum" in imported and UK origin plants are of concern and inspections at UK nurseries and ports of entry are to be stepped up to ensure that all consignments of plants moved into and within the UK are free from Phytophthora ramorum and meet plant passport requirements. Any consignment found to be infected, or not to have the correct documentation, will, as now, be destroyed.

<a name="40209w07.html_para1">The purpose of a threshold is to allow for inaccuracies in the target vehicle's speedometer and to provide a consistency in police enforcement.

 St. Cecilia's College suffers from a number of serious deficiencies in the level of permanent accommodation.

It is anticipated that, subject to securing a successful outcome from current discussions on the site issues affecting the school, it should be possible for the scheme for a new school to progress shortly to public advertisement. I would hope that the scheme could be completed within about 2&#189; years following the advertisement.

 National Savings and Investments' primary role is to raise cost-effective financing for the Government and it can only achieve this by offering savings and investment products which are attractive to customers and which they want to buy.

<a name="40209w08.html_para2">The Ordinary Account, set up in 1861, has changed little since it was introduced. Due to extensive changes in the savings market, the Ordinary Account no longer reflects customers' savings needs. In light of this, and following research with a wide range of customers, National Savings and Investments decided, with the Treasury's approval, to close the Ordinary Account and open a new and more appealing product&#151;the Easy Access Savings Account. The features of this new product are aimed at offering customers greater flexibility in managing their savings.

 In common with many other providers, National Savings and Investments' new Easy Access Savings Account requires a customer to have a bank or building society account to receive repayments. The Easy Access Savings Account will therefore not be suitable for those without such an account. However, National Savings and Investments offer other products, including the Investment Account, which can be operated without the need for a bank account. The Post Office card account is limited to receiving pension or benefit payments only and no other credits so would not be suitable as an alternative to use with an Easy Access Savings Account.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence on what date his Department was informed of the purchase in early 2003 by BAE Systems UK from Israel Military Industries of 26,000 155 mm L20 cluster artillery shells; whether the order was made at the behest of his Department; what his Department's response was in respect of this proposed purchase; on what date a Minister was first notified of this proposed purchase and what his response was; on what date his Department purchased these cluster shells from BAE Systems and at what cost; for what reason his Department purchased these cluster shells from BAE Systems rather than from Israeli Military Systems directly; and if he will make a statement.

 A contract was let with BAE Systems on 7&nbsp;November 2002 by the Defence General Munitions Integrated Project Team (DGM IPT). Deliveries from that contract were made in March, May, June and July 2003. I am withholding details of the cost of these munitions in accordance with Exemption 7 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information as it is classified Commercial in Confidence. It is normal practice under the Framework Partnering Agreement with the Royal Ordnance Defence division of BAE Systems for the DGM IPT to use the company as a Prime Contractor whenever it is cost effective and adds value to do so. In this case, these requirements were met since BAE Systems were able to negotiate favourable rates for the shell.

<P>
<a name="40209w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The process for chartering freight-carrying commercial ships is reviewed on a regular basis and was last reviewed during 2003, following the Iraq campaign, when a more robust risk-based assessment was incorporated. Specialist ships are chartered to deliver specific technical capability, primarily outside the United Kingdom and often with limited global availability.
<P>

<a name="40209w10.html_para5">As I said in my previous reply, information on why ships fail consideration of charter is not held centrally. This information could be provided only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="40209w10.html_para6">The selection of ships for charter is dependent on a whole range of factors, of which flagging is but one. The Ministry of Defence charters ships in accordance with the European Union guidelines and to give bias to ships flying the Red Ensign would, therefore, run counter to such arrangements.

During the 12 months before HMS Bridport was placed in extended readiness, no specific repair work needed to be done other than the routine maintenance and periodic safety related tasks which are necessary to enable RN ships to fulfil Fleet tasking. Should the decision be taken to return HMS Bridport to operational service, the cost of regeneration would depend on her material state and the plans for her future tasking at that time. Bridport was to have undergone a refit in 2002. However, in view of the decision to hold her in extended readiness, this work was not undertaken. Therefore, to regenerate her would require, as a minimum, an extended refit.

 <i>[holding answer 19&nbsp;January 2004]:</i> During the crowd disturbance on 10&nbsp;January in Al Amarah an Iraqi threw explosive devices at United Kingdom forces who were endeavouring to calm the situation. The Iraqi was preparing to throw a further device when he was shot and killed by a British soldier. In accordance with standard procedures the incident has been assessed by the local British Commander who concluded that the soldier acted fully within his Rules of Engagement.

 The MOD does not have a single monitoring system in place to ensure consistency in the way that procurement competitions are undertaken. However competitive tendering and evaluation procedures are supported by strong processes operating within well established policy, including formally delegated responsibility and authority, which in itself drives consistency of approach in line with both European Directives and national law. The quality, impartiality and competence of the procurement staff who apply this policy also ensures consistency.

<UL>(2) when he last had reason to intervene in a local education authority's failure to implement the statutory guidance contained within the access to education for children and young people with medical needs document of November 2001; how many times in each of the last two years he has had to intervene; and what plans he has to update these guidelines.  [151854]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w13.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 In November 2001, the Department for Education and Skills, jointly with the Department of Health, published statutory guidance, "Access to 



<P>
<P><I>9 Feb 2004 : Column 1186W</I><P>
Education for Children and Young People with Medical Needs", which sets out national minimum standards of education for those children and young people who cannot attend school due to illness. This is statutory guidance and local education authorities (LEAs) must have regard to it. The needs of this group of children and young people are often complex. There is therefore an expectation that LEAs should be sensible in their implementation of the guidance.
<P>

<a name="40209w13.html_para0">The DfES has been working to ensure that LEAs and schools are aware of their responsibilities under the guidance. The DfES has sponsored research on mapping best practice, including self evaluation tools for those working in the field. Also, Ofsted published last year a survey report on education provision for children with medical needs. A series of seminars is planned this year to disseminate the findings and recommendations of the Ofsted report and to further raise awareness of the statutory guidance.
<P>

<a name="40209w13.html_para1">The guidance flows from section 19 of the Education Act 1996, which places a duty on LEAs to provide "suitable education" for children of compulsory school age who cannot attend school because they are ill or excluded. The Secretary of State has not issued any directions to LEAs in the last two years for failing to provide suitable education for children who cannot attend school due to illness.
<P>

<a name="40209w13.html_para2">Feedback on the guidance from those working with children and young people with medical needs is that it has had a positive impact. There are therefore no current plans to update the guidance.

 I am not aware of any Connexions Partnerships imposing sanctions on people who refer to themselves as Careers advisers. We have asked Connexions partnerships to avoid a confusion of titles by referring to all practitioners, whatever their specialism, as Personal Advisers. We recognise the important role in the service played by professionals with a careers guidance qualification, but Personal Advisers offer a broader service to young people which cannot be adequately described through reference to a single specialist area.

 The cost of fulfilling the requirements of the Community Care (Delayed Discharges etc.) Act 2003 was estimated at &#163;5.5&nbsp;million in the regulatory impact assessment for the Bill. Most of this cost is around improving the communication between the national health service and social services so that each patient's discharge is planned as effectively as possible. Financial systems for charging will be a small part, and minimal in areas where performance is good.

<a name="40209w17.html_para12">Charges for delayed discharge are based on the patient, not the bed which they are occupying, so numbers will vary depending on the patients in hospital. Currently, charges are potentially payable for a patient who has been receiving acute hospital care and needs community care services from social services in order to be safely discharged. There is only a liability for a charge when that patient is delayed solely because of a lack of social services.

 We do not routinely collect information on stroke services at the level of detail requested in these questions.

The audit was commissioned by the National Health Service in 1998 and was last updated in 2002. The results can be found at http://www. rcplondon.ac.uk/pubs/strokeaudit01-02.pdf. There will be a further update of these figures later this year.
<P>

<a name="40209w20.html_para0">Our major vehicle for improving standards for stroke services is through the older people's national service framework (NSF) which sets specific milestones for improvement by April 2004 of stroke services in primary care trusts, specialist services and general hospitals that care for people suffering from a stroke. Our document, Improvement, Expansion and Reform, which sets for the National Health Service a Priorities and Planning Framework for 2003&#150;6, makes clear that implementation of the older people's NSF is a top priority, and that the 2004 milestone around specialist stroke services is a key target.

<a name="40209w20.html_para1">Implementation of the NSF for older people is leading to real improvements in stroke services and making a difference to people's lives.

 The broadband regional aggregation bodies ("RABs"), together with the national aggregation body ("NAB"), aim to provide better value for public sector customers seeking broadband connectivity and to enhance the availability of broadband (not least in remote and rural areas). The RABs and NAB will join up individual public sector broadband requirements and present them as consolidated requests to the market&#151;delivering better value deals and driving up broadband availability by making it more attractive to telecom companies to make the capital investment necessary to provide broadband in new areas. The Government and public sector is expected to spend at least &#163;1 billion on broadband over the next three years, and the RABs and NAB will help ensure that the most is made of this buying power. The set up costs of each RAB are being funded by a loan and/or grant made by the relevant Regional Development Agency, and thereafter the costs will be covered by an appropriate mark up within the contracts that the RAB negotiates&#151;the aggregation of demand by a RAB providing cost savings which will cover its expenses. Any profits which might accrue to a RAB would be distributed by way of rebate to the customers.

<a name="40209w20.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Broadband regional aggregation bodies ("RABs") will offer highest available value for money to public sector customers in their region and the costs will include a mark-up to cover their costs. Any public sector customer contemplating novating a contract for broadband connectivity to a RAB will need to consider whether to take the RAB's offer or stay with their existing contract if that offers better terms&#151;no customer will be obliged to pay a levy on their existing contracts if they are not transferred to a RAB.

 At the end of 2003 there were over 3.2&nbsp;million subscribers to broadband services in the UK growing at 40 000 per week. The majority of these subscribers were using services with downstream 



<P>
<P><I>9 Feb 2004 : Column 1212W</I><P>
specifications of 500&#150;600 kbps. However, most of the major providers offer broadband services for businesses and consumers at 1 or 2 Mbps and some operators offer services at even high specifications. We expect that there will be an increasing demand for higher speed services over the next few years.
<P>

<a name="40209w20.html_para3">The Government are committed to make use of broadband for the delivery of public services, for example the Department for Education and Skills has set a target for all primary and secondary schools in England to have broadband connections by 2006. As part of its support for businesses adopting information and information technology, the DTI has produced a wealth of material which explains the benefits of using broadband and how it can help business become more effective.

 The number of spin offs from UK universities has increased significantly, rising from 28 in 1995&#150;96 to almost 250 in 2000&#150;01. The latest Higher Education Business Interactions Survey indicates that in the academic year 2000&#150;01 248 companies were spun out from UK universities, employing 10,710 people (an increase of 84&nbsp;per cent. on the previous year) and a turnover of &#163;195&nbsp;million (an increase of 46&nbsp;per cent. on 1999&#150;2000). The Government have supported the increased levels of spin-offs by addressing the funding gap between basic university research and private sector investment, which was identified in our "Investing in Innovation" Strategy. This funding gap has been addressed through the University Challenge fund which provides seed funding for Universities to support spin-offs and has now been assimilated into Higher Education Innovation Fund round 2, which was launched in December 2003, with a deadline for bids of 25&nbsp;February.

 On Monday 2&nbsp;February I hosted a round table discussion with around 50 companies, trade unions and other organisations and academics on the issue of offshoring of UK service activity to other countries. The discussions were held under Chatham House rules, so there were no minutes. There was agreement that the UK cannot compete on labour costs, but must focus on value-added elements where the UK can compete, such as quality of service, proximity to customers, local knowledge and higher skilled work. All agreed that protectionism is not the answer, that location decisions are matters for companies, but that full account needs to be taken of all factors before decisions are made. There was also widespread recognition of the need to make the UK as competitive as possible, both for indigenous firms and to continue to attract inward investment.

 I understand that my hon. Friend is referring to electricity interconnection with France.
<P>

<a name="40209w21.html_para1">According to the January 2004 update to national grid's "Seven Year Statement", the England and Wales plant margin (i.e. the excess of total generating capacity over winter peak demand) in 2003&#150;04 is 21.6&nbsp;per cent. This figure includes the 2GW Anglo-French electricity interconnector out of a total generating capacity of around 68GW.
<P>

<a name="40209w21.html_para2">The 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 plant margins in England and Wales are currently projected to be 22.7&nbsp;per cent. and 22.3&nbsp;per cent. respectively. Under these circumstances, the French interconnector would account for a lower share of the plant margin than at present.
<P>

<a name="40209w21.html_para3">The interconnector therefore makes a significant contribution to total generating capacity in England and Wales at times of winter peak demand.

 Recent evidence shows, particularly in the DTI's International Benchmarking Study 2003, that there has now been an end to the "dash for access".

 The following information is taken from the UK Trade and Investment database, January 2004. The figures are collected on the basis of information provided by companies at the time of the announcement of the decision to invest, and some of these decisions are not notified to UK Trade and Investment until long after a decision is taken. There is no requirement on companies to notify inward investment decisions to UK Trade and Investment and so the figures include only those projects where UK Trade and Investment or its regional partners were involved or which have come to their notice. They are therefore likely to be an under-estimate. As well as jobs created, jobs may also be safeguarded as a result of foreign direct investment. These are not included in the following table.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps are being taken to address the funding gap between public sector support for research and private sector investment in development.  [152052]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w23.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 By 2005&#150;06 the science budget will reach just short of &#163;3 billion, more than double the figure for 1997&#150;8. Moreover, the Chancellor announced in his speech on 26&nbsp;January that we will make a long term plan for science funding over the next decade a central feature of our 2004 spending review. These demonstrate the Government's strong commitment to an excellent science base.
<P>

<a name="40209w23.html_para2">We are pressing forward on a number of fronts to address the funding gap between research and commercial exploitation. Direct support to universities and public sector research establishments (PSREs) is being provided in the form of proof of concept and seed corn funding through programmes such as University Challenge, the second round of the Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEIF) and the Public Sector Research Exploitation fund. In addition the Government is building up the capability of the research community to interact with business and investors. The recent Lambert Review of business /HEI interaction found that this investment is already succeeding.
<P>

<a name="40209w23.html_para3">R&D tax credits provide an incentive for companies to undertake R&D, both when work is subcontracted to higher education institutions or public sector research bodies and when work is done by the company itself.
<P>

<a name="40209w23.html_para4">The Government's Innovation Report (published in December 2003), describes how the DTI will develop a Technology Strategy with business, the SET base, other Government Departments, RDAs, and other stakeholders to identify key technologies with future growth potential. DTI will provide some of the funding and share some of the risks of pulling through technologies in these key areas into the market. In addition, the Research Councils will make plans for increasing the rate of knowledge transfer and interaction with business.

 Last week I jointly launched the National Employer Skills Survey 2003 which was the largest survey of its kind ever commissioned. A total of 72,100 interviews were conducted with employees from 27 industries. This survey provides robust and detailed statistical information about the extent, causes and implications of England's recruitment problems and skill shortages.
<P>

<a name="40209w23.html_para7">NESS suggested that at any one time there are 250,000 job vacancies that are hard to fill and of these 135,000 cannot be filled because of skill shortages. The skilled trades are hardest hit by skill shortages and represent 18&nbsp;per cent. of the hard to fill vacancies due to skill shortages.

<a name="40209w23.html_para8">Skills gaps among those in the workforce are more acute with employers stating that almost 2&#189; million employees (11&nbsp;per cent. of the total English workforce) are lacking skills needed to do their job effectively.

 The Regional Co-ordination Unit (RCU) led a review of area-based initiatives (ABIs) in 2001 which included the commitment to significantly reduce the number of separate funding streams without reducing the total amount of funding.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w24.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The 2001 White Paper, "Strong Local Leadership, Quality Public Services", noted the concern that council tax bands were not fine grained enough to reflect difference in value at the top and the bottom of the property market and acknowledged that residents of mobile homes and other very low value property have added to calls to split band A. The Local Government Act 2003 provides for a council tax revaluation in England in 2007 based on 1&nbsp;April 2005 values. The White Paper made clear that ahead of revaluation the Government will listen to the views of local government and taxpayers about council tax bands. The Balance of Funding Review has also been considering evidence on possible changes to existing bands. Decisions on any changes to the banding structure will be taken nearer to the time of the revaluation.

 The Government does not have any plans to amend the radio frequency public exposure guidelines. Our advice is based on the Stewart Report on health effects of mobile phones and base stations, which recommended a precautionary approach to the development of mobile phone technology. The Government accepted the precautionary approach and has therefore introduced measures to ensure that people's exposures from base stations meet the guidelines of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). These guidelines are five times tougher than they had been for the public.
<P>

<a name="40209w25.html_para4">On 14&nbsp;January the National Radiological Protection Board's independent Advisory Group on Non-Ionising Radiation published a report entitled "Health Effects from Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields". The Advisory Group reviewed the evidence for health effects from radiofrequency transmissions, especially that published since the Stewart Report on Mobile Phones and Health in 2000. Their report confirmed that "Exposure levels from living near to mobile phone base stations are extremely low, and the overall evidence indicates that they are unlikely to pose a risk to health." However, the Advisory Group also concluded that continued research is needed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w25.html_spnew10"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 Local planning authorities already have powers to determine the suitability of sites for mobile phone base stations. Current planning guidance on telecommunications is set out in the revised Planning Policy Guidance Note 8: Telecommunications.
<P>

<a name="40209w25.html_para6">The installation of any telecommunications mast in designated area such as National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, conservation areas and Sites of Special Scientific Interest, and of a mast of more than 15 metres in height elsewhere, is subject to a full planning application. Certain types of development, such as the installation of ground-based masts of up to 15 metres in height, are subject to a prior approval procedure. Prior approval procedures allow the local planning authority the opportunity to say whether it wishes to approve details of the siting and appearance of the installation. If the authority considers that the development will pose a serious threat to amenity, it is able to refuse approval.
<P>

<a name="40209w25.html_para7">The Government also strongly encourages telecommunications operators and local planning authorities to carry out annual discussions about rollout plans for each authority's area. Pre-application discussions on a specific development proposal should be set in the context of the operator's strategy for telecommunications development in the area.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has no plans to require planning permission for the reinstatement of windows. There is a right to install or replace windows in dwellinghouses without needing to apply for planning permission; this has relieved local councils of a potentially large administrative burden. However, where development requires specific planning permission, Planning Policy Guidance Note 1 says that it might be material to consider the question of 'overlooking' or loss of privacy experienced by a particular resident.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assessment he has made of the transport infrastructure projects which are required in order to facilitate the provision of 120,000 additional homes in the Thames Gateway in such a way as is consistent with the concept of sustainable communities; and which of those projects has received the Government's commitment that the necessary public funding will be made available.  [153492]<P>

<P>
<a name="40209w26.html_spnew6"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister announced on 30&nbsp;July 2003 that the Government would commit support that would enable the development of at least 120,000 homes in the Thames Gateway by 2016. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will be supporting development across the Gateway, with particular focus on five strategic locations; East London Gateway, Greenwich Peninsula to Woolwich, Barking Reach, Thurrock and Ebbsfleet/North Kent Thameside.
<P>

<a name="40209w26.html_para2">In his statement, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister identified the transport infrastructure projects that are critical to supporting growth. These include domestic services on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, extensions to the Docklands Light Rail (DLR) network and bus transit systems for East and South East London and Kent Thameside.

<a name="40209w26.html_para3">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport has approved a consultation exercise by the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) on a proposed Integrated Kent Franchise that incorporates CTRL Domestic Services.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what proportion of the 120,000 new homes envisaged for the Thames Gateway he estimates will not be deliverable without a major enhancement of flood defences; to what extent further development in the Thames Gateway may be prevented without major enhancement of flood defences; and when the Government expects to <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;agree and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;begin to implement a programme of major enhancement of flood defences in the Thames Gateway.  [153511]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w26.html_spnew7"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 Growth in the Thames Gateway will be largely concentrated on previously developed land in existing urban areas. Concentration of the development on priority areas substantially reduces the requirement for extra flood defences since most of the Thames

Estuary is already protected to a greater than 1:1000 year level (possibility of 0.1&nbsp;per cent. of flooding in any one year) until 2030. This includes a generous allowance for future sea level rise until 2030 and is a far higher standard of protection than in most other parts of the UK.
<P>

<a name="40209w26.html_para4">There are some parts of the Gateway that do not benefit from defences to this standard, notably the Medway Estuary. However, where development is proposed in such areas, we will ensure that appropriate defence measures are put in place to provide flood risk protection standards as required by Planning Policy Guidance Note 25 on 'Development and Flood Risk'. We shall also seek to ensure that the appropriate design and siting of development is considered through an assessment of flood risk that is required for all Office of the Deputy Prime Minister funded development in the Gateway.
<P>

<a name="40209w26.html_para5">The Environment Agency is currently conducting a major study, entitled 'Thames Estuary 2100', of flood risk management for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. It is expected that this will take approximately six years to report, and that proposals for the renewal and possible enhancement of flood defences in the Thames Gateway will be implemented between 2015 and 2035. Much of this improvement would have been required even if no extra housing had been envisaged.

 The CAA receives over 9,000 mandatory occurrence reports each year and is not aware of any under reporting of oil fume exposures by aircrew.
<P>

<a name="40209w27.html_para0">The current statutory framework ensures that the Civil Aviation Authority receives the data it requires on incidents that can affect flight safety. The Air Navigation (General) Regulations 1993 prescribe the mandatory reporting to the Authority of any hazardous, or potentially hazardous, defects encountered during aircraft operations or maintenance. Specifically Article 17<i>(c)</i>&nbsp;requires the reporting of any occurrence involving the impairment during a flight of the capacity of a member of the flight crew to undertake properly his or her functions. In addition, the Civil Air Publication CAP 382 "Mandatory Occurrence Scheme" gives detailed information and guidance that backs up the Air Navigation (General) Regulations 1993. Appendix B of CAP 382 includes a requirement to report each occurrence of smoke or noxious fumes in the aircraft that resulted in the use of emergency equipment or procedures.

<P>
<a name="40209w27.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology's report on Air Travel and Health, November 2000, looked into the health aspects of air travel including cabin air quality. Several studies on cabin air have been carried out but have revealed no evidence that fumes would be a hazard to the long-term health of passengers. The Civil Aviation Authority is not aware of any adverse long-term health effects in flight crew that can be traced back to the cabin environment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w27.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Civil Aviation Authority has recently investigated cabin air contaminants after a small number of events where flight crew reported the presence of fumes in the cockpit. Other, more broadly-based, international research into aircraft cabin air quality has not shown the presence of organophosphates or any other dangerous engine oil-related substances leaking into the cabin air system on a regular, repeated or continuous basis.

The remaining 7.3&nbsp;million pensioners in England are entitled to at least the statutory half-fare minimum requirement on bus services, though local authorities can offer more generous schemes and many provide concessions between half fares and free travel, such as flat fares. Some authorities offer the choice of free travel with a charge for the annual concessionary travel pass as an alternative to the statutory minimum half fare with a free annual pass. Some local authorities offer free travel to older age groups, for example, those aged 75 and over. Some local authorities also extend their concessionary fare schemes to cover other forms of public transport&#151;including the free schemes in the London boroughs, Merseyside, West Midlands and Crawley.
<P>

<a name="40209w27.html_para2">From 1&nbsp;April 2003, concessionary fares became available to men aged 60 to 64, bringing them into line with women of the same age. This includes 230,000 men who live in the six free travel areas, though West Midlands PTA is now providing half fares to men and women who reach their 60th birthday on or after 1&nbsp;April 2003, who will not receive free fares until they are 65. A further 940,000 men live in other areas where at least half fares or better, are available.

<a name="40209w27.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 We do not intend to change the current arrangements for providing local authority concessionary travel for pensioners. The statutory requirement for concessionary fares ensures an equitable minimum level of half-fares on local buses, with a free pass for all pensioners in England. This minimum requirement was introduced in 2001 and has benefited many people where previously there was no scheme at all, or a scheme that offered less than half-fares. Above the minimum requirement, it remains for local authorities to make more generous provision, at their discretion and in the light of their own financial priorities and local circumstances.

 <i>[pursuant to his reply, 29&nbsp;January 2004, Official Report, c. 468W]:</i> We have made no estimate of the total cost of providing free off-peak travel for pensioners on all forms of public transport. However, we estimate that the additional cost of providing free travel on all local bus services for pensioners would be more than &#163;300&nbsp;million per year. This does not include the costs of free travel on other forms of public transport. Local authorities in England currently spend around &#163;500&nbsp;million per year on concessionary travel for all men and women aged 60 and over, disabled people and in some areas, children, on all forms of public transport including, as well as buses, London Underground, other metro and tram systems, some national rail services and ferries.

 The information is not available in the form requested because maintenance regimes are complex and specific to individual types of rolling stock.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w28.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 The railway is and will continue to be a public-private sector partnership. The Government attaches considerable importance to investor confidence and the need to preserve and protect the rights of private sector investors and lenders and their ability to plan and finance their businesses.
<P>

<a name="40209w28.html_para0">The review which I announced on 19&nbsp;January 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 1075&#150;78, will not change the Government's acceptance of the Regulator's determination of Network Rail's income for the next five years as set out in his December 2003 Final Conclusions and any further conclusions he may reach; and the Government will ensure that the Strategic Rail Authority has sufficient funds to meet its resulting commitments. As I made clear in my statement of 15&nbsp;December 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 122&#150;24WS, regulatory promises will be honoured, and the Government recognises, and is content, that only the Regulator can re-open his determinations.
<P>

<a name="40209w28.html_para1">The independence of economic regulation has already been clearly set out in my statement of 19&nbsp;January. The Government also rules out any change to the rights of third parties, which will be protected. There is no question of weakening the effectiveness of economic regulation. The Government recognises that maintaining fully effective and independent economic 



<P>
<P><I>9 Feb 2004 : Column 1238W</I><P>
regulation is critical for retaining investor confidence. There will be no diminution in the regulatory protection of the private sector investors in the railway.
<P>

<a name="40209w28.html_para2">The review announced on 19&nbsp;January will consider how Government can control the total public expenditure on the railways, while respecting the principles set out above. It will also need to consider whether options for changes to the industry structure might imply consequential changes to the details of economic regulation.
<P>

<a name="40209w28.html_para3">Railways are essential to the economy of Britain. Whatever the institutional structure, the Government will need to be at least as closely involved as it currently is in expenditure decisions and in making financial commitments to the industry and those who finance it; so that lenders to the industry enjoy at least the same strength of financial support from Government as they do today.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w28.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In a research study on the incidence of drugs and alcohol in a sample of 1,184 road accident fatalities between 1996 and 1999, TRL Report 495, it was found that 13&nbsp;per cent. of car drivers had traces of cannabis in the body. However, presence of a drug in the body cannot alone be directly related to any contributory role in accidents. In the case of cannabis the research also noted that it may remain traceable in the blood stream for up to four weeks after it is taken by regular users, whereas its effect on driving is probably limited to a few hours at most.
<P>

<a name="40209w28.html_para4">Routine accident statistics do not record drugs as a contributory factor. But under a pilot scheme on contributory factors begun in 1999 it was assessed that drugs of any kind were a factor in about one per cent. of injury accidents.

 The Department for Transport plans to publish, for consultation, a local transport note giving guidance on traffic calming (including road humps) in autumn 2004.

<P>
<a name="40209w28.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In the mid 1990s, investigations were carried out into the grounding of vehicles on road humps. These revealed that installing road humps 75 mm in height (compared to 100 mm) substantially reduced the risk of vehicles grounding with little or no

erosion in the speed reductions achieved. Following anecdotal claims of damage, the Department commissioned, in 2001, TRL to look at the impact of repeated crossing of road humps on vehicles and their occupants. The results of this work will be published later this year.
<P>

<a name="40209w28.html_para7">Section 90E of the Highways Act 1980 expressly provides that, where road humps or traffic calming measures have been constructed in accordance with the statutory requirements, they are to be treated as part of the highway and not as an obstruction. The road humps should either comply with minimum standards set out in the Highway (Road Humps) Regulations 1999 or otherwise be authorised by the Secretary of State (there is an additional special procedure for authorising road humps in London). If a road hump is not so constructed, it may constitute an obstruction or nuisance in which case an individual may be able to obtain compensation for damages that are attributable to the presence of the hump in the road. A court would determine such liability, if it exists, in accordance with common law principles.

 My Department consulted publicly last September on a package of measures designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the TWA process and we are currently considering the comments received with a view to implementing improvements during the course of the year. A key feature of our proposed changes is that they are designed to secure better and fuller information at an earlier stage. This will, in turn, help to ensure that we can reach decisions more quickly upon receipt of an inspector's report. We also intend to consult in the next few months on changes to the model clauses for TWA Orders, which will help to ensure that applications are in better shape when they come in.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment has been made of the effect of the availability of transport on the well-being of elderly people.  [153997]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w30.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Department has a wide-ranging research programme looking into the transport needs of older and disabled people as well as other vulnerable groups in society. We recognise that a lack of mobility can prevent older people from participating in social activities and lead to low morale, depression and loneliness. It can also impact upon others, such as carers, social services and health agencies. A recent&#151;January 2001&#151;study indicated that the requirements of older people are similar to those of other members of society and major concerns include accessibility of vehicles, safety, reliability and cost.
<P>

<a name="40209w30.html_para1">We are making significant headway in all these areas, in particular in the provision of accessible public transport vehicles&#151;for example, over a third of buses used on scheduled services are now fully accessible&#151;and have introduced a provision under the Transport Act 2000 that guarantees pensioners and disabled people an entitlement to at least half-fares or better on local bus services, with the travel pass being free of charge.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w30.html_wqn4"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment he has made of the extent to which vehicle excise duty reflects the environmental impact of different models of vehicle.  [152069]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w30.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The graduated Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) regime, which was introduced in March 2001, is designed to encourage motorists to choose less polluting vehicles by giving clear signals to them about the environmental impacts of their car purchasing decisions. Its primary aim is to incentivise the purchase of the most fuel-efficient cars, as a way of helping to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide from the transport sector. It is also designed to reflect the different emissions of local air pollutants from diesel, petrol and alternatively fuelled cars. As with all taxes, the Government keeps VED under review, and since the introduction of the scheme we have introduced a number of modifications to give greater incentives to those who purchase the most fuel-efficient vehicles. As the Chancellor announced in his Pre-Budget Report in December 2003, the Government is currently considering how the effectiveness of the scheme might be further improved.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what recent representations he has received on the level at which vehicle excise duty is charged.  [152070]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w30.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 During the last 12 months my department dealt with 265 pieces of correspondence concerning VED from Members of Parliament the public and organisations.
<P>

<a name="40209w30.html_para2">Most of the correspondence dealt with two matters:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) enforcement of VED, and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) whether existing exemptions from payment of VED might be extended to particular groups of motorists or classes of vehicle.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="40209w30.html_para3">Very little of this correspondence deals with the level of VED charged. Where it does however, it tends to be by way of suggestions that certain, generally larger vehicles, should be taxed more heavily.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w30.html_wqn6"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on vehicle excise duty.  [152071]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w30.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Vehicle Excise Duty is a tax on mechanically propelled vehicles. It raises about &#163;4.5 billion annually and has two purposes in addition to the raising of revenue:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) Through the licensing process it ensures checking of insurance and MOT documents, and;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) It provides an opportunity to influence vehicle purchase e.g. on environmental and road friendliness grounds.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="40209w30.html_para4">Cars registered since 1&nbsp;March 2001 are taxed mostly according to their CO2 emissions, with VED set for the lowest emitting petrol cars at &#163;55, ranging up to &#163;165 for the highest emitting diesel cars. UK lorry rates are related to vehicle weight and configuration and are some of the lowest in Europe.




<P>
<P><I>9 Feb 2004 : Column 1247W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40209w30.html_para5">There are a number of concessionary VED rates and exemptions which are sometimes subject to discussion with the various interest groups. While there will always be room for debate at the margins, the Government believes the balance is broadly right between those paying VED at the normal rate for the vehicle, those paying at concessionary rates and those who are exempt from VED.
<P>

<a name="40209w30.html_para6">We have considerably tightened the enforcement of VED through the "continuous registration" package of measures. By introducing continuous registration and using modern technology, we are improving the accuracy of the register to the benefit of law enforcement and the honest motorist. To deal with short term evasion we have introduced fines for those over a month overdue with relicensing, while tackling those vehicles already outside the system of registration and licensing with enhanced enforcement using wheel clamping and ANPR cameras.

<P>
<a name="40209w30.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer takes decisions on transport taxation, including vehicle excise duty, on a Budget-by-Budget basis, taking a range of economic, social and environmental factors into consideration. The Government acknowledge the role historic vehicle enthusiasts play in maintaining that part of the country's history and heritage, but need also to recognise the poorer environmental performance of older vehicles. The current exemption for vehicles constructed before 1&nbsp;January 1973 is designed to strike the right balance between environmental and heritage needs.

Areas have devised their own premium service protocols which include elements of proactive policing, improved investigations and case management, priority court listings, and strategies for rehabilitation. As well as targeting core persistent offenders, who are 18 or over and have been convicted of 6 or more recordable offences in the last year, as part of their wider crime reduction strategies areas are also using the scheme flexibly to target persistent offenders defined on the basis of local intelligence.

 The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme (CICS) provides compensation at the taxpayers' expense to blameless victims of crimes of violence and those injured in trying to apprehend criminals or prevent crime. It does not compensate victims of other types of crime.
<P>

<a name="40209w31.html_para8">Claims are determined on the basis of applications and supporting information submitted by applicants, and upon the outcome of such other inquiries about the applicant's injuries and other aspects of eligibility as the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) considers it necessary to make.

 The evidence shows that Drug Treatment and Testing Orders (DTTOs) do work and that the longer offenders remain in treatment, the more likely they are to reduce their levels of offending and drug misuse (National Treatment Outcome Research Study 2001). An evaluation of the 3 DTTO pilots found that, on average, offenders committed 75&nbsp;per cent. fewer offences while on the order and reduced their spend on drugs by over 90&nbsp;per cent.

<P>

<a name="40209w32.html_para12">Data are also collected centrally on the disposal, (ie. paid, fine registration certificate issued etc.) of fixed penalty notices issued for road traffic offences. However because of the time taken for the procedures for payment to be enforced the data are collected approximately nine months later than the period of issue. Tables 21(a)&nbsp;and 21(b)&nbsp;of the above 2001 publication details 2000 data by number and percentage of fixed penalty notices by result. Tables 20(a)&nbsp;to 20(c)&nbsp;of the 2000 publication cover that period. Information is not available on the number of fines paid in full and on time.
<P>

<a name="40209w32.html_para13">Over 6,000 penalty notices for disorder were issued in the year-long pilots in four police force areas which started in mid-2002. A Home Office Research Findings covering the evaluation of the pilots will be published shortly.

 Local recruitment campaigns for Prison Officers at Highdown and surrounding prisons have been held.

In the Kent, Surrey and Sussex area a further 18 potential recruits are undergoing final checks into their suitability for posts in the Prison Service, some of whom are expected to be posted to Highdown. A further recruitment exercise is scheduled to begin in March.

 The Home Office is aware of two pieces of research conducted by the Florida Department of Corrections, Bureau of Research and Data Analysis: A Report on Community Control, Radio Frequency (RF) Monitoring and Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) Monitoring (October 2002) and A Controlled Study of the Effects of Electronic Monitoring and Officer Caseload on Outcomes for Offenders on Community Control (March 2003). Officials have also visited programmes in Florida and Texas that use satellite global positioning systems to monitor offenders. The Home Office is testing tracking equipment using satellite global positioning systems and plans to pilot the use of this technology to track offenders later this year. No decisions have been taken about the categories of offenders who will be subject to tracking in the pilots.

<a name="40209w33.html_spnew2"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 An identity card, although very helpful to public services as a reliable means of proving identity, would not become mandatory until a specific further Parliamentary decision on a move to compulsion.

<P>
<a name="40209w33.html_spnew5"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 In Northern Ireland voters are already required to produce proof of their identity before they vote. The Electoral Fraud (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 introduced electoral identity cards in Northern Ireland as one of the four ways in which individuals can prove who they are when going to vote at an election in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="40209w33.html_para3">There are no plans to extend this by requiring electors throughout the United Kingdom to show a valid identity card in order to cast a vote. However, discussions are continuing between the Home Office and other Departments on how production of an identity card might be linked to services for which they are responsible in the future.

There will be 10 regional offender managers responsible for this in the nine English regions and Wales.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many seizures of alcohol were made in London prisons in the last 12 months.  [151424]<P>

 The information requested cannot be obtained except at disproportionate cost.

<a name="40209w35.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Oaten: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to upgrade existing prison cells over the next five years.  [151690]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w35.html_spnew4"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The Prison Service is currently working to a three year programme of ongoing refurbishment of prison places. At any one time approximately 2,000 places are out of use on account of building refurbishment works. There are also programmes to provide privacy screens in cells that may be used for double occupancy.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w35.html_wqn5"><B> Mrs. Gillan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list fires started by prisoners in 2003; at which prisons the incidents took place; and what the cost was in each case.  [151152]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w35.html_spnew5"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 In 2003 there were 980 fires in prisons. The possible cause of 674 (69&nbsp;per cent.) of these was recorded as malicious ignition.
<P>

<a name="40209w35.html_para4">While many of the fires started by prisoners are dealt with quickly, resulting in little damage, occasionally larger fires do occur and a very small number of these result in serious damage to cells.
<P>

<a name="40209w35.html_para5">The following table shows all establishments and indicates for each, the number of fires that occurred in 2003 for which malicious ignition was recorded as the 'possible cause'.
<P>

<a name="40209w35.html_para6">Figures for the cost in each case is not available.

 The current maximum retirement age for serving prison officers is 60 years. A small number of prison officers are retained beyond 60 for exceptional operational reasons.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many prison officers failed their annual control and restraint test in the past 12 months; and what their ages were.  [152711]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w35.html_spnew7"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 There is no annual control and restraint test in the Prison Service. Prison establishments are required to maintain an appropriate level of officers trained at basic level control and restraint, and those officers selected to fulfil this requirement all undertake initial and refresher training courses. However, these courses do not include a test.
<P>

<a name="40209w35.html_para9">Officers who deal with incidents of concerted indiscipline attend an advanced control and restraint training course. Again, officers are not formally tested at the end of this training. However, to gain admission to the course, an officer must be identified by his or her line manager as having an aptitude for the role; and is required to undertake a fitness test. From 1&nbsp;January to 31&nbsp;December 2003, a total of 4,353 officers undertook this fitness test, including officers from private prisons. The overall pass rate was 98.6 per cent, with 62 officers, aged between 18 and 65, failing. Their age distribution was as follows:

 Information regarding assaults on probation officers is not collected centrally, for the previous or the new probation areas, and cannot be obtained except at disproportionate cost. Information on the numbers of assaults on prison officers reported to Prison Service headquarters by prisons is given in the table below, which distinguishes between serious and minor assaults. Serious assaults are shown in column A for each prison and each year with minor assaults being shown in column B. Serious assaults are those that result in detention in outside hospital as an inpatient, medical treatment for concussion or internal injury, fractures, scalds and burns, stabbing, crushing, extensive or multiple bruising, black eye, broken nose, lost or broken tooth, cuts requiring suturing, bites, temporary or permanent blindness or sexual assault. Minor assaults may involve no injury.

 Funding has been provided for around 3,000 additional public sector prison places to be built at existing prisons by 2006. Two new private sector prisons providing 1,290 places are also due to be opened at Ashford (near Heathrow) and Peterborough in June 2004 and March 2005 respectively. This will increase the total useable capacity of the prison estate to around 78,700 by 2006.

<a name="40209w35.html_para13">On the 6&nbsp;January a radical reform of the management of offenders was announced with the publication of the document 'Reducing Crime-Changing Lives'. The overriding purpose of the reforms is to improve the management of offenders and reduce re-offending. Offenders for whom prison is the right penalty will continue to be sent to prison. But there are many offenders for whom tough non-custodial penalties will

 The structural changes introduced under the Criminal Justice Act 2000 and implemented from April 2001 were managed as a change programme overseen by National Director (latterly the Director General) of the National Probation Service (NPS) based within the Home Office.
<P>

<a name="40209w36.html_para0">The strategy for the change programme was set out in a three-year strategic document, "A New Choreography". The Office of Government Commerce independently reviewed the initial programme in October 2001. They commended the restructure and noted early performance improvements. Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Probation has covered issues relevant to restructuring, such as governance, training and race equality, in recent reports.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on funding available for the provision of intensive services to offenders on release by the Probation Service.  [151192]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w36.html_spnew3"><B> Paul Goggins </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29&nbsp;January 2004]:</i> The National Probation Service (NPS) is funding or part funding 15 intensive supervision and monitoring schemes (ISMs) which aim to reduce reoffending by persistent offenders. ISMs operate as part of a community sentence or a post custodial licence. Funding was provided for two years by the NPS and the Criminal Justice System Reserve (CJS) which will expire in April 2004. After that areas are expected to have made their own arrangements to fund the projects locally. It is also expected that some continuation funding will be available from the CJS Reserve for an additional year.
<P>

<a name="40209w36.html_para3">Persistent offenders are defined as those who are aged 18 or over and have been convicted of six or more recordable offences in the last year. ISM schemes target the most prolific offenders in a locality. These are the most serious of persistent offenders. Therefore, in addition to six convictions in the last year, those selected will also usually be the target of local police intelligence.
<P>

<a name="40209w36.html_para4">ISM schemes provide intensive surveillance and supervision of offenders, offering fast access to services and support for rehabilitation, alongside swift action and penalties for non-compliance. They incorporate a partnership between police and probation, two agencies that have historically worked in different areas of criminal justice, through the joint aims of apprehending offenders at the same time as addressing offenders' needs. As part of these projects, the police and probation services also work together with other partner agencies such as: providers of housing, education and training, alcohol and drug abuse treatment groups, leisure facilities and employment services.
<P>

<a name="40209w36.html_para5">The ISMs are subject to independent evaluation, which is due to report in spring 2004. A number of areas operate similar schemes to the probation funded ISMs. Plans to deal with persistent offenders will be included as part of the regional resettlement strategies which are to be developed over the next 12 months.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w37.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department which rehabilitation programmes have been the most effective in reducing the reconviction rate; and what plans he has to extend these programmes to all prisons.  [148907]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w37.html_spnew0"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 Prisoners are imprisoned for many different kinds of offences, ranging widely in character and seriousness. No one programme is likely to be effective in reducing re-offending on the part of all offenders. The Correctional Services Accreditation Panel accredits programmes which are based on the international evidence about what is likely to be effective in reducing re-offending. Cognitive skills programmes, sex offender treatment programmes, drug treatment programmes and therapeutic communities have all been accredited, as well as programmes designed to address violent offending and domestic violence specifically. These interventions are subject to ongoing evaluation, including research into their impact on reconviction rates.
<P>

<a name="40209w37.html_para0">Over 100 prison establishments currently run accredited programmes and although the overall number is increasing there are no plans at present to extend them to every prison, as they are not suitable for all prisoners, particularly those serving short sentences. All prison establishments, however, are required to provide constructive regimes which address offending behaviour, improve educational and work skills and promote law abiding behaviour in custody and after release. Other activities which support rehabilitation and address prisoners' resettlement needs include learning and skills, prison work, involvement in pre-release programmes, housing advice and support services, Jobcentre Plus prison surgeries and job search training and support.
<P>

<a name="40209w37.html_para1">The establishment of a new single National Offender Management Service will focus on reducing re-offending and equipping offenders to turn away from crime. Regional offender managers will, in the future, be responsible for commissioning offender management services and interventions to reduce re-offending.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many risk of sexual harm orders have been issued.  [150331]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w37.html_spnew1"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The Sexual Offences Act 2003, which provided for the risk of sexual harm orders, is not due to come into force until May 2004. As a result no risk of sexual harm orders have yet been made.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on changes in sentence lengths since 1991.  [150350]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w37.html_spnew2"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 Information on trends in sentencing is contained in chapter 4 of Criminal statistics, England and Wales, 2002 (Cm 6054) published in December 2003.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w37.html_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps are taken to ensure consistency of sentencing practice.  [150354]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w37.html_spnew3"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The recent Criminal Justice Act 2003 created the Sentencing Guidelines Council. The purpose of the council is to produce robust and comprehensive sentencing guidelines. By providing an important bridge between what legislation provides and how that legislation is used, the guidelines will assist the courts in their task of effecting consistent and just disposals in all cases.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w37.html_wqn4"><B> Mrs. Brooke: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he will ask the Sentencing Guidelines Council to consider reducing overall sentencing lengths for offences not involving violence, drugs or sexual matters.  [152752]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w37.html_spnew4"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 It is the role of the Sentencing Guidelines Council to issue guidance on all aspects of sentencing so as to promote consistent and just sentencing by the courts within the framework provided by Parliament. The guidance will be issued following an evaluation period and will be proportionate in severity to the nature of the offence.
<P>

<a name="40209w37.html_para2">It will be for the Council to make its proposals, and there will be opportunities for criminal justice professionals, the public and Parliament to make their views known to the Council. While no type of criminal behaviour can be condoned or minimised, the Home Secretary has made clear that custody should be reserved for serious offenders.

<P>
<a name="40209w37.html_wqn6"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) when the updated guidelines on anonymity for those accused of historical sex abuse were sent to police forces;  [148881]
<P>
<UL>(2) what the terms of guidelines on anonymity for those accused of historical sex abuse <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;were before and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;are since recent amendments were put into effect.  [148882]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w37.html_spnew6"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) has amended its guidelines to all police forces to give greater prominence to the rules that govern the release of information about anyone suspected of, but not yet charged with, an offence. The 



<P>
<P><I>9 Feb 2004 : Column 1291W</I><P>
guidance underlines that suspects should not be named before charge and goes on to highlight the possible dangers of doing so, in that not only is there the risk of causing irreparable damage to a suspect's reputation, but also that unwarranted disclosure could leave a force open to civil proceedings. Updated guidance was sent to all police forces via the ACPO intranet in October 2003 and may be viewed on www.acpo.police.uk. We have asked that a copy of previous guidance be sent to my hon. Friend.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w37.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on his plans for increases in fines for drivers caught speeding; and how the extra money raised will help victims of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;crime and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;road traffic accidents.  [149095]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w37.html_spnew7"><B> Paul Goggins </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21&nbsp;January 2004]:</i> I would refer my hon. Friend to the Written Ministerial Statement made by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary on 12&nbsp;January 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> column 18WS. This announced the publication of a consultation paper entitled 'Compensation and Support for Victims of Crime', which set out proposals to provide a wide range of support for victims of crime and to amend the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme.
<P>

<a name="40209w37.html_para3">A central plank of the proposals was to make all offenders pay for their crimes and to help all victims.
<P>

<a name="40209w37.html_para4">One of the key proposals was to add a surcharge to all criminal convictions, and to fixed penalty notices for criminal offences. The surcharge would be additional to the fine or any other penalty imposed, and would be payable by those who were convicted of a criminal offence, those who receive a penalty notice for disorder, and those who receive a fixed penalty notice for a road traffic offence, including drivers breaking the law by speeding.
<P>

<a name="40209w37.html_para5">The money raised through the surcharge would go into a new Victims' Fund, as would monies raised in the other ways described in the consultation paper. The money from that fund would be spent directly on services for victims of crime including, for example, victims of rape and sexual assault, victims of domestic

violence and hate crime, and the many seriously injured victims of road traffic incidents and the bereaved relatives of victims.
<P>

<a name="40209w37.html_para6">We welcome comment on all the ideas and proposals set out in the consultation paper. Subject to the outcome of this consultation exercise, we propose to legislate to make the changes, where necessary, through amendments to the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Bill currently before Parliament.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w37.html_wqn8"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his answer of 14&nbsp;January 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 762W, on HMYOI Wetherby, what the reasons were for the increase in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;costs per prisoner and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;cost per prisoner place at HMYOI Wetherby.  [151131]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40209w37.html_spnew8"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 Baseline funding for HMYOI Wetherby has risen from &#163;6.7&nbsp;million in 1998&#150;99 to &#163;10.2&nbsp;million in 2002&#150;03. The change from cash to resource based accounting over this period reflects part of this increase, but the major structural and regime changes at HMYOI Wetherby following its re-role to a juvenile only establishment have been the main reason for increased funding. This increase has led to a greatly improved regime generating improved numeracy and literacy among prisoners, better opportunities for training and employment, increased employability through practical and vocational activities and the addressing of offending behaviour issues.
