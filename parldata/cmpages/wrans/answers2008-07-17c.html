 In World-class Apprenticeships we highlighted the need for clear progression routes for apprenticeships to maximise the apprenticeship experience, including higher education. Sector Skills Councils are developing a strategy for Level 4 Apprenticeships, enabling progression to higher education, including Foundation Degrees. They are mapping all apprenticeship frameworks to see where Level 4 apprenticeships may be required. Arrangements are already in place for apprentices who complete an engineering or e-skills apprenticeship to have their learning recognised through UCAS points to progress to higher education. A further eight frameworks are expected to be recognised by 2010.</p>

The Directive provides for the protection of clinical trial subjects, including minors, and sets out requirements for the ethical review of clinical trials. The Directive provides for a general rule that minors may only be included in a clinical trial if the informed consent of the parents or legal representative has been obtained.</p>

Two further Commission Directives setting out the detailed principles and guidelines of good clinical practice have been agreed and implemented into UK law. On 1 May 2008 the Government amended UK legislation, following a public consultation, to allow minors to be entered into a trial prior to consent having been obtained from a person with parental responsibility or legal representative in trials of emergency medicines where and while certain conditions are met.</p>

1. It is known that for some police force areas, the reporting of court proceedings in particular those relating to summary motoring offences may be less than complete.<br>
2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>

1. It is known that for some police force areas, the reporting of court proceedings in particular those relating to summary motoring offences may be less than complete.<br>
2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>

 The Government have not made any estimate of the percentage of voter registration in each constituency and local authority area in England. The Electoral Commission estimated that 3.5 million eligible electors were not registered to vote in their report, Understanding Electoral Registration, which was published in September 2005. However the number of electors registered in England continues to grow and between 2 December 2006 and 1 December 2007 the number of parliamentary electors grew from 37,588,775 to 37,817,466 and the number of local government electors grew from 38,223,259 to 38,599,775.</p>

To support this aim we have taken a number of steps to increase voter registration rates. Section 9 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006 placed a new duty on electoral registration officers to take all necessary steps to maintain the electoral register, including sending the annual canvass form more than once, making house to house inquiries and inspecting records that they are permitted to inspect. It is for the ERO to decide on the best steps to use in conjunction with their local knowledge to ensure that requirements for making contact with persons and maintaining the register are complied with. To support such activities we have made &#163;2.5 million available each financial year under our Participation Fund, which allows EROs to apply for additional funding to assist them in promoting electoral awareness within their areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_427"><a name="80717w0010.htm_para1"><a name="08071789002403">The Act also includes a provision for the Electoral Commission to introduce new performance standards for EROs. The Electoral Commission is currently developing these standards and the final set of standards will be published during July 2008. A copy of these standards will be laid before the House and the information obtained from local authorities as a consequence will give us a better understanding of the actions taken to increase registration.</p>

 Following a review of the partnerships provisions of the Crime and Disorder 1998 Act, the duties to produce three yearly audits and to report annually to the Secretary of State on a partnership's work and progress were repealed in 2007. They were replaced by new statutory requirements in 2007 to introduce minimum standards for partnership working based on six hallmarks of effective partnerships, providing clear statements of the core functions of crime and disorder reduction partnership or community safety partnership in Wales. These include producing a strategic assessment identifying local community safety priorities and a partnership plan which sets out the approach for addressing these priorities. Partnerships have a duty to publish a summary of the partnership plan in a format of their choice but in a way that makes it available to diverse groups in their communities.</p>

Diazepam is also subject to instalment dispensing arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_469"><a name="80717w0018.htm_para0"><a name="08071796001594">In 1998, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs advised the Government that all benzodiazepines should be placed into schedule 3 subject to due consideration of the accompanying prescription and safe custody requirements under the regulations. In response to these concerns, the Government decided that rescheduling of benzodiazepines should be made on a case by case basis, with additional controls on the import, export and possession of all benzodiazepines. These controls were introduced in February 2002.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_470"><a name="80717w0018.htm_para1"><a name="08071796001595">In 2004, the Advisory Council concluded that the controls for the schedule 4, part 1 benzodiazepines were sufficient, endorsing the Government's response to its earlier recommendation.</p>

 Under Operation Pentameter 1 (which concluded in 2006) there was a total of 88 victims recovered who originated from a number of countries primarily in Eastern Europe, the far east and South East Asia, Africa and South America. Under Operation Pentameter 2 (which concluded in 2008) there was a total 167 victims recovered from similar regions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_472"><a name="80717w0019.htm_para0"><a name="08071796002199">Since the inception of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 there have been 84 successful prosecutions of people for human trafficking offences, many of whom also received sentences for related offences. Under Pentameter 2 there were 528 arrests. We therefore expect the number of successful prosecutions to rise in the forthcoming months as such cases progress though the criminal justice system.</p>

 Under Pentameter 2, 31 victims of trafficking have already returned to their country of origin voluntarily. We are aware that a number of non-EEA nationals initially believed by the police to be victims have been returned to their country of origin using immigration powers. Removal of individuals confirmed to be victims of trafficking would only be sanctioned if it was considered safe and reasonable to do so in accordance with the UK's domestic and international obligations.</p>

 Notification orders are issued by courts. This is a separate process from the issuing of visas.

 The Government recognise the need for national data which may be used to monitor whether the condition of roads is improving or deteriorating. But there has been mounting dissatisfaction over a number of years with the quality of CHART visual surveys, which are based on judgments of conditions by engineers, and a programme of work is taking place supported by the Department and the UK Roads Board to develop more sophisticated machine-based surveys.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_499"><a name="80717w0024.htm_para4"><a name="08071796003182">The 2006 statistical report on road conditions stated that CHART data would not be collected in 2007 for classified roads. More extensive and detailed data would instead become available from machine scans of the road surface (SCANNER surveys), the same source used by local authorities for reporting best value performance indicators (BVPIs) on classified road condition. This same source will be used for authorities reporting against their local area agreements. The Department has commissioned research to develop appropriate methods for producing national estimates from these complex data, which should be available in 2009. At that point, it will be possible to produce several years&#146; results at once to allow analysis of trends in the condition of classified roads.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_500"><a name="80717w0024.htm_para5"><a name="08071796003183">Indicators from the BVPI reporting regime were also included in the statistical report &#147;Road Conditions in England 2007&#148;. These can be compared with the BVPI results which were reported in previous statistical reports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_501"><a name="80717w0024.htm_para6"><a name="08071796003184">CHART visual surveys for the unclassified network continued until 2007-08, but, following consultation with the LGA and with the UK Roads Board, have not been requested in 2008-09. Most local authorities rely on their own programme of inspection and asset management to determine the condition and maintenance needs of unclassified roads, and there has been a declining response rate to the request for CHART data to support the national survey, with only two-thirds of local authorities responding in 2007-08.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_502"><a name="80717w0024.htm_para7"><a name="08071796003185">The Road Conditions in England statistical report published in June 2008 provided members of the public and highway officers with the latest information on road conditions. The next statistical report, intended for publication in 2009, will include several years&#146; data on classified roads. For unclassified roads, DFT will continue to work with the UK Roads Board to determine how best to measure and survey road conditions with an intention of national surveys every three to five years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_503"><a name="80717w0024.htm_para8"><a name="08071796003186">Members of the public interested in the condition of their own authority&#146;s roads will have available annual indicators published as part of local area agreements. Many authorities also publish their own local data. We have encouraged authorities to prepare asset management plans for local authority, and have announced that at least &#163;15 million will be available to help them do so in 2009-10.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) does not undertake its own assessment of regions that will be worst affected by land degradation. However, we work closely with organisations, funded by DFID, that have expert capacity in this area (such as the International Institute for Environment and Development). We also draw on recent international assessments; for example, the Food and Agricultural Organisation's Global Assessment of Land Degradation and Improvement (GLADA) that was released on 2 July. Based on quantitative analysis, and use of satellite imagery, this identifies southern Africa, Burma, Malaysia, Indonesia and south China as areas particularly affected by degradation. 1.5 billion people depend on degrading areas for their livelihoods. The 2007 United Nations Environment Programme's Global Environmental Outlook 4 (GEO-4) included an assessment of land degradation and concluded that demands on land resources and risks to sustainability are likely to intensify.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_518"><a name="80717w0025.htm_para4"><a name="08071796003295">Better land management can prevent and reverse degradation leading to improved agricultural production and availability of other resources such as forest products. The recent GLADA provides positive examples of land improvement such as land reclamation in north China. DFID has worked with the World Bank in its projects to better manage land and reduce poverty in the degraded and remote Loess Plateau region of north China. The World Bank funded improved land use and erosion control, boosting incomes for farmers, with DFID assistance focused on improved benefits for the poorest.</p>

The DWP Social Fund Policy, Budget and Management Information System (PBMIS) does not hold data on crisis loan applications by the reason for the application. However, the proportion of applications processed which were for alignment payments can be estimated from scans of crisis loan applications. Each such scan consists of applications processed in the relevant financial year and held on the Social Fund Computer System at the end of that year. (Each scan records the latest decision on each application; this may be an initial decision or a review decision.) These estimated proportions have then been applied to the numbers of applications processed obtained from PBMIS.<br>

1.Figures are based on (initial) awards made in each year, not on awards being repaid in each year.<br>
2. Figures are for initial awards only. Awards made after review are not included.<br>
3. The current standard repayment rates are 12 per cent, 10 per cent and five percent. These rates were introduced for applications received on or after 3rd April 2006. Some awards made in the early part of 2006-07 were for applications received before 3 April 2006, to which the previous standard repayment rates of 15 per cent. 10 per cent. and five per cent. applied.<br>
4. When a standard repayment rate is used, the weekly repayment amount for a budgeting loan is calculated by multiplying the repayment rate by the weekly available income, then rounding to the nearest penny. For each award, the scan does not give the repayment rate, but only the weekly repayment amount and the weekly available income. The repayment rate calculated from these two quantities may differ slightly from the true repayment rate, because of the rounding of the repayment amount. To allow for this, the stated number of awards with a repayment rate of 12 per cent is actually the number with a calculated repayment rate of 12 per cent ± 0.05 per cent. Similarly, for the other standard repayment rates, 10 per cent ± 0.05 per cent and five per cent ± 0.05 per cent have been used.<br>
5. Numbers have been rounded to the nearest 1,000.<br>
6. Proportions have been calculated using non-rounded numbers.<br>

This has been mainly due to the implementation of the Total Paper Recycling Scheme across the estate over the last five years by Land Securities Trillium and their service partners. We also operate an intranet based &#147;Swap Shop&#148; which enables staff across DWP to redistribute surplus goods, which might otherwise have been sent to landfill.

1. All data represent a snapshot in time of claimants on the computer system, and therefore exclude a very small number of cases that are held clerically.<br>
2. Due to the introduction of child tax credits in April 2003, information on child dependents is not reliably completed on the benefit computer system. Children have been merged onto income support/jobseeker's allowance/incapacity benefit/severe disablement allowance/pension credit claims from child benefit records with permission from HMRC.<br>
3. The total number of children aged 0-15 on child benefit in each parliamentary constituency at the relevant year has been used as the denominator for the percentages given.<br>

1. All data represent a snapshot in time of claimants on the computer system, and therefore exclude a very small number of cases that are held clerically.<br>
2. The Department does not have complete information on child dependents on the benefit computer systems, therefore children have been merged onto income support, jobseeker&#146;s allowance, incapacity benefit, severe disablement allowance and pension credit claims from child benefit records with permission from HMRC.<br>
3. The total numbers of children aged 0 to 15 on child benefit in each parliamentary constituency at the relevant year have been used as the denominator for the percentages given.<br>

When the scheme was established in 1978 there was a large backlog of cases that had to be dealt with. This accounts for the large number of awards made in the early years of the scheme. One of the main reasons for the decline, over time, in the number of awards made is that medical knowledge and understanding has significantly advanced since 1978. Additionally, many reliable research papers since then have demonstrated that a clear link between vaccines and adverse reactions, sufficient to accept causation on the balance of probabilities, is not as great as had been previously thought.<br>

 The Government's policy intent is to increase access to and convenience of general practitioner (GP) services. There are a number of ways of measuring the impact that a new GP-led health centre will have on the delivery of services to patients, which will be monitored centrally. Primary care trusts (PCTs) as the responsible commissioners of services will review improvements against their strategic needs assessments and patient satisfaction with the services being delivered to ensure local needs are being met and the public's health and well-being improves.</p>

 The average daily number of available beds in neonatal intensive care wards (also known as level three wards) for national health service acute providers in the South Central Strategic Health Authority (SHA) area can be found in the following table. There have been concerns raised recently about the definitions used for neonatal intensive care cots in the KH03 data return. The concerns have been around the use of the ward type where the cot is located as part of the definition. This has caused confusion amongst some trusts about where to record their neonatal intensive care cots and has caused inconsistency in reporting. These concerns will be investigated with the view of ensuring a robust and clear definition is developed for the 2008-09 collection.</p>

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has not discussed the specific issue of an illicit trade in whale meat from Japan&#146;s scientific whaling programme with the Japanese Government but has taken note of the allegations made by Greenpeace. The Government continue to oppose all forms of whaling apart from some limited subsistence whaling when there is a substantiated need. The UK has also protested against Japan&#146;s whaling operations, which we argue are unjustified, cruel and unnecessary, at every appropriate opportunity. Most recently the UK maintained its strong anti-whaling position at the annual International Whaling Commission meeting which was held in Santiago, Chile, in June 2008.</p>

 The court procedures being applied in the case of the two Greenpeace activists are standard in Japan, where those suspected of committing a crime can be held for up to 23 days without charge. The Government are unable to get involved in the criminal investigations of another country, but are following the issue closely. We remain of the view that the large-scale killing of whales&#151;under the guise of &#145;scientific&#146; research&#151;is both unnecessary and deeply flawed, from a scientific point of view, and we will continue to make representations to the Japanese authorities on this.</p>

 The UK is ready to consider all available options to secure the effective deployment of the UN-African Union Mission in Darfur and full humanitarian access to promote a peaceful resolution to the situation in Darfur. Possible steps could include an assets freeze or travel ban against individuals engaged in violence, authorising it or impeding progress. Our preference for further measures, in common with many of our EU partners, would be for UN sanctions because of their universal coverage and because they could include, for example, extension of the existing UN arms embargo to cover the whole of Sudan. The EU already has an arms embargo on the whole of Sudan.</p>
