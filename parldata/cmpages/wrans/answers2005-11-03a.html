However, in 2004 17 per cent. of new FTSE 100 board appointments have been women, up from 13 per cent. in 2003 and 10.5 per cent. in 2002.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">Thank you for your letter of 29 July to the Prime Minister enclosing a postcard from your constituent about Tearfund&#039;s &quot;HIV/AIDS and Children&quot; campaign. I am responding as the Minister who leads on the issues raised.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">It is a terrible human catastrophe and presents an unprecedented challenge to the developing world and to the eradication of poverty. The cost in terms of human life and economic burden on national governments, communities and families is enormous. Women and young people, including the rising number of orphans are particularly vulnerable.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">The Government is taking action. Last year we published &quot;Taking Action&#151;the UK&#039;s strategy for tackling HIV and AIDS in the developing world&quot;, and committed at least &#163;1.5 billion to tackling HIV and AIDS over the next three years. Of this, at least &#163;150 million will go into supporting orphans and children made vulnerable by HIV and AIDS. The UK was one of the first countries to endorse UNICEF&#039;s &quot;Strategic Framework for the Protection, Care and Support of Orphans and Children Made Vulnerable by HIV/AIDS&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">DFID is working directly with national governments to support the development and implementation of national programmes for the support and care of children affected. In Mozambique we have given funding to help the Government properly track its programmes for orphans and vulnerable children to ensure that aid reaches the children that need it most. In Kenya we are directly supporting community based organisations to help them deliver home based care services, including to children affected by AIDS.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">We are investigating the best ways to build systems that provide support to vulnerable children and their families, possibly in the form of monthly child or family allowances. This will simplify the tracking of funds from government budgets to the poorest families. The cash received through these transfers enables families and communities to make their own decisions about the best way to improve their livelihoods and care for their children. Another important area in which we are investing is the health of children living with HIV. For example we have supported trials of a cheap and widely available drug (co-trimoxazole) which have shown that it can halve the death rate for HIV infected children in Africa. We are also supporting a new research programme to assess how to provide antiretroviral treatment for children in resource-constrained settings</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">Monitoring development expenditure by category, as your campaign highlights, is an area where all of us, the international community, donor organisations and national governments can all do better. DFID has recently introduced a new system to enable us to better monitor our support for orphans and vulnerable children, Activities which will be recorded include special programmes for children made vulnerable by AIDS, cash transfers to vulnerable families, exemption from school fees and help with food.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">DFID also believes that monitoring and evaluation are crucial with regards to other financing instruments such as the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM). DFID has funded work specifically to develop the Global Fund&#039;s capacity for monitoring and evaluation. We believe that progress is being made, but there is more to do.</p>

<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">We are delighted to be co-hosting with UNICEF, later this year, the Global Partnership Forum on children affected by AIDS. We anticipate that this Forum will examine how funding can better reach community based organisations. Bottlenecks that prevent funding getting to those most in need must be identified and unlocked We see this as a crucial part of the wider efforts at &quot;Making the Money Work&quot;&#151;a process being led by UNAIDS to ensure greater harmonisation and co-ordination alongside the additional resources now being made available to tackle HIV and AIDS The steps we are taking are a start, but there is much still for all of us to do.</p>
