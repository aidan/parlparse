               <b>The Solicitor-General:</b>
 The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) vigorously prosecutes defendants who have been charged with human trafficking offences. In addition, the CPS plays an important role in preventing harm from trafficking from reaching the UK, through prosecutors working with source countries to improve the ability of overseas investigators and prosecutors in case building and prosecution to disrupt human trafficking at source. The CPS is also working with source countries to improve international co-operation to assist in the provision of information and evidence to support prosecutions in the UK. The CPS published a new policy statement on the prosecution of cases of Human Trafficking on 2 June 2011 that explains the prosecution process to those who support victims of trafficking.</p>

Offences recorded under the Protection of Harassment Act 1997 are included within their offence classification of ‘Harassment’ and cannot be separately identified from other offences recorded within that classification. It is therefore not possible to identify those Section 4 offences which are recorded and subsequently not proceeded with.</p>

 The seaside remains an important part of the visitor economy, accounting for some 24 million domestic overnight trips and almost £4.6 billion in overnight visitor spend across the UK in 2010. The VisitEngland website gives wide coverage to the coast, and the seaside also features in themed promotions through print and electronic media and related marketing activity. Government's tourism strategy includes the aim of growing the value of the domestic tourism market, and coastal destinations and attractions can contribute significantly to this objective. The British Resorts and Destinations Association and other industry members have been working with VisitEngland to develop a Coastal Resorts Action Plan.

 The Department for International Development (DFID)'s contribution to the Government's action against human trafficking will be set out in the new human trafficking strategy. DFID's most important contribution is our work to tackle the root causes of human trafficking in poor countries such as poverty, lack of economic opportunities, and social exclusion. For example, DFID has one of the largest bilateral programmes on social protection, directly helping very poor people in over 15 developing countries.</p>

We support the Malawi Anti-Child Trafficking Project, run by the Salvation Army, which aims to improve knowledge of and access to rights for children in Malawi who have been trafficked or are vulnerable to being trafficked. In Bangladesh we have supported a police reform programme which has recently established a Human Trafficking Investigations Unit. In Uganda, we have supported UNICEF to help identify and support trafficked women and children in the northern Karamoja region. DFID is currently developing a new regional programme which will aim to reduce the numbers of women and girls trafficked in the south Asia region.</p>

1.These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data available at:
http://research.dwp.gov.uk/asd/index.php?page=hbai_arc
2. These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data sourced from the 2009-10 Family Resources Survey (FRS). This uses disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD equivalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.
3. Net disposable incomes have been used to answer the question. This includes earnings from employment and self-employment, state support, income from occupational and private pensions, investment income and other sources. Income tax, payments, national insurance contributions, council tax/domestic rates and some other payments are deducted from incomes.
4. Figures have been presented on a Before Housing Cost rather than an After Housing Cost basis. For Before Housing Costs, housing costs are not deducted from income, while for After Housing Costs they are.
5. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to a degree of uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.
6. The reference period for HBAI figures is the financial year.
7. Numbers of children have been rounded to the nearest hundred thousand children.
8. Proportions of children in low-income households have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.
9. Each of the measures is defined as:
Absolute poverty: children living in households with equivalised incomes below 60% of 1998-99 median household income held constant in real terms.
Relative poverty: children living in households with equivalised incomes below 60% of contemporary median household income.

New checks and balances have been put in place, assisted by the discipline of the Department publishing all spending over £500 and greater openness over the Government Procurement Card.</p>

            <p class="tabletext">“The FiReControl project was flawed from the outset because it did not have the support of those essential to its success—local Fire and Rescue Services. The Department rushed the start of the project, failing to follow proper procedures. Ineffective checks and balances during initiation and early stages meant the Department committed itself to the project on the basis of broad-brush and inaccurate estimates of costs and benefits and an unrealistic delivery timetable, and agreed an inadequate contract with its IT supplier. The Department under-appreciated the project's complexity, and then mismanaged the IT contractor's performance and delivery. The Department failed to provide the necessary leadership to make the project successful, over-relying on poorly managed consultants and failing to sort out early problems with delivery by the contractor. The Department took a firmer grip of the project from 2009 and terminated the contract in December 2010 to avoid even more money being wasted. The Department is now trying to minimise the future cost of the project by subsidising Fire and Rescue Services to use the Regional Control Centres” (National Audit Office press release, 1 July 2011).</p>

 Two changes were made to the fire funding formula which are reflected in the current Local Government Finance Settlement. The first was to update the expenditure data and the second was to adopt a new fire risk index with a positive weight for population density. Both updates were made to reflect more up to date data. We took into account all of the views received on the options for change set out in the summer 2010 consultation paper, which concluded two years of work reviewing the existing formula with representatives from fire authorities.</p>

 The Government have introduced a new more accurate way of evaluating rough sleeping levels in England. Previously only local authorities where there was a known, or suspected, rough sleeping problem were required to provide a count, which led to a large number of existing rough sleepers being excluded from the data. All areas across England now provide counts or robust estimates giving a clear national picture. Latest statistics show 1,768 rough sleepers in England on any one night in autumn 2010. York unitary authority provided an estimate of two rough sleepers in the area. These figures are published at the following link:</p>

 Any use of force whether in an armed conflict or otherwise will need to be consistent with applicable legal obligations, whether under a UN Security Council Resolution or some other legal mandate. In an armed conflict situation we would comply with the Laws of Armed Conflict. Any use of force outside of an armed conflict should be consistent with that legal mandate and also with English criminal law, for instance, in cases such as self defence, defence of others or prevention of crime.</p>

 The strategic defence and security review announced the decision to delete the Sentinel capability in 2015. The Ministry of Defence is developing plans to address the capability gap and expect to reach conclusions in the autumn. The plans are likely to involve the use of Watchkeeper, an unmanned air vehicle, and future systems such as the Crowsnest programme from 2016, and through the development of Scavenger, an unmanned air system.</p>

As part of the review of the case completed by officials between late 2008 and early 2009, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) considered the status of the detainees and determined that, as there was no information to suggest that they were members of the armed forces of Iraq, they would not have been prisoners of war. They may have been protected persons under the Geneva conventions, subject to certain criteria being satisfied. If they were protected persons, compliance with the Geneva conventions in respect of detainees held by US forces was primarily a matter for the US.</p>

 Information on the percentage of looked after children who achieve the expected standard in reading and writing in key stage 1 tests is available in table 1.1 of the Department's Statistical First Release, Outcomes for Children Looked After by Local Authorities in England, as at 31 March 2010. This shows the percentage of children looked after continuously for 12 months at 31 March who achieved at least level 2 in reading and writing key stage 1 tests for all years since 2006.

We have also provided a grant of £521,360 for 2011-12, and a further grant of £876,360 for 2012-13 conditional on meeting targets, for a Barnardo's project aimed at providing specialist support to sexually exploited or trafficked children.

The “sea kite” technology being developed by companies such as Minesto UK Ltd is just one of the many leading tidal energy technologies currently being developed in the UK and it has already received £350,000 support from the Carbon Trust to develop and deploy its first prototype at sea. If sea kite technologies can be successfully developed they could allow the utilisation of lower velocity tidal energy resource which cannot be used by more conventional designs.</p>

 We are aware of recent media reporting regarding hydroelectric and diversionary projects on the Brahmaputra river. However we have not received any specific reports of the effects of such projects. We understand that since 2002 India and China have signed a number of MOUs for the provision of hydrological information on the Brahmaputra river, and that the two sides have set up a joint expert level mechanism to discuss co-operation. We continue to monitor water disputes in the region, recognising that these are a potential source of tension.</p>

 Throughout the Libya evacuation, our top priority was the safe and quick evacuation of British nationals and other eligible persons. The UK instigated the military multinational evacuation cell, based in Malta, to co-ordinate rescue efforts throughout the crisis. Whenever we sought a charter flight to support the evacuation, our brokers would return a number of options from different air operating companies. We made a selection on the basis of seat capacity, location of aircraft and price. Once our selected charter was confirmed, the broker informed the unsuccessful bidders. Because of the way the charter market works, it is not possible to hold other flights on reserve without paying significant costs. Following the FCO Review of Consular Evacuation Procedures, which I lodged in the Library on 4 July, we are examining the most cost-effective way of securing redundancy capacity, if we need it in the future.</p>

               <a name="1107143000829"> The European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) is financed by the European Commission raising funds on capital markets, guaranteed by the EU Budget. There is no direct impact on the EU Budget from any such borrowing by the Commission. Only in the event that a beneficiary member state defaults on loan repayments would the EU Budget be adversely affected. In those circumstances, member states would be liable for a share based on their contribution to the EU Budget at that time. Contributions to the EU Budget vary over time, mainly driven by the member states’ share in the EU's Gross National Income. For this reason, it is not possible to state exactly the UK liability. As an illustrative example, based on contributions to the 2010 EU Budget, the UK's share would be approximately 14%.</p>

The UK contributes funds to the IMF as a whole rather than to any country-specific IMF programme. Our ultimate exposure to any IMF lending programme would be in line with our quota shareholding, i.e. around 4.5%.</p>

Ireland accounts for 6% of Britain's total exports—we export more to Ireland than to Brazil, Russia, India and China put together. By offering Ireland a bilateral loan, Britain is recognising the important economic relationship between Britain and Ireland, including between Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>

3. The RTS is published quarterly, Q1 is January-March; Q2 is April-June; Q3 is July-September; and Q4 is October-December.
4. The latest RTS publication is first quarter (Q1) 2011.
5. Where quarterly company counts are indicated, the figures reflect the number of companies active in that quarter. The annual total company counts do not correspond to the sum of the quarterly company counts, but to the count of unique companies active at any time during the year.

 The scope of the EC Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive has been problematic since its adoption at the end of 2002. There is no direct reference to an exemption for 'fixed installations' in the directive, but the European Commission's guidance does allow for one in its interpretation of Article 2.1.</p>

A power shower that has controls in the bathroom but a remote pump and/or water heater fitted elsewhere in the building would be regarded as part of a fixed installation and, therefore, outside scope.</p>

The programme prevents cervical cancers by detecting and treating abnormalities which, if left undetected and untreated, may develop into cancer. Experts estimate it saves up to 4,500 lives per year. As set out in “Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer” (January 2011) we have committed to invest £60 million between 2011 and 2014 to incorporate flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) into the NHS bowel screening programme. New evidence has shown that a one-off FS screening test for bowel cancer at age 55 can reduce the incidence of bowel cancer in people attending screening by 33%. Experts estimate FS will save around 3,000 lives every year.</p>

                     <sup>(1)</sup> The new headcount methodology for 2010 data are not fully comparable with previous years data due to improvements that make it a more stringent count of absolute staff numbers. Further information on the headcount methodology is available in the Census publication. Headcount totals are unlikely to equal the sum of components.
<sup>(2)</sup> The area of Devon is serviced by Devon PCT, Plymouth PCT and Torbay PCT. A sub-total of the three PCTs has been provided. GP workforce data are not available at constituency level. In England, only local PCTs and Strategic Health Authorities. Newton Abbot is contained within and serviced by Devon PCT.
<i>Notes:</i>
1. Data as at 30 September 2010.
2. GP per head of population figures have been calculated using Office for National Statistic resident population estimates.
<i>Data Quality:</i>
The NHS Information Centre for health and social care seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data but responsibility for data accuracy lies with the organisations providing the data. Methods are continually being updated to improve data quality where changes impact on figures already published. This is assessed but unless it is significant at national level figures are not changed. Impact at detailed or local level is footnoted in relevant analyses.

‘Debt’ can be interpreted in a number of ways in relation to the finances of NHS trusts. We have interpreted ‘debt’ to mean the total amount reported by each NHS trust in their balance sheet in respect of bank overdrafts, loans, finance leases and Private finance initiative arrangements. These are the items most readily identified with the term ‘debt’ in accounting terminology.

 The Government want the full range of health and care professionals to be involved in the new commissioning arrangements, supporting the NHS Commissioning Board and clinical commissioning groups to design pathways of care and shape services.

Clinical commissioning groups will also receive expert support and advice from clinical networks and senates on the design and delivery of services.

As part of this work, the Department is seeking to provide more health services/professionals with the training and skills to refer potential victims directly into the National Referral Mechanism. The Department has also recognised the need for better understanding of the issues around health and trafficking and has therefore invited bids for research in this area, due to commence in 2011.

 The Government are committed to giving patients greater choice of any qualified provider and creating a fair playing field, in which the best providers (from whichever sector) flourish. We will make sure that what matters is the quality of care provided, not who owns the organisation providing it. Charities, voluntary organisations and social enterprises will have the opportunity to offer services that, as well as achieving health and social care outcomes, can respond to clients' individual needs and provide real social value.</p>

               <a name="1107149000800"> Amendments to the Health and Social Care Bill will outlaw any policy to increase or decrease the market share of any particular sector of provider. As a result of the changes we have proposed, Monitor, the NHS Commissioning Board and the Secretary of State would not be able to exercise their functions for the purpose of increasing the market shares of any sector of provider.</p>
