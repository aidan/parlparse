To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1) what consultations he has had with British Nuclear Fuels plc concerning the quality control procedures covering MOX plutonium fuel manufactured at Sellafield for export to Japan; and what representations his Department has received from <i>(a)</i> Japanese customer companies and <i>(b)</i> the Japanese Government in respect of the monitoring of MOX fuel;  [102176]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will place in the Library a copy of the reports provided to his Department in the past year by BNFL concerning safety and quality assurance of MOX plutonium fuel.  [102180]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91216w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Ministers were concerned to learn of falsified quality control data at BNFL's Sellafield MOX Demonstration Facility. The Government have insisted that the company co-operate fully with investigations both by the Japanese customer and regulator and by the HSE's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate.
<P>

<a name="91216w01.html_para0">No representations have been received by my Department from BNFL's Japanese customers. Inquiries from the Japanese Embassy about the data falsification were referred by my Department to HSE (NII) with a request to respond direct. With HSE's agreement, I am placing a copy of their reply to the Embassy in the Library of the House.

<P>

<a name="91216w01.html_para1">On 1 December I discussed with the BNFL Chairman, Mr. Hugh Collum, the progress of the investigations being undertaken and the company's strategy for dealing with management issues identified. Remedial measures are in hand to satisfy both HSE (NII) and BNFL's Japanese customers. I have asked the company to make these public as soon as it has satisfied HSE (NII) as to the adequacy of its proposals.

<a name="91216w01.html_wqn3"><B> Ms Perham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on the effects of the proposed EU Directive on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society on <i>(a)</i> library and archive services, <i>(b)</i> UK library and archive privileges and their extension to digital copying, <i>(c)</i> lawful copying and use of libraries and archives and <i>(d)</i> music reproduction; and if he will make a statement on the inclusion in the proposed EU Directive of the exhaustive list of exceptions to the restricted acts.  [102542]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91216w01.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 While we do not think that the effects of the draft Directive would be particularly problematic in the case of archival operations, we are concerned about its potential impact on library services and privileges. Our concerns stem chiefly from the exhaustive list of exceptions, which we have always felt is unnecessarily prescriptive and inflexible, and have been increased by European Parliament amendments, largely accepted by the Commission, which seek to restrict further the exception provisions. In particular, these amendments make photocopying and research exceptions in the Directive subject to "fair compensation" for right owners, exclude printed music from the photocopying exception, and limit the only specific library exception to copying for conservation purposes.
<P>

<a name="91216w01.html_para2">Overall, our aim is to ensure that it remains possible to achieve a fair and reasonable balance between the interests of right owners and those of users, such as in the library and archive sectors, and we are therefore pressing strongly for much greater flexibility in the exception provisions. Negotiations on the Directive are still some way from conclusion, and we hope that it will prove possible to obtain improvements, particularly since several other member states share many of our concerns about the approach on exceptions. Moreover, we are aware of the potential conflict between exceptions and the use of technical protection measures by right owners, and, like other member states, are seeking to achieve an appropriate balance in this area also.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91216w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 December 1999]:</i> Airbus has been a major success story of European co-operation, and it is important that the UK continues to be involved in it. British companies benefit from the success of Airbus programmes, not only by supplying to BAE SYSTEMS, the UK partner in Airbus, but also to the French, German and Spanish partners. Procurement choices are the commercial decisions of those companies. Over 400 UK sub-contractors and suppliers are currently working on Airbus programmes.
<P>

<a name="91216w01.html_para3">BAE SYSTEMS has applied for launch investment. In assessing this application, we have looked at the potential benefits for the UK economy as a whole to be secured by this programme. It represents the sort of high-tech knowledge based manufacturing which the Government are keen to encourage. This high level of innovation and technology has benefits which cascade throughout the supply chain.
<P>

<a name="91216w01.html_para4">The Future Transport Aircraft competition is being organised by the Ministry of Defence. However, I am well aware of the industrial significance of this project to BAE SYSTEMS and the UK supply chain. My Department has liaised closely with MOD on this, and the decision (expected in the New Year) will properly take account of industrial factors.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91216w01.html_wqn7"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps he is taking to monitor and control the use of telephone pornography services offered by telecommunications providers.  [102838]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91216w01.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Telephone pornography services are offered using the Premium Rate Service (PRS) charging mechanism. The Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone Information Services (ICSTIS) has responsibility for regulating PRS, through its Code of Practice. ICSTIS can apply sanctions, ranging from fines to disconnection and barring from service provision, to service providers which breach the Code. ICSTIS and the Office of Telecommunications (Oftel) are currently reviewing the regulatory framework for PRS to ensure that consumers continue to benefit from the right level of protection.
<P>

<a name="91216w01.html_para5">The ICSTIS Code requires all providers of services to abide by a number of provisions covering decency, and requires that promotional material does not reach those for whom the service concerned may be inappropriate.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91216w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Martlew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when he will announce his decision on Scottish and Southern Energy's proposal to build a new gas-fired power station at Britannia Zinc Ltd., Avonmouth.  [103464]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91216w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 I have decided not to grant consent under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 to Scottish and Southern Energy plc for a 100 MW combined cycle gas turbine generating station at Britannia Zinc Ltd., Avonmouth. The application will be put on hold unless an interested party satisfies the Secretary of State that it should be determined at this stage.
<P>

<a name="91216w01.html_para6">This decision has been taken in accordance with the policy set out in the White Paper entitled, "Conclusions of the Review of Energy Sources for Power Generation and Government response to fourth and fifth Reports of the Trade and Industry Committee" (Cm 4071). I would be prepared to review the decision, if requested, when the stricter consents policy announced in the White Paper is relaxed.
<P>

<a name="91216w01.html_para7">This is the 15th application, totalling over 5,800 MW of new gas-fired generating capacity, which has not been approved since the White Paper was published in October 1998. That would be enough electricity to supply approximately all the households in Greater London or the whole of Scotland.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91216w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. David Stewart: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on the instruction he gave earlier this year to the Export Credits Guarantee Department to establish a bond guarantee scheme for cashmere exports to the US.  [103465]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91216w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 In March of this year, the dispute between the EU and the US over the EU's banana regime led to the US requiring the posting of bonds in respect of potential additional customs duties for certain categories of EU goods, including cashmere knitwear, pending the decision of the WTO arbitrator. Given the potentially devastating effect this could have had on the UK cashmere industry, the Government decided to establish a limited scheme, to be administrated by the Export Credits Guarantee Department, to indemnify cashmere exporters against losses arising from these bonds and additional customs duties.
<P>

<a name="91216w02.html_para0">ECGD's Accounting Officer advised me that, in his judgment, the risk involved in giving such guarantees under Section I(1) of the Export and Investment Guarantees Act 1991, could not be accepted under ECGD's normal underwriting criteria.
<P>

<a name="91216w02.html_para1">However, in view of the importance which Ministers attached to ensuring the future of the UK cashmere industry, I instructed him to make such guarantees available.
<P>

<a name="91216w02.html_para2">Cashmere was subsequently removed from the list of affected goods and I can now report that the scheme has been closed down and that ECGD has not been and will not be required to pay any claims.

[103547]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91216w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 We have considered the Committee's recommendation on this matter and concluded that, pending the introduction of new primary legislation which will provide for parliamentary scrutiny of secondary legislation on strategic export controls, as proposed in the Strategic Export Controls White Paper, any further Orders made under the Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act 1939 will be laid before both Houses of Parliament.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS), I have been asked to reply to your recent parliamentary question about the number of workers being paid under the national minimum wage.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Definitive estimates on the number of people that are being paid under the national minimum wage are not yet available. Currently available estimates for assessing the number take data from both the New Earnings Survey and the Labour Force Survey and adjust them for known limitations in each. However, the latest adjusted estimates are based on data for the spring (March-May) 1999 Labour Force Survey and this period spans the introduction date for the national minimum wage legislation. As a result, the adjusted estimates may be giving a misleading picture of the effect of the minimum wage legislation since employees might legitimately have been earning below the minimum wage rates in March 1999.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The currently available estimates were published in an ONS First Release on 14 October and show that the number of people earning below the minimum wage rates fell significantly between 1998 and 1999.

<P><I>16 Dec 1999 : Column: 241W</I><P>
for which interim results were released in February 1998. These showed that 6 per cent. of all road users (including drivers, riders, passengers, pedestrians and cyclists) had measurable traces of medicinal drugs and 16 per cent. had traces of illicit drugs (mainly cannabis). The results also showed that 19 per cent. of the sample of drivers and riders killed had taken illicit drugs and consumed alcohol over the legal limit.

<a name="91216w02.html_para9">The presence of drugs in an accident victim is not evidence of accident causation, although there may be an association.

 <i>[holding answer 6 December 1999]:</i> The training and testing of young and newly qualified car drivers is one of the issues being addressed in the Government's review of road safety strategy. The Government have considered a range of measures which might contribute to improving driving standards and road safety. The Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Committee recently suggested a minimum period of learning before a car driving test may be taken, and others have suggested changes in the minimum driving age for provisional and/or full licences. However, the Government have not yet reached a conclusion on these matters. We intend to have completed work on a new Road Safety Strategy early in the new year.

 The Department began a major research programme on fatigue in December 1992, conducted at Loughborough University. The first phase included a comprehensive study of HGV and car drivers. The results suggested that, for car drivers in particular, tiredness is a principal factor in around 10 per cent. of accidents.
<P>

<a name="91216w03.html_para0">The next phase of the research looked at the relative effectiveness of possible counter measures to tiredness, to ensure that drivers have the best possible advice on how to minimise the risk of a sleep-related accident. Recommendations derived from this work have since been incorporated into the Highway Code.

<a name="91216w03.html_para1">Much of the research undertaken in the road safety area has relevance in rail, air and maritime situations and vice versa. It is also significant that leading experts in this field are very aware of each other's work. A further phase of the Department's research, begun in September, is reviewing successful measures that have been employed elsewhere in the world and in different operating environments. This includes a requirement to develop a targeted programme of publicity and education to counter driver fatigue. When this is completed in September 2000, the Government will consider what action to take, including whether to commission further research.

<P>
<a name="91216w04.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 There has been a slow but steady increase in the proportion of non-peat material used as soil improvers and growing media. In 1993, 28 per cent. of the total market was met by non-peat materials. This increased to 29 per cent. in 1997 and 32 per cent. in 1998. The report of the Working Group on Peat Extraction and Related Matters published last month identified short-term measures which could be taken to increase the rate of uptake of non-peat materials. If the producers and retailers of growing media respond in the

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on the rights of appeal for local people who consider that their ideas of best value are being ignored by their local authority.  [103027]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91216w04.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Local Government Act 1999 places best value authorities under a statutory duty to consult with local people as to how the duty of best value can be met after 1 April 2000. This is reinforced by a requirement to consult with business and other interests in considering alternative ways of providing services.
<P>

<a name="91216w04.html_para0">There is no explicit right of appeal, as the Government take the view that where there are conflicting views it is for best-value authorities to judge how the duty is to be met in the light of all the relevant circumstances. They will be expected to provide a clear rationale for the decisions which they reach, and to justify these to local people every year in their Best Value Performance Plans and to independent auditors and inspectors acting on behalf of local people. All local authorities are ultimately accountable to local people through the ballot box.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91216w04.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 <i>(a)</i> There is no recycling target which each individual local authority is expected to meet. There is a national goal to recycle or compost 25 per cent. of household waste as soon as possible, hopefully by 2005. By 2010 we hope to see 30 per cent. of household waste 



<P>
<P><I>16 Dec 1999 : Column: 249W</I><P>
being recycled or composted, and in the longer term we hope to see a third of all household waste being dealt with in this way.
<P>

<a name="91216w04.html_para1">Under our Best Value Initiative, performance indicators are being developed for local authority waste services. From these, authorities will be expected to derive targets for their own performance on waste, having regard to any national goals we set in the forthcoming National Waste Strategy. I emphasise, though, that local targets should take account of local assessments of the Best Practicable Environmental Option, and will not therefore necessarily be at the same level as our national goals. I fully expect some authorities to put forward targets that exceed those that we propose, and others to put forward lower targets.
<P>

<a name="91216w04.html_para2"><i>(b)</i> We have no targets for the recycling of industrial waste by local authorities. Although the Environmental Protection Act 1990 gives local authorities the discretion to collect industrial waste, they are under no obligation to do so and few do.

 The Secure Stations Scheme is designed to improve and standardise good security practices at all overground and underground stations. To become an accredited Secure Station, each station operator needs to work with their local British Transport Police Crime Prevention Operator to ensure that their station meets the national standards on design and management to cut down crime. Operators also have to conduct an independent passenger survey to see whether passengers feel safe at the station and provide evidence that crime rates are low.

<P>

<a name="91216w04.html_para6">A consultation paper issued by the Department in August set out four alternative approaches to helping authorities deal with the overhanging debt: continuing to pay subsidy, through either the Housing Revenue Account or Revenue Support Grant subsidy schemes; providing a one-off payment to assist with the repayment of the debt; and transferring the debt to the acquiring landlord. The consultation paper made clear that the Government's preference was for the one-off payment option.

 The six standing Defence Advisory Notices are concerned with matters of national security, and are not issued in response to individual cases. No Notice has been issued therefore, nor invoked, in respect of Flight-Lieutenant Burns.

 <i>[holding answer 13 December 1999]:</i> Between 14 and 30 November there have been 12 reported incidents involving RAF Chinooks. Eleven of these were minor day-to-day occurrences but one incident, which occurred during a training exercise on 25 November 1999 and involved damage to the rear of the aircraft, is being investigated by a RAF Board of Inquiry. Nobody was injured. After carrying out a preliminary assessment the Board reported that they had no urgent recommendations to make affecting the Chinook fleet as a whole. Their investigation is continuing and a summary of the Board's final report will be placed in the Library of the House in the normal way.

<a name="91216w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 NATO has agreed to revise arrangements for manning the headquarters in the UK sector of SFOR. We have worked closely with our Dutch, Canadian and Czech partners on plans. This will allow a reduction in UK forces in Bosnia from around 3,300 to some 2,000 in the course of next year, while fully maintaining the operational effectiveness of SFOR. This reduction is in addition to the withdrawal of some 900 UK troops announced in late October, and will further reduce overstretch in the British Army.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what information he has obtained regarding the number of veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf conflict that have died, and the underlying causes of death; and if he will make a statement.  [103469]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91216w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence has reviewed its own records and has found that between 1 April 1991 and 22 November 1999 (the latest date for which information is currently available) there were 413 deaths of UK armed forces Gulf veterans (out of a total of 53,462 deployed). The causes of death for 387 of the deaths have been determined and are set out in the table. Sufficient information on the causes of death in the remaining 26 cases is not currently available; work is continuing to establish this.

<P><I>16 Dec 1999 : Column: 257W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="91216w06.html_para3">The Ministry of Defence also has information on the number and causes of deaths in a similar sized comparative sample of armed forces personnel in service in January 1991 but who did not deploy to the Gulf. This information has been used by the Ministry of Defence funded epidemiological study undertaken by Professors Nicola Cherry and Gary Macfarlane at Manchester University. The results of this study, commissioned by the Medical Research Council, have been submitted to a leading medical journal for consideration for publication. They will show whether or not the Gulf veterans are experiencing a higher mortality rate than their peers and if so what the causes might be.
<P>

<a name="91216w06.html_para4">It is important that this study is independently peer reviewed to ensure publication in a leading medical journal. To ensure this my hon. Friend the Minister for the Armed Forces has withheld the information on the comparative group under Exemption 11a of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

 The Annual cost of The Surveillance, Target Acquisition, Night Observation and Counter- surveillance Centre (STANOC) is &#163;0.24 million.

<a name="91216w07.html_para2">The Centre gives assistance to the police and other Government Departments under the provisions of Military Aid to the Civil Powers, and to Industry. Assistance to the police and other Government Departments is provided without charge.

I am withholding the information on the specific charges levied in each case under section 13 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. I can report, however, that total recoveries since 1 January 1998 amount to &#163;9,882.

 The estimated overall cost of registration of electors in Scotland is in the region of &#163;4 million per year, or just under a pound per elector. The cost of making a single correction to the electoral register would not be very much greater than the cost of registering an elector.

<P>
<a name="91216w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Stringer: </B> 
 "Public Bodies 1999" was published earlier today. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="91216w08.html_para1">"Public Bodies 1999" provides a range of statistical information on over 1,500 public bodies and over 35,000 public appointments. It focuses primarily on non- departmental public bodies, but also includes information on nationalised industries, certain public corporations and those NHS bodies to which Ministers make appointments. "Public Bodies 1999" is UK-wide in its coverage and includes information on those public bodies which now operate in devolved areas in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="91216w08.html_para2">"Public Bodies 1999" shows that the Government are making steady progress in reducing the overall number of non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs). The number of such bodies now stands at 1,057--a reduction of 6 per cent. over the 1997 total of 1,128.
<P>

<a name="91216w08.html_para3">"Public Bodies 1999" also shows that the Government are succeeding in increasing diversity among those serving of the board of public bodies. As at 1 September 1999, 33 per cent. of public appointments were held by women and 4.7 per cent. were held by members of ethnic minorities. This compares favourably to September 1997, when 32 per cent. of public appointments were held by women and 3.6 per cent. by members of ethnic minorities. We will continue working hard to encourage more women and more members of ethnic minorities to take up positions in public life.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91216w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Stringer: </B> 
 Making a dramatic improvement in diversity is a central part of the civil service reform programme. We are taking action across the civil service to address the under-representation of ethnic minorities particularly at senior levels. We have set a target to double the number of staff from ethnic minority backgrounds in the senior civil service to 3.2 per cent. by 2004-05.
<P>

<a name="91216w08.html_para4">The Cabinet Office is putting in place measures to help achieve corporate action, including: the appointment of an outreach worker who is working with university ethnic minority groups to build a better understanding of the opportunities in the Fast Stream; appointing a Senior Adviser to establish further pools of secondees and potential recruits and act as a source of advice to departments; planning to hold a civil service ethnic minority careers fair annually.
<P>

<a name="91216w08.html_para5">The Cabinet Office, as an organisation, has developed and is implementing, a Diversity Action Plan, which includes objectives and actions for setting targets for recruitment and selection; retention; and progression of under-represented groups, strengthening links with ethnic minority communities (open-days and seminars), summer work placements for school pupils, and a mentoring scheme for Cabinet Office staff and external ethnic minority undergraduates.

(9) These figures for Tulloch Bridge are extrapolations from 1996-97, not true estimates.<P>

<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Kinloss and Tulloch Bridge stations serve both constituencies. The other six stations do not serve Inverness, East, Nairn and Lochaber. Each station also serves areas outside these two constituencies. The total estimated recipients for all the weather stations is therefore substantially higher than the total of estimated recipients in the two constituencies. The calculation of the estimated cost takes this into account.<P>

2. The figures in the table represent an estimate of the actual total cost per constituency. The cost of triggers at Kinloss and Tulloch Bridge has been split equally between the two constituencies.<P>

3. The estimated cost has been calculated by multiplying the number of triggers (A) by the number of estimated recipients served by each station (B) by the cost per CWP (&#163;8.50), then multiplied by the number of total qualifying individuals in each constituency (C) (from the following table) divided by the total estimated recipients served by all relevant stations for each constituency.<P>

4. Waterstein Head station did not exist in 1996-97. Its catchment was drawn from Tiree for 1997-98. It was then replaced by another new station, Lusa, in 1998-99.<P>

5. It is not possible to estimate the cost or number of payments for a future period for the year 2000 as CWPs are dependent on prevailing weather conditions and the caseload at the time.<P>

There have been significant changes in the postcode districts linked to weather station areas over the period in question. Of particular interest in respect of the Inverness area was the transfer of postcodes IV 47-49, 51, 55 and 56 from the station at Tiree to the new station at Waterstein Head in 1997; the replacement of the station at Waterstein Head by that at Lusa in 1998, and, most significantly and recently, the transfer of postcode district IV3 from

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will issue an instruction to all Benefits Agency staff requiring them to disregard the value of the Winter Fuel Payment when assessing the value of capital in any assessments of entitlement to income-related benefits.  [102998]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91216w09.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Winter Fuel Payments are made under the Social Fund. Income-related benefits legislation provides for all types of Social Fund payments to be fully disregarded in the assessment of a person's capital. This is reflected in guidance to Benefits Agency staff in both the Decision Makers' Guide (DMG) and the Guidance and Procedures manual (GAP).

<P>
<a name="91216w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The latest available information is published in "Households Below Average Income" (HBAI) and relates to 1997-98 for Great Britain. In that year, mean income Before Housing Costs was &#163;318 per week (in April 1999 prices), &#163;277 After Housing Costs.

<a name="91216w10.html_para1">HBAI assumes that both partners in a couple benefit equally from the household income, and as a result both partners will appear at the same position in the income distribution. On that basis, mean net equivalised household income for men was &#163;301 per week, and for women was &#163;279 per week.

2. The HBAI income measure is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income (that is to say, income that is adjusted to reflect the size and composition of the household).

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="91216w10.html_para4">The most recent figures we have show that at the end of October, 8,596 applicants were waiting for settlement visa interviews at the 100 busiest Entry Clearance posts overseas. This figure excludes those applicants waiting in Peking where computer problems have delayed the production of statistical data. The figure also excludes applications referred to the Home Office for a decision; and applications under appeal. During the period January to October 1999, the Posts concerned received 1,314,397 applications for settlement and non-settlement visas for the UK.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when the Criminal Records Bureau will come into operation; and if he will make a statement.  [103466]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91216w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 On 14 December 1998, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced in a reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Kemptown (Dr. Turner), <i>Official Report,</i> column 356W, that we would be setting up a Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) in Merseyside to implement Part V of the Police Act 1997. The function of the Bureau will be to issue certificates to applicants, including people who wish to apply for posts involving working with children and vulnerable adults. On 20 July, my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, Home Department announced in a reply to the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington), <i>Official Report,</i> column 464W, that he was reviewing the timetable for the delivery of the CRB and that he would inform the House of the results after the recess.
<P>

<a name="91216w10.html_para5">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has confirmed that Bernard Herdan, the newly appointed Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Passport Agency, will also be in charge of the CRB. He will chair the CRB Management Board and account to the Home Secretary, to Parliament and to stakeholders for the CRB's performance. Some administrative support functions will be provided to the CRB by the United Kingdom Passport Agency, but in general it will operate as an entirely separate business unit and will be publishing its own Business Plan and Annual Report.
<P>

<a name="91216w10.html_para6">I have reviewed the delivery of the project to establish the CRB within the framework of a Public Private Partnership. A dedicated team has been established in Merseyside to deliver the project. A business prospectus was issued on 8 October and a bidders conference was held on 14 October. I am pleased to report that there has been a substantial amount of interest from potential private sector partners, and bids were received on 19 November and are under evaluation. Shortlisted bidders will be invited to take part in a technical design study next spring and we hope to be in a position to let the contract around the middle of next year. It will then take about six to nine months to install the necessary 



<P>
<P><I>16 Dec 1999 : Column: 272W</I><P>
systems and recruit the staff before the Bureau is ready to receive applications for registration from employers requiring access to the highest level certificates on behalf of their employees.
<P>

<a name="91216w10.html_para7">My aim is that the CRB should then move on to the next stage and start issuing certificates in July 2001. This is later than our original estimate, but this is a challenging programme and I think it important that the timescale is realistic. Priority will be given to issuing the highest level of certificate, the Enhanced Criminal Record Certificate, for those seeking positions which involve regularly caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge of persons aged under 18. The CRB's services will expand over the subsequent year so that, by July 2002, it should be issuing all three levels of certificate provided for in the legislation.
<P>

<a name="91216w10.html_para8">In the course of the review, we have decided that it is not necessary to proceed with earlier plans to procure accommodation to house the whole of the CRB's staff. While it remains our intention to accommodate the Bureau's core public sector staff in Merseyside, we think it right to give our private sector partner the flexibility needed to produce the best, most cost-effective solution. The project will continue to be managed from Merseyside.

<P>
<a name="91216w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 My right hon.

 I have received the following information from the Chief Fire Officer, Devon Fire and Rescue Service.
<P>

<a name="91216w11.html_para0">The premises were built in 1970, and were issued with a Fire Certificate under the Fire Precautions Act 1971 on 18 February 1991. This certificate related to the use of the premises as a cash and carry warehouse.
<P>

<a name="91216w11.html_para1">Plans submitted by the current occupiers during June 1998, for approval under the Buildings Regulations, were considered for compliance by both the Torbay Council and Devon Fire and Rescue Service. The standards applied are contained in the Building Regulations Approved Document B. The intent of the Regulations is to secure reasonable standards of health and safety for persons in or about the building. There is no requirement for a building put to this use and of this size to be provided with either automatic fire detection or sprinklers. On receipt of a Building Regulations Completion Certificate, in respect of the work covered by the plans, an inspection was to have been carried out with the intent of updating the Fire Certificate.
<P>

<a name="91216w11.html_para2">On 1 December 1999 the Fire Precautions (Workplace) (Amendments) Regulations 1999 came into force, placing a requirement upon the employer to carry out a risk assessment to minimise the risk of and spread of fire.

<P>

<a name="91216w11.html_para8">Devon Fire and Rescue Service received the call to the fire at the Wilton Bradley Factory at 22.58 hours on 9 December 1999. A fire engine was en route to the site at 23.00 hours and in attendance at the fire at 23.04 hours. This was well within the 8-10 minute maximum response time recommended by the minimum standard of fire cover for the area. As a matter of policy the brigade mobilised two fire engines and one supervisory officer immediately. The second fire engine arrived at 23.07 hours and the officer at 23.17 hours. At the height of the incident a total of 17 fire brigade appliances (including specialist vehicles) and 80 firefighters attended. There was a multi-agency response including police, ambulance and environmental health.

The tests were repeated in Long Road at 13.30 hours when all results were negative with the exception of hydrogen chloride which was recorded at less than one part per million.

Once this review is completed, we will need to consider whether, and if so what, changes are necessary. We intend to do this in full consultation with the police and non-governmental bodies working in this area. Primary legislation will be required for any changes to the Act.

 <i>[holding answer 14 December 1999]:</i> The details of those concerned are held on the Dome Opening Celebration's secure database and are subject to data protection legislation. All those concerned would need to be contacted for their agreement to release their details. The costs of doing so, including the opportunity costs of moving NMEC employees on to such a task, are at this stage of the project disproportionate to the outcome, especially when the results would be uncertain in terms of agreements and refusals.

<a name="91216w13.html_para6">On 3 December, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced that a review is now under way, with the Chief Constable and GOC, which will focus particularly on specific security arrangements, including various installations throughout Northern Ireland, taking account of the prevailing threat. Any changes will of course depend on genuine cessations of violence and continued progress in the political process.
<P>

<a name="91216w13.html_para7">The first phase of this review will be completed early in the new year. The Secretary of State has invited people who wish to send him their written views to do so by 14 January.

 Consultation on the draft Regulations to lift the retail ban on bone-in-beef was completed on Wednesday 8 December and showed strong support for the proposal. A summary of consultation responses has been placed in the Library of the House. The Regulations have been laid before the House today and will come into effect on Friday 17 December.

<a name="91216w14.html_para0">The remaining ban on the use for manufacturing of bones from beef deboned in Great Britain will continue to be kept under review. Meanwhile, manufacturers are being reminded of the continuing importance of compliance in the interest of public health and to help maintain consumer confidence in beef products. In addition, caterers are being asked to ensure that information is readily available to consumers about whether bone-in-beef or beef bones have been used in the preparation of food for direct sale.

 Three projects on the effects associated with GMOs have been completed in the last six months. These are: an investigation of the interaction between genetically modified micro-organisms (GMMOs) living around sugar beet plants; a study of the chances of the creation of novel viruses from the release of GM virus-tolerant plants; and a desk study of the possible effects associated with the introduction of GM forage grasses and forage legumes. The results of these projects will inform policy on future releases of GMOs.

 I have no plans to change current guidance on pupil-staff ratios in nursery classes and nursery schools in the maintained sector. Data on pupil-staff ratios in these settings are available only as an aggregated value for each local education authority. This information was last collected by my Department in January 1999 and suggests that all local education authorities are operating nursery schools with pupil-staff ratios which are within current recommended levels and that approximately 99 per cent. are operating more favourable ratios. In addition, 49 per cent. of local education authorities are providing nursery classes in maintained primary schools with pupil-staff ratios that are within or better than the recommended level.

 Funding under the education element of the Home Office's Section 11 Grant ceased on 31 March 1999. A new grant, the Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant (EMAG), for which my Department is responsible, was introduced in its place from 1 April 1999. EMAG was established to raise standards for those ethnic minority pupils particularly at risk of underachieving and to meet the particular needs of pupils for whom English is an Additional Language. For 1999-2000, individual allocations mirrored Section 11 allocations in 1998-99.

<a name="91216w15.html_para0">For 2000-01, &#163;162.5 million will be available to local education authorities to improve the attainment of ethnic minority, traveller and refugee pupils, an increase of 7 per cent. on the amount available for the same purposes in 1999-2000. Provisional allocations for the newly merged Ethnic Minority and Traveller Achievement Grant for 2000-01 were announced in October 1999. The formula used to allocate the ethnic minority achievement element of the Grant protected each authority's total Grant in 1999-2000, while distributing additional funds on the basis of need.

<a name="91216w15.html_para13">The introduction of accredited status has enabled the Further Education Funding Council (FEFC) to recognise all-round competence in college performance. The criteria for accreditation are demanding, and colleges that fulfil them must demonstrate continuing commitment to the achievement of high standards across the range of their activity. The FEFC national accreditation panel will continue to meet to consider further applications from colleges in the period until April 2001. There will be consultations early next year on post-16 quality assurance arrangements after April 2001.

 The total level of support available to students in 2000-01 will be 2&#189; per cent. higher than for 1999-2000, in line with forecast price increases. I am today placing a memorandum in the Library giving details of the new loan, grant and fee rates for 2000-01. These rates will be incorporated in the Education (Student Support) Regulations, which cover support for eligible students under the current arrangements, and in the Education (Mandatory Awards) Regulations and Education (Student Loans) Amendment Regulations, which cover students who are still eligible for support under the previous arrangements. These Regulations will all be laid before Parliament in due course.

 The Government have introduced a series of measures to combat pensioner poverty:
<P>

<a name="91216w17.html_para1">The Minimum Income Guarantee for the poorest pensioners, which was introduced in April 1999, will be uprated by earnings over time and as resources allow. The Government have already pledged to uprate the Minimum Income Guarantee by earnings every year until the end of this Parliament. This will benefit the 1.6 million MIG recipients. The effect of earnings uprating is that, from April 2000, for a younger single pensioner, the MIG will be almost &#163;500 per year higher than it was in April 1997. For a pensioner couple, the MIG will be &#163;800 higher.

<P>

<a name="91216w17.html_para2">The Winter Allowance--introduced by this Government in 1998 and increased to &#163;100 for every pensioner household from winter 1999--is a major part of the Government's strategy to combat fuel poverty, along with the cut in the rate of VAT on fuel from 8 per cent. to 5 per cent.
<P>

<a name="91216w17.html_para3">Free TV licences for pensioners aged 75 and over will be introduced from autumn 2000. This measure is an important income boost for some of the poorest pensioner households.
<P>

<a name="91216w17.html_para4">On taxation, this Government have introduced the 10p and 22p tax bands, increased personal allowances for pensioners and ensured that the 10p rate applies to savings income. These changes benefit pensioners particularly and mean that two thirds of pensioners now pay no income tax at all.
<P>

<a name="91216w17.html_para5">Taken together, the average pensioner household will be &#163;300 per year better off as a result of these measures. In addition, the Government's success in delivering low inflation is particularly important for pensioners who may be relying on savings for their income.

The alignment of the income tax personal allowance and the starting point for employers' NICs means that the level of both now needs to be announced in the Autumn. The Government keep all income tax allowances under review, and any other changes will be announced in the Budget in the usual way.

 Since the beginning of the year, the Treasury has received 19 letters and 603 postcards from members of the public and 42 letters from hon. Members about the proposal to introduce a tax on currency speculation.
<P>

<a name="91216w18.html_para0">The Government believe the idea of a tax on currency speculation is, in principle, interesting, but has a number of practical drawbacks. It would be almost impossible to achieve global coverage, and there would be huge scope for avoidance.

 The football authorities, which are independent of Government, are best placed to make decisions on the development of football, including the distribution of income within the game. The tax system is not an appropriate mechanism for redistributing funds between football clubs.

<a name="91216w18.html_para1">The Commission replied at the beginning of December last year, saying that there is currently no provision which would allow for this reduced rate. They raised the possibility of future Commission proposals relating to Annexe H of the EC Sixth Directive, which allows for reduced rates, and maintain that these proposals would provide the right context in which to tackle the energy saving materials question. We believe that the Commission may put forward these proposals next year and, when they arrive, we will consider again the case for a reduced rate for energy saving materials.

 The Comprehensive Spending Review backed the Strategy set out in "Tackling Drugs to Build a Better Britain" with &#163;217 million of new money over the three years 1999-2000 to 2001-02. This includes funding for the Drug Treatment and Testing Orders, which, subject to successful evaluation, will roll out nationally from next year. In addition, my predecessor agreed a framework for the new Confiscated Assets Fund, which will ensure that the assets seized from drugs barons are deployed effectively in support of the Strategy.
<P>

<a name="91216w18.html_para2">Further, HM Customs and Excise, who are accountable to the Chancellor, play a key operational role in delivery against the Strategy's objective of reducing the availability of drugs in the UK.

 Unfair tax competition in the form of harmful and discriminatory tax practices can distort competition and artificially attract investment and jobs away from member states, such as the UK, which have more neutral tax systems. Unfair tax practices of others prevent British business from operating on a more level playing field.

 As set out in the Pre-Budget Report, and in a Treasury paper, "The New Monetary Policy Framework", the Government believe that the new monetary policy framework has had several beneficial effects on the UK economy.

<P>
<a name="91216w20.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The key criterion for the selection of Phone and Go dental access centres is that there must be a demonstrated problem of access to National Health Service dentistry in the area. This is assessed from several sources of availability information, including health authority reports, statistical indicators and knowledge of the individual health authority's dental needs and health. The schemes must also offer good value for money, provide a full range of general dental services and have both regional office support and health authority commitment and capability to deliver. Northamptonshire was middle ranking in terms of reported dental availability problems.

 <i>[holding answer 15 December 1999]:</i> We fund health and medical research, including that for breast cancer, in a number of ways.
<P>

<a name="91216w21.html_para3">The Department funds research and development to support its work on policy development and evaluation in health and social care. The Department also manages the National Health Service research and development levy, which is used to support research and development of relevance to the National Health Service in hospitals, general practice and other health care settings, and to fund the NHS research and development programme. In addition, the Medical Research Council (MRC)--which receives most of its income via grant-in-aid from the office of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry--funds medical research as part of the Government's funding of the science and engineering base.
<P>

<a name="91216w21.html_para4">There is strong existing research evidence for the value of using the combination of clinical examination, mammography and fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) known as "triple assessment" to diagnose cancer in women with breast lesions. A review of 15 follow-up studies showed that triple assessment is consistently more sensitive than any single test alone, capable of picking up 95 per cent. to 100 per cent. of cancers when at least one component is positive. When all three tests give the same result, whether positive or negative, the probability that the diagnosis is correct is about 99 per cent. In most cases, therefore, women with three positive tests can be offered therapy and those whose tests are all negative can be reassured without the need for surgical biopsy. In addition, triple assessment can be carried out in a single visit, reducing the time to achieve a definitive diagnosis.
<P>

<a name="91216w21.html_para5">"Improving Outcomes in Breast Cancer" was issued in 1996 by the NHS Executive Headquarters to provide evidence-based guidance on commissioning breast cancer services in the NHS. This recommends the use of triple assessment. A synopsis of the research evidence underlying the guidance was published alongside the guidance. Copies of both documents are available in the Library. We have invested an additional &#163;30 million since 1997-98 to improve breast cancer services, building on this guidance.
