To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what prophylactic research has been conducted by his Department and agencies responsible to his Department into <i>(a)</i> anthrax and <i>(b)</i> other biological agents.  [8762]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11022w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The remit of Defence Science Technology Laboratory Chemical (Dstl) and Biological Sciences at Porton Down is to provide the UK and its armed forces with safe and effective protection in the event of exposure to chemical or biological weapons. This involves conducting research into prophylactic measures, such as vaccines, antibiotics or antivirals for a variety of different biological agents including anthrax.
<P>

<a name="11022w01.html_para0">Dstl Porton Down seeks to publish the results of its research wherever security considerations allow. In recent years work has been published on a new vaccine against plague, which is currently undergoing clinical trials and the development of a new vaccine against anthrax which it is hoped will enter clinical trials in the near future. Additionally, research results on various prophylactic measures against a range of agents and diseases including Tularaemia, VEE, SEB, Brucellosis, Glanders, Ricin and Botulinum toxin have been published in the peer reviewed technical literature.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11022w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory Porton Down has developed a package of state of the art atmospheric dispersion models to determine the potential travel of aerosol clouds.
<P>

<a name="11022w01.html_para1">These models form part of an extensive suite of tools and data which are used by the Ministry of Defence to assess the potential hazard posed by chemical and biological weapons. For agents of biological origin, the data include estimates of the human toxicity or infectivity, the transmissibility, atmospheric stability and the availability of detection, protection and medical countermeasures.

<a name="11022w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Under the terms of the Tri-Partite Agreement (TPA) between India, Nepal and the UK, Gurkha pay is linked to the Indian Army pay code. Gurkhas also receive a cost of living allowance known as Universal Addition payable wherever a Gurkha serves. This combination of basic Indian Army pay and Universal 



<P>
<P><I>22 Oct 2001 : Column: 5W</I><P>
Addition, means that overall total Gurkha remuneration is in line with the net pay of comparable British service men. These arrangements have been in place since 1997

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the Gurkha regiments; and what plans he has to increase the number of Gurkhas serving in the British armed forces.  [9034]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11022w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The total number of trained Gurkhas in the British Army as at 1 September, was 3,500. There are two Gurkha Infantry Regiments serving with the British Army; 1 Royal Gurkha Rifles and 2 Royal Gurkha Rifles.

 Potential drugs for post exposure treatment of anthrax are Ciprofloxacin or Doxycycline but these antibiotics are also used to treat a wide range of clinical conditions. Other than supplies to meet ongoing primary and secondary healthcare requirements, no additional quantities of these drugs were acquired in the six-week period prior to 11 September.

 The Department has carried out general studies on the potential impact of offshore energy devices, as well as Environmental Impact Assessments for specific schemes, including one for a proposed tidal stream development. These studies indicate that, providing the schemes are deployed with some care, they should not have any significant adverse effect on the environment and simple steps can be taken to ensure that such schemes are not a navigation or environmental hazard.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11022w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The recent report of the Science and Technology Committee Inquiry into wave and tidal energy estimated that energy from wave and tidal currents around the UK have the theoretical potential to generate about 25 per cent. of the nation's electricity.
<P>

<a name="11022w04.html_para0">The same report estimated that if 0.1 per cent. of the energy resource in the ocean could be converted to electricity it would satisfy the present world demand for energy five times over.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11022w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 In the case of wave energy, my Department has already supported the development of the world's first commercial wave power device at Islay, and we recently announced that we will provide further support to the company involved, Wavegen, by increasing the level of R&D funding for their most recent project to almost &#163;1.67 million. This funding will assist with the further development of their new offshore wave energy concept and the construction and testing at sea of a prototype. This substantial funding confirms the Government's commitment to its new wave energy programme.
<P>

<a name="11022w04.html_para2">The Department commissioned a study into the prospects for tidal stream technology in the UK and this has now been completed. It was positive about the prospects for tidal stream, and is being taken forward in association with the industry. There are a useful amount of tidal currents around the shores of the UK and these are already well charted. There a number of sites where tidal stream generators could be deployed, but as yet no prototype device. Tidal stream is now covered as a technology in my Department's Sustainable Energy Programme.
<P>

<a name="11022w04.html_para3">The Department recently initiated a call for proposals under the Sustainable Energy Programme, which invites bids for funds to support the development of both wave and tidal power. The level of funding will be dependent on the number of good quality R&D proposals which are received from the industry.
<P>

<a name="11022w04.html_para4">Both technologies will also continue to be eligible for funding for R&D into Electricity Generation from renewable and clean sources from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). This programme provides &#163;3.5 million of support per year for research into the full range of renewables technologies. To date, wave and tidal projects have received over &#163;769,000 of support from this source.
<P>

<a name="11022w04.html_para5">We anticipate that the introduction of the Renewables Obligation will also provide a further stimulus to these and the wider range of eligible renewables, including wave and tidal power.

 The Department has put in place a range of measures to encourage and assist development and long term investment in offshore technologies.
<P>

<a name="11022w04.html_para6">The Government have allocated at least &#163;49 million to capital grants for offshore wind. &#163;39 million will come from DTI, the remainder from the New Opportunities Fund. The capital grants programme was officially launched this week, and application forms/guidance notes are now available from DTI at www.dti.gov.uk/renew/ eoi.htm. These grants will support early deployment of a number of demonstration projects and enable the industry to develop a bank of knowledge and expertise to maximise the contribution of this technology to the UK's 10 per cent. target. We have also consulted recently on the offshore consents process and plan to bring forward a new 'one-stop-shop' approach which should make it easier for project developers to get their projects up and running.
<P>

<a name="11022w04.html_para7">Already this year, 18 wind farm developments have achieved pre-qualification status for a lease of sea bed from the Crown Estate. We hope to see these projects coming to fruition as quickly as possible. In the light of the interest expressed in the first round of leases we would also hope that the Crown Estate can provide further opportunities.

<P>

<a name="11022w04.html_para9">All three technologies will also benefit from the forthcoming introduction of the Renewables Obligation. The Obligation marks a significant commitment by Government to the renewables industry as a whole, with the potential to create a market worth over &#163;1 billion per annum by the year 2010. We have backed up our commitment to the Obligation with funding worth over &#163;260 million for this and the next two financial years, including the capital grants funding and R&D programmes already mentioned. A proportion of the &#163;100 million for renewables announced by the Prime Minister earlier this year may also be allocated to the early deployment of offshore technologies.

 There are no sanctions against Turkey. There is little evidence to show that the economy in south-east Anatolia has suffered as a result of sanctions against Iraq. The United Kingdom firmly supports Turkish economic reform through institutions such as the IMF and the European Commission. We believe implementation of economic and structural reforms should help raise market confidence in Turkey and improve the long-term prosperity of the Turkish people.

 This is a matter for the Lord Chancellor's Department; however, I understand that the position is as follows: there are conventions governing functions held in the City of London where the Lord Mayor of London takes precedence immediately after the Sovereign.
<P>

<a name="11022w05.html_para8">Outside the City, guidance will vary depending on the nature or location of the function. In more ceremonial events with a wider or national basis that include members of the Royal Family, the Lord Mayor may continue to have precedence over the Mayor of London, but, in other events, where no member of the Royal Family is present, the event organisers will take into account the nature of the function and the necessary courtesies.

 The Department for International Development (DFID) has pledged more than &#163;4 million to help establish the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) conflict prevention and recovery unit in Jakarta. The unit will build up capacity in conflict reduction and recovery in the provinces torn apart by ethnic conflict, particularly in north Maluku. These new initiatives will complement DFID-supported humanitarian relief programmes by addressing the causes underlying conflict&#151;abuse of power, alienation and loss of access to and control of resources essential for every day life. We will continue to work with the Indonesian authorities and UNDP to promote reconciliation, begin wider reconstruction work and to offer practical assistance where appropriate.

Friend the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions is currently considering the responses to his consultation on a revised draft of Planning Policy Guidance Note 17 on Sport, Open Spaces and Recreation. My Department is working closely with the DTLR to ensure that the new PPG 17 is robust in strengthening and extending our protection of school and community playing fields, and assists local authorities in planning constructively for sport and recreation for the future.

 The Government have issued for consultation draft regulations giving effect to the requirements of the EC Landfill Directive, including those banning the landfilling of whole and shredded tyres. The consultation period closes on 26 October 2001 and we will then move to lay the regulations before Parliament as soon as possible. In advance of the regulations coming into effect the Environment Agency is using its existing powers under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations 2000 to apply the Directive's requirements to any permits issued in the interim.

<a name="11022w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 October 2001]:</i> Under the Utilities Act 2000, the Government will set an Energy Efficiency Commitment obligation for electricity and gas suppliers for the period 1 April 2002 until 31 March 2005. Under the commitment, electricity and gas suppliers will be required to achieve targets for the promotion of improvements in energy efficiency. There will be a focus on helping lower income consumers, including those in receipt of income and disability benefits.

 The UK Government and Devolved Administrations published the consultation paper "Managing radioactive waste safely" on 12 September. People in the UK must have a central role in the decision on how radioactive waste is managed in the future. The paper proposes a programme of national debate and information gathering leading to decisions on the long-term management of radioactive waste, and explores how best we should organise that programme. It does not invite comments at this stage on specific options&#151;such as storage or disposal&#151;but it does summarise the main options, so people can always comment on them if they want to.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will list for each county of England the disposal sites which are <i>(a)</i> available and <i>(b)</i> being used for the disposal of foot and mouth disease (i) carcases and (ii) ash from pyres.  [5261]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11022w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Over the last few weeks most carcases resulting from new cases of foot and mouth disease have been disposed of by rendering. The two rendering plants that are currently available for use for the disposal of foot and mouth disease carcases are in Bradford (West Yorkshire) and Lancaster (Lancashire). The extent to which these plants are used depends on the demand for disposal on any given day.
<P>

<a name="11022w08.html_para0">On the few occasions when disposal demand has exceeded available rendering capacity use has been made of licensed landfill and mass burial sites. The only licensed landfill and mass burial sites that have been used for the disposal of foot and mouth disease carcases in recent weeks are those at Hespin Wood in Cumbria and Tow Law in Co. Durham. Other licensed landfill sites and mass burial sites could be contracted or brought back into operation should additional disposal capacity be required.
<P>

<a name="11022w08.html_para1">Wherever possible, ash from pyres is being buried on site. Where this is not possible it is being disposed of in licensed landfill. The landfill sites in England that are being used for this purpose are at Bishops Cleeve (Gloucestershire), Calvert (Buckinghamshire), Hespin Wood (Cumbria) and Workington (Cumbria). There are no plans to use any other landfill sites for ash disposal.

<a name="11022w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 October 2001]:</i> The Countryside Stewardship Scheme is already open to organic farmers. Because it is a discretionary scheme, applications are assessed and approved on the basis of the environmental benefits they can offer. This assessment process takes account of the potential additional benefits of combining Countryside Stewardship with organic farming and as a result many organic farmers have been accepted into the Scheme. Officials are also conducting a review of agri-environment schemes which will consider a range of issues including the structure of existing schemes and the interrelationship between them. The review will report in 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what plans she has for reversing the decline in the farmland bird population by 2020;  [8169]

<P>
<P>
<a name="11022w08.html_spnew5"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The farmland bird index, based on populations of 20 species, increased last year, though this may have been partly due to the relatively mild preceding winter. Expert advice is that it will take several years before we could expect to see the effects of current policy measures. Nevertheless, analysis of the underlying trend by the British Trust for Ornithology has shown that the rate of population decline is now slowing.
<P>

<a name="11022w08.html_para2">A number of existing policy measures will help this Department to achieve its Public Service Agreement (PSA) target to reverse the long-term decline in the number of farmland birds by 2020&#151;not least the significant expansion of our agri-environment schemes under the England Rural Development Programme. In particular, we are very hopeful that next year's national rollout of arable Countryside Stewardship options, based on the successful pilot scheme, will prove beneficial for birds.
<P>

<a name="11022w08.html_para3">The reasons for the decline in farmland bird numbers are complex. That is why we have commissioned research from the British Trust for Ornithology, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Oxford University to help us identify more precisely what needs to be done to deliver the PSA target.

 The criteria for proposed strategic health authorities are that they should have a population of around 1.5 million, their boundaries should be coterminous with an aggregate of local authority boundaries and their boundaries should not cut across Government office for the regions boundaries. It has also been determined that boundaries should reflect clinical networks as closely as possible. The criteria for strategic health authority boundaries are in line with the principles set out in the Modernising Government White Paper. We have no plans to review the criteria for strategic health authority boundaries.

 <i>[holding answer 19 October 2001]:</i> The pilot study of liquid based cytology and human papilloma virus testing as triage for women with mild or borderline abnormalities began in April 2001, as planned. Women with a mild or borderline screening result in the pilot will have an HPV test in accordance with the pilot protocol. In 2000&#150;01, the number of cervical screening tests and the percentage of tests with a mild or borderline result for the three pilot site areas are shown in the table.

 The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE)&#151;not the Government&#151;has responsibility for determining the number and location of higher education places, including those for veterinary medicine. The funding council takes demand for veterinary surgeons into account in setting the number of places.

<a name="11022w10.html_para5">In recent years, there has been a steady rise in the number of students entering veterinary schools, from 430 in 1991 to 660 in 2000, as well as a similar rise in the numbers graduating, from 360 to 560 over the same period.

<P>
<a name="11022w10.html_spnew11"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 This information is not available to the Department. It is for college corporations to determine spending priorities within the overall need to balance their budgets. Colleges' ability to pay the recommended pay rise will depend on their overall financial health, their success in recruiting and retaining students (which will affect the funding they receive from the Learning and Skills Council) and the level of their staff costs in relation to overall college expenditure.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what factors relating to the responsibilities and duties of teachers in sixth-form colleges underlie the pay differential with further education colleges.  [6681]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11022w10.html_spnew12"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The pay, terms and conditions of staff in general further education and sixth-form colleges are matters for college corporations and management to determine in consultation with the relevant unions. I understand that over the years since incorporation, sixth-form colleges have sought to mirror pay and conditions arrangements in schools, because staff responsibilities are similar in both. In general FE colleges, 



<P>
<P><I>22 Oct 2001 : Column: 35W</I><P>
a wider range of pay and conditions arrangements now exist, reflecting the diverse learning needs of colleges local communities and colleges individual decisions on implementing the nationally recommended pay settlement each year.
<P>

<a name="11022w10.html_para6">In addition, sixth-form colleges have, this year, been given proportionately a larger share of teaching pay initiative (TPI) funding than general FE colleges. This honours a commitment given by the former Secretary of State, identifying the scale of implementation of TPI in sixth-form colleges in 2001. Under TPI, sixth-form colleges should, this year, be able to replicate the &#163;2,000 threshold payments that apply in schools; and in general FE, colleges should be able to pay at least &#163;1,000 and up to &#163;2,000 to eligible staff, with up to &#163;4,000 to a minority of their most able staff.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what plans she has to promote increased access to training and development in renewable energy-related disciplines in higher education.  [7358]<P>

<P>
<a name="11022w11.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Higher education institutions are autonomous organisations which design and determine their own courses, in response to market forces. A substantial number of higher education institutions are offering a range of courses in renewable energy-related disciplines in the current academic year. The Government are keen to promote an interest in science and technology generally. Science Year (September 2001 to August 2002) will raise the profile of science and increase pupil engagement with science, particularly in the 10&#150;19 age range. It aims to boost the take-up of science subjects post-16.

<P>

 The role of the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) is to plan, fund, monitor and improve the quality of post-16 learning up to higher education. We expect the LSC to encourage more young people to stay in learning; increase demand for learning among adults; and improve the skills of the work force. We also expect it to drive up standards in teaching, learning and training and to build equality of opportunity into everything it does.

 All maintained schools, including schools with sixth-forms, receive almost all their public funding from their local education authority. The bulk of such funding&#151;including support from the school standards grant&#151;is delegated to a school through the authority's fair funding scheme. Schools also receive funding, via their local education authority, under the standards fund, and the teachers threshold pay grant. Individual schools may also receive support from a wide range of other sources, including the national lottery, and private sector contributions.

 The Government are fully committed to helping the estimated one in five adults who do not have adequate literacy skills. The Prime Minister launched "Skills for Life", the national strategy for improving adult literacy and numeracy in England on 1 March. New national standards, a core curriculum for literacy and numeracy, teacher training and national tests in literacy and numeracy are all now available nationally after a successful pilot. A national promotional campaign is currently boosting demand. We are working across Government and with key partner organisations to ensure that all those who can help adults with literacy and numeracy skills needs are able to do so. Our target is that 750,000 adults improve their literacy and numeracy by 2004. More than 70,000 adults have already gained literacy and numeracy qualifications since April 2001.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11022w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Many teachers are qualified in more than one subject. What subjects they should be asked to teach is a matter for the professional judgment of the headteachers concerned. The latest figures available show that in 1996&#150;97, 82 per cent. of secondary school teachers held an appropriate subject qualification.

<P>
<a name="11022w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 This information is not collected centrally. In order to apply for a golden hello, an eligible teacher must have completed induction successfully and be employed in a relevant post in a maintained school or a maintained or non-maintained special school in England on a permanent contract or a fixed-term contract of one term or more.

 The Social Exclusion Unit is part of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and reports to the Prime Minister through the Deputy Prime Minister. Its remit is to help improve Government action to reduce social exclusion by producing "joined-up solutions to joined-up problems". It works mainly on specific projects, chosen following consultation with other Ministers and suggestions from interested groups. The unit's remit covers only matters which are the responsibility of the Government, but it keeps in close touch with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland devolved Administrations, which have their own strategies for tackling social exclusion.

<a name="11022w13.html_para0">On 1 October 2001 there were 52 members of staff in the SEU. The administration and pay costs for the unit for the past five years are as follows:

<P>
<P>
<a name="11022w13.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Wills: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="11022w13.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 I have been informed by the Justices' Clerk for the area that the total arrears of maintenance orders at Peterborough Magistrates' Court appears to be &#163;6,185,950. However, it is possible that this figure is overstated, as maintenance may have been paid direct between parties, parties may have reconciled, re-married or one of the parties may have died.

The remaining four have been returned to the court because the defaulters cannot be traced.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11022w13.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The Freedom of Information Act received Royal Assent on 30 November 2000 and, by section 87(3), has to be fully implemented by the 30 November 2005. However, the Government are committed to the implementation of the Act before this deadline. The Lord Chancellor also has a statutory duty to report to Parliament by 29 November this year on his proposals for bringing fully into force those provisions that are not yet fully in force.
<P>

<a name="11022w13.html_para6">In his appearance before the Home Affairs Select Committee on 16 October, the Lord Chancellor outlined the two possible approaches to implementation. A 'Sector by Sector' approach would mean implementing the Act in stages, by type of public authority, with publications schemes provisions implemented first and the right of access following, say, six months later. The alternative is a 'Big Bang' approach, under which the publication scheme provisions are rolled out, by type of public authority, and the individual's right of access to all public authorities commences at the end of that complete process. The Government are considering which of these two to adopt.
<P>

<a name="11022w13.html_para7">Some parts of the Act are already in force. The provisions of the Act set out in section 87(1) came into force on 30 November 2000, when the Act was passed. These provisions relate mainly to the work of the Information Commissioner, the coverage of the Act and Order making powers. The provisions set out in section 87(2) of the Act came into force on 30 January 2001. These relate primarily to the creation of the post of the Information Commissioner. Provisions relating to the amendment of the Data Protection Act, as provided for by the Freedom of Information Act, were also brought into force by Commencement Order in Statutory Instrument 2001 Number 1637, on 30 April 2001.
<P>

<a name="11022w13.html_para8">The Government are determined that the time taken to implement the Act will be used well to ensure that the Act is a success. There is a parallel to be drawn here between the Freedom of Information Act and the Human Rights Act. Time was taken to ensure that the Human Rights Act was implemented properly. This meant that, despite criticism at the time, the implementation of the Act has been considered a success.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11022w13.html_wqn11"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department how many officials and what reasons are deployed to secure implementation of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 <i>(a)</i> in his Department and <i>(b)</i> elsewhere in Government.  [6024]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11022w13.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 Within the Lord Chancellor's Department there is a Division devoted to central policy on Freedom of Information and Data Protection. It has a delegated budget of approximately &#163;310,000 for work on Freedom of Information. In addition, the Division has allocated a grant in aid, for this financial year, to the Information Commissioner of &#163;2 million, for her responsibilities under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (the Act).
<P>

<a name="11022w13.html_para9">Each Public Authority is responsible for the implementation of the Act within its own jurisdiction and therefore, there are a number of staff involved in the

<P><I>22 Oct 2001 : Column: 48W</I><P>
implementation of the Act in the Lord Chancellor's Department itself, as well as in its Agencies and Associated Offices, as there are in other Departments.
<P>

<a name="11022w13.html_para10">Key staff in each Department include the Management Board level 'Champion' for Freedom of Information and the Implementation Team Leader. Records and knowledge management staff, including website staff, are also involved, as are many others throughout the Department. The work is clearly an aspect of many people's jobs; for example, the Home Office has in the region of 50 staff involved in the implementation as some part of their job.

 The national Trial Issues Group carried out a review of the reducing delay measures in November of last year, in so far as they affected the magistrates' courts.

<a name="11022w14.html_para0">The Government's strategy to reduce unnecessary delay in the criminal justice system is being taken forward at a national level by the Trial Issues Group through its Reducing Delays Sub Group (RDSG). To achieve this, RDSG established a National Implementation Team consisting of officials from the Home Office, Lord Chancellor's Department, Crown Prosecution Service, police, Law Society and the Court Service. A "post- Narey" evaluation of most of the new procedures has now been carried out and an action plan based on its recommendations has been drawn up.

However, the foreign court is not under a duty to return the child if he objects to being returned and has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of his views.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what is the budget for <i>(a)</i> the current fiscal year and <i>(b)</i> the next five years for (i) the UK and (ii) Scotland for departmental spending by his Department.  [9398]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11022w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 The information requested is not available. Expenditure plans are published in Departmental Reports. However, the Department for Work and Pensions was created only in 2001&#150;02 and the first Parliamentary Estimate covering the whole of the new Department is still being prepared.
<P>

<a name="11022w15.html_para0">Departmental plans are not broken down by region but information regarding expenditure in Scotland up to the 1999&#150;2000 fiscal year is available in HM Treasury's publication "Public Expenditure Statistical Analysis (PESA) (2001&#150;02)" published in April 2001 under Command Number 5101.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11022w15.html_spnew1"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 There is currently a shortage of examining doctors in south Cumbria. This has resulted in some delay, particularly during the summer months, to the processing of claims for Disability Living Allowance and Attendance Allowance. SchlumbergerSema Medical Services are actively recruiting new doctors to address the shortage, and as a temporary measure they are planning to use doctors from the North East to cover Cumbria if necessary.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11022w15.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will list the targets set for reducing fraud in respect of each benefit and payment for which his Department has responsibility; and what progress has been made towards meeting such targets in each year since 1997.  [7476]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11022w15.html_spnew3"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 We have put in place a comprehensive strategy to reduce fraud across all benefits. We are tightening up the system to make sure that from the very first claim, the right benefits are going to the right people.
<P>

<a name="11022w15.html_para1">We have firm targets for reducing the amount of fraud and error in Income Support and Jobseeker's Allowance. The Department is aiming for a reduction of 25 per cent. by 2004 and 50 per cent. by 2006. We have met our first milestone, which was to achieve a 10 per cent. reduction by March 2002, 18 months ahead of schedule.
<P>

<a name="11022w15.html_para2">This year we have also introduced for the first time a continuous measure of the level of Housing Benefit fraud. We will consider the appropriateness and scope for setting targets for reducing the level of incorrectness in Housing Benefit in the light of the results of this exercise.
<P>

<a name="11022w15.html_para3">We have also introduced an ongoing programme of National Benefit Reviews looking at other benefits. These reviews are providing us with the intelligence we need to focus our efforts where it is needed most.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will change the limit on earnings which can be retained by people on Jobseeker's Allowance; and if he will make a statement.  [8097]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11022w15.html_spnew4"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The earnings disregards for Jobseeker's Allowance are aimed at achieving a balance between encouraging people to undertake part-time work and remain in touch with the labour market, while not creating disincentives for them to take up full-time work and become independent.
<P>

<a name="11022w15.html_para4">We keep the levels of earnings disregards under review. The higher earnings disregard for lone parents, people with disabilities and certain other special groups was increased by a third to &#163;20 from April this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (1) how much money in excess of the proper calculation was paid by parents without care through the Child Support Agency to parents with care, in the last year for which information is available; and how much was recovered from parents with care and repaid to parents without care;  [7718]

<UL>(2) how much money below the proper calculation was paid by parents without care through the Child Support Agency to parents with care, in the last year for which information is available; and how much was subsequently recovered and paid over.  [7719]<P></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Mr Smith is unavailable and therefore I am writing to you on his behalf.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You asked how much money in excess of the proper calculation was paid by parents without care through the Child Support Agency to parents with care in the last year for which information is available; and how much was recovered from parents with care and repaid to parents without care.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You also asked how much money below the proper calculation was paid by parents without care through the Child Support Agency to parents with care in the last year for which information is available; and how much was subsequently recovered and paid over.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The information you have requested in the first part of each question is not available, as it is not collected in the format you have asked for.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>However in the Agency's Annual Report and Accounts for 2000&#150;2001, the National Audit Office estimated that overpayments amounted to &#163;5 million and underpayments amount to &#163;12 million. These figures were based on a sample of cases examined, which showed underlying errors in maintenance assessments and incorrect adjustments to customer's accounts. Any variance of 1p of more in an assessment is regarded as an error.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Where we identify that maintenance has been overpaid it will be refunded to the parent without care either in a lump sum or by means of reducing the ongoing liability that has to be paid.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Maintenance that was due but not paid is collected as arrears. Arrears are either received in lump sum payments or agreements are reached where by a parent without care will pay an amount towards arrears in addition to regular maintenance. If no agreement can be reached between the Agency and the parent without care then that case would undergo enforcement action.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The value of the excess of the proper calculation and also that, which is below the proper calculation, is not collected in the format you have requested to enable me to give a definitive reply.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (1) what the effect will be on incapacity benefit entitlement where an incapacity benefit recipient applies for employment following a work-focused interview; and if the fact that the application has been made will have any bearing on the outcome of any future personal capability assessment;  [9534]

(3) what is the level of contact anticipated between a work-focused interviewer and a Personal Capability Assessment Medical Examiner for incapacity benefit claimants in pilot areas for the Social Security (Jobcentre Plus Interviews) Regulations 2001; and if records from work-focused interviews will be available to PCA examiners;  [9536]

(4) if the outcome of a work-focused interview for incapacity benefit claimants in pilot areas for the Social Security (Jobcentre Plus Interviews) Regulations 2001 will influence the timing of a claimant's next personal capability assessment.  [9537]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11022w16.html_spnew1"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Work-focused Interviews will enable people receiving incapacity benefit to consider their work options and to hear about the practical and financial help that is available to them. An application for employment following a work-focused interview will have no effect on an individual's incapacity benefit entitlement and would 



<P>
<P><I>22 Oct 2001 : Column: 58W</I><P>
not in itself have any bearing on the outcome of any future personal capability assessment. If a person subsequently took up employment, entitlement might be affected as there are limited circumstances in which people can work and receive incapacity benefit.
<P>

<a name="11022w16.html_para0">A person receiving incapacity benefit will be able contact their Personal Adviser at any time following the work-focused interview to seek further advice and guidance. They will also be able to take part in a review when they will have the opportunity to discuss the help and benefits available to them.
<P>

<a name="11022w16.html_para1">There will be no direct contact between the work- focused interview Personal Adviser and the personal capability assessment medical examiner. Records from the work-focused interview will not be available to personal capability assessment medical advisers.

<a name="11022w16.html_para2">The participation of a person in a work-focused interview will not generally influence the timing of their next personal capability assessment. However, if at the time their Personal Adviser considers it appropriate they may refer the case to a benefit decision-maker to consider if, in the light of all the available evidence, a personal capability assessment is required.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11022w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The Government have no plans to introduce legislation on integration in the manner described because there is no evidence that UK occupational pension schemes take increases in the state pension into account once state pension age has passed and the scheme member's pension is in payment.
<P>

<a name="11022w16.html_para3">It is estimated that in 1995 there were approximately 7,200 private sector defined benefit occupational pension schemes which operated integration of some form to allow for the receipt of state pensions.
<P>

<a name="11022w16.html_para4">In general, the integration adjustment is applied at the time the pension is calculated at the date of retirement or at the date state pension age is reached. The resultant pension is then subject to increases according to the scheme rules. These rules also protect against the level of pension from being reduced once it has gone into payment.

 <i>[holding answer 18 October 2001]:</i> Local exchange and trading schemes and time banks are dealt with in accordance with normal tax rules. If a trader offers their goods and services through a LETS scheme then they will be liable to tax in the normal way. If a non-trader offers their goods and services through a scheme there should be no liability. Since both the form of these organisations and of members' activities within them can differ, anyone in doubt about the tax position, whether organiser or scheme member, should check the position with the local tax office.

<P>
<a name="11022w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 To protect the competitiveness of UK industry, sectors covered by the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive Parts A1 and A2 are able to get 80 per cent. reductions in the Climate Change Levy in exchange for entering negotiated agreements with the Government to deliver specific energy reductions. These agreements cover the main energy intensive sectors exposed to international competition.

 In general terms improvements to domestic property constitute personal expenditure and are not tax deductible.

 In the November 2000 pre-Budget report, the Chancellor proposed that he would extend the small car engine VED rate for cars first registered before 1 March 2001 from 1200cc to 1500cc, subject to consultation. The Chancellor also proposed that this extension should have immediate effect, as if starting in November 2000.

 Under the Green Fuel Challenge launched in November last year, the Government announced that, subject to EU agreement, it will introduce a new duty rate for biodiesel in Budget 2002, at 20p per litre below the rate for ultra-low sulphur diesel.

 In the year ending 31 March 2001, the Personal Investment Authority Ombudsman Bureau (PIAOB) received 17,255 new cases against PIA regulated firms, each of which attracted a &#163;500 case fee. 13,000 cases were resolved during this period, of which 46 per cent. were resolved by voluntary agreement between each side, through conciliation or mediation, and 22 per cent. of which were found against the firm.
<P>

<a name="11022w17.html_para3">The total cost to the PIAOB of dealing with these 13,000 complaints was &#163;9.5 million. This was funded by &#163;6.5 million in case fees; &#163;2.8 million direct from the PIA; and the &#163;0.2 million balance from other income (mainly sale of publications). The PIAOB investigates complaints itself and so there was no cost to the FSA in investigating these cases.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As National Statistician and Registrar for England and Wales, I have been asked to reply to your recent questions on:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. what measures will be taken to provide accurate and reliable census data for Eastbourne (9099);</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>

<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>3. what percentage of households in (a) Eastbourne and (b) Wealden completed a census return (9098).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In answer to the first question, a number of measures have either already been implemented or will be taken to provide accurate and reliable census data. Prior to the Census, an important new initiative was the Community Liaison programme. Its main objectives were:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to facilitate enumeration and to ensure full coverage;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to help provide a source of potential field staff;</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to advertise the Census and to underline its uses;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to provide help to individual members of local communities;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to help with translations and advertising.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This, coupled with the new strategy of asking the public to post their completed forms back, enabled resources to be targeted to where they were most needed.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Despite these efforts, it was always anticipated that some people would not be counted and that the degree of under-enumeration would vary across the country. The extent and nature of such under-enumeration will be more accurately assessed than ever before by the extensive, separate, follow-up Census Coverage Survey carried out by interviewing around 300,000 households shortly after the Census enumeration was completed. Once the interview responses and all the Census returns have been analysed, we will have a definitive picture of how well we have done at Local Authority level. The sample size was large enough for estimates of levels of under-enumeration for each Local Authority to be made and will enable the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to create a complete dataset for analysis of individual communities that takes account of this estimated under-enumeration.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Information about the quality of Census data will be published on the National Statistics website and brought together in a Census Quality Report to be published in 2003.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>With regard to your second question, the target date for mid-year 2001 population estimates by sex and age for all local authority areas based on the 2001 Census is August 2002. These will include an adjustment for births, deaths and migration between Census Day (29 April 2001) and 30 June 2001. The target date for summary Census results&#151;Key Statistics for areas throughout England and Wales (including Eastbourne) is December 2002. They will be laid before Parliament and accessible through the National Statistics website.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The full census data for Eastbourne will be published along with the detailed results for all the other local authority areas in the first half of 2003; these will be accessible via the National Statistics website.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In response to your final question, I am unable, at this stage, to provide detailed information on the response rate to the Census in Eastbourne and Wealden. This will be available in Autumn 2002. Currently the ONS estimates that the 2001 Census response rate nationally will reach 98 per cent. of households.</FONT></UL>

<a name="11022w18.html_para0">On 1 October Northamptonshire police had 1,209 officers, 52 more than in March 2001. This is a record number of officers. The force also had 724 civilian staff, 30 more than in March 2001.

<a name="11022w18.html_para4">I am aware of the contribution made by DARE Programme to drug education schemes in a number of areas, particularly the strong support it has in the Nottinghamshire area.

The Home Office is currently working with the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (DTLR), the police and local authorities to produce firmer guidance on siting, visibility and signing.

 During the 2000&#150;01 financial year, police authorities in rural areas received &#163;15 million from the police modernisation fund to improve policing in rural areas. For the 2001&#150;02 financial year, police authorities received &#163;30 million.
<P>

<a name="11022w19.html_para5">Police authorities are required to publish a statement on how the money has been, and will be, spent in their annual policing/best value performance plan. This statement includes what aspects of rural policing were or will be targeted for improvement; what level of improvement was or will be achieved and how the impact of the police in rural areas will be enhanced. Police authorities can use the suite of best value performance indicators to demonstrate the improvements in policing.

 Antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) are one measure in this Government's drive to control disorder on estates and in communities. I am determined that ASBOs play their proper part in reducing crime and disorder. We have conducted a research review of the effectiveness of ASBOs during their first two years in operation. We will announce later this year our detailed conclusions on how to extend their use.

 There is known to have been some under-recording of antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) in a few police force areas.

I will write to the hon. Member when the information becomes available.

 Crime overall has fallen under this Government. The most recent British Crime Survey, which is widely recognised as providing the best picture of long-term trends in crime, shows a drop in violent crime of 4 per cent. between 1997 and 1999. But we know 



<P>
<P><I>22 Oct 2001 : Column: 72W</I><P>
from the increase shown in police recorded crime figures that level of violent crime remains too high and we must continue to do all we can to reduce it.
<P>

<a name="11022w19.html_para10">Our strategic approach to tackling violent crime is based on improving support for victims, more efficient, intelligence-led policing, more effective punishment, dealing with the causes of violent crime and tackling the conditions which breed violence.
<P>

<a name="11022w19.html_para11">Last year we gave &#163;20 million to the five metropolitan forces which account for nearly three quarters of all recorded robberies, specifically to assist them in meeting their five-year robbery reduction targets. They have used the money to introduce a number of new initiatives and to reinforce good practice. These include the targeting of hotspots (including transport routes) and offenders based on better intelligence, higher visibility of uniformed officers on the street, mobile CCTV vans, a range of publicity measures, improved recording, scene of crime management, investigation and identification techniques; youth diversion measures, the creation of safe routes into city centres, and targeted anti-mobile phone theft campaigns.

In the first six months of the current financial year, 214 claims have been approved and &#163;68,165 has been paid. As there is a timelag of around two months between authorisation and payment, a number of claims agreed in 2000&#150;01 will have been paid in the current financial year. Records of payments do not differentiate between claims in connection with lost passports and other claims arising from maladministration by the directorate but we estimate that around 85 per cent. relate to lost passports and associated costs such as travel expenses.

 The Minister of State at the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, who has policy responsibility in this area&#151;my noble Friend Lord Falconer&#151;recently met with my hon. Friend and the Leader of Nottingham city council to discuss concerns over the time it can take a social landlord to evict antisocial tenants. To follow up this meeting officials at the DTLR are exploring ways in which the eviction process might be speeded up in cases of serious or persistent antisocial behaviour. As part of this they will be discussing possible approaches with local authorities, including Nottingham city council.

<a name="11022w22.html_spnew3"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The information requested for the period up to 30 June 2001 is set out in tables which can be found in the Library. As of that date, a total of 37,105 prisoners had been placed on home detention curfew since the scheme commenced on 28 January 1999.
<P>

<a name="11022w22.html_para0">Table 1 shows the original offences committed by prisoners released under the scheme during the period, the number of prisoners convicted of each specific offence, the average sentence received and served for those offences, and the average period spent on the scheme in respect of prisoners convicted of each specific offence. The data are taken from the Prison Service's Inmate Information System, based on the data recorded by each prison. The table provides as detailed a breakdown as is possible from central records.
<P>

<a name="11022w22.html_para1">As at 30 June, a total of 1,249 prisoners placed on the scheme had breached the conditions of their curfew. A breakdown of this number showing the original offences committed by those curfewees is shown in Table 2.
<P>

<a name="11022w22.html_para2">Information on curfewees whose licences are revoked and who disappear before being recaptured is not held centrally. However, information is held on the number of curfewees unlawfully at large at any one time. On 30 June there were 77 curfewees who remained unlawfully at large. This represents less than 4.3 per cent. of the total number of revocations.
<P>

<a name="11022w22.html_para3">Details of the offences committed by those 77 curfewees who remained unlawfully at large on 30 June 2001 can be found in Table 3.
<P>

<a name="11022w22.html_para4">As at 30 June 2001, 1,801 curfewees had their licences revoked, using the powers available to the Secretary of State under sections 38A(1) and 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. The reasons for revocation were as follows: breach of the curfew (section 38A(1)(a) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991); the curfewee's whereabouts could no longer be electronically monitored (section 38A(1)(b) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991); it was necessary to protect the public from serious harm (section 38A(1)(c) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991); the curfewee had committed an offence or breached any other requirement of probation supervision (section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991). Curfewees who are charged with a new offence may also be recalled on any of the preceding grounds depending upon the circumstances of the case.
<P>

<a name="11022w22.html_para5">Prisoners whose current sentence is in respect of an offence committed before 1 January 1999 are not liable to be recalled under section 39 of the Act. In such cases, where the curfewee has breached the requirements of probation supervision or where they have committed a further offence and it has not been possible to revoke their licence under section 38A of the Act, the breach may be referred to the courts under section 38(1) of the Act. The total number of such cases referred to the courts is not held centrally.
<P>

<a name="11022w22.html_para6">A breakdown of the original offences committed by the 1,801 recalled curfewees, together with a breakdown of the reasons for their recall is at Table 4.




<P>
<P><I>22 Oct 2001 : Column: 84W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11022w22.html_para7">Table 5 gives a breakdown of the cases where a prisoner placed on home detention curfew is known to have been convicted, cautioned in respect of an offence committed while on home detention curfew, or where a prisoner is known to be pending prosecution for such an offence. Where a curfewee has been charged with more than one offence, these have been shown separately.
<P>

<a name="11022w22.html_para8">Table 6 gives a breakdown of cases involving prisoners placed on the scheme who are known to have been convicted, cautioned or have a prosecution pending in respect of an offence committed while on home detention curfew which is similar in character to the index offence or offences for which they were originally convicted.
<P>

<a name="11022w22.html_para9">The scheme is designed to ensure a better transition for short term offenders between custody and the community. Prisoners are only placed on home detention curfew after a careful risk assessment and the safety of the public is paramount at all times.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what measures he intends implementing to combat the rise in street robberies in the year ending March 2001.  [6405]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11022w22.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We remain determined to reduce the number of robberies, and have set a challenging target of a 14 per cent. reduction in robbery in our principal cities by March 2005. The rate of increase in recorded robbery fell from 26 per cent. to 13 per cent. in the 12 months to March 2001. The five metropolitan forces have been set individual robbery reduction targets under the best value framework, and have been given an additional &#163;20 million specifically to assist their efforts in tackling robbery and to enhance those targets. Almost three-quarters of all robberies are committed in these five metropolitan areas.
<P>

<a name="11022w22.html_para10">The additional funds have enabled those forces to introduce a number of new initiatives and to reinforce good practice. These include the targeting of hotspots (including transport routes) and offenders based on better intelligence, higher visibility of uniformed officers on the street, mobile closed circuit television vans, a range of publicity measures, improved recording, scene of crime management, investigation and identification techniques; youth diversion measures, the creation of safe routes into city centres, and targeted anti-mobile phone theft campaigns.
<P>

<a name="11022w22.html_para11">We are also working at a national level with the mobile phone industry to tackle mobile phone theft, which accounts for a significant proportion of robberies. In July we published a crime prevention leaflet distributed via police forces and retail outlets, and we are continuing to press the industry to enhance the security of their products and services.

The Public Order Community Cohesion Ministerial Group, which my right hon.

My colleagues in the Department for Education and Skills are contributing to the group's work. The group will be taking full account of Lord Ouseley's observations on this issue in Bradford.

<P>

<a name="11022w25.html_para0">This meeting of the Council was mainly focused on aviation issues, following the special session of the Transport Council on 14 September, which I attended. In addition, the special European Council of 21 September had called on this Council to adopt measures in the field of aviation security. I am very pleased that the Council succeeded in doing this. The Council put in hand preparations for Community-wide measures to enhance aviation security.
<P>

<a name="11022w25.html_para1">The Commission presented a draft regulation establishing a framework of aviation security measures and inspection arrangements. The Presidency reported on the work of the ad hoc group set up by the special

Transport Council, which will examine further the scope for additional measures in areas such as crew training; checking and monitoring of hold luggage; securing cockpits; sky marshals; use of video cameras, and quality control of security measures. The Council also discussed alignment of security measures with those adopted by the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC), and the need for the issues to be further pursued at the global level by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).
<P>

<a name="11022w25.html_para2">The Council agreed conclusions, following a debate on the economic consequences for the aviation industry of the 11 September attacks, on the basis of a Communication from the Commission. The conclusions recognise that application of the Community's state aid rules is the Commission's exclusive competence, and noted the limited range of financial assistance the Commission would approve. This would include compensation for losses directly attributable to the closure of airspace in the four days following 11 September, insurance guarantees for war-related third party risk where the market has failed, and possible assistance with the costs of enhanced security measures. The conclusions called on the Commission to take a position on slot flexibility before the next winter season, and welcomed the Commission's intention to open a dialogue with the US on a code of conduct on unfair competition. On insurance guarantees the conclusions called for monthly reviews with a final cut-off date of 31 December this year.

The outcome of the packages is now satisfactory from our point of view, and I am pleased that a number of the issues have been taken forward by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). We look forward, subject to clarification on some points, to a decision in December on establishment of a European Maritime Safety Agency.

 The research was conducted in a number of locations which varied in size, which had different authority types, and which are likely to be opting for different forms of new constitutions. This was to provide a broad range of different situations to inform the survey's conclusions. The Department chose some authorities that have held or will be holding a referendum on directly elected mayors, others that intend to adopt a leader and cabinet form of executive and others who had yet to decide their preference. In addition, the Department wanted a wide geographical spread of locations to be

Detailed policy proposals for long term charging and means-testing arrangements under Supporting People were published in a consultation document on 3 January 2001. A further paper, carrying forward work on this issue in the light of responses to the consultation, will be published shortly.

 All local authorities are currently mapping the existing supply of housing-related support in their area. This will provide the information to put in place contracts to continue existing services.
<P>

<a name="11022w27.html_para5">Local authorities will be asked to consider their strategic priorities for housing-related support in light of local needs, including age profile and social grouping. This will be presented as a local Shadow Supporting People Strategy in September 2002.

<a name="11022w27.html_spnew12"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Supporting People will introduce consistent quality standards across the housing-related support sector. All providers of services funded by Supporting People grant will report regularly on key performance indicators, and the quality and appropriateness of the service being provided will be thoroughly evaluated at the contract review.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (1) if he will make it his policy to ensure that building regulations limit the compartment size for single storey warehouse, distribution and storage premises;  [8229]

<UL>(2) if he will make it his policy to require all warehouse, distribution and storage premises to use non-combustible cores in the sandwich panels used in such buildings;  [8231]

(3) what estimate he has made of the cost of requiring new warehouse, storage and distribution buildings to install sprinkler systems;  [8228]
<P>
(4) if he will make it his policy to require the installation of sprinklers in warehouse, distribution and storage premises where compartment sizes exceed 2,000 sq. m.  [8230]<P></UL>

 I do not currently plan to adopt a policy, in either the Building Regulations or the Approved Documents that support them, to limit the compartment size in single storey warehouse, distribution and storage premises.
<P>

<a name="11022w28.html_para0">Nor do I currently plan to adopt a policy, in either the Building Regulations or the Approved Documents that support them, to require the installation of sprinklers in all warehouse, distribution and storage premises where there are compartment sizes in excess of 2000 square metres.
<P>

<a name="11022w28.html_para1">Guidance on fire safety measures that will meet the requirements of the Building Regulations is given in Approved Document B (Fire safety). The 2000 edition of Approved Document B suggests that the compartment size of an unsprinklered single storey retail premises should not exceed 2000 square metres.
<P>

<a name="11022w28.html_para2">The decision to limit the guidance on the use of sprinklers in the 2000 edition of Approved Document B to single storey retail buildings, as opposed to warehouse, distribution and storage premises, was based on the fact that retail buildings have the greater potential for loss of

life. This is because of the large numbers of people that may be present within a retail building, the fact that they will generally be unfamiliar with their surroundings and the levels of managerial control that can be placed on members of the public is somewhat different to that which can be placed on staff in a warehouse type building. The decision to provide such guidance on single storey retail buildings was arrived at following the undertaking of a full Regulatory Impact Assessment.
<P>

<a name="11022w28.html_para3">Owing to the recognised fact that the level of risk to occupants and fire fighters can increase with height, the Approved Document does already suggest maximum compartment volumes, both with and without sprinklers, for multi-storey storage type buildings.
<P>

<a name="11022w28.html_para4">No estimate has been made of the cost of requiring the installation of sprinklers in all new warehouses, storage and distribution buildings. This would form part of a Regulatory Impact Assessment should such a proposal be considered in the future.
<P>

<a name="11022w28.html_para5">I do not propose to adopt the policy of requiring all warehouse, distribution and storage premises to use only non-combustible core sandwich panels as this is a matter for consideration on a case-by case-basis. The 2000 edition of Approved Document B offers guidance on the use of sandwich panels within buildings. It offers design recommendations with regard to the selection of the type of panel core and its associated jointing and fixing system. It goes on to suggest that a risk assessment approach should be adopted to identify the appropriate solution.
<P>

<a name="11022w28.html_para6">The Building Regulations are applicable to most building work that is undertaken in England and Wales, typically the erection or extension of a building. Fire precautions in warehouses in use are normally governed by the Fire Precautions (Workplace) Regulations 1997, as amended, and, where the warehouse has been designated as a factory, the Fire Precautions Act 1971. Fire safety legislation is concerned with life safety, and sprinklers will be required if they are necessary for the protection of employees or other occupants of the building.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what estimate he has made of the cost to the public since 1990 of fighting fires in warehouse, distribution and storage premises.  [8232]<P>

<a name="11022w28.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 This information is not available centrally. Research into the cost of fires has been recently undertaken by the Home Office and is now being taken forward by the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions.
<P>

<a name="11022w28.html_para7">However, the current model does not allow for the cost of fires in warehouse, distribution and storage premises to be separately identified from the broader category of "fires in buildings other than dwellings".
