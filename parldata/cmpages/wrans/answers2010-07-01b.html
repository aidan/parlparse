In April 2005 responsibility for cleaning up the legacy sites was passed to the newly created Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA). These were previously owned variously by the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) and British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL). These sites have always been in the public sector and the clean-up costs are recognised as public sector liabilities. BNFL's operational facilities, including the Magnox power stations, were run on a commercial basis under contracts negotiated with their customers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="100701w0002.htm_para6"><a name="10070131000206">The NDA mission is fully funded by the public sector, through a mixture of direct grant and commercial income. The latter will decline over time as the remaining operational nuclear plants close and enter decommissioning. The European Commission approved the funding of NDA under the state aid rules and in the same Decision, concluded that there was no aid or subsidy to either BNFL or UKAEA.</p>

 Tackling the UK's record deficit is the Government's top priority and we believe that it is right that local authorities make a contribution to the efficiency savings of £6.2 billion in 2010-11.

 We plan to build on the National Dementia Strategy published on 3 February 2009 by accelerating the pace of improvements through a greater focus on delivery and local accountability and through empowering citizens to hold local organisations to account. This process will be aided by driving up quality standards through a tariff for dementia patients, better regulation of providers, improving commissioning processes to deliver greater efficiencies and through national health service and public health interventions having a greater focus on outcomes for individuals.</p>

It is for primary care trusts (PCTs) to decide locally how best to deliver the national requirements and local priorities set out in the NHS Operating Framework including the National Dementia Strategy. Local PCTs are asked to publish their plans for implementing the strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_374"><a name="100701w0009.htm_para11"><a name="10070161000103">In order to gauge progress overall in implementing the National Dementia Strategy, the Department is undertaking a national audit of dementia services. We will use the data from this, alongside information from locality action plans prepared by local authorities and PCTs in March 2010, in order to focus on where action is required to accelerate implementation of the Strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_375"><a name="100701w0009.htm_para12"><a name="10070161000104">In addition, the Department is updating the current implementation plan for the National Dementia Strategy to ensure that it is focussed on those areas that will have the most impact on the lives of people with dementia and their carers. These include; promoting early diagnosis and referral with general practitioners, care of people in hospital and care homes with dementia and reduction of the prescribing of anti-psychotic medication to people with dementia.</p>

 The Government will replace regional development agencies with local enterprise partnerships. We are reviewing all the functions of the RDAs. Some of these are best led nationally, such as inward investment, sector leadership, responsibility for business support, innovation, and access to finance, while others can be scrapped, such as Regional Strategies. Local enterprise partnerships will want to create the right environment for business and growth in their areas, by tackling issues such as planning and housing, local transport and infrastructure priorities, employment and enterprise and the transition to a low carbon economy. The Government have asked for outline proposals from partnerships of local authorities and businesses.</p>
