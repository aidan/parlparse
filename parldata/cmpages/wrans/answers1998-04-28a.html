To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment his Department has made of the change in the degree of satisfaction or dissatisfaction among service personnel relating to the clothing they are issued with over the last five years; and on what evidence this assessment is based.  [36817]<P>

<P>
<a name="80428w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The bulk of the procurement of clothing for service personnel is carried out through the Defence Clothing & Textiles Agency and I have therefore asked the Chief Executive to write to the hon. Member.
<P>

<a name="80428w01.html_para0"><i>Letter from Michael Roycroft to Mr. Andrew George, dated 28 April 1998:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your Question to the Secretary of State for Defence about the degree of satisfaction amongst service personnel relating to clothing they are issued with, as this matter falls within my area of responsibility as the Chief Executive of the Defence Clothing & Textiles Agency (DCTA).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The degree of satisfaction amongst service personnel related to clothing can be assessed by various methods including Continuous Attitude Survey, Availability, Defect Reports and other evidence from Service representatives or their personnel. In addition DCTA produces a Monthly Bulletin, a Quarterly Situation Report to all customers and holds 6 monthly Customer Days, to which all Top Level Budgets are invited to be represented, to discuss individual item problems and forecasts of future supply shortages.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Continuous Attitude Surveys are carried out on behalf of the Royal Navy, Army and the Royal Air Force by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency. A small number of questions which relate to clothing issues are included in all three Service surveys, however, only the Army are asked questions relevant to clothing satisfaction. I attach a graphical representation of the answers received to two questions asked over the last five years in the Army Attitude Survey. These graphs show that satisfaction with combat clothing and working dress has improved with time; overall availability of working dress has improved by 27% in the last three months to February 1998. A DCTA survey into clothing issues had been prepared, but it was agreed that for the time being we should rely on the Continuous Attitude Survey.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>DCTA do request that personnel finding fault with clothing send in Defect Reports to us and we record defect investigation findings under the following headings: Fair Wear & Tear, Abuse/Misuse, Design Failure, Unjustified or Justified Quality Assurance Failure. Most of the findings over the last three financial years have fallen under the last two headings, although the number of defect reports is very small in number, 187 in the last year, when compared to the overall customer base of 408,000 Armed Forces and other

<a name="80428w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Menzies Campbell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what new technology his Department is developing to assist in the clearance of landmines from the Falkland Islands.  [39358]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80428w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence is not developing any technology aimed specifically at clearance of landmines from the Falkland Islands. Various systems which could potentially be used for such a purpose in the future are, however, under development.
<P>

<a name="80428w01.html_para2">MOD sponsors a considerable amount of research into sensors and countermine technologies in support of the military requirement to breach minefields under operational conditions, as well as to open up and clear routes in support of military operations. Some of these, such as Ground Penetrating Radar, are not yet mature enough for military use.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80428w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Menzies Campbell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what estimate he has made of the number of landmines remaining on the Falkland Islands.  [39421]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80428w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 Landmines were used in the Falklands by our forces during the 1982 conflict, and in its aftermath. One British anti-personnel landmine remains unaccounted for although every effort has been made to clear our devices.
<P>

<a name="80428w01.html_para3">We have no reliable figure for the number of Argentine mines in the Falklands. Our best current estimate is that some 18,000 Argentine mines and similar devices of various types were laid, including some 14,000 anti-personnel landmines. About 1,400 Argentine mines were cleared following the conflict, before work was suspended after a number of serious injuries to clearance personnel.

<a name="80428w01.html_para4">Remaining minefields, or areas where it is suspected that mines might be, have been marked and fenced. These areas are monitored regularly to ensure that remaining mines present no danger to civilian or military personnel on the Islands.

As the hon. Gentleman may be aware, I have previously expressed my support for a single scheme and I welcome this development. Both the Funeral Ombudsman Scheme's code of practice, and that of the National Association of Funeral Directors (who operate a separate scheme for consumer redress) require members to make a basic funeral available with its price clearly indicated. Where funeral directors do not do this, consumers must report them to the Funeral Ombudsman Scheme or the National Association of Funeral Directors as applicable. I am concerned that there is not enough transparency in this and in other aspects of the funeral business and I have asked the industry to improve consumer protection.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland when she will lay before Parliament the 1997 Annual report of the Independent Commission for Police Complaints for Northern Ireland; and if she will make a statement.  [40173]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80428w04.html_spnew4"><B> Marjorie Mowlam: </B> 
 The 1997 Annual Report of the Independent Commission for Police Complaints is being laid before Parliament today. The report, which follows the format of previous years, comments on the work of the Commission in 1997, and looks forward to the establishment of the Office of Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland. I am pleased to see the welcome from the Commission for the establishment of the Police Ombudsman through the Police (Northern Ireland) Bill. The Commission contributed to Dr. Maurice Hayes' review of the police complaints system, and Dr. Hayes acknowledged in his report the assistance he had received from the Commission.
<P>

<a name="80428w04.html_para4">The Government are committed to see the Police (Northern Ireland) Bill's passage through Parliament completed, to enable the new Office to be established by March 1999. There is a good deal of work still to be done 



<P>
<P><I>28 Apr 1998 : Column: 76</I><P>
at a practical level to implement the Bill; and I am grateful to the Commission for their willing and constructive involvement in this important task.
<P>

<a name="80428w04.html_para5">The Government have no doubt that the proposals made by Dr. Hayes, which received such widespread support, and which we believe are fully reflected in the Bill, will command public and police confidence. These, like the rest of the changes in the Bill, represent the Government's determination to secure genuine improvements to policing, and to increase further public confidence in and active support for the police service.
<P>

<a name="80428w04.html_para6">The report notes that 1997 was marked by an increase in complaints made against the police, to the highest level ever recorded by the Commission. The number of complaints rose from 2,545 in 1996 to a total of 3,111 in 1997, which constituted a rise of 22 per cent. compared to a rise of 9 per cent in 1996. The increase can be explained, to some extent at least, by the large numbers of complaints arising from Drumcree, the Derryhirk Inn incident and the events in the Lower Ormeau Road in July 1996, for which complaints were not lodged until 1997.
<P>

<a name="80428w04.html_para7">I should like to record the Government's thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Commission, particularly after such a busy year, for their excellent work. I would also like to thank the staff of the Commissions, who will form the core of the staff of the Police Ombudsman's office, and are already preparing for their new task. I am sure they will provide an excellent service to the Ombudsman.
<P>

<a name="80428w04.html_para8">Government policies on policing in Northern Ireland whether about police complaints and changes to policing structures in the Police Bill, or the remit given to the Commission on Policing by the Agreement, are designed to improve the police service. We want to make it even more professional, effective, efficient, fair, impartial and acceptable; to ensure it is properly accountable for its work; and that it can command widespread community support, as the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the Police Authority, and the ICPC have themselves striven, in very difficult circumstances, to achieve. Many important changes are dependent on the development of a genuinely peaceful environment. But the history of the last 30 years shows that even while terrorist threats from disaffected elements continue, worthwhile changes can be made.
<P>

<a name="80428w04.html_para9">We now have the opportunity for a new beginning. I believe that the RUC, the ICPC and the Police Authority, who have worked to bring this opportunity about, are eager to make the best use of it; the ICPC Report illustrates this, looking forward to a changed future, with the creation of the Police Ombudsman.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what role <i>(a)</i> he and <i>(b)</i> other Government ministers play in determining the tariff structure set by the London Taxi Board; and what criteria are used in setting the tariff structure. [39458]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80428w06.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The London Taxi tariff is set not by the London Taxi Board, but by the Secretary of State by statutory instrument. The Secretary of State's decision is taken with reference to a formula established in 1980, which takes into account the various costs involved in operating a taxi in London. I announced in a written answer on 8 April 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>307</i>, the new fares applying from 25 April.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if uncorroborated complaints against taxi cab drivers are kept in their personal files by the Public Carriage Office.  [39485]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80428w06.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Brief details of all complaints against licensed London taxi drivers are kept in their personal files by the Public Carriage Office. All such complaints will have been the subject of an investigation or inquiry. Complaints are not recorded as "corroborated" or otherwise.

<P>
<a name="80428w06.html_wqn2"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions for what reasons cabs appointed by the Public Carriage Office are required to have 6-ply-rated taxi tyres.  [39486]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80428w06.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 6-ply-rated tyres are specified for London taxis by their manufacturers to ensure that they have the appropriate load and speed characteristics and adequate wear resistance, particularly at the shoulders. The Public Carriage Office requires the tyres to be marked "taxi" to indicate that they are approved for use on London taxis and are of the appropriate circumference to ensure accurate meter readings.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80428w06.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Such records are retained on a driver's personal file for as long as the individual remains licensed.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what percentage of taximeters have to be retested and resealed by the BSI and again by the Public Carriage Office during the period of the annual cab licence.  [39488]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80428w06.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 All taximeters are returned to the BSI for testing once every 12 months and are sealed to certify accuracy of the instrument. In addition each taxi has its meter installation checked during the taxi's annual inspection by the Public Carriage Office (PCO) to ensure that the BSI seal is intact and up to date, that all linkages are sealed against tampering, and that the meter as installed is registering correctly over a measured distance.
<P>

<a name="80428w06.html_para0">During 1997 the BSI tested 25,358 taximeters of which 884 failed, and the PCO tested 20,293 meter installations of which 193 failed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80428w06.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Although the legislation allows for any Public Carriage Examiner to conduct taxi driving tests, the Public Carriage Office permits only those examiners who have been certified by the Metropolitan Police Driving School at Hendon to conduct taxi driving tests.
<P>

<a name="80428w06.html_para1">The examiners are re-assessed by the Police Driving School at intervals of about five years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80428w06.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 All individuals who meet the requirements of the Public Carriage Office in respect of good character, medical fitness, topographical knowledge of London and driving ability in a London taxi are licensed. There are no ceilings on the numbers of licences issued.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80428w06.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The precise turning circle for each vehicle is a matter for the manufacturers. The Public Carriage Office (PCO) is satisfied that both types of vehicle comply with the turning circle requirements of the Metropolitan Conditions of Fitness for London taxis, namely that they are capable of being turned on either lock so as to proceed in the opposite direction without reversing between parallel planes 8.535 metres apart, and that the wheel turning circle kerb to kerb on either lock is not less than 7.62 metres in diameter.

 A London taxi has particular driving characteristics associated with its size, weight and turning ability.

<P>
<a name="80428w06.html_spnew12"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 None. There is no limitation imposed by the Public Carriage Office on the number of taxis or taxi drivers licensed in London; all that meet the necessary standards are licensed. It is up to individuals to decide whether to seek to enter the London taxi trade.
<P>

<a name="80428w06.html_para4">However, my Department has commissioned a study into the supply and demand for taxis at different times of the day and in different parts of London, with a view to assessing whether any change in the structure of the taxi fares tariff would be appropriate.

<P>
<a name="80428w06.html_spnew13"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Meters are not removed from taxis by the BSI or by the Public Carriage Office (PCO); they are removed by the meter companies or their authorised agents.
<P>

<a name="80428w06.html_para5">Whenever seals are broken they are replaced by the BSI, or by the PCO, as appropriate, in order to maintain the integrity of the meter installation. Seals may get broken during the course of repairs to the meter itself, the transducer, the driver cable or its illumination. Seals may also be broken following an accident, or during repairs to the taxi's transmission.

 We were extremely disappointed to hear of the collapse of the Farm Films Producers Group in early 1997, an industry-led scheme which organised the collection and recycling of plastic films used on the farm. It seems that the principal cause was that certain importers were not prepared to participate on a voluntary basis and that the competitive advantage thus created led to the collapse of the scheme. We are currently considering what options are likely to be most effective in this area and hope to have proposals available for consultation shortly.

 The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions has attempted to strike a balance between obtaining sufficient advice and being in a position to publicise the dangers of lead in paint and provide updated information to the public at the earliest opportunity. We do not consider that the consultations which we have so far conducted are exhaustive and we will continue to consult widely on risks from lead in all media as part of our strategic review of chemicals in the environment.
<P>

<a name="80428w08.html_para0">To date, the other Government Departments which we have consulted on the dangers of lead in painted surfaces have been the Departments of Health and of Trade and Industry, the Health and Safety Executive and English Heritage.

These are used for internal quality management purposes and are made available to external quality assessors for the purposes of accreditation to International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) 9000 and United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) standards. Quality assurance trials for suppliers of information to the National DNA database are not published but are similarly made available to external assessors. The results are also presented to learned conferences in tabular form; control tests on an individual casework basis are also made available to the defence on request.

 Detainees who are sectioned under the Mental Health Act are referred for appropriate treatment. Other detainees, who may be receiving treatment when they are released or bailed, are given a summary or copy of their own medical records. They are also given a short supply of any medication they require and told to register with a General Practitioner as soon as they are released. It would then be for the General Practitioner to arrange whatever care he or she considered necessary.

 When the award of the Casework Programme contract was announced by the previous Government, its purpose was stated to be to computerise the handling of immigration casework, and the present Government have decided to proceed with the project. The project extended to asylum casework in the same way as to other types of immigration casework. Under the previous Government, it was planned that staff cuts would help fund the cost of the Casework Programme. The present Government did not make the planned staff cuts in 1997-98 and those staff are currently deployed in reducing the large number of cases which the present Administration inherited.
<P>

<a name="80428w10.html_para0">In broad terms, there has been no change over the past twelve months in plans for expenditure on information technology in asylum casework. The Casework Programme system is not available but the intention is to use it extensively on future asylum casework.
<P>

<a name="80428w10.html_para1">The Casework Programme will allow greater flexibility in the use of resources, but the priority that can be given to asylum casework will depend on the outcome of the Comprehensive Spending Reviews.

 I refer the hon. Member to the reply I gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Linton) on 19 March 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>682</i>. The legal basis for this practice is the power of the Secretary of State under the Immigration Act 1971 to grant or vary leave to enter or remain. The practice has been an undisclosed feature of decision-making on immigration since the early 1990s, but information is not available centrally on the number of occasions on which it has been followed and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. We have disclosed this practice as part of this Government's wish to be more open than previous Governments in disclosing the way in which immigration controls operate.

<a name="80428w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Winter Fuel payments are one of a number of initiatives the Government have taken to help vulnerable people, especially the elderly, keep warm in the winter. A total of &#163;400 million has been committed for two years (97/98 and 98/99), to help pensioners with fuel bills to pay. This is the first time any Government have provided additional help with heating costs to all pensioners living in the United Kingdom who receive a retirement pension or one of a number of other qualifying benefits.

<a name="80428w11.html_para3">The making of this year's payments has been an enormous and unprecedented exercise. In order to establish all eligible pensioners, correctly identify pensioner households, and determine the amount each should receive, it was necessary to correlate data in around 15 million

The issue of these payments was completed by 24 March 1998.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To determine whether &#163;20 or &#163;10 was due it has been necessary to establish whether the pensioner lived alone.

<P>
<BR>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are aware from subsequent enquiries from some pensioners that the official records available and used by my Agency did not always accurately reflect the correct, current address details.

A further 211 duplicate payments were made to those pensioners who were in receipt of both Income Support and income-based Jobseeker's Allowance for at least one day during the qualifying week of 5 January 1998.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The total number of cases with final maintenance assessment debt at 31 March 1998, was 294,745. Information is not available on the average age of debts or the number of cases where the Agency has rescheduled debts: re-scheduled debts are those where the Agency has negotiated an agreement with the absent parent to repay arrears by instalments. The amount of debt re-scheduled (included in the above) at 31 March 1998 was &#163;328,214,264. This amount relates to 197,137 cases and equates to 47 per cent. of the debt and 66 per cent. of the cases.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>During 1997/98, the number of staff years spent on maintenance collection was 1850 at a total cost of approximately &#163;42 million. 613 of those staff years were spent working directly on debt management, enforcement and tracing (in connection with debt recovery).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Where arrears of maintenance exist, the Agency contacts the absent parent to arrange payment. The imposition of a deduction from earnings order is considered when the absent parent defaults on an agreement or refuses to come to an agreement. This step is taken as a last resort and every effort is made to secure the compliance of the absent parent before a deduction from earnings order is issued. During 1997/8 the Agency issued over 50,000 deduction from earnings orders.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If all other voluntary methods have failed, and if a deduction from earnings order is not a possibility, then a liability order is applied for. The Agency's intention in such cases is to secure maintenance--it is hoped that the threat of such action will be enough to ensure compliance.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Throughout the debt management and enforcement process, absent parents are given every opportunity to make a voluntary arrangement to pay off their child maintenance debt. The majority do agree to make an arrangement and only in a very small minority of cases is legal action actually taken.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>During 1997/8, the number of cases that were referred to Agency enforcement teams for litigation action was 17,833. The number of liability orders applied for was 2,498 and the number granted was 1,353.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency looks to use any and all enforcement methods legally available but experiences the same difficulties as other litigants in enforcing a civil debt. During 1997/8 we have been successful in registering debt by County Court Judgment in 522 cases. Where all other action has failed, the Agency has pursued cases for prosecution; between October 1997 and March 1998 a total of 15 suspended custodial sentences were imposed.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency measures its performance in securing maintenance against the target set by the Secretary of State; the target during 1997/8 was for &#163;500 million of child maintenance to be collected or arranged for direct payment from the absent parent to the parent with care. The total achieved was approximately &#163;547 million--the portion that was collected by the Agency was &#163;344 million.</FONT></UL>

 We have had successful discussions with transport operators throughout the country to negotiate transport concessions for young unemployed people taking part in the New Deal. From 24 May 1998 the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) members will offer New Deal participants 50 per cent. reductions. The concessions will be available to New Deal participants who will be issued with a New Deal ID card. London Transport have also agreed to offer the reduction. New Deal participants will be entitled to a 50 per cent. discount on most standard tickets and Travelcards on London Underground and London Buses. In addition 55 agreements with bus and coach companies up and down the country, have been signed, resulting in discounts of between 50 per cent. and 80 per cent.

 I understand that the Teacher Training Agency reached its decisions on the allocation of the relevant funding on the basis of competitive bids from providers to deliver in-service training for teachers judged according to their quality in meeting identified national priorities. The Agency has issued contracts for the academic year 1998-99. It will be considering how to take account of regional impact in allocating funding for the interim bidding rounds in 1999-2000 and 2000-01. Final allocations for these and later years will be determined by the Agency in due course, taking account of the representations which have been received.

 We have considered very carefully all of the education recommendations of the Task Force report. Alcohol education at primary school level is already included in the requirements for National Curriculum science at key stage 2 (7-11 year olds) as part of the programme of study covering aspects of drug education. The new curriculum for teacher training requires all teachers to address pupils' personal, moral and social development; and because of the National Curriculum requirements for drug education, all primary school teachers and secondary school science teachers will be trained in it. We continue to encourage local education authorities and individual schools to improve their coverage of alcohol issues.

Best value will cover all local services and will, in due course, replace the existing compulsory competitive legislation which applies to only some local services.

 <i>[holding answer 20 April 1998]:</i> The Museum of London Archaeological Service (MOLAS) was commissioned by British Gas, the original owners of the site, to produce an assessment of the area of the site now occupied by the Dome. This report was issued in 1993 and concluded that this was not a site of prime archaeological significance. English Partnerships, the Government's urban regeneration agency and current owners of the site, have appointed MOLAS to carry out a watching brief during the works on site. This activity is on-going.

 The Department of Health's independent Committee on Carcinogenity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COC) reviewed the available data on breast cancer in women and levels of lindane in serum and breast fat tissue in 1995. The Committee concluded that there was no clear evidence of an association between serum and fat levels of lindane and breast cancer at the present time, and recommended that the

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will estimate the amount of money spent by the Government on research <i>(a)</i> based on the hypothesis that the only factor in BSE causation is prion protein transmitted via contaminated foodstuffs and <i>(b)</i> examining other possible hypotheses for BSE causation and other contributory factors.  [39362]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80428w14.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Funding on Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE) related research across all Government Departments is expected to be about &#163;69 million during the three year period 1997-98 to 1999-2000. The national research effort is co-ordinated via the Joint TSE R&D Funders Co-ordination Group on whose figures this reply is based.
<P>

<a name="80428w14.html_para1">As the causative agents responsible for TSE diseases are unknown, most of the research programme makes no assumptions on this point, but rather tries to establish what the causative agents and associated factors are, how they may be identified, how they are transmitted, what is the pathogenesis of the disease caused, how many cases of each TSE disease will occur and over what timescale. Whatever the causative agent is eventually shown to be, the most robust epidemiological evidence to date indicates that the most significant route of transmission to cattle was via contaminated feed.
<P>

<a name="80428w14.html_para2">The following figures have been derived from information on TSE research funding across all Government departments. The majority of projects are not based on a single premise of cause; those which relate to identifiable causes, other than the prion hypothesis, or the investigation of causal and transmission mechanisms are included in these figures.
<P>

<a name="80428w14.html_para3">In 1997-98 alone the total Government spend on TSE research was estimated at &#163;18.82 million of which &#163;3.25 million involved investigation of causal and transmission mechanisms. The projected spend for 1998-99 is &#163;23.27 million of which &#163;3.23 million is so far allocated to this type of research.

 Last October we provided an additional &#163;269 million to the National Health Service in England for use in the 1997-98 financial year. As part of this programme, nearly 1,500 initiatives were funded to ease pressures on the health and social care system during the winter period.

 Health authority based figures show that 143 patients were having to wait more than eighteen months for admission to hospital on 31 March 1997. Our commitment was to eliminate such unacceptably long waiting times. Provisional management information indicates that on 31 March 1998 there were no English residents waiting more than 18 months for admission to hospital.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80428w15.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Woman-centred maternity care is an important principle of service planning in the National Health Service. "Changing Childbirth" has promoted multidisciplinary co-operation among professionals and encouraged the involvement of users in shaping maternity services. The shift of focus towards outcomes for users of services, as emphasised in our White Paper "The New NHS", will ensure that the ethos of "Changing Childbirth" is maintained.
<P>

<a name="80428w15.html_para4">The midwifery pilot scheme at Hammersmith, Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospitals is being reviewed by Ealing, Hammersmith and Hounslow Health Authority and the Hammersmith Hospital National Health Service Trust as part of a wider review of maternity services. There were a large number of local maternity initiatives resulting from "Changing Childbirth". We do not have details of those which were not centrally funded. We will be publishing a report within the next few months which summarises the "Changing Childbirth" development projects funded by the Department.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80428w15.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 We are employing a twin strategy by increasing training levels and investing in initiatives to improve the recruitment, retention and return to practice of trained staff and encourage flexible and family-friendly ways of working. We have included provision for an extra 990 new doctor training places and 1,700 new nurse training places. New student funding arrangements are being introduced which will mean a better deal for all health care professional students. From September 1998 the non-means tested bursary payable to students on nursing and midwifery diploma courses will increase by 2.75 per cent. We have also made available &#163;14.4 million to support recruitment and retention initiatives such as return to practice programmes. A &#163;1.2 million national nursing advertising campaign is currently underway. Early results show that the campaign has been running since the beginning of January and has so far attracted 12,500 responses, which is very encouraging. In addition a resource pack was made available in March to help local managers develop and expand their recruitment and retention programmes, using the momentum built up by the national nursing publicity campaign. Although the pack concentrates on nursing, the key messages cross all professions.

 We expect health action zones (HAZ) to deliver within their area measurable improvements in public health and in the quality of treatment and care. The East London and City HAZ plans particularly to address the health needs of young people, to improve access to services and to work with highly disadvantaged communities to improve their health. The HAZ partnership has committed itself to improve mental health and reduce deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke.

 Resources are not allocated to fund particular services or costs. It is for health authorities and general practitioners to use resources to plan and arrange services for their residents, following an assessment of their needs, and to make decisions about the level of resources required for any particular service.
