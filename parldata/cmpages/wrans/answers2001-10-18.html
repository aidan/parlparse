11. <a name="11018w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Robathan: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what further initiatives she intends to introduce to encourage more environmentally friendly agriculture. [R]  [4678]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w01.html_spnew0"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The Government are committed to developing a more sustainable agricultural industry. Improving the environment is one element of sustainable agriculture and we have an expanding programme of measures in place.
<P>

<a name="11018w01.html_para0">We know there is more to do and expect that the independent Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food will propose new and innovative ideas to develop a more sustainable agricultural industry.

12. <a name="11018w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many compensation claims for foot and mouth disease are outstanding in respect of farmers in Chorley.  [4679]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department has no outstanding claims for compensation for slaughtered livestock from farmers in Chorley.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on foot and mouth disease.  [4699]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w01.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 For almost two months, cases of foot and mouth disease have continued to occur but have been confined to two "hotspots" in Cumbria and Northumberland. However there is no room for complacency and farmers should continue with the biosecurity measures issued by the Department.

<P>
19. <a name="11018w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Roger Williams: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the long-term economic impact of the foot and mouth outbreak on mid-Wales farming and other rural businesses in mid-Wales.  [4689]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w01.html_spnew3"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The outbreak is having a considerable impact on farming and a range of industries throughout the UK and this is certainly reflected in the impact in mid-Wales. It is not possible, at this stage, to make a reliable estimate of the longer-term economic consequences. Work is in hand to complete a national assessment, the details of which will be made available to the public.

23. <a name="11018w01.html_wqn5"><B> Dr. Julian Lewis: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the impact of foot and mouth disease on rural small businesses.  [4694]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w01.html_spnew4"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Foot and mouth disease has had a massive impact on the rural economy including tourism and other non-farm businesses, even in areas with few FMD cases. The Rural Task Force was set up to advise on the impact of foot and mouth disease on the rural economy and the report reflects the way in which a variety of interests have been willing to work together to tackle the problems.

<P>
24. <a name="11018w01.html_wqn6"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what representations she has received on her Department's handling of the foot and mouth epidemic.  [4695]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w01.html_spnew5"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 The Department has received representations from an extremely wide range of interested parties on all aspects of the foot and mouth outbreak. Since the start of the outbreak, we have regularly consulted a wide range of stakeholders and worked closely with them in the development of our disease control polices.

<P>
28. <a name="11018w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the economic impact of foot and mouth disease.  [4703]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w01.html_spnew6"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 I am very much aware that the outbreak is having a considerable impact on farming and a range of industries throughout the UK. However, it is not possible, at this stage, to make a reliable estimate of the longer-term economic consequences. Work is in hand to complete a national assessment, the details of which will be made publicly available.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Evans: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many footpaths have been re-opened since the outbreak of foot and mouth.  [7698]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w01.html_spnew7"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The precise success in re-opening footpaths has been measured in percentage terms rather than in terms of the number of footpaths, which is less meaningful and could be established only at disproportionate cost. The latest available figures from the Countryside Agency (11 October) show that 92 per cent. of the footpath network in England is open again. This corresponds to over 109,000 miles out of a total of 118,248 miles. A list breaking down by local authority the progress made in re-opening footpaths since early July has been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="11018w01.html_para1">Most of the remaining closures are in the Infected Areas in the north of England where foot and mouth disease is still active, and where farms are subject to restrictions for disease control purposes. Elsewhere in the country, individual paths may remain closed across farmland that is still subject to "Form A" restrictions, until full cleansing and disinfection procedures have been completed and clearance to re-stock has been given. There 



<P>
<P><I>18 Oct 2001 : Column: 1267W</I><P>
may also be a few paths closed where there is assessed to be a greater risk from foot and mouth disease, such as pig units, or for the protection of specific rare breeds of susceptible animals.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w01.html_wqn9"><B> John Mann: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what support her Department is giving to the Youth Hostels Association consequent upon the restrictions on countryside access imposed to combat the spread of foot and mouth disease.  [8179]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w01.html_spnew8"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 We are well aware of the impact that foot and mouth disease and the measures to control it have had on the Youth Hostels Association's finances. I have met representatives of the YHA to discuss their difficulties and possible sources of help, and the Minister responsible for tourism is due to meet them shortly. We are considering, in the light of the recommendations of the Rural Task Force published yesterday, what further help might be made available to the YHA.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Sayeed: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will publish the cost of hiring privately owned land to incinerate slaughtered livestock during the foot and mouth crisis.  [7760]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The cost of hiring privately owned land which has been used, at least in part, for incineration of slaughtered livestock during the foot and mouth epidemic is &#163;741,905. Some of this was farmland with payment to the farmer.

<a name="11018w01.html_sbhd2"><H4><center>Animal Transportation</center></H4>


<P>
13. <a name="11018w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Prosser: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has to place further restrictions on the transportation of live animals.  [4680]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 There are extensive controls on the transport of livestock. Any further restrictions must be developed and applied on an EU-wide basis. We are pressing the Commission to bring forward proposals for further improvements.

<P>
14. <a name="11018w01.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Fallon: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what regional issues are her responsibility.  [4681]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w01.html_spnew11"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 DEFRA sponsors the Regional Development Agencies' rural programme, which this year is contributing &#163;75 million to the rural economy of the English regions, including &#163;39 million to help deal with the effects on rural businesses of foot and mouth disease.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent representations she has received from North-East Bedfordshire in respect of the Rural White Paper.  [4685]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w01.html_spnew12"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The Department has not received any representations recently from North-East Bedfordshire in respect of the Rural White Paper.

<P>
17. <a name="11018w01.html_wqn14"><B> Mr. Viggers: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps she proposes to retain and enhance hedgerows.  [4686]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w01.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The current combination of expanded agri-environmental incentives, good conservation advice and legal protection for important hedgerows is intended to ensure that we increase and improve our stock of these valuable countryside features.

<a name="11018w01.html_sbhd6"><H4><center>Fruit and Vegetables</center></H4>


<P>
18. <a name="11018w01.html_wqn15"><B> Sir Teddy Taylor: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many tons of fruit and vegetables were disposed of in the EU in the last financial year; and what the totals were for each item.  [4687]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w01.html_spnew14"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 Provisional figures indicate that some 1.3 million tonnes of fruit and vegetables were withdrawn from the EU market between 1 April 2000 and 31 March 2001. Just under 10,000 tonnes of this were withdrawn in the UK, 10 per cent. of which was distributed free or used for animal feed. Information on the quantity of individual products will be placed in the Library of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w02.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 The proximity principle set out in the Waste Strategy 2000 and Planning Policy Guidance Note 10 requires that waste should generally be disposed of as near as possible to its place of production, because transporting waste itself has an environmental impact.
<P>

<a name="11018w02.html_para0">The Waste Strategy 2000 also sets out the many steps Government are taking to encourage diversion of waste to recycling.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government recognise the importance of standards of production for consumers and the market. We therefore welcome all industry initiatives to enhance further welfare standards and to highlight those standards to consumers. Financial assistance towards such initiatives is available through the England Rural Development Programme. It includes schemes which assist improved processing and marketing of quality products from welfare friendly systems, and related training for farmers

 Our priority is to win the battle against foot and mouth disease. But we have provided for various animal movements schemes in order to overcome welfare problems. And in extreme cases, the Livestock Welfare Disposal Scheme remains in place.

 We welcome the analysis contained within the Commission Green Paper. The Commission correctly identifies many of the significant weaknesses in the current operation of the CFP; sets out those existing elements of the policy, such as relative stability and access restrictions in the six-twelve mile zone, which should be continued; establishes a convincing case for revising the objectives of the CFP; and outlines a number of useful new ideas which must be carefully examined in the course of the Review.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="11018w02.html_para3">In the last three years my Department has taken a number of steps to promote renewable forms of energy in the United Kingdom. Renewable sources of energy have received support of around &#163;208 million over the last three years under the Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO) arrangements. As of 31 March 2001, 366 NFFO projects had been commissioned, representing an installed capacity of around 934 MW (declared net capacity). In addition, my Department's Sustainable Energy Programme has invested a further &#163;36.9 million into R&D activities. Indeed, the period from 1998&#150;2001 saw my Department's budget for renewables rise from &#163;9.7 million to &#163;18 million in the current financial year.

<a name="11018w02.html_para4">We are now looking to continue to accelerate the development of renewables across a wide range of sources and technologies. We are about to introduce the new Renewables Obligation which will oblige all licensed electricity suppliers to supply a specified and growing proportion of their electricity from renewable sources. Our target for the Obligation is that 10 per cent. of licensed electricity supplies will be generated from eligible renewable sources by 2010.
<P>

<a name="11018w02.html_para5">The introduction of the Renewables Obligation will create a long-term market expected to be worth over &#163;1 billion per year by 2010. Direct government funding for the financial years 2001&#150;2004 will be worth over &#163;260 million and will fund a range of initiatives including my Department's R&D programme, extensive capital grants for offshore wind and energy crops, and a photovoltaic demonstration programme.

<P>
<a name="11018w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 This Department encourages a strategic approach to management of flood risk through the preparation of Shoreline Management Plans for the coastline and Catchment Flood Management Plans for rivers. These enable the identification of sustainable flood management options, including the possible use of farmland for flood alleviation purposes. In circumstances where quantifiable beneficial use arises, for example acquiring land for the construction or maintenance of defences, payment of compensation is possible. In specified circumstances land may be considered for payment under agri-environment schemes.

 We understand that the Environment Agency's Severn Estuary computer model is essentially complete, except for verification of results and some refinement to assess options for flood defences at Gloucester. The initial results are confirming the previous understanding of the levels of protection provided by existing defences. The results will be used to develop the Agency's Tidal Severn Strategy and to feed into feasibility studies for any proposed flood defence works.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w04.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 The Government are working to ensure that broadband services are available in all parts of the country. To this end we are developing a strategy together with all interested parties. The &#163;30 million fund for regional Development Agencies and the devolved Administrations is focused on extending broadband networks to those who are not offered access by the market, including in rural areas. The Countryside Agency also included broadband access and demand in its "healthchecks" on 100 market towns, while the devolved Administrations are carrying forward their own work on broadband in rural areas with our support and assistance.
<P>

<a name="11018w04.html_para4">In addition, we are examining the scope for aggregating public sector demand in order to speed up the roll-out of broadband services to individuals and businesses in rural and other areas that service providers currently see as uncommercial.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, pursuant to her answer of 20 July 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 584W, to the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Simpson), on energy, if she will ask the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets to compile a report on the doorstep selling practices of gas and electricity suppliers.  [8075]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w04.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM) monitors the performance of gas and electricity suppliers in all areas of marketing and sales, including doorstep selling. Where necessary it will take formal action against individual suppliers. However, in comparison with the high volume of transfers, consumer complaints about direct selling are relatively low. Between January and June 2001, the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council&#151;Energywatch&#151;received an average 0.67 per cent. complaints per 1,000 gas supply transfers and 0.63 per cent. per 1,000 electricity supply transfers. Nonetheless, given the distress that mis-selling can cause, I will shortly write to gas and electricity suppliers setting

 <i>[holding answer 15 October 2001]:</i> The tourism industry benefits substantially from spending all of the Regional Development Agencies' main programmes including SRB and Rural Regeneration. It is also a particular focus of the Business Recovery Fund for foot and mouth disease established by the RDAs largely with extra resources. With an increasing budget, greater flexibility and increased economic focus, the RDAs can continue to build on their support for the tourism industry. Figures for the total spending on the tourism industry are not available because records are maintained on a programme rather than business sector basis.

However, the total cost of administering the UK's development assistance programme from DFID's HQs in London and Scotland was estimated at &#163;80 million in 2000&#150;01, the latest year for which such figures are available. This figure comprises salary costs and associated overheads and represents almost 3 per cent. of the Department's total spending in 2000&#150;01. We estimate that this is split in a ratio of 3:1 between London and Scotland ie at 2 per cent. and 0.7 per cent. respectively.

 The World Food Programme (WFP) is responsible for overseeing food aid assistance on behalf of the international community.

Since 11 September, WFP has made some progress, having distributed around 15,000 metric tonnes of food inside Afghanistan. However more needs to be done to provide for the Afghan people and lay down stores for the winter.

 Support for grassroots sport is a Government priority. As the nation's most popular participatory sport, football has a vital role to play in increasing levels of participation. The Government's support for grassroots football has been channelled through the Football Foundation since July 2000. In 2000&#150;01, the Foundation received &#163;7 million in Lottery funding from Sport England and &#163;3.4 million from the Reduction in Pools Betting Duty, and the majority of this went to funding the sport at the grassroots. A further &#163;30 million has been ring-fenced for football in the New Opportunities Fund's PE and school sport programme.

 It is not within Government's powers to direct the Regional Tourist Boards (RTBs) on this issue as they are not public bodies&#151;almost all are private companies limited by guarantee. While they do receive some public funding from this Department (via the English Tourism Council), they are funded primarily by their members and from their commercial activities. Thus they need valid commercial reasons to choose to change their boundaries to be in line with other regional partners. In principle we would like to see all RTBs having the same boundaries as the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) and closer alignment is happening in many regions, although in some cases two RTBs share one RDA area or vice versa.

<a name="11018w08.html_para0">In December 2000 my right hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) announced the creation of a Task Force to report to Government on the nature of the problems facing regional museums and how these problems can be solved. I expect that the Task Force will publish its report shortly. The Department will consider its policies and priorities for regional museums, in consultation with Resource, in the light of that report.

<a name="11018w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 In terms of delivering and supporting sport development through revenue programmes, guidance and advice, Sport England regional offices are well placed to take a strategic lead locally. DCMS is currently engaged in the second stage of a quinquennial review of Sport England, which includes a specific element relating to Sport England's regional role and structure. I expect the review to be completed early in the New Year, at which point I will discuss its findings with the new chief executive of Sport England, who is currently being recruited, and with Sport England's Council members, with a view to implementing the recommendations on Sport England's regional presence as promptly as possible.

 No specific figures on the impact of the foot and mouth outbreak on walking holidays are available. Our best estimate to date is that the loss of revenue in 2001&#150;02 by the English tourist industry is likely to be about &#163;3.3 billion in "value added" terms over the eight month period under consideration (March to October). We will continue to revise the model on which this estimate is based in the light of the latest available data.

<a name="11018w08.html_para1">We are committed, however, to supporting instrumental music tuition. The Music Standards Fund was introduced to halt the decline in LEA music services. Between 1999 and 2004, &#163;270 million has been made available to protect and expand local music services. We have also pledged that, over time, all primary school pupils who want to will be able to learn a musical instrument. This is an important part of our drive to ensure that all pupils, regardless of their background, have access to a wide range of extra- curricular activities.

<P>
<a name="11018w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Before October 1998 there was nothing to prevent a local authority selling a school playing field if it wanted to. Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 was introduced in October 1998 to stop the indiscriminate sale of school playing fields. Local authorities and governing bodies of all maintained schools are now required to obtain the Secretary of State's consent before disposing of playing fields or any part of a playing field.
<P>

<a name="11018w08.html_para2">Since October 1998, 101 applications to sell areas equal to, or larger than, a sports pitch have been approved. These approved applications can be broken down for each year since the law was changed as follows:

 The primary responsibility to bring the violence to a halt rests with both parties concerned.

<P>

<a name="11018w10.html_para3">The British Government support the right of the Palestinian people to establish a sovereign, independent and viable Palestinian state and look forward to early fulfilment of this right, provided there is a concomitant recognition of Israel's right as a state, and the right of its citizens to live in peace with security. Peace between Israel and the Palestinians will only come through a political process which implements 'land for peace', delivers security for Israel within recognised borders, brings an end to occupation, and allows the emergence of a viable, democratic and peaceful Palestinian state committed to co-existence with Israel, and recognised and respected by Israel. Such an outcome would be a major contribution to regional stability.

 We are concerned about burdens on business and aim to ensure that regulations are necessary, give effective protection, balance cost and risk, are fair and command public confidence. It is a general principle that both parents, whether they live together or apart, are primarily responsible for supporting their children&#151;not the taxpayer. Deductions from earnings orders (DEOs) are sometimes the only effective method of collecting child maintenance from non-resident parents who otherwise fail to meet their responsibilities. Employers can take an additional &#163;1 from non-resident parents' wages towards their administration costs each time a deduction is made.

<P>
<a name="11018w12.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Reservists are employed across the full range of duties with all the services, and play an important role in undertaking support tasks, helping alleviate shortfalls in regular manpower and bringing units up to operational manning levels. At present, there are almost 1,700 personnel on full-time reserve service. There are also over 500 reservists called out into permanent service under the Reserve Forces Act 1996 to support military operations. We expect to continue making use of the reserves in these ways.

<a name="11018w12.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when his Department will reopen its life and personal accident insurance scheme to soldiers in the UK armed forces; which private insurance companies his Department has selected to cover service men and women liable to be involved in the war in Afghanistan who are not covered by PAX+ (Personal Accident and Combined Services); whether this scheme will be similar to the existing PAX+ coverage; if his Department will ensure that every soldier's coverage will be full and continuous; and if he will make a statement.  [8418]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w12.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence has in place a comprehensive package of compensation schemes for injury or death resulting from service in the armed forces. The MOD's Armed Forces Pension Scheme and the War Pensions Scheme are absolutely unaffected by any commercial considerations. These schemes provide full and continuous cover for all personnel. For those who want additional cover Ministry of Defence facilitates the services of commercial insurers.
<P>

<a name="11018w12.html_para10">As a responsible employer, MOD encourages its personnel to take out the level of cover that individuals deem necessary. However, policies are commercial undertakings between individuals and insurers. The MOD neither carries any of the risk, nor gains from any of the premium. All such schemes differ, and it is for each individual to decide what benefits, restrictions and costs are deemed appropriate.
<P>

<a name="11018w12.html_para11">Since 1989 the MOD has facilitated a commercial personal accident policy (known as 'PAX') deemed most appropriate to armed forces personnel. On 31 August 2001, 60,035 armed forces personnel (over 25 per cent.) had a PAX policy, and just under half of these took optional life cover. On 9 October the scheme's underwriters&#151;AIG Europe (UK)&#151;implemented an exclusion period for new applicants from 21 September. Existing holders are unaffected; they can carry out their duties knowing that their policy remains in force wherever they are in the world, on or off duty.
<P>

<a name="11018w12.html_para12">A PAX exclusion period was last imposed during the Gulf War and a special scheme was introduced for personnel who had not bought PAX but wished to buy insurance. AIG Europe are working now to introduce a replacement for PAX, but I am unable to say how long it will take them to achieve this. This is a commercial matter for them.

<P><I>18 Oct 2001 : Column: 1306W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11018w12.html_para13">Since 11 September, some insurance companies have put geographical exclusions on new policies for armed forces personnel (mainly for those deploying to Oman and associated area); others have increased rates. As a result, some service personnel have found themselves without the cover they desired.
<P>

<a name="11018w12.html_para14">However, at present there are insurers still offering worldwide personal accident and life assurance schemes, although obviously they are keeping rates and terms under close review, and the situation could change. Currently such schemes are available, for example, from NAAFI Financial&#151;through their website and 20 centres located in service garrison areas&#151;and from Scottish Widows through the "Forces Safeguard" Policy. While MOD does not select, endorse or recommend individual companies or products without a full 'benchmarking' process, the MOD is both currently advising members of the armed forces of known personal accident and life assurance options and also facilitating the completion of application forms, especially for those deployed.

 The 1998 Strategic Defence Review (Cm 3999) identified the importance of the UK's defence response to the potential use of weapons of mass destruction. The threat posed by chemical and biological weapons is under continuous review and we constantly monitor the preparedness of the UK's armed forces to meet it. The strategy paper "Defending against the Threat from Biological and Chemical Weapons" of 21 July 1999, cited on 21 July 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 537W, explained in more detail our policy, and the ways in which we planned to develop our capabilities further to protect our armed forces. The United Kingdom has also been active in promoting wider preparedness in this area within NATO.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The process that led to the close of the Ministry of Defence site Aston Down stemmed from the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) Study 2G1. This study recommended the formation of the Defence Storage and Distribution Agency (DSDA) and also recommended that savings equivalent to the closure of a minor depot could be made. As one of the minor units joining the new agency, MOD Aston Down was therefore considered, along with two other minor units, a candidate for closure.
<P>

<a name="11018w13.html_para2">In order to determine how best to make these savings a further study was undertaken. This study was known as the DSDA Rationalisation Study&#151;Phase 1 (DRS1). The study was wide ranging and among other things considered the MOD's future storage requirement against storage capacity and sought to identify the way in which this could be produced in the most cost-effective manner.
<P>

<a name="11018w13.html_para3">Ministers decided that, subject to consultation, savings equivalent to the closure of a minor depot could be best achieved by shutting down the MOD site at Aston Down. My right hon. Friend the Member for Warley (Mr. Spellar), the then Minister for the Armed Forces, wrote to my hon. Friend on 10 January 2000 to communicate this and initiate the consultation period, during which all interested parties were given the opportunity to comment on 



<P>
<P><I>18 Oct 2001 : Column: 1308W</I><P>
the proposals to the Chief Executive. In the event the only comments received were from the Council of Civil Service Unions regarding the position of their members. During the consultation period, SERCO, the company running Aston Down under contract, made alternative proposals for future use of the site. SERCO's offer to purchase the site was eventually withdrawn. Once the period of consultation had ended a decision was made to close the MOD site at Aston Down.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will list the level of Government financial support given to Railtrack in each year since its inception.  [8486]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w15.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In 1994&#150;95 and 1995&#150;96, when Railtrack was still in the public sector, grants of &#163;32 million and &#163;34 million were paid to the company towards the cost of maintaining level crossings. Since its privatisation in 1996, the company has recovered that cost and other costs through access charges paid to it by train operating companies (TOCs) and others. So, although no public money was paid direct to Railtrack between 1996&#150;97 and 2000&#150;01, the company's profitability in those years was contingent on public money. Some 85 per cent. of its income is paid to it in access charges by TOCs, most of which are supported by public money.
<P>

<a name="11018w15.html_para0">In future Railtrack, or its successor body, will continue to receive income from TOCs, the large majority of which will continue to receive subsidy from the SRA. In addition, in accordance with the terms of Railtrack's 2 April agreement with Government, Railtrack received &#163;337 million of network grant on 1 October 2001; and, when requested by the administrators, it will receive &#163;162 million of network grant in respect of the (October 2000) final conclusions of the Rail Regulator's periodic review of access charges.

<P>

<a name="11018w15.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The identity of the directors of the proposed company has yet to be determined. Initially, the Strategic Rail Authority, in consultation with rail industry stakeholders and existing senior management of the company, would appoint directors. Members&#151;a large majority of whom would be from the private sector&#151;would be invited to confirm these initial appointments at a special general meeting. Subsequent board appointments would be decided by the board itself. Members would have the power to remove directors and would therefore have an effective right of veto. We anticipate this process would produce a highly competent board, representative of the interests of railway industry stakeholders.

<a name="11018w15.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government have proposed a private sector Company Limited by Guarantee to succeed Railtrack and intend to agree a transfer scheme with the Railway Administrators. We plan to structure this new company so that it would achieve at least a BBB investment grade credit rating as the basis to raise debt finance.
<P>

<a name="11018w15.html_para1">The new company would be entitled to receive track access payments from train operators along with the network grants from the SRA agreed as part of the Rail Regulator's October 2000 Periodic Review and the 2 April agreement between Railtrack and Government.

<a name="11018w15.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 The Valuation Office Agency (VOA), an executive agency of Inland Revenue, is responsible for compiling and maintaining the non-domestic rating lists. The most recent revaluation took place on 1 April 2000. At 30 September 2001, VOA had received a total of 798,000 appeals against the rateable values shown in the new rating lists on 1 April 2000.




<P>
<P><I>18 Oct 2001 : Column: 1317W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11018w15.html_para2">This figure includes 632,000 appeals made to challenge the initial valuations made by the VOA at the time of the revaluation on 1 April 2000, and 166,000 made on the grounds that the valuation has been affected by a change in circumstances that has occurred since that date.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w15.html_spnew13"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 Appeals against rateable values shown in the rating lists can be made at any time before a new rating list comes into force, by sending them to the local Valuation Officer of the Valuation Office Agency, an executive agency of Inland Revenue. The next revaluation is scheduled to come into force on 1 April 2005. Appeals are automatically sent to the independent Valuation Tribunal, if they are not settled by agreement between the ratepayer and the Valuation Officer.
<P>

<a name="11018w15.html_para3">Where an appeal is made, the ratepayer must continue to comply with the payment schedule as set out in the original demand notice from the local authority. Payments may only be altered following the settlement of an appeal and following the issue of a revised bill by the local authority, or with the formal agreement of the billing authority. Where an appeal leads to a reduction in the amount due to be paid, any previous overpayment is refunded to the ratepayer with interest.
<P>

<a name="11018w15.html_para4">In general, the effect of any appeal leading to a change in rateable value will be backdated either to the date that the change in value occurred, or the first day of the financial year in which the appeal was made, whichever is the later.
<P>

<a name="11018w15.html_para5">However, in the following cases, changes in rateable value arising from an appeal will take effect from either the date that the change in value occurred or the day that the rating list came into force, whichever is the later:

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will make a statement on the operation of rates relief for businesses affected by foot and mouth, with specific reference to <i>(a)</i> the Valuation Office and <i>(b)</i> individual local authorities.  [8586]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w15.html_spnew14"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 Local authorities have discretion to provide rate relief of up to 100 per cent. to any ratepayers suffering hardship for any reason, under Section 49 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988. Usually, 75 per cent. of the cost of any such relief is centrally funded, with local authorities funding the remaining 25 per cent., to reflect the benefit to the local community of granting the relief.
<P>

<a name="11018w15.html_para6">Under Special Grant Reports 80 and 86, approved by Parliament on 2 April and 17 July 2001, the Government increased to 95 per cent. their contribution towards the cost to English rural local authorities of granting this relief to small businesses suffering hardship as a result of the foot and mouth outbreak. Guidance on the general 



<P>
<P><I>18 Oct 2001 : Column: 1318W</I><P>
operation of these arrangements was provided to local authorities in appendix (ii) to Special Grant Report No. 80.
<P>

<a name="11018w15.html_para7">This increased level of funding applies in respect of properties with rateable values of up to &#163;12,000 in 151 English rural local authorities, and up to &#163;50,000 in 37 of these authorities that are located in the worst affected areas, for a period of nine months from 1 April 2001. The level of Government support also increases to 98 per cent. in total where the net cost to the authority would otherwise exceed 0.4 per cent. of the authority's net budget requirement for 2001&#150;02.
<P>

<a name="11018w15.html_para8">Special Grant Report No. 86 requires local authorities to submit claims for the grant by 31 March 2002. Those claims will provide information on the amount given in relief. Meanwhile, information provided by the Local Government Association shows that 117 English local authorities have received over 6,500 applications for hardship rate relief related to the foot and mouth outbreak.
<P>

<a name="11018w15.html_para9">The Valuation Office Agency (VOA) is responsible for setting rateable values, but has no role in administering rate relief. Ratepayers who believe that the rateable value of their properties has been adversely affected by the foot and mouth outbreak can appeal to the VOA for a reduction in rateable value. Around 72,000 such appeals have now been received in England. The VOA is now giving priority to settling appeals from businesses that have been worst affected by the outbreak.
<P>

<a name="11018w15.html_para10">The Government also extended by three months to 30 June 2001 the deadline for all appeals relating to properties in the 151 rural authority areas. This allowed any changes to rateable values arising from foot and mouth related appeals made before that date to have effect from the date the outbreak affected the property, instead of being limited to 1 April 2001. It also allowed the effect of other appeals made in these areas up to 30 June 2001 to be backdated to 1 October 2000, or the date of any change to the property giving rise to the change in value, whichever is the later. The effect of appeals made on or after 1 July 2001 in these areas will be backdated to 1 April 2001, or the date of any change to the property giving rise to the change in value, whichever is the later.

 We have announced our intention to conduct a council tax revaluation in England. Properties will be placed into updated valuation bands according to their values on 1 April 2005, and changes will first impact on council tax bills in 2007. Revaluation should not, of course, lead to any overall increase or decrease in the council tax yield. Decisions on the band thresholds will be taken closer to the time of revaluation, when we will know more about the distribution of property values across England.

 Rural bus services supported by grants from my Department are provided by operators under contracts to local authorities who specify and enforce the terms of the contract. There is no specific role for the Traffic Commissioners on such services. However, all local bus services must register route and timetable with the Traffic Commissioner who can take disciplinary action if the service is not run reliably according to those details. Traffic Commissioners, at the request of the local authority, can also impose conditions on bus operators on the grounds of reducing danger to road users, congestion or pollution.

 The Home Secretary has announced further plans for controlled channels of entry to help meet skill needs in the United Kingdom economy. These will provide a legal route for those who can earn their living and contribute to the United Kingdom. But these proposals must be seen as separate from asylum. There are no plans to allow any asylum seeker who has made his way to this country to take up any form of employment other than the existing concessionary arrangements for adult asylum seekers where their application has been outstanding for longer than six months without a decision being made on it.

 I understand that 17.2 per cent. of the Phyllis Tuckwell Hospice's revenue costs are financed by West Surrey health authority. We are committed to tackling inequalities in access to specialist palliative care services for patients. The Cancer Plan set out our intention to support this by investing an additional &#163;50 million in specialist palliative care by 2004. This will mean that for the first time the national health service investment in specialist palliative care services will match that of the voluntary sector.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what estimate he has made of <i>(a)</i> the average length of time a nurse will need to spend per person when using the assessment tool for free nursing care and <i>(b)</i> the number of nurses required to complete the assessment by all self-funders by Christmas;  [7481]

<P>
<a name="11018w19.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 October 2001]:</i> The testing of the registered nursing care contribution (RNCC) tool has indicated that, on average, determinations take between 50 minutes and one hour to carry out.
<P>

<a name="11018w19.html_para0">By the end of this month, a total of 800 nurses in England will have undergone training in the use of the tool to enable the planned programme of determinations to be completed by the end of December.
<P>

<a name="11018w19.html_para1">The RNCC was developed with the input from a wide variety of organisations, nurses, as well as social services staff and the independent nursing home sector. National health service and independent sector nurses took part in its evaluation.

<P>
<a name="11018w19.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) if part-funders in nursing homes will be assessed under the free nursing care guidance; when the assessments will commence; when they will be concluded; what levels of payment they will be entitled to; and if he will set out for each health authority how many part-funders there are;  [7480]
<P>
<UL>(2) what steps he will take to ensure that self and part-funding residents in nursing homes receive a reduction in their nursing home fee equivalent to the NHS payments for nursing care under the free nursing care assessment.  [7388]<P></UL>

<P>
<a name="11018w19.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 October 2001]:</i> Those people who have, prior to 1 October 2001, paid a council towards the cost of their care by a registered nurse (part funders) will be classed as self funders from that date and treated identically. Those people entering nursing homes after 1 October 2001 who would previously have paid a small amount to the council in respect of their care by a registered nurse will no longer need to do so. All self funders currently in a nursing home should have had a determination of their need for the care of a registered nurse carried out by the end of December this year. The actual reductions in the level of payments experienced by this group will vary depending on the level of assessed need and how the council had previously assessed them. Information on the number of people in this group by health authority is not held centrally, but there are thought to be less than 10 per health authority on average in England.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the cost of a molar root treatment is in <i>(a)</i> the general dental service and <i>(b)</i> the personal dental services.  [8064]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w20.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The item of service fee currently paid to a dentist for providing a molar root treatment (endodontics) under general dental services is &#163;68.65 per molar tooth. Under the personal dental service's arrangements, treatments are not remunerated on an item of service basis but are included as part of the overall contractual arrangements, which, for example, may be by way of salary, capitation payments, modified item of service or block contract, the category of patient treated and the range of treatments being provided under each individual pilot's arrangements.




<P>
<P><I>18 Oct 2001 : Column: 1336W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11018w20.html_para0">Patients pay the same charge for treatment under the personal dental service as they do under the general dental service. The current charge for molar root treatment is &#163;54.92 per molar tooth.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many dentists have de-listed themselves from taking NHS adult patients by each health authority area, in each of the last six years.  [8553]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w20.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The table shows the number of the General Dental Service (GDS) dentists in each health authority whose adult registration numbers fell to zero during each of the last five financial years ending in March. The vast majority of these dentists are leavers from the GDS. They will leave for a number of reasons, for example retirement, and some are absent only temporarily.
<P>

<a name="11018w20.html_para1">Those people who wish to see a national health service dentist should now be able to do so by contacting NHS Direct.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many dentists still take NHS adult patients, broken down by each health authority area.  [8552]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w20.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Most dentists continue to treat some adults and children on the national health service. Only about 1,000 general dental service (GDS) dentists have no adult registrations at all and a proportion of these are practitioners who specialise in children's work. Most dentists ceasing to have adult patients have left the GDS, frequently because of retirement.
<P>

<a name="11018w20.html_para2">The table shows the number of GDS dentists in each health authority that have adult registered patients at the end of June 2001. Dentists working in more than one health authority are counted only once in their main health authority.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many children have died in the last five years as a result of brutality inflicted on them by <i>(a)</i> relatives and <i>(b)</i> people known to the child as a "family friend", while the child was on the at risk register of the social services department of Norfolk county council; and if he will make a statement.  [7546]<P>

<P>
<a name="11018w21.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The information requested is not collected centrally. However, we are informed by the social services department of Norfolk county council that one child has died in the last five years as a result of injuries inflicted on them by a relative, while the child was on Norfolk's child protection register. The social services department is not aware of any registered child who has died in the last five years as a result of injuries inflicted on them by a person known to the child as a family friend.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what his estimate is the number of drug misusers who were not given immediate access to appropriate treatment, upon application, in each year since 1997.  [6485]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w21.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 This information is not available centrally. There has been an increase of 16 per cent. in the number of people entering treatment over the last three years. In fact, the latest information from the regional drug misuse databases published on 11 October, indicates that the number of users in treatment was approximately 118, 500.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps the General Medical Council will be required by him to take in order to advise complainants of the availability of judicial review of its decisions.  [6967]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w21.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 None. In August we published "Modernising Regulation in the Health Professions" in which we have consulted on the functions of the proposed Council for the Regulation of Healthcare Professions. These include a power to make public interest appeals in extreme cases against individual decisions of the regulatory bodies.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w21.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Gardiner: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what percentage of responses to complainants and subsequent notification of decisions the General Medical Council has failed to issue within its own target times for each year since 1997.  [6969]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w21.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Since July 2000 the General Medical Council has set itself a series of explicit service standards for dealing with fitness to practise complaints. It reports on its performance against these standards each year. It aims to acknowledge all letters promptly and to keep complainants informed of progress but it does not hold separate performance information on these activities.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w21.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Gardiner: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what provision the General Medical Council is making to fast track complaints against doctors where <i>(a)</i> previous disciplinary action has been taken against them and <i>(b)</i> another complaint is presently being considered by the General Medical Council;  [6964]
<P>
<UL>(2) in how many cases since January 1999 in which disciplinary action was subsequently taken, including admonishment, by the Professional Conduct Committee of the General Medical Council, an interim suspension order was imposed.  [6970]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>

 Guidance on the training appropriate for registered managers for Care Homes for Older People has been given in the National Minimum Standards for Care Homes for Older People published in March 2001. Guidance on the training appropriate for registered managers of Care Homes for Younger Adults and for Children's Homes will be given in the relevant set of National Minimum Standards. These standards are presently being finalised and will be published later in the year.

<a name="11018w21.html_para0">It is an employer's responsibility to ensure that they and their staff receive the relevant training for the work that they have to undertake. However, help towards the cost of funding for national vocational qualifications is available from the learning and skills councils.

 The Department completed the consultation exercise on the draft Care Homes Regulations 2001 on 21 September. Copies of that document were made available widely to interested groups and individuals through direct mailing, the National Care Standards Commission internet site and the Department's distribution unit. Care workers were welcome to give their views as were any other interested parties. Responses were received from a few individual care workers. In addition, under section 7 of the Care Standards Act 2000, the National Care Standards Commission will have the responsibility of keeping my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State informed about the availability and quality of the services it regulates. The Commission will also be required to make public information about these services. Much of this information will be obtained through the inspection processes that the Commission will adopt. Section 31(3)(d) gives the Commission powers to interview any person employed by a regulated provider. It is likely that staff views would be sought through this power.

 Section 19(4)(c) of the draft Care Homes Regulations will require the registered person to obtain certain information regarding the fitness of a person who is working or seeking to work in the care home. Schedule 5 of the draft Regulations sets out the details of the information for the purpose of establishing identity to be provided by the care worker. The care worker is required to provide a birth certificate, a passport if he or she has one and a recent photograph. Where a person who has a passport refuses to provide that document to the registered person then an application for employment should be refused or employment terminated. No action will be taken against a provider who refuses to employ or terminates the employment of someone who has a passport but who refuses to provide that document.

 <i>[holding answer 18 October 2001]:</i> On 9 October, we announced an extra &#163;300 million investment over this year and next year for local councils to spend on community care services. This major cash investment will be used to reduce bed blocking and will help to stabilise the care home sector, giving them greater confidence in the future.

<a name="11018w21.html_para1">We, also launched a new agreement "Building Capacity and Partnership in Care" on 9 October. The agreement focuses on councils and the independent sector working together as partners throughout the commissioning process. This should promote a more strategic, inclusive and consistent approach to capacity planning at a local level.

The mobile telecommunications and health research programme, jointly funded by Government and industry, has now been set up under the direction of an independent programme management committee. The committee is currently assessing a range of research proposals, including some that are designed to look at non-thermal effects. Information about this programme can be found on the Department's website at www.doh.gov.uk/mobilephones.

 In guidance published in October 2000 the National Institute for Clinical Excellence identified that of an estimated 69,000 six to 16-year-olds in England who met the diagnostic criteria for hyperkinetic disorder, for example severe attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), some 45,000 who might benefit from the drug methylphenidate were not receiving this treatment. The guidance also made it clear that a diagnosis of ADHD should be based on a timely, comprehensive assessment conducted by a child/adolescent psychiatrist or a paediatrician with expertise in this disorder. Referrals for specialist assessment can come from a number of sources including family members, general practitioners, social workers and teachers.
<P>

<a name="11018w22.html_para1">The Department for Education and Skills (DfES) is promoting a number of initiatives designed to help schools and teachers work with children with a range of emotional and behavioural needs, including ADHD. In June this year the DfES issued guidance on "Promoting Children's Mental Health within Early Years and School Settings" which has been circulated widely. The guidance covers not only mental health problems faced by children but also the approaches schools can take to promote children's mental health. It includes a section on attention deficit/hyperactivity which will help teaching staff identify pupils with ADHD. It also includes teaching strategies to help pupils with ADHD.

The NSF includes a detailed service model for integrated falls services and milestones for their full adoption across England by April 2005. Staged implementation will help planning, and will be underpinned by an evaluation of the more detailed financial and workforce implications within the additional resources we have allocated to health and social care.

 <i>[holding answer 15 October 2001]:</i> National Health Service Estates is responsible for disposing of surplus NHS property owned by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health.

<P>

<a name="11018w23.html_para1">The NHS Plan provides for an extra 7,000 beds by 2004, with the biggest hospital building programme in the history of the NHS already under way.

<P>

Department of Health medical workforce census <P>

<P>

<P>

<BR>
</FONT>

<P>

<a name="11018w23.html_para3">It is possible to link together files from consecutive years using the doctors' General Medical Council number, to see how many doctors are present one year and not the next, and vice versa. This provides a reliable general indication of turnover, which is used in workforce models, but does not provide reliable separate figures for leavers and joiners. The main reasons for this are:
<P>

<a name="11018w23.html_para4"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Doctors do not receive full registration until they have completed their pre-registration year. For most doctors in the earlier stages of their careers, the census will show them with a limited registration GMC number in one year, and a completely different full registration number the following year. If we match these files together, the doctor would appear notionally as both a leaver and a joiner.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="11018w23.html_para5"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Similarly, some doctors in the latter stages of their career take career breaks, or work for periods of time in other sectors such as the armed forces. The census only counts those doctors working on a given day (30 September), so again leaving and joining rates tend to be slightly inflated.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w23.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 October 2001]:</i> The national health service complies with Government policy as determined by the Office of Government Commerce which requires that all public procurement of goods and services is based upon value for money, having due regard to propriety and regularity.
<P>

<a name="11018w23.html_para6">The NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency negotiated a national contract for purchasing electricity from renewable sources which was an option to the NHS from April 2000. However, it attracted an average 5 per cent. price premium. Therefore, no NHS bodies took up this option.
<P>

<a name="11018w23.html_para7">In the recent October/November 2001 contract round, electricity from renewable resources has been secured without a price premium. This should provide approximately 16 per cent. of the total NHS demand for electricity in the next 12 months.

<a name="11018w23.html_spnew3"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The report of our National Beds Inquiry (NBI) was published for consultation in February 2000. The facts revealed by the NBI supported the concept of building a new bridge of national health service care for older people between hospital and home, and supported the first national strategy for providing NHS beds in 30 years.
<P>

<a name="11018w23.html_para8">Worcestershire health authority is currently modelling bed numbers and capacity for the year ahead. The health authority's modelling work on bed numbers will take into account the NBI.
<P>

<a name="11018w23.html_para9">The NHS plan took forward the findings of the NBI report by proposing action to increase bed numbers. The Department subsequently published new long-term planning guidance in February 2001 to implement NHS plan bed increases. This guidance will help local health economies ensure that they have the right number and mix of beds in place.

 In September 1999, we gave a commitment that, within two years, everyone would be able to access National Health Service dentistry if, and when they wanted it, via NHS Direct. All health authorities in England now have in place dentistry action plans to ensure that everyone in their local area can access NHS dentistry if they want it, within a reasonable time and distance. These plans identify shortfalls in service provision and ways of tackling unmet demand.
<P>

<a name="11018w23.html_para10">Southern Derbyshire Health Authority has recently been allocated &#163;35,000 from the Dental Care Development Fund to support the development of a new practice in this area. Discussions are taking place with a dentist who has expressed an interest in practising in Swadlincote. If an agreement can be reached with the dentist concerned, this will ensure the availability of NHS services at the new practice for five years.

 The National Service Framework for Older People was published on 27 March this year. It sets, for the first time, new national standards of care for all older people, across all care settings. The NSF looks at conditions that mainly affect older people, including dementia.
<P>

<a name="11018w24.html_para3">Standard 7 of the NSF relates to mental health and will ensure that those older people who have mental health problems have access to integrated mental health services to ensure effective diagnosis, treatment and support, for them and for their carers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11018w25.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 A report by the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones (IEGMP) (the Stewart Report) provided a comprehensive and authoritative review of possible health effects of emissions from mobile phone masts. The report concluded that the balance of evidence indicated that there is no general risk to the health of people living near to base stations on the basis that exposures are expected to be small fractions of guidelines. The group was concerned that there could be indirect adverse effects on people's wellbeing in some cases and efforts have been made by Government to improve the availability of information about the siting and emissions from base stations.
<P>

<a name="11018w25.html_para0">The Report also indicated that there are some unique features of emissions from terrestrial trunked radio (TETRA) telecommunication systems that may be a cause for concern. This was addressed in a report by the National Radiological Protection Board's (NRPB's) Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation at the request of the Government. This report was published on the NRPB web site at the end of July 2001. In relation to exposures from TETRA base stations it concluded that exposures of the public would be small fractions of exposure guidelines and comparable to those arising from the operation of other telecommunication systems.
