<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="71129w0001.htm_para1"><a name="07112985000158">In June 2007 the stock of registered child care stood at over 1.28 million places, which is more than double the 1997 total, and the aim of the Government's national child care strategy for England is that by 2010 there will be a child care place for all children aged between three and 14, between the hours of 8 am to  6 pm each weekday, all year round. By that date there will be over two million sustainable child care places for children up to the age of 14. The strategy is given legislative underpinning by the Childcare Act 2006 which requires local authorities in England and Wales to secure child care to meet the needs of working parents in their areas. The Scottish Executive have committed to extending access to child care that meets the needs of working parents even though the legislative requirements of the Childcare Act do not apply there.</p>

Help is available for severely disabled people through the care and mobility components in disability living allowance and the disability premiums in the income-related benefits which have a substantially higher annual value than the winter fuel payment and are spread over a 52-week period.

 The precise characteristics and impact of an influenza pandemic will only become apparent as the virus emerges, so that the pandemic threat and the UK's level of preparedness are constantly evolving. DWP continues to be involved in drawing up and revising the UK pandemic flu plan, along with other Government Departments. Plans aim for the continuation of everyday activities as far as practicable, including the availability of sick pay and state benefits.</p>

Customer payments, which are largely automated, will continue to be paid. DWP and HMRC have robust business continuity plans in place to ensure that the administration and key services that support these payments can be maintained during a pandemic.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"><a name="71129w0007.htm_para4"><a name="07112985000774">The Mayor of London also receives funding from the Department via a total transport grant through Transport for London (TfL) and bus operators receive Bus Service Operators Grant (BSOG) which makes bus services cheaper. The DfT integrated block element of the LTP settlement was worth &#163;547 million in 2006-07, while TfL received &#163;2.4 billion and bus service operators received &#163;380 million in BSOG.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"><a name="71129w0007.htm_para5"><a name="07112985000775">In addition we can, however, identify the amount of funding allocated for regional and local authority school travel advisers through the &#147;Travelling to School&#148; project, for &#145;Links to Schools&#146; and for other initiatives such as &#145;Bike It&#146; that promote and support cycling to school. (Prior to April 2004, the Department awarded a number of bursaries to local authorities to enable them to employ school travel plan co-ordinators rather than school travel advisers.) The levels of expenditure in each of the last five years are shown as follows:</p>

<i> [holding answer 27 November 2007]:</i> No studies have ever been conducted by VLA in which cattle were fed with BSE infected material.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_368"><a name="71129w0009.htm_para9"><a name="07112985001168">Seven individual experiments have been conducted at VLA that involved the oral dosing of cattle with bovine brain tissue known to be infected with the BSE agent. The material, in the form of a suspension, was administered directly on to the back of the tongue with a syringe. These studies represent three clusters of experiments, with individual experiments within each cluster being related in terms of the objectives of the investigations conducted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_369"><a name="71129w0009.htm_para10"><a name="07112985001169">Two experiments investigated the susceptibility of calves to oral challenge to different doses of brain tissue, ranging from 300g to 1mg. A correlation was recognised between dose and the incubation period, but infection was achieved at all dose levels. Below a dose of 100g however, not all exposed calves became infected, and the efficiency of transmission declined with reducing dose. Although incomplete, data from these studies were published recently<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_370"><a name="71129w0009.htm_para11"><a name="07112985001170">Three other experiments investigated the pathogenesis of BSE in cattle, although the latest, and largest, was primarily intended to provide tissues and fluids at varying time points in the incubation period to enable the evaluation of diagnostic tests. These studies involved the sequential slaughter of cattle, and collection of tissues, during the incubation period, from shortly after exposure to the point of clinical disease. There have been several publications that have described the scientific outcomes of the first pathogenesis study, but the most recent<sup>(2)</sup> summarises all previous results. Additional data from a smaller study, and an opportunistic evaluation of data from the largest pathogenesis study, have also been published recently<sup>(3, 4, 5)</sup>.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_371"><a name="71129w0009.htm_para12"><a name="07112985001171">The last two experiments were established to enable the collection of fluids, such as blood samples, during the course of the incubation period to enable their investigation as potential targets for diagnosis of BSE before onset of clinical disease. These transpired to be negative studies, not only in terms of tests investigated at VLA but also when materials were shared with other researchers. As a result, there have been no scientific publications related to these studies.</p>

<i> [h</i><i> olding answer 26 November 2007]:</i> There are currently 1,140 cattle herds in Gloucestershire. On 30 September, 249 herds (17.3 per cent.) of herds in the county were under TB movement restrictions.<sup>(1)</sup></p>

<p><a name="stpa_380"><a name="71129w0010.htm_para8"><a name="07112985001210">We recognise that the level of bovine TB (bTB) in cattle in Gloucestershire and across Great Britain is unacceptably high, and that some areas of the country are becoming more affected. In line with the &#145;GB Strategic Framework for the Control of Bovine TB&#146;, we are tailoring our policies to take account of the regional variation of disease risk as well as reflecting emerging evidence. Working on these principles, we have introduced measures such as pre-movement testing for cattle moving out of high risk herds. We have also extended the use of the gamma interferon blood test (alongside the TB skin test) to improve the sensitivity of our testing regime and identify more infected animals more quickly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_381"><a name="71129w0010.htm_para9"><a name="07112985001211">We will continue to work in partnership with interested parties to embed and monitor these measures. We have also recently developed revised TB husbandry guidance in association with the Bovine TB Husbandry Working Group, and published two free guidance booklets for farmers, to help them prevent bTB in their herds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_382"><a name="71129w0010.htm_para10"><a name="07112985001212">Looking ahead, DEFRA funds a wide-ranging bTB research programme and we will continue to use emerging evidence to inform our policies for the future. In June, the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB published its final report which adds to the scientific evidence base. We are now considering carefully the issues raised in the report and we will work with farmers, Government advisers and scientific experts in reaching final policy decisions on these.</p>

<i> [holding answer 26 November 2007]:</i> As part of the Government&#146;s Climate Change programme, a Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) will be introduced in 2008. It will require transport fuel suppliers to ensure that 5 per cent. of their fuel sales are from a renewable source by 2010.</p>

Current high cereals prices are due to global factors, including two successive lower world wheat harvests, low global stocks and increased demand for cereals from the food, feed and fuels sectors. Growing global demand for biofuels can be expected to increase crop prices but also the supply of crops in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_398"><a name="71129w0012.htm_para3"><a name="07112985001388">Analysis by the European Commission assessing the impact of the 10 per cent.

This took into account, potential in the EU to increase production in response to additional demand, and a future contribution from second generation biofuels which can use non-food feedstocks, including waste.</p>

<i> [holding answer 26 November 2007]:</i> The Home Office Simplification Plan published in December 2006 includes a target to reduce the compliance costs arising from the regulation of animal experiments by 25 per cent. by 2010, whilst maintaining proper provision for animal welfare. Work towards the target is being taken forward in a dedicated better regulation programme. This work includes looking at how we might reduce information requirements and streamline transaction processes for applications for project licences under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.</p>

Amongst other things, we are now working on the development of a new, shorter project licence application form and project licence templates and worked examples.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_425"><a name="71129w0015.htm_para1"><a name="07112987000215">We have not separately estimated the costs to the scientific community associated with applications for project licences. However, an administrative burden on business, excluding the academic sector, has been identified and priced at &#163;6.95 million per annum. These costs include those arising from all aspects of regulation under the 1986 Act, including personal and project licences, certificates of designation, local ethical review processes and training.</p>

This followed a revision to the counting rules for recorded crime and the expanded coverage which came into effect on 1 April 1998. The figures were also affected by the revised detections guidance issued in April 1999 which formalised detection procedures, placing a greater emphasis on the evidential basis on which detections can be claimed.</p>

The Sexual Offences Act 2003 in May 2004 also altered the definition and coverage of sexual offences, including rape. All of these changes mean that detection rates are not comparable over these time period.</p>

1. It is known that for some police force areas, the reporting of court proceedings in particular those relating to summary motoring offences are less than complete.<br>
2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>

Absent of a settlement, we welcome interest shown by Turkish Cypriots in the European Parliament; and by European parliamentarians in the Turkish Cypriot community&#151;not least as oversight and encouragement of disbursement under the Aid Regulation by the Commission. It is for the Parliament to decide precisely what mechanisms to employ. But we will urge the Council to support any such initiatives, as complementing its own efforts to bring Turkish Cypriots closer to Europe, underlining what the two communities have in common, and help reunify the island.</p>

 Primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible for ensuring that their local residents and people seeking services within their area are aware of the range of national health service services available. NHS dental services are a mainstream NHS service. Any United Kingdom resident (or visiting European Union resident under reciprocal arrangements) who is eligible for NHS care is therefore eligible for NHS dental services. PCTs methods of promoting NHS dental services range from leaflets to targeted local advertising campaigns. Most also run dental help lines providing advice on how to access services locally. The location and other details of NHS dental practices can be accessed nationally via NHS Direct and NHS Choices or from the local PCT, often through their Patient Advisory and Liaison Service.</p>

Improving the range and depth of information available via NHS Choices (previously NHS.UK) is one part of this ongoing work. The NHS Choices website is currently being enhanced to include a central contact number for each PCT through which potential patients can access information about the availability of services in their chosen area, in addition to the existing dental query helpline and out of hours contact numbers. We expect this improvement to the existing service to be available later this year, and further improvements will follow next year. The site can be accessed at:</p>

It is also anticipated that PCTs will continue to promote the availability of and entitlement to services in more traditional ways, using literature placed in other primary care premises e.g. general practitioners and pharmacies, in libraries and in Yellow Pages wherever possible.</p>

 The arrangements for accommodation of junior doctors changed as a result of changes in training for doctors in foundation year 1, brought about through modernising medical careers. The change means there is no longer a need for these doctors to be resident on hospital sites.</p>

Since the publication of the framework a number of key steps have already been implemented; we have improved the data on audiology by collecting monthly data of all audiology assessments together with a quarterly census of waits for all diagnostic tests, including audiology. We are also currently piloting the collection of referral to treatment times for all direct access referrals into audiology. A good practice guide was published in June 2007 that includes model pathways for the delivery of care. An audiology advisory board has been created to support the implementation and to review progress on the key deliverables. Progress has been made on testing the new assess-and-fit technology which enables a hearing aid to be fitted on the same day as assessment. Work has also begun on the Audiology Transformation Project, which is aimed at ensuring the good practice guidance can be fully implemented and the potential gains in capacity realised.</p>

The investment has been used to fund additional staff for extra clinics at the Mid Yorkshire Hospitals Trust and also to offer further services in the community. This means that more patients are being seen, and are having their digital hearing aids fitted as soon as possible, with the majority of patients having aids fitted within 12 weeks.</p>

 This methodology combines data from a number of sources such as the &#147;Annual survey of HIV-infected persons accessing care, Unlinked anonymous surveillance, NATSAL 2000, ICH National Study of HIV in Pregnancy and Childhood.&#148;<br>
<sup>(2)</sup> From 2001 to 2003, no range is available for these estimates. Numbers diagnosed were adjusted for under-reporting and failure to access services. Numbers undiagnosed derived for England, Wales and Scotland using data from Natsal 2000 and the Unlinked Anonymous programme in an extension of the method previously described (Petruckevitch et al. &#147;Genitourinary Medicine 1997; 73:348-54&#148;). Numbers undiagnosed for Northern Ireland derived by using exposure specific factors. All cases infected through blood and blood products or tissue were assumed to be diagnosed.<br>
<sup>(3)</sup> Published estimates prior to 2005 only include persons aged 15-59. The methodology for calculating these estimates changed between 2003 and 2004 (although the key data sources were the same).<br>

 The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>
 2. <i> Secondary Diagnoses</i><br>
 As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>
 3. Finished Consultant Episode (FCE)<br>
 A FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. The figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>
 4. <i> Ungrossed Data</i><br>
 Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
 5. <i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
 HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the national health service there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>

At the request of FLO, we have agreed to provide interim funding to the Fairtrade Foundation for the next two years, until a strategic review on its expansion has been completed and a longer-term proposal can be put to donors. Our interim support will be around &#8364;1 million over two years. No decision has been made about the size of our longer-term funding, but we remain committed to expanding the fair trade sector.</p>

 DFID officials regularly discuss child labour in the cocoa industry with the Government of Ghana, which has shown strong commitment to the issue. The government has passed a Children&#146;s Act which prohibits child labour, especially the engagement of children in hazardous and exploitative work. It has also been working with the International Labour Organisation on a Programme for the Elimination of Child Labour since 2000 and is collaborating with the industry initiative, known as the Harkin-Engel Protocol, to eradicate child labour in cocoa production.</p>
