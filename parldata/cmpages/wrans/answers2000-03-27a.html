<P>
<a name="00327w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will provide further details about the additional money for fighting crime, which was announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his Budget Statement on 21 March; and if he will make a statement.  [116484]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00327w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 As a result of the funding decisions outlined in the Budget statement, there will be a significant injection of &#163;285 million for tackling crime and the causes of crime. This comprises capital modernisation funding of &#163;185 million for a range of projects and a &#163;100 million fund for modernising policing, of which around &#163;91 million is for England and Wales and &#163;9 million is for Scotland. &#163;14 million of expenditure under the capital modernisation fund has been previously announced in respect of DNA. The rest represents new money.
<P>

<a name="00327w01.html_para0">This funding will be used to step up the fight against crime in four key areas. It will speed up the recruitment of new officers; create more opportunities for local partnerships to tackle crime and disorder; provide further scientific and technological support to increase their effectiveness; and will develop and modernise the Criminal Justice System.
<P>

<a name="00327w01.html_para1"><P>

<a name="00327w01.html_para2"><i>Crime Fighting Fund</i>
<P>

<a name="00327w01.html_para3">The first deployment of resources from the &#163;91 million fund for modernising policing will be utilised to enhance the crime fighting fund. Under the crime fighting fund, police forces have been allocated their shares of the 5,000 additional recruits over the next three years. This programme will now be brought forward with the aim of delivering all 5,000 within two years. Doubling the number to be recruited during the coming financial year will cost in the region of &#163;11 million, above and beyond the &#163;35 million which has already been provided for the current allocation. A further significant portion of the new &#163;91 million funding will be used to assist the Metropolitan Police and other forces which are having particular difficulties with recruitment and retention, including the development of a national police recruiting campaign.
<P>

<a name="00327w01.html_para4"><P>

<a name="00327w01.html_para5"><i>Partnerships</i>
<P>

<a name="00327w01.html_para6">This new fund will also be an important contributor to strengthening the services which the police deliver including cutting crime. In that context, I will also want to look closely at the resources available to support the work with which the police are involved on local partnerships for tackling crime. In particular, I want to look at the resources to deal with local problems of

<P><I>27 Mar 2000 : Column: 2W</I><P>
anti-social behaviour, to improve information sharing between partner agencies, and to provide more effective training in the development and implementation of local crime reduction strategies. One specific new development in this area is that capital modernisation fund monies will provide &#163;950,000 to Operation LION. This is a programme being piloted in London which will encourage the development of integrated strategies to reduce crime and improve community safety.
<P>

<a name="00327w01.html_para7"><P>

<a name="00327w01.html_para8"><i>Police--Science and Technology</i>
<P>

<a name="00327w01.html_para9">The capital modernisation fund will also boost the programme of work we already have in hand to roll out the latest and best in science and technology to the Police Service.
<P>

<a name="00327w01.html_para10">We shall be applying &#163;40 million of new capital modernisation funding, together with &#163;6 million already set aside, to roll out a new suite of information technology applications to support police operations as part of the national strategy for police information systems. The new systems, one on case preparation, the other for custody suites, will reduce considerably the burden of paperwork and bureaucracy, releasing police manpower to their primary duties. These projects will also be at the heart of a network of information technology systems connecting the criminal justice system and improving the efficiency of the whole process.
<P>

<a name="00327w01.html_para11">We are also using &#163;25 million of the capital modernisation funding to establish a new Government technical assistance centre (GTAC). GTAC will enable us to respond to the threat to public safety from criminal use of encryption and will provide law enforcement agencies with the capability to derive intelligence and evidence from new information and communication technologies. It will make a difference between serious crime being prevented or punished and criminals going unpunished and free to continue their activities by providing techniques for lawful interception of modern multimedia communications. It will also improve facilities for deriving evidence from lawfully seized computer data.
<P>

<a name="00327w01.html_para12">The programme to expand the national database of criminal DNA profiles, which the Prime Minister announced last September, will also start delivering on 1 April. The capital modernisation funding includes &#163;14 million specifically for the DNA database, as part of the &#163;34 million envelope of funding for the DNA project which has already been announced.
<P>

<a name="00327w01.html_para13">A further &#163;21 million has been allocated for the roll out of equipment to police forces for the video recording of interviews with suspects. The full roll out is subject to the evaluation of an initial pilot scheme and the necessary parliamentary legislation. But in principle, video taping will offer the prospect of an end to disputes in court about what actually happened during police interviews and thus deliver fairer administration of justice.
<P>

<a name="00327w01.html_para14">Another significant project using the latest technology will receive funding to help the fight against property crime. &#163;4.5 million is being provided to develop the electronic 'chipping' of goods. These electronic data tags will assist police officers or investigators in identifying and recovering stolen merchandise and be a powerful

<a name="00327w01.html_para16"><i>Modernising and Developing the Criminal Justice System</i>
<P>

<a name="00327w01.html_para17"><P>

<a name="00327w01.html_para18">In addition to investing in science and technology for the police, the extra resources announced in the budget will provide additional investment right across the criminal justice system. The aim is to help modernise the system as a whole and to deliver a more joined-up approach to tackling crime. It will also help to deliver the modern service that the public is entitled to expect from the criminal justice system. The new capital investment includes the following.
<P>

<a name="00327w01.html_para19">Video links: &#163;5.3 million to allow the innovative use of video conferencing technology to allow vulnerable or intimidated witnesses to give evidence remotely and also to allow defendants remanded in custody to take part in preliminary court hearings without leaving prison. This will build on the existing pilot schemes for video links between courts and prisons in Bristol and Manchester.
<P>

<a name="00327w01.html_para20">Post release hostels for prisoners after drug treatment: &#163;5 million to allow the establishment of post release support for prisoners who have served sentences of up to a year and have drug misuse as well as housing problems. This will help in reducing re-offending by a group of high risk offenders.
<P>

<a name="00327w01.html_para21">Restructuring the prison estate: an investment of &#163;40 million to modernise the prison estate. This will enable a start to be made on a programme to provide additional prison capacity. It will include creating additional capacity in existing prisons and converting spare capacity in open prisons as a result of the success of the home detention curfew into closed conditions.
<P>

<a name="00327w01.html_para22">Joining up criminal justice system information technology systems: &#163;1.48 million to provide a central resource for the criminal justice system integrating business and information systems (IBIS) initiative. This will be used to ensure that criminal justice service and agency information technology systems are developed so as to allow inter-operability between them. Inter-operability will support the fast access to information to the key business areas in the criminal justice system, from preparing cases through the court process to serving sentences.
<P>

<a name="00327w01.html_para23">Criminal justice units: &#163;5 million to enable the Crown Prosecution Service to invest in the infrastructure needed for new joint Crown Prosecution Service/police criminal justice units. These will lead to improved quality and timeliness of prosecution files, involve closer and better working relationships so as to eliminate the duplication of tasks, and will improve the handling of criminal justice casework and get it right first time.
<P>

<a name="00327w01.html_para24">In addition to these projects, the Lord Chancellor will make an announcement next month about additional investment of &#163;23 million to modernise the Crown Court.

of the Electoral Commission will be met in advance of Royal Assent being given to the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Bill.  [116668]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00327w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 It is in the public interest to ensure that the Commission is functioning at the earliest opportunity. I have made clear my wish that it should be up and running by this November. To meet this tight timetable, some costs such as those relating to the recruitment of the commissioners will necessarily be incurred before Royal Assent.
<P>

<a name="00327w01.html_para25">Parliamentary approval to this service will be sought in a main estimate for the Electoral Commission Vote (Class XVIII, C, Vote 1). Pending that approval, urgent expenditure estimated at &#163;300,000 will be met by repayable advances from the Contingencies Fund.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he will publish the basket of race equality performance indicators he has been developing. [116669]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00327w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 I have today placed in the Library a copy of the document "Race Equality in Public Services--Driving Up Standards and Accounting for Progress". The document sets out performance data in a number of key areas which are of interest to ethnic minority communities, and provides a quantifiable way of demonstrating the Government's progress in promoting race equality.

<P>
<a name="00327w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The numbers of reported incidents and charges are not collected centrally.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list, for each of the last 10 years for which figures are available, the average number of prisoners in each prison establishment being held two in a cell in a single cell; for what reason the Prison Service does not collect data on the number of prisoners held three in a double cell; and if he will make a statement.  [116473]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00327w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The average number of prisoners held two to a cell designed for one, in each prison establishment since 1992-93, is given in the table. Prisons that are not currently operational are excluded from the analysis.
<P>

<a name="00327w02.html_para2">The Prison Service has never collected centrally the number of prisoners held three to a cell designed for two. Prisons provide data on the total overcrowding level and on the numbers held two to a cell designed for one, known as "doubling". Total overcrowding includes those held three to a cell for two and those overcrowded in dormitories and larger cells. Doubling is an appropriate measure of the true impact of overcrowding on individuals.
<P>

<a name="00327w02.html_para3">Overcrowding, other than doubling, is not widespread. At the end of February 2000, only nine establishments reported a total overcrowding figure in excess of the numbers doubled.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 22 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 561W, on the home detention curfew scheme, what specific offences are defined as <i>(a)</i> other homicide and attempted homicide, <i>(b)</i> other motoring offences and <i>(c)</i> other offences; how many offenders were released having been convicted of each specific offence; and if he will make a statement.

 Further details of the offences defined as other homicide and attempted homicide, other motoring offences and other offences, and the number of prisoners convicted of each type of offence who have been released on home detention curfew are shown in the table.
<P>

<a name="00327w03.html_para0">No eligible prisoner can be granted home detention curfew without first passing a risk assessment. The risk assessment addresses the risk to the public and the likelihood of the prisoner re-offending during his time on curfew. The details of the offence in each case will be known to the establishment before a risk assessment and release on home detention curfew can take place. The nature of the current offence, together with previous offending history, are important factors that are taken into account in assessing a prisoner's suitability for the scheme. Prisons have been instructed that prisoners who present a clear and immediate threat to the public must not be released on home detention curfew.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 22 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 561-62W, on the home detention curfew scheme, how many offenders who committed further offences while on the scheme committed an offence similar in character to that for which they were originally convicted; if he will provide a breakdown by type of offence of such offenders; and if he will make a statement.

 According to Prison Service records, of the 185 curfewees referred to in the reply I gave on 22 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 561-62W, who have been charged with a further offence while subject to home detention curfew, 74 have been charged with an offence similar to that for which they were serving a

sentence of imprisonment prior to being released on curfew. The table gives a breakdown of the types of offences committed.
<P>

<a name="00327w03.html_para1">One of the factors addressed in the home detention curfew risk assessment is the likelihood of the prisoner re-offending during his time on curfew. If the offender's past history and current circumstances suggest that there is a probability that he will return to offending within the curfew period, release must be refused.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 22 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 561W, on the home detention curfew scheme, how many offenders charged with a further offence committed while on the scheme have been convicted of such an offence; if he will provide a breakdown by type of offence; and if he will make a statement.  [116480]<P>
<P>
<P>

<a name="00327w03.html_wqn3"><B> Miss Widdecombe: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 22 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 561W, on the home detention curfew scheme, for what reason the original offence committed by 1,001 offenders released on the scheme was not recorded; and if he will make a statement.  [116481]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00327w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The statistics on the original offences committed by prisoners released on home detention curfew are taken from the Prison Service computer database, known as the Inmate Information System, and are based on the data entered by each prison. Where offence data are not completed by the prison, the category "offence not recorded" is used at the centre. At a local level, the details of the offence in each case will be known to the establishment before a risk assessment and release on home detention curfew can take place. In assessing a 



<P>
<P><I>27 Mar 2000 : Column: 12W</I><P>
prisoner's suitability for release on the scheme, the nature of the offence is an important factor to be taken into account.
<P>

<a name="00327w03.html_para3">Efforts are made to ensure the completeness and accuracy of all data as far as practicable, but there are inevitable errors of omission and commission. Guidance is being issued to establishments stressing the importance of recording the data on original offences as quickly as possible in every case.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00327w03.html_wqn4"><B> Miss Widdecombe: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is the maximum sentence that may be passed on an offender who is eligible for release on the home detention curfew scheme.  [116475]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00327w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Under the Criminal Justice Act 1991, as amended by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, no prisoner who has been sentenced to four years or more imprisonment is eligible for release under the home detention curfew scheme.

<a name="00327w03.html_wqn5"><B> Miss Widdecombe: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department further to his answers of 22 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 557W, on drug testing procedures under Clause 48 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Bill, <i>(a)</i> if a positive test would in itself be sufficient proof of an offence of unlawful possession of a controlled drug, <i>(b)</i> what specified Class A drugs will be tested for, <i>(c)</i> if he intends to extend the testing procedure to include Class B drugs and <i>(d)</i> how he intends the tests to be used to assist in appropriate sentencing, and if this includes the length of sentence to be passed; and if he will make a statement.  [116472]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00327w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The purpose of drug testing on charge is to identify and monitor drug misusers who may need treatment and to inform any subsequent bail decisions. It is not intended that a positive test will be used to bring a prosecution for unlawful possession. Initially, tests will be made to detect heroin and crack/cocaine which research evidence shows are strongly linked to crimes committed in order to feed a drug habit. The Criminal Justice and Court Services Bill includes provision to extend the range of drugs tested for, including any in Class B, if a similar linkage to commission of crime emerges.
<P>

<a name="00327w03.html_para4">The court will have regard to a positive test on sentencing and can make a drug abstinence order or add an abstinence requirement to a community sentence in cases where the criteria is met.
<P>

<a name="00327w03.html_para5">A positive test result will not be an aggravating factor for sentencing purposes.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00327w03.html_wqn6"><B> Miss Widdecombe: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the new procedure for appointing local probation boards contained in Schedule 1 to the Criminal Justice and Court Services Bill, indicating how it differs from the present procedure.  [116476]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00327w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The present procedure is based on the nomination directly to the committee of local magistrates, a member of the judiciary and local authority members. In future, members of probation boards, with the exception of the Lord Chancellor's nominee, will be appointed by the Secretary of State following a process of open, public advertisement.

 Planning Policy Guidance note 3, "Housing", (PPG3) (see paragraphs 47 and 48) provides that local planning authorities should seek to exploit opportunities to locate larger housing developments around major nodes along good quality public transport corridors (both existing and those with firm proposals for improvement in local transport plans). In addition, authorities should seek to ensure that all housing developments are accessible by a range of non-car modes. Draft PPG13, "Transport", also proposes that major development proposals should be supported by a transport assessment.

 Such vehicles are exempt from the MOT test if they are constructed such that they tow vehicles that they are recovering rather than carry them. Although it is not possible to say precisely how many of these there are, a good approximation is the number of vehicles whose body type is recorded as a breakdown truck. Further to these, there will also be a number of other vehicles in the recovery vehicles tax class that are exempt from the MOT test because they are less than one year old. The estimated numbers of those licensed and exempt from the MOT test at the end of 1998 are as follows:

<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="00327w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 There are two parts to housing subsidy: housing element and rent rebate element. Most authorities show a surplus on their housing element--that is their assumed rental income covers assumed costs. Where there is a surplus on housing element for an authority, we reduce the size of the rent rebate element by an equivalent amount.
<P>

<a name="00327w06.html_para0">Other than in those cases where rent rebate subsidy limitation applies, local authorities are fully reimbursed for rent rebate expenditure. The effect of limitation is that 



<P>
<P><I>27 Mar 2000 : Column: 21W</I><P>
if an authority increases its average rent above the limit rent level, it receives additional rental income only from those tenants not receiving rent rebate.
<P>

<a name="00327w06.html_para1">This accounting arrangement reflects the different subsidy provisions which apply to different tenures. Local authority rents are generally lower than housing association or private sector rents, so it is not the case that council tenants are treated less favourably than other tenants. We intend to replace the current system with one that is easier to understand and which will avoid offsetting one expenditure stream against another and avoid the present confusion. The necessary legislation will be introduced as soon as parliamentary time permits.
<P>

<a name="00327w06.html_para2">We are currently consulting on the detail of our proposals on how to structure and operate a new system for redistributing resources under resource accounting. We have also announced that the proposed major repairs allowance (MRA) will be introduced from April 2001 to meet the cost of keeping housing stock in good condition. We expect that there will be fewer surpluses when the MRA is introduced and that will itself ease concerns about the system.
<P>

[116564]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00327w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has today published for consultation Proposed Changes to the Draft Regional Planning Guidance (RPG) for East Anglia and to the Draft RPG for the South-East.
<P>

<a name="00327w06.html_para5">On 7 March my right hon. Friend set out a new approach to planning for housing provision and made a preliminary announcement about housing in the South-East. The Proposed Changes to the draft RPG for East Anglia reflect the principles and priorities set out in that statement. They aim to support economic growth and regeneration, while protecting and enhancing the region's environment. They endorse the housing target proposed by SCEALA (the Standing Conference of East Anglia Local Authorities) of around some 9,600 additional dwellings a year as the starting point for the plan, monitor and manage approach. The Panel recommended that at least 40 per cent. of these new dwellings should be on previously-developed land. We are proposing a 50 per cent. target initially. This takes account of the likely availability of such land in a largely rural region.
<P>

<a name="00327w06.html_para6">We endorse SCEALA's view that development should be concentrated in the cities and larger towns. This is consistent with our policies for urban renaissance and the better use of land.
<P>

<a name="00327w06.html_para7">Cambridge now has world status as a centre for high-tech, knowledge-based industry. The emphasis must be on enabling the development of these industries while safeguarding the City's special character. However, we share the Panel's concern at the non-sustainable nature of much recent development around Cambridge, associated with increased car dependence and a lack of affordable housing. Building on the Panel's recommendations, we are proposing a sequential approach to development, looking first at the capacity of Cambridge, then possible urban extensions, then a new settlement--always considering brownfield land first.
<P>

<a name="00327w06.html_para8">We have accepted the Panel's recommendation for a review of the Cambridge Green Belt as an essential part of the process of finding sustainable locations for development. It should be carried out by the local authorities, with any changes taken forward through the review of development plans.
<P>

<a name="00327w06.html_para9">The integration of development and transport is at the core of our approach to regional planning. Our programme of multi-modal transport studies reflects the strategic priorities identified by SCEALA. The Minister responsible for roads announced on 3 February that the A11 Roudham Heath to Attleborough scheme was to be brought forward to start in 2000-01. In further recognition of the strategic priorities we are adding three schemes to 



<P>
<P><I>27 Mar 2000 : Column: 23W</I><P>
the targeted programme of improvements at an estimated cost of &#163;53 million: A11 Fiveways to Thetford and Attleborough Bypass Improvements, already in preparation, and A47 Thorney Bypass. The A11 schemes will complete a high-quality route to Norwich, improving access to Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft. Thorney Bypass will bring safety and environmental benefits for the local community, and will remove a bottleneck on a strategic east-west route.
<P>

<a name="00327w06.html_para10">On 7 March, my right hon. Friend announced the overall housing numbers for the South-East region and the target for the use of recycled land. The Proposed Changes, published today, set out detailed proposals including a clear spatial strategy for the region.
<P>

<a name="00327w06.html_para11">The Proposed Changes recognise the national priority for regenerating the Thames Gateway area, and the need within the region to promote the Priority Areas of Economic Regeneration and to facilitate the continuing economic success of the area to the west of London, while maintaining environmental quality, and of London as a World City. The policies are designed to help achieve an urban renaissance and the improved economic and social viability of the rural areas, while protecting and enhancing the countryside.
<P>

<a name="00327w06.html_para12">The Proposed Changes set out priorities for transport investment and study, and include revised parking standards. However, they make clear that more work needs to be done to develop the Regional Transport Strategy to facilitate the economic performance of the region, achieve more sustainable patterns of movement and to combat congestion. The documents include an illustrative distribution of the housing numbers to county areas, a point on which we have specifically sought the views of SERPLAN (the South-East Regional Planning Conference). We consider that there is scope for potential growth areas at Milton Keynes, Ashford and, in the longer term, at Stansted. The potential of these areas will now be the subject of studies with the Regional Planning Bodies, the local authorities concerned and other interested parties.
<P>

<a name="00327w06.html_para13">The consultation period on both sets of Proposed Changes will be for 12 weeks, ending on 19 June. Copies of the relevant documents have been placed in the House Library and made available to the two region's MPs.

We are giving authorities more resources and more freedom to produce the best possible plans.

This reflects our commitment to supporting local solutions and initiatives.

Local authorities will play an important role in delivering that plan, and in the guidance issued today we are asking them for additional investment proposals for an integrated transport strategy over the next 10-years.

A comprehensive programme of commemorative events is planned over the next three years in the Republic of Korea, involving that country and those whose forces constituted the United Nations Command. As the United Kingdom's participation in the war as a contributor to the United Nations Command in defence of the Republic of Korea, it is appropriate that our commemoration should be as part of that programme, and we will be represented at a number of events at the appropriate level. The Ministry of Defence has no plans for additional commemoration of the anniversary.

<P>
<a name="00327w07.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when his Department issued instructions that Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force cadets must not travel in four-tonne trucks or other military vehicles without seatbelts; and what assessment he has made of the impact of this ruling on <i>(a)</i> cadet training and <i>(b)</i> cadet financing.  [116346]




<P>
<P><I>27 Mar 2000 : Column: 26W</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00327w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Instructions on the carriage of cadets in military vehicles were first issued on 20 March 1998, in response to the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 1996 (SI 1996/163). These instructions stated that the use of Troop Carrying Vehicles (TCVs) which were not fitted with passenger restraint was not appropriate for the routine movement of cadets. The use of TCVs for the carriage of cadets was therefore restricted to training areas and their immediate vicinity.
<P>

<a name="00327w07.html_para8">The use of military vehicles during training is permitted, but only under a rigorous control regime. This requires Commanding Officers to consider whether it enhances training, whether it might be more appropriate to use civilian vehicles, the nature of the training and the terrain to be covered. This is aimed at ensuring that the proposed training is reasonable and that any risks are controllable.
<P>

<a name="00327w07.html_para9">Following the Strategic Defence Review, additional funding of &#163;500,000 per year was allocated to Headquarters Land Command for additional provision for routine travel for Army Cadet Force units and Army sections of the Combined Cadet Force, and additional facilities at detachment level. Of this, &#163;200,000 per year has been allocated to TAVRAs for cadet travel. This is in addition to the usual process through which TAVRAs receive funding, including provision for a cadet travel vote. This additional funding has meant that the impact of the ruling with respect to the requirement for seatbelts in TCVs on Army Cadet Force training and financing has been minimal.
<P>

<a name="00327w07.html_para10">Naval Cadet Forces seldom used four-tonne trucks for passenger carrying purposes, and therefore the ruling with respect to the requirement for seatbelts in these vehicles has had no impact either on cadet training or financing. Naval Cadet Forces use either loan vehicles from motor transport pools or hire vehicles, all of which are fitted with seat belts.
<P>

<a name="00327w07.html_para11">Air Cadets do not travel in four-tonne trucks at any time. They may occasionally travel in Land Rovers, which are sometimes used at gliding schools. The ruling has had no impact on their training or financing.

 We are currently considering lessons learned from Kosovo, including the need to bomb with precision in all weather conditions. However, no decisions have yet been made. Upgrading the Ministry of Defence's stock of Paveway II laser guided bombs to have a Global Positioning System/Inertial Measurement Unit capability is one of the options which are being considered. The disclosure of the estimate of the cost of any such upgrade could disadvantage the MOD in commercial negotiations and I am therefore withholding this information under Exemption 7 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. If a decision were made to upgrade the weapons, we would consider what safeguards might be put in place to prevent jamming of the system.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what plans he has to improve access to child support for lone parents who claim income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance.  [116667]<P>

<P>
<a name="00327w09.html_spnew8"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Closer working between the Child Support Agency and the Benefits Agency has already provided a more straightforward, responsive and easily understood child support service. Currently, when Benefits Agency staff interview lone parents to help with their claim for income support and income based jobseeker's allowance, they also help them complete a child support application. If the parent with care is unwilling to apply for child support, a statement is taken at the interview setting out her reasons. The statement is then passed to the Child Support Agency for a decision on whether the reasons for not applying for child support constitute "good cause".
<P>

<a name="00327w09.html_para2">As a result of these changes, many more parents with care claiming income support and income-based jobseeker's allowance, now apply for child support. 87 per cent. now complete a child support application and provide details of the non-resident parent.
<P>

<a name="00327w09.html_para3">From 1 April this year, following successful trials around the country, the current arrangements will be extended so that the Benefits Agency will take on responsibility for making decisions about good cause. This will further streamline the service offered to lone parents claiming benefit.

 <i>[holding answer 23 March 2000]:</i> No decisions have yet been taken on the future of the Ministry's regional service centres (RSCs) following the recent review of CAP scheme administration, which was commissioned to help us identify the best way to improve the service we offer to farmers and traders eligible to claim CAP payments, taking full advantage of the benefits offered by modern technology.
<P>

<a name="00327w11.html_para0">We are now considering, in the context of the spending review 2000, how best to restructure MAFF's RSCs and the Intervention Board Executive Agency. Any major restructuring will only be possible if funding can be made available.
<P>

<a name="00327w11.html_para1">My right hon. Friend the Minister has made it clear that he will not implement the recommendations of the review unless he is satisfied that we will be able to deliver real improvements in the service which MAFF and the Intervention Board currently provide to farmers and traders, as well as reductions in the cost to the taxpayer of administration of CAP payments.
<P>

<a name="00327w11.html_para2">We are also taking forward plans to align MAFF's other regional activities, particularly on rural development, with the Government Offices for the Regions. This will ensure that we are able to work effectively with other regional partners including the regional development agencies.

<a name="00327w11.html_para3">It is the Government's policy to ban the commercial release of GM crops until it can be demonstrated that they are safe for people and the environment. The current European and UK legislation prohibits the commercial release of any genetically modified organism, including GM crops, until the applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of European member states that they will not cause harm to human health or the environment and a marketing consent has been issued under the terms of the Directive 90/220.

 The subsidy is an addition to income over and above salary, so income tax and national insurance contributions are payable. However, the DfEE has made arrangements with the Inland Revenue for these liabilities to be met centrally. No liability will fall on individual teachers, and they will not have to include the subsidy in any income tax return.

 This is an operational matter falling within the remit of the Library and the Parliamentary Communications Directorate (PCD).

The cost of providing millennium compliant terminal emulation software to all PDVN users could not be justified, compared with the benefits of developing the browser-based version. The Library's POLIS development programme is now focused on that service.

 I can announce &#163;50 million of new money to enable the RDAs to support clusters, including business incubation, in the English regions. The eight Regional Development Agencies (and the London Development Agency, when it is established in the summer) will be responsible for promoting the development of clusters in their respective regions: the new money, together with existing funding streams, will provide them with resources towards this. This new DTI initiative demonstrates the Government's commitment to strengthening the business agenda in the regions.




<P>
<P><I>27 Mar 2000 : Column: 44W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00327w12.html_para6">RDAs are being invited to prepare business plans for their regions setting out their proposals to support clusters development in line with the Regional Economic Strategies. These plans will set out details of what each RDA intends to achieve using money allocated to them from the new fund. The &#163;50 million will cover the financial years 2000-01 and 2001-02. Financial allocations for future years are being considered as part of the current Spending Review. Each RDA (and the LDA) will receive an allocation from the Capital Modernisation Fund of &#163;1&#189; million for the coming financial year (2000-01). For the following year (2001-02), we shall introduce a "Challenge" element in the allocations.

Much of this was for technology transfer activity in areas such as laser, plastics, structural composites and joining generally. The largest project (with grant of around 70 per cent. of the total paid) was to develop an internet based technology transfer delivery system based on BT communications expertise.

<a name="00327w13.html_para4">The actual impact on UK companies in the targeted sectors will depend on a number of factors, including the length of time that the retaliatory measures remain in place, and the ability of affected companies to find alternative customers for their goods. However, I have received many representations from UK companies affected by the US retaliation. Taking into account these representations and the above data, my assessment is that there is a real risk of damage to UK companies in terms of lost trade and jobs.

A maximum of five European Fast Streamers (the UK Government's development programme for British graduates who wish to make a career in the EU institutions) go on a "stage" in each biannual intake.

 The UK will apply the general provisions of the Charter in respect of all the languages which meet the Charter's definition of a regional or minority language. The Government recognise that this definition embraces Scots and Ulster-Scots and are considering what other languages, including Cornish, also meet the definition. To fulfil the Charter's requirement to implement specific provisions to promote the use of certain languages in public life, the Government intend to specify Welsh, Scots-Gaelic and Irish.

(28) Data for London in 1987 are incomplete, there are no data below national level prior to 1987. In April 1996, FHSAs merged to form Health Authorities, in this process some of Barnet FHSA split to form part of West Hertfordshire (which is not in the London Region).<P>

<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Figures are rounded to the nearest ten.<P>

2. 1995 to 1998 figures exclude learners and agency staff. Figures from 1982 to 1994 include learners, trainees and students.<P>

3. England figures for 1979 to 1981 include staff in certain centrally-based services, ie, family planning, occupational health and staff nurseries. Excluded are regional nursing officers, nursing cadets, agency staff and staff in the blood transfusion service and primary health care services. These figures were taken from 'Health and personal Social Services Statistics for England'.<P>

4. London Regional Office Area figures from 1979 to 1981 are not available.<P>

5. Due to a change in classification in 1995 for collecting the data, from payscale to occupation code, 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998 figures are not comparable with earlier years.<P>

<i>Source:</i><P>

Department of Health Non-Medical Workforce Census.<P>

<i>Notes for Practice Nurses:</i><P>

 1. The whole of Barnet FHSA has been included prior to 1996, data from 1996 onwards will not include staff who left Barnet FHSA to join West Hertfordshire HA.<P>

<i>Source:</i><P>

Department of Health General and Personal Medical Services Statistics.<P>

<i>Notes for NHS Doctors:</i><P>

1. All Doctors includes doctors in hospitals, public health medicine, the community health services. General Medical Services and Personal Medical Services. Hospital Practitioners and Clinical Assistants are excluded, as most of these are also GPs. The figures exclude doctors working in the HCHS sector in one of the dental specialities.<P>

2. London figures should be interpreted with caution. The London Regional Office came into being on 1 April 1999 while the former Thames Regional Offices covered areas outside London. The 1998 figures are for the (shadow) London Regional Office. The 1987 to 1997 figures are estimates from Health Authorities (Family Health Service Authorities and District Health Authorities prior to 1996) or NHS Trusts that would now be in the London Region. Some HCHS doctors may be counted more than once. This is because they will be counted once for each region where they worked, based on the regional structure in place at the time, and also in the current London region which overlaps with more than one of the former regions.<P>

3. It is not possible to provide numbers for all doctors in London from 1979 to 1986. While estimates for GPs are available, because these were returned by Family Service Health Authorities, estimates for all other doctors are not because these were only returned at regional level and the former Thames regions are not comparable with the new London region.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) in what circumstances the prescribing of a drug to a child in care can be challenged by the parents, if they believe that the child may have suffered an adverse reaction to the drug, where that adverse reaction is (i) reported and (ii) unreported;  [115521]
<P>
<UL>(2) in what circumstances independent medical advice can be sought when there is a disagreement between parents and the local authority with a duty of care for a child who may have suffered an adverse reaction to a drug, where that reaction is <i>(a)</i> reported and <i>(b)</i> unreported; and if he will make a statement;  [115523]
<P>
(3) in what circumstances the local authority with a responsibility of care for a child could challenge the prescribing of a drug to that child if they believe the child may have suffered an adverse reaction to the drug, where that adverse reaction is <i>(a)</i> reported and <i>(b)</i> unreported.

<P>
<a name="00327w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Where a child is looked after by a local authority and is on a care order, the local authority has parental responsibility for the child. It shares that parental responsibility with the child's parent(s), but the local authority has the power to determine the extent to which the parents may exercise their parental responsibility in relation to the child. Where a child is looked after by a local authority and the authority is accommodating the child, it does not have parental responsibility--but a person may arrange for someone else to discharge all or some of it on their behalf, so a parent whose child is accommodated may arrange for the local authority to be responsible on their behalf. Even without such an arrangement, the local authority may do what is reasonable for the purpose of safeguarding or promoting the child's welfare, which may include arranging for urgent medical attention.

<a name="00327w19.html_para0">Ministers committed themselves to the fulfilment of the tourism strategy. Collectively, they also made two specific pledges. Most notable of those is the establishment of a cross-departmental network of officials to ensure close working on policies affecting tourism. They will also consider the forthcoming report from the Better Regulation Task Force on the impact of regulation and enforcement on the hotel and restaurant sector and how to improve co-ordination of regulation in this area.
<P>

<a name="00327w19.html_para1">We will publish a report on the summit.

 Inter-school competitive fixtures will be an important part of the job description of the School Sports Co-ordinators, a new initiative which is being supported by the Lottery Sports Fund with additional support expected to come from partnership funding, including the new opportunities fund. Detailed proposals for the initiative are being drawn up in conjunction with key partners.

<a name="00327w19.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 The new opportunities fund launched the green spaces and sustainable communities initiative in January, and hopes to make its first grants this summer. The initiative covers, among other things, opportunities for children's play, organised and informal sport, playing fields, access to the countryside and creating safer routes to school. These opportunities will greatly benefit the health, happiness, safety and social well-being of children, particularly in areas of multiple deprivation.

 A number of UK governing bodies have signed the Central Council of Physical Recreation's Voluntary Code, under which a minimum of 5 per cent. of broadcasting income is invested in grass roots development. The resulting arrangements in cricket, tennis and other sports appear to be working well. The football authorities are currently drawing up--in consultation with Sport England and my Department--

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if he will make a statement about the distribution of lottery grants across the country. [114874]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00327w19.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 The Government are committed to ensuring that Lottery funding is distributed fairly both geographically and across all groups of society. This is reflected in the changes made to lottery distribution through the National Lottery Act 1998, and through the revised policy directions which I issued in summer 1998. My Department and the lottery distributors have jointly commissioned research, due shortly, into why coalfield areas have fared badly from the lottery, which I hope will hold lessons for distribution to other areas of low take-up.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00327w19.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 All the funds in the National Lottery Distribution Fund available for distribution have been allocated to the National Lottery Distributing Bodies, and all but &#163;200 million of this money has already been committed by them. While money remains in this fund, it earns tax free interest which goes to the good causes, not Government.

 I am pleased to announce that today my Department was able to help launch Positive Futures, a joint sports and drug prevention initiative designed to engage young people at risk.
<P>

<a name="00327w19.html_para2">The UK Anti-Drugs Co-ordination Unit in the Cabinet Office, Sport England and the Youth Justice Board have joined together to create the initiative, which will use sporting and drug education activities to divert vulnerable young people away from drug misuse and crime.
<P>

<a name="00327w19.html_para3">Between the three partners, &#163;950,000 will be invested in 2000-01 to fund 24 projects around the country. By the end of October, all 24 will have begun.
<P>

<a name="00327w19.html_para4">As we set out in our 10-year anti-drugs strategy "Tackling Drugs to Build a Better Britain", the Government are committed to helping young people resist drug misuse in order to achieve their full potential in society. I believe that this initiative will give hope to young people in areas of deprivation, helping them to build self-esteem and confidence while, at the same time, offering a healthy alternative to involvement in drugs.
