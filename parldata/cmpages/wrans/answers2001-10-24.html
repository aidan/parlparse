 I have no immediate plans to make such a proposal, but it is worthy of consideration. Any switch to a new system would need to take account of its wider impact and ensure that any security implications are properly addressed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11024w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Roe: </B> 
 After the 2001 general election, House departments provided a fuller and more co-ordinated induction process for newly elected Members than at any previous election. It is known that virtually all newly elected Members attended the Reception Area and associated activities. There is a good deal of anecdotal evidence that these activities were well received, but in addition the Board of Management has agreed that there should be a small survey of newly elected Members in order to seek their opinions in a more systematic way. The group of House officials who oversaw the process has made its own assessment, including points for consideration when preparations are being made for the induction process after the next general election.

 The Government are keen to ensure that the Thameslink 2000 project should not be put at risk by Railtrack being taken into administration. We are discussing with the administrators and the Strategic Rail Authority the best way of ensuring that the project can be carried forward if the enabling powers are granted under the Transport and Works Act 1992.

<a name="11024w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 Summary information on activity under statutory homelessness provisions is reported to the Department by local authorities in England. This includes the number of households accepted under the homelessness provisions of the 1985 and 1996 Housing Acts as being eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need, and the number of those households resident in various types of temporary accommodation at the end of each quarter.

 It is too early to be precise about representation in the proposed company limited by guarantee.

 I should like to refer to the existing publication "Civil Service Statistics 2000", published on 31 August 2001, specifically to Table G (page 46). This gives an overall figure of staff, by salary band as at 1 April 2000, for the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR(C)) and its agencies before the machinery of Government changes. A copy of this already resides in the House of Commons Library. I am unable to give a more detailed breakdown by region as the information is not held in this form. Following the machinery of Government changes we are budgeting for approximately &#163;336.2m expenditure on staff costs for the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (DTLR(C)) and its Agencies.

 We are looking at a range of options for the area cost adjustment as part of our current review of the grant distribution formulae. We are actively involving local government in this process.

Any change to the area cost adjustment would be implemented in the 2003&#150;04 local government finance settlement.

<a name="11024w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 PPP/PFI deals go ahead only where they demonstrate clear value for money against a public sector comparator. The last survey, which was carried out by Arthur Andersen and the LSE, identified 17 per cent. savings by PPPs against a conventional public sector procurement. However, specific information about savings in PFI contracts can be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

However, new technology is being explored and the case for air conditioning, or for other means to provide a better travelling environment, is being reviewed by London Underground. Until this work is completed it is not possible to announce a time scale for equipping trains with air conditioning. In the meantime, the modernisation contracts require all new and refurbished trains to have improved airflow and ventilation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what information he has collated on the number of building and maintenance departments of local authorities which have been externalised since the introduction of best value; if he will list the local authorities concerned and indicate <i>(a)</i> how many employees are involved (i) in each case and (ii) overall and <i>(b)</i> the name of the contractor who has taken over the delivery of those services in each case; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="11024w03.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 This information is not held centrally. Local authorities have to report the outcome of best value reviews in their Best Value Performance Plans, but no co-ordination of these references has taken place, either on building maintenance or on any other work. The Best Value Inspectorate of the Audit Commission will consider whether the outcome of any particular review is likely to represent best value.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions when he expects <i>(a)</i> Crossrail, <i>(b)</i> Thameslink 2000 and <i>(c)</i> the west coast main line to be completed.  [8993]<P>

<P>
<a name="11024w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government, with the Mayor and the Strategic Rail Authority, have commissioned project definition work on an east-west London rail link, often known as Crossrail. This is looking into possible routes and service patterns. At this stage it is too early to say when such a scheme, if it were to receive the necessary approvals, could be completed; the earliest date is late 2010.
<P>

<a name="11024w03.html_para0">The Thameslink 2000 proposal is dependent on powers being granted under the Transport and Works Act 1992. The public inquiry into the scheme finished earlier this year, and the Inspector's report is expected next spring. If the scheme is approved, the earliest date that it could be operational is late 2007.
<P>

<a name="11024w03.html_para1">At present, phase 1 of the west coast main line project is expected to be completed in 2002&#150;3. Some elements of phase 2 of the project are dependent on powers being granted under the Transport and Works Act and are the subject of public inquiries. If powers are given for these elements of the project, the principal outputs of phase 2 could be completed in 2005, and the work could be fully completed by 2007. However, in recent discussions with Railtrack about its financial position, the company indicated that these dates are subject to some uncertainty.

<P>
<a name="11024w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Most urban bus drivers are subject to the UK drivers' hours rules. These rules, including the break requirements, are explained in a guide book issued by my Department entitled "Drivers' Hours and Tachograph Rules for Road Passenger Vehicles in the UK and Europe (PSV375)" which can be obtained free of charge from the Area Offices of the Vehicle Inspectorate or downloaded from the Departmental website.

<a name="11024w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Performance statistics published by the Strategic Rail Authority show that 76.3 per cent. of Central Trains services arrived on time during the period 24 June to 21 July. This is a combined punctuality and reliability assessment. Services are deemed punctual if they arrived at their destination within five minutes of the timetable.

 The Government have a long-established commitment to legislate for the licensing of houses in multiple occupation. Our plans for legislation are well in hand following consultations on HMO licensing and a new Housing Health and Safety Rating System to replace the current fitness regime. We envisage that the proposed legislation will extend to the Selective Licensing of Landlords in areas of low housing demand&#151;on which we have just issued a consultation document.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what has been the impact on safety in the construction industry of the Safety Summit; if she will make a statement on progress and plans in this area; what priority the Government accords to improving construction safety; and if she will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="11024w04.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 The Government remain committed to ensuring that the construction industry achieves a step change in its health and safety performance. At the Summit in February the industry adopted challenging targets to achieve this improvement, and through its various representative organisations published action plans to deliver those targets. At the Revitalising Heath and Safety in Construction Conference in London on 18 October the industry reviewed progress, and debated how to maintain the momentum of turning concern into 



<P>
<P><I>24 Oct 2001 : Column: 233W</I><P>
positive action. The Summit was always recognised as the start of a long process and this recent conference was one step along the way. It is too early to judge whether the undoubted activity taking place with action plans will achieve results in terms of the targets industry has set itself, but Ministers maintain an active interest and have asked to be kept informed of developments.

 Oxford-Worcester services are predominantly provided by Thames Trains. The current franchise is not due to expire until April 2004. On 16 July the Secretary of State asked the Strategic Rail Authority to consider how improvements for passengers could be secured within existing franchises, or by negotiating short extensions. The Strategic Rail Authority has reviewed

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what initiatives he has taken to <i>(a)</i> renovate and <i>(b)</i> clear decaying private sector housing stock in (i) England and (ii) east Lancashire since 1997.  [9388]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11024w04.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The responsibility for renovating or clearing decaying private sector housing lies primarily with local housing authorities. But in our Housing Policy Statement "The Way Forward for Housing", published last April, we set out a number of ways in which local housing authorities may make better use of their powers.
<P>

<a name="11024w04.html_para0">"The Way Forward for Housing" announced relaxations to the rules governing the declaration of renewal areas and group repair schemes. These came into force immediately. The Housing Policy Statement also set out major new changes to allow authorities far greater freedom in renovating or clearing private sector stock. Subject to parliamentary approval of an order under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001, local authorities will be given a new general power replacing the present detailed grant regimes. These reforms, planned to come into force in 2002, will broaden authorities' present loan-giving powers, enable payments to be made to third parties to lever in private finance, and enable help to be offered to people to move to a new home as an option to renovating their existing one.
<P>

<a name="11024w04.html_para1">These reforms are in addition to a wide range of regeneration programmes pursued by this Government, including the Single Regeneration Budget, the New Deal for Communities and the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund which can be used for decaying private sector housing.

 The Strategic Rail Authority announced the transfer of the South Central franchise to GoVia on 24 August. Negotiations are continuing between the two parties to put in place a new 20 year franchise as soon as possible.

 <i>[holding answer 23 October 2001]:</i> Following the tragic events in USA on 11 September, the Government took immediate steps to restrict flying over the United Kingdom as a precautionary measure while the new terrorist threat was evaluated. Two Restriction of Flying Orders were put in place. These measures were kept under constant review and as a consequence there was a gradual relaxation of restrictions. The first order banning all general aviation flying was lifted at midnight on Wednesday 12 September. The second order banning flights over central London was amended at midnight on 13 September to reduce the amount of London airspace restricted and enable London City airport to reopen (while still protecting central London including Canary wharf). Although this order lapsed at midnight on Saturday 16 September the Government continue to monitor the situation and stand ready to impose further restrictions should they become necessary.

 These are issues for Southampton city council to answer, as local planning authority and local transport authority. I have asked the council to write to the hon. Member. The Secretary of State does not approve local plans. They are adopted by the local planning authority, following a public inquiry. It is for local authorities preparing development plans to ensure they consult all those with an interest in the plan.

 The term "casual workers" is not used by the armed forces, and soldiers in the Territorial Army (TA) have not been formally designated as such. However, members of the TA are not eligible for membership of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme because of the terms of their employment. In the part-time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 service in the TA (as set out under sections 22 and 27 of the Reserve Forces Act 1996) is specifically excluded.

<a name="11024w06.html_para1">None the less, since 8 October 2001 members of the TA have had the option of joining the Armed Forces Stakeholder Pension Plan. The Ministry of Defence has designated Scottish Widows plc to provide this facility to all eligible members of the armed forces. MOD and Scottish Widows are involved in an exercise to inform all members of the armed forces of this new facility.

 We remain determined to balance operational commitments. We will commit personnel to operations for no longer than is necessary to achieve the military aim. Recent operations in Macedonia demonstrated this well. We are introducing systems to monitor the amount of separated service undertaken by each individual in the armed forces which will help us to target our efforts on the most hard-pressed branches and trades. For operations overseas, a new and comprehensive package of welfare support was introduced worldwide in April 2001.

 The integrated inquiry service project was established to examine the feasibility of providing local authorities which administer housing benefit with wider access to the Department's benefit data. This would build on the existing data available through remote access terminals linking local authorities to the Department systems. Our aim is to speed up the processing of claims and improve customer service by reducing authorities' dependence on clerical processes.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para3">A software application was developed by the project and tested in seven local authorities at an estimated cost of &#163;800,000. An evaluation of these trials showed that there remained substantial technical problems to overcome before the tested application could satisfy the Department's and local authorities' business requirements. No assured solutions to these problems could be identified and we have therefore closed the project.

<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para6">The BFI first inspected Blyth Valley district council in October 1999 and found significant weaknesses in the administration of Housing and Council Tax Benefit and counter fraud work. At its follow-up inspection, in April 2001, inspectors confirmed substantial improvements, with progress and developments in the vast majority of areas.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para7">The report notes that through the commitment and enthusiasm of members, managers and staff, the council has achieved a significant improvement in performance in combating fraud and error. This is highlighted by the fact that 42 of the 44 recommendations from the first report have been implemented or are in the process of being implemented.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para8">Inspectors consider that benefits administration and overpayment recovery now has the necessary resources and management information in place to enable the council to deliver an effective service, while the implementation of a comprehensive checking regime has enabled the council to identify and focus on priority issues and proactively manage its operations.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para9">The council has addressed the main issues identified in BFI's first report concerning its counter fraud activities. However, BFI considers it has focused too heavily on claiming Weekly Benefit Savings. It is now moving to a more sanction and deterrence based operation. As its Weekly Benefit Savings claims are fairly accurate, inspectors conclude there is a sound basis for this move, which will ensure the council provides a value-for-money deterrent to fraud.

<a name="11024w06.html_para25">BFI's first inspection of the borough of Broxbourne in March 1998 found significant weaknesses in the administration of Housing and Council Tax Benefit and counter fraud work. The follow-up inspection, in October 2000, confirmed substantial progress and developments in many areas of work, although inspectors also found scope for further improvement.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para26">Inspectors consider the council's implementation of the Verification Framework has been comprehensive. BFI found the council improved public access to benefits information and assistance, and now has effective joint working with BA. The report notes, however, that the previous problems of backlogs of work and slow processing were still in evidence.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para27">Inspectors found that the council's IT system did not provide adequate information on the management of overpayments; however, the report does note that the council has made substantial progress in its administration of overpayments since the first BFI inspection.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para28">The report makes particular mention of the council's strong focus of counter fraud work on the quality of investigation and sanctions.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para29">Inspectors consider that the council has sufficient systems in place to ensure the effectiveness and quality of the housing benefit and council tax benefit administration and counter fraud work. The previous lack

of monitoring of the contractor has improved and inspectors conclude the council now has effective monitoring mechanisms in place.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para30">The report notes that since the BFI's last inspection, Members have been taking a close interest in the progress of the Housing Benefit section.

 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate report in respect of Three Rivers district council was published on 23 August 2001 and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para33">The BFI report notes the council has been working towards meeting the standards of the Verification Framework since February 2000. BFI found that some areas of verification of claims were good, although inspectors identified other areas that needed improvement.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para34">The BFI report notes the council's counter fraud activity is effective, with a well-resourced fraud team. As a result, it is able to produce high quality investigations. In contrast, the housing benefit team does not have enough staff to meet customer expectations.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para35">Inspectors consider that the introduction of the Customer Services Centre did not help the performance of the Housing Benefit team as anticipated. The team is also hindered by poor management information.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para36">The council has taken steps to improve overpayments collection by utilising the debtors' module of its benefits system.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para37">Overall BFI concludes that the council have done much to eradicate fraud, but needs to improve the verification of claims and recovery of Housing Benefit overpayments.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para38">The council is planning to address a number of the weaknesses identified in the report and demonstrated its commitment to improve the administration of HB and CTB in Three Rivers district council.

 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate report in respect of the East Lothian council was published on 18 September 2001 and copies of the report have been placed in the Library. This is the second report on East Lothian council by BFI.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para41">The BFI expressed major concern with the lack of demonstrable commitment at senior manager level to address issues highlighted by the first BFI inspection. Relatively few of the major recommendations from the first inspection had been fully implemented in areas such as the provision of management information, system security and overpayment recovery where long standing weaknesses were identified.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para42">The report finds the council had made little or no attempt to tackle serious shortcomings in benefit administration. Inspectors found that it was extremely difficult to assess performance in benefit administration and overpayment management because the council was unable to provide any reliable data for the previous two financial years. Additionally, the BFI was particularly concerned that a number of matters which had been reported to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) (formerly Department of Social Security) as having been addressed were still found to be problematical. In particular, the report finds little evidence of sustained improvement in the council's strategic and operational management.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para43">The report recognises that some definite improvements have been made in areas such as day-to-day claims processing and fraud investigation. Also there is praise for the commitment of front line staff.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para44">The report makes recommendations to help the council address weaknesses and to improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as its counter fraud activities.

<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para46">Inspectors report that the council has made considerable improvements in many areas, particularly in re-designing processes to improve performance. Quality improvements have been less dramatic and the report recommends that the council should now focus on these areas to make further gains in the effectiveness and security of its service.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para47">The speed of processing new claims was found to be very good but weaknesses in verifying evidence were identified and a similar pattern was found with renewal claims.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para48">The council's counter-fraud efforts are meeting with some success but inspectors consider further work is needed in controlling and recovering over-payments. The 



<P>
<P><I>24 Oct 2001 : Column: 248W</I><P>
council had over &#163;15 million in benefit over-payment debt which, at the time of the inspectors' visit, was continuing to rise.

 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate report in respect of the London borough of Bromley was published on 12 September 2001 and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para51">Inspectors report variable standards of claim verification and identify improvements needed in this area and on the speed of processing claims. The report recommends more rigorous management and controls to improve the quality and consistency of checking and to ensure that guidance is followed.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para52">The report notes that the council has a strong culture of probity at officer and Member level and that it recognises the need to draw together existing policies on probity into a single fraud and corruption policy. The BFI's findings show that Bromley's performance in tackling fraud was found to be ineffective in its organisation and investigation quality. A number of recommendations to tackle this are contained within the report.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para53">The report notes the council welcomed the inspection as an opportunity to review and improve its benefit operations. The council has expressed its commitment to improving the security and integrity of the benefits system and modernising all its services using e-government.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para54">Since the inspection, Bromley has begun to implement recommended changes, such as increasing staffing in the client unit. Full implementation of the recommendations contained in the report should enable it to build a more secure and efficient benefits system.

 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate report in respect of the Benefits Agency (BA) was published on 28 September 2001 and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para57">Inspectors report that their investigation took place at a time when significant changes were taking place in the organisation with the start of a major project to focus substantial resources on supporting the frontline delivery of services to customers. There was also a great deal of work underway to develop and improve the relationship with local authorities.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para58">BFI found areas where the BA needed to make improvements in order to ensure benefit payments were free from fraud and error. These include training BA staff in Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit issues, improving the recovery of Housing Benefit overpayments, and better checking of identities and more effective exchange of information with local authority counter fraud staff.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para59">Inspectors consider there needs to be a higher profile on closer working with local authorities within BA.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para60">The report notes that changes made in BA should have a positive impact on counter fraud activity, especially the appointment of a Chief Investigation Officer and Head of Profession for counter fraud activity. The appointments should lead to a clearer strategic direction and raise the profile of closer working on counter fraud.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para61">Inspectors also consider the introduction of BA's Performance Improvement Action Teams to support equalisation of performance amongst BA offices should also have a positive impact on several of the areas of weakness identified in the report.
<P>

<a name="11024w06.html_para62">We are determined that we take every measure to bear down on fraud and error and we want to ensure that the work of the best is duplicated right through the organisation.

I have also taken steps to ensure that business representation is strengthened on the boards. I have placed details of re-appointments in the Library of both Houses.

 <i>[holding answer 16 October 2001]:</i> The information requested is given in the following table.

These figures also cover students on full-time first degree courses but the methodology and institutional coverage used by the Department was different to that used by HEFCE, so the two sets of figures are not directly comparable. Neither HEFCE nor the Department have calculated non-completion rates for students on part-time courses. Non-completion rates for part-time courses are intrinsically more difficult to calculate because part-time students can take many years to complete their course.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11024w08.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Local authorities are key partners of the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). A local LSC must prepare a plan for each of its financial years, and, in so doing, must consult the local authorities (including local education authorities) within its area. The local LSC must also have regard to the local authorities' strategies for the promotion of economic, social and environmental well-being. Local LSCs must also have members who understand the needs of local communities through local authority experience, either as elected members or in an official capacity. In most cases both local authority members and officials already sit on local LSC boards.
<P>

<a name="11024w08.html_para0">Each local LSC is responsible for approving the Adult Learning Plans provided by each local authority. These are then subject to national moderation. These Plans outline what each local authority will do with the funding provided by the local LSC in the provision of vocational and non-vocational education and training in the local area.
<P>

<a name="11024w08.html_para1">Local LSCs will, from April 2002, be responsible for funding local education authorities for their sixth- form provision, including new LEA-maintained 16 to 19 institutions. Those funds must be passed on to the relevant schools in full.

 The Learning and Skills Council has been established to provide effective planning and funding of post-16 learning, focusing on individual, employer and community needs at national and local level. Local LSCs are accountable for delivery to their boards, whose members represent a broad cross-section of local interests. Local LSCs must have members who understand the needs of local communities through local authority experience, either as elected members or in an official capacity. In most cases both local authority members and officials already sit on local LSC boards. And when developing their strategic plans, local LSCs are required to consult with a wide range of local partners.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what recent changes there have been to the EU Common Position on Burma.  [10371]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11024w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Changes in Burma in the past nine months give grounds for cautious optimism, but the rapprochement between the regime and the domestic opposition remains fragile and reversible. Until Burma is firmly embarked on a return to constitutional, democratic rule it would not be appropriate to suspend or remove the core elements of the EU Common Position. The General Affairs Council of 8 October therefore decided to renew the Common Position for a further six months. The core elements of the Common Position are to remain unchanged, with the addition of required legal clarification that enables EU member states to fulfil their UN obligations by allowing Burmese Ministers to attend UN conferences in the EU.
<P>

<a name="11024w09.html_para0">However, in recognition of the progress achieved to date and in expectation of further positive developments, the EU Council Conclusions on 8 October set out a modest first package of positive measures. We stand ready to consider what further measures might be appropriate if change in Burma accelerates significantly. Conversely, if progress were to stall or fail, UK/EU policy would need to be tightened again.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will take steps to mitigate the impact of inheritance tax on those estates which are predominantly comprised of the value of the deceased's family home.  [8681]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11024w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 Even where property represents a high proportion of the total value, most estates also have sufficient liquid assets to satisfy all the inheritance tax which may be due. Executors can nevertheless defer payment of tax when a former home has not been sold by the time the tax on it would otherwise be due, if necessary by making instalments over as long as 10 years. Most eligible estates start in this way, but the overwhelming majority settle their tax before the 10 years is up, usually because the home is no longer in family use and has been sold.

Where the local authority denies such an objection, the objector would be entitled to appeal to the magistrates courts.

In the case of public entertainment licences, local authorities have a broad discretion to impose such conditions, terms and restrictions as they see fit. In the case of late-night refreshment houses and night caf&#233;s, conditions may be imposed to prevent unreasonable disturbance to local residents, and "closing orders" may be imposed to the same end. Some local authorities have sought agreements with parts of the licensed trade on standardised conditions which might be adopted in connection with public entertainment licences. From time to time local authorities publish advice on associated matters in conjunction with the Health and Safety Executive. The majority of local authorities in making licensing decisions generally adopt similar standards to those which they adopt in enforcing the provisions of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Noise Act 1996.

 <i>[holding answer 23 October 2001]:</i> The role of the English Tourism Council is set out in its three-year funding agreement with this Department, as signed on 4 June 2001 and deposited in the Library of this House. The impact of foot and mouth disease and the terrorist attacks of 11 September have necessitated a review of short-term tourism policy and, in the light of recent discussions with key players in the industry, efforts will be concentrated on data collection, improving quality and skills and domestic marketing. The English Tourism Council, other tourism bodies and the industry all have important roles to play in this strategy.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what measures she has put in place to cut the risk of foot and mouth being re-imported.  [9430]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11024w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government take very seriously the need to have effective controls on imports of animal products, be they in personal baggage or commercial consignments. We in DEFRA are co-ordinating action across Government to ensure that the rules are enforced as effectively as possible at ports and airports.
<P>

<a name="11024w11.html_para0">New arrangements have been introduced across all enforcement agencies involved to improve the sharing and analysis of information about known or suspected illegal imports. This is being used to target enforcement action and to make best use of available resources. Our national regulations have also been amended to assist local authorities in seizing suspected illegal imports when they are found at point of sale. The Food Standards Agency is also encouraging local authorities to ensure that checking for illegal imports is part of their routine inspection of food premises.
<P>

<a name="11024w11.html_para1">Alongside this we have introduced improved publicity to ensure that travellers are aware of the restrictions on what may be imported. Posters have been placed at main airports and information is being provided to travellers by the travel industry and by British embassies abroad.
<P>

<a name="11024w11.html_para2">We are keeping these measures under review and will make improvements as necessary. In addition, we will be looking at further options to ensure the rules on imports are enforced effectively and efficiently.
<P>

<a name="11024w11.html_para3">On commercial consignments, all meat imported from third countries must be accompanied by veterinary certification. This must confirm that the meat is derived 



<P>
<P><I>24 Oct 2001 : Column: 267W</I><P>
from animals which have been subjected to an ante- mortem inspection during the 24 hours prior to slaughter at which the animal showed no signs of foot and mouth disease.
<P>

<a name="11024w11.html_para4">If there is an outbreak of disease likely to present a risk to human or animal health such as foot and mouth disease, Community legislation allows us to take appropriate safeguard action, which may include a ban on imports of meat from all, or parts, of that country.

[8342]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11024w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The table shows the amounts of meat from foot and mouth disease susceptible animals imported into the UK in 1999, 2000 and January to July 2001.
<P>

<a name="11024w11.html_para5">Community legislation permits the importation of meat from certain countries where foot and mouth disease is present but only where the disease is restricted to specific areas. Imports are permitted only from parts of the country that are free of disease or under strict conditions that ensure the meat does not come from any animal that may have come in contact with foot and mouth disease before, during and after slaughter. These provisions are in line with the guidelines set out in the Office International des Epizooties International Animal Health Code 2001.
<P>

<a name="11024w11.html_para6">If there is an outbreak of disease likely to present a risk to human or animal health such as foot and mouth disease, Community legislation allows us to take appropriate safeguard action, which may include a ban on imports of meat from all, or parts, of that country.

 We are aware that movement restrictions increase the costs of many livestock producers and others in the food chain.

<a name="11024w11.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 October 2001]:</i> Since the first case of foot and mouth disease was confirmed on 20 February 2001, the Government have announced financial assistance worth &#163;164.4 million to the farming industry (see table for cost breakdown). This supplements payments to date of &#163;1,016 million <sup>1</sup>  in compensation for compulsory slaughter of stock, &#163;26.2 million <sup>1</sup>  in compensation for seized or destroyed items, and a further &#163;185 million <sup>2</sup>  paid to date to farmers in respect of the

livestock welfare disposal scheme. UK farmers are also expected to receive around &#163;3 billion in support under the Common Agricultural Policy in 2000&#150;01.
<P>

<a name="11024w11.html_para7">In addition, some farmers will be benefiting from the range of other measures we have put in place to help enterprises affected by foot and mouth, such as targeted trade development and marketing activities and the Countryside Agency's scheme to provide matched funding to voluntary organisations for the relief of distress. The hon. Member will also be aware that the revenue departments have been asked to take a sympathetic view, on a case-by-case basis, of businesses affected by the foot and mouth outbreak. They have so far helped over 18,000 businesses by agreeing to defer tax, national insurance contributions and VAT for periods of mainly between three and 12 months.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11024w11.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 October 2001]:</i> Our current estimate of the cost of compensation that will be paid because of the foot and mouth disease outbreak is &#163;1.216 billion.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11024w11.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The criteria for lifting Form D notices are governed by EU rules for the control of foot and mouth disease (FMD). This requires a clinical inspection of all stock on premises within three kilometres of an infected premise, commencing at least 21 days after preliminary cleansing and disinfection of the premise.
<P>

<a name="11024w11.html_para8">There is also a requirement for serological testing of all premises with sheep and goats for evidence of FMD infection. This may commence 21 days after slaughter of the animals and preliminary disinfection. If all the inspections and blood tests prove negative for FMD and more than 30 days have elapsed since slaughter and preliminary disinfection, the Infected Area restrictions may be lifted.

 <i>[holding answer 19 October 2001]:</i> I plan to reduce the risk of flooding by investing in effective flood warning arrangements and in flood defences in the highest risk areas. Funding for the Department's programme is increasing from &#163;66 million in 2000&#150;01 to &#163;114 million in 2003&#150;04.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11024w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Environment Agency's flood defence programme is funded mainly by levies paid by county councils, metropolitan boroughs and unitary authorities. These levies, and other flood defence expenditure, are taken into account in determining each council's flood defence standard spending assessment (SSA) for the following year.




<P>
<P><I>24 Oct 2001 : Column: 271W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11024w12.html_para0">North Yorkshire county council's flood defence SSA for 2001&#150;02 was &#163;2,423,000; the council paid a levy to the Environment Agency of &#163;2,469,192 and I understand that they have no other flood defence expenditure. However, this has to be seen against an historic failure of some local authorities, including those in Yorkshire, to invest adequate sums to maintain and renew defences over many years.

<a name="11024w12.html_para1">The Government can compensate authorities collectively for expenditure up to the aggregate 4.2 per cent. increase provided for in Spending Review 2000 but to do otherwise would mean unfairly limiting the increase in other parts of the Environment, Cultural and Protective Services SSA block. Of course a local authority is able to utilise the funds provided for those services it judges a priority.
<P>

<a name="11024w12.html_para2">The Government have recently made additional funds available to the Environment Agency to meet flood defence expenditure in the current year. Alongside funds made available during the previous year, Government have now met almost all the emergency response and repair costs that the Agency incurred in the autumn/winter 2000 floods. In addition for both years it has met the design and feasibility costs of river flood defence schemes in order to accelerate their implementation. This represents a substantial contribution to the exceptional costs arising from those floods and the Yorkshire region is a major beneficiary. These additional funds have the effect of reducing the levy increase necessary to deliver the appropriate flood defence service in the region; we now expect the local authorities to make a proportionate contribution.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11024w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Personal imports into the UK of meat from countries outside the EU are restricted to one kilogram per person of meat in a hermetically sealed container. People travelling from other EU countries can bring with them up to 10 kg of meat products per person, for their own consumption. However, if there is an outbreak of disease likely to present a risk to human or animal health such as foot and mouth disease (FMD), appropriate safeguard action is taken, which may include a ban on imports of meat from all, or parts, of that country. In those circumstances, personal imports may effectively be prohibited.
<P>

<a name="11024w12.html_para3">We have introduced improved publicity to ensure that travellers are aware of the restrictions on what may be imported. Posters have been placed at main airports and information is being provided to travellers by the travel industry and by British embassies abroad.

<a name="11024w12.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 If any third country experiences an outbreak of disease likely to present a risk to human or animal health (such as foot and mouth disease) European Community legislation allows us to take appropriate safeguard action. This may include a ban on imports of meat from all, or parts, of that country. We have recently taken such action in respect of Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, Swaziland, Uruguay and Zimbabwe. EU law lays down the protection measures to be implemented by a member state if they experience such a disease outbreak. These include a ban on the movement of susceptible animals, export restrictions on their products and the slaughter of infected animals.
<P>

<a name="11024w12.html_para4">All meat and meat products imported from third countries, must be accompanied by veterinary certification. This must confirm that the meat is derived from animals which have been subjected to an ante-mortem inspection during the 24 hours prior to slaughter at which the animal showed no signs of foot and mouth disease or any notifiable disease.
<P>

<a name="11024w12.html_para5">All meat and meat products imported into the UK from third countries must enter at designated UK Border Inspection Posts (BIPs) where they are subject to veterinary inspections. All consignments are subject to documentary and identity checks and at least 20 per cent. of consignments undergo physical checks. These ensure import conditions are met and that the products remain in a satisfactory condition during transport.
<P>

<a name="11024w12.html_para6">No matter what level of import controls are in place, it will never be possible to guarantee that no exotic disease could be imported into this country. It remains vital that farmers take effective precautions to minimise the possibility of spread of any disease that may occur, whatever its source.

This has been particularly so during the period since the mid 1980s&#151;when it was evident that agricultural production in a number of major sectors (cereals, milk, beef, wine) was running well ahead of consumption and export opportunities. This gave rise to structural surpluses and budgetary pressures. The principal adjustments to this policy since 1997 include:

<a name="11024w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 There are currently 59 fugitives held in extradition custody. The power of provisional arrest means that in some cases the fugitive will have been remanded into custody before receipt of the formal extradition request. In some cases, the fugitive may be serving a domestic sentence, pending completion of which, no surrender can be ordered or take place. The table therefore provides the date of arrest in respect of each requesting jurisdiction. We are not aware of any case involving a supplementary or subsequent request. It is not policy or practice to list the names of those who are the subject of extradition proceedings.

 There is known to have been some under-recording of antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) in a few police force areas. With the co-operation of Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) we are therefore undertaking a one-off reconciliation exercise to establish any differences between the numbers of ASBOs known to the police and the data from court returns. I will write to the hon. Member when the information becomes available.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will introduce legislation to require sentences to state, when passing sentence, <i>(a)</i> the existence of and <i>(b)</i> the potential effect on the date of earliest release of the home detention curfew scheme; and if he will make a statement.

<a name="11024w15.html_spnew9"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 In January 1998 the then Lord Chief Justice issued a practice direction to the courts requiring them to explain the practical effect of the custodial sentences they imposed. This aimed to ensure transparency in sentencing for the benefit of the defendant, any victim and the public.
<P>

<a name="11024w15.html_para1">The practice direction does not prescribe a form of words in which the court's explanation should be given. It does, however, provide models to be adapted as necessary. These models do not cover the possibility of home detention curfew (HDC) since they pre-date its introduction, but the direction does make it clear that they are based on the statutory provisions in place on 1 January 1998 and will require modification if those provisions are materially amended. Since HDC can clearly be considered a "material amendment" it is appropriate for inclusion in the court's explanation. However, a sentencing court is not in a position to know whether the offender before it will be eligible for consideration for HDC or, if eligible, whether it will be granted. I am satisfied that this practice direction is adequate to promote transparency in sentencing and that legislation is not necessary.

<a name="11024w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 No applications have been received to impose child curfew schemes under section 14 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. Sections 48 and 49 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, which took effect on 1 August 2001, have recently extended the upper age limit to 15 and allowed the police, as well as local authorities, to initiate schemes. Local areas are assessing the implications of these changes.

 Persons detained in prison solely while their application for asylum is being considered, or where awaiting removal following a failed asylum application, or deportation by order of a court following the completion of a prison sentence of more than 12 months are immigration detainees.

<sup>(20)</sup> Published guidance on Public Sector Comparators notes that: "Accounting Officers should not rely solely on a straight comparison of a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) bid to its Public Sector Comparator (PSC), which should never be regarded as a pass/fail test but instead as a quantitative way of informing judgment". (Treasury Taskforce Technical Note No. 5: How to construct a public sector comparator).<P>

<P>

<sup>(21)</sup> Details of individual payments to Contractors under Private Finance Initiative contracts are usually regarded as commercially confidential. Aggregate figures of estimated payments under all Private Finance Initiative contracts for the years 2001&#150;02 to 2025&#150;26 were published in Table C18 of the Budget 2001 "Red Book".<P>

<P>

<sup>(22)</sup> The value of the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) contract and therefore that of outstanding payments, is entirely dependant on demand and so cannot be forecast with any greater accuracy. At this stage, before the Bureau has become fully operational, estimated cost savings cannot be calculated.<P>

<P>

<sup>(23)</sup> It is unlikely that there will be any savings compared with the previous passport production operation. Following the passport problems of 1999, United Kingdom Passport Service (UKPS) embarked on a large number of initiatives to improve the service. These resulted in major changes to the system and associated hardware and the requirement of the PFI partners to increase all their resources to match capacity. The delay to the implementation of the system at all offices has delayed the income stream for both partners.<P>

<P>

<sup>(24)</sup> A PSC was not calculated on the grounds that this was not necessary for projects which would not have gone ahead otherwise, because public sector capital provision was not available. The reasonableness of the bid was tested by comparing it with the nearest public sector example, ie the cost per place of local authority secure accommodation. The estimated cost saving has been calculated by deducting the Net Present Value (NPV) from the average of the PSCs for Rainsbrook and Hassockfield Secure Training Centres (STCs) (both 40 place STCs, similar to Medway).<P>

<P>

<sup>(25)</sup> No PSC constructed. The directorate decided that it would be unrealistic to construct a conventional PSC. Detailed plans for a conventional solution were not available and the bids received proposed packages of risks, costs and benefits which were different from each other and from the ideas for a conventional solution which had emerged from a 1994 review by SEMA.<P>

 The Government are strongly committed to enhance international effort to promote development in Africa. We have in the past four years built strong programmes on a range of issues from conflict reduction to HIV/AIDS and education, to support for anti-corruption strategies. We are also leading the way in formulating innovative and new ways of disbursing funds, for example, providing direct budgetary support to those African countries with the most development focused policies.

<a name="11024w19.html_para2">This is a vitally important moment in the development of Africa. Not only have African countries recently joined together to agree the New African Initiative, but the Prime Minister has also signalled his own personal commitment to Africa in this Parliament, ensuring that it has also become a focus of the G8 for this year as well.

 We are one of the principal donors providing technical and other support to the National Elections Commission, to help ensure that the elections scheduled for next May are conducted freely, fairly and fully in accordance with democratic principles. Much of the rest of our development programme promotes democracy indirectly, by strengthening the processes of governance. Examples include our work to increase the accountability of the agencies responsible for security (police, army, and intelligence services), our support for judicial reform, for reform of governance in the paramount chiefdoms, the anti-corruption commission, and for strengthening the ability of civil society and the media to scrutinise government policy. Conflict resolution is being addressed by our support to the processes of disarmament, demobilisation, and reintegration of ex-combatants. Here we are providing logistical assistance and other funding to the implementing agency, as well as funding a reintegration programme in Port Loko with the specific purpose of encouraging local communities to accept returning ex-combatants.

 Twenty-three countries have now qualified for relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, with three countries Bolivia, Mozambique and Uganda having completed the HIPC process. More than $53 billion of debt relief has been agreed for those countries, which together owe $74 billion, so a major part of their debt has been written off. The money released is spent on poverty reduction.
<P>

<a name="11024w20.html_para0">The impact of that debt reduction means that social expenditure (primarily on health and education) in those countries is projected to rise by $1.7 billion per year. On average, these countries are expected to spend more than three times as much on social sectors in 2001&#150;02 as on debt service. We hope that a further three countries&#151;Ghana, Ethiopia and Sierra Leone&#151;will reach their Decision Point this year. But the prospects of the 11 remaining eligible countries qualifying for relief in the near future are slim, as they are affected by conflict or have yet to demonstrate their commitment to reform.

 Education is a precondition for development and poverty reduction.

We are strongly committed to the international development targets of achieving universal primary education (UPE) by 2015 and gender equity in primary and secondary schooling by 2005. My Department's education strategy paper, "The challenge of universal primary education", recognises that achievement of UPE requires unwavering commitment to gender equality. Developing country Governments need to mainstream gender through all their policies and practices and have a real and sustained commitment to change. Since 1997 we have committed over &#163;600 million to support sustainable primary education programmes, all with a strong focus on gender equality. We will do more. Our paper on "Poverty elimination and the empowerment of women" also indicates our commitment to stronger collaboration and co-ordination for the achievement of gender equality among donors, including the European Union, the UN system, the World bank and other international financial institutions.

 Microcredit has a very important role to play in achieving the Millennium Development Goal to halve the proportion of people living in extreme poverty by 2015.
<P>

<a name="11024w21.html_para9">Poor people need continuous access to appropriate savings, credit and other financial services. Put together, these services help poor people take advantage of opportunities to increase their incomes and build more secure livelihoods.
<P>

<a name="11024w21.html_para10">For this reason, DFID has made multi-year investments totalling some &#163;100 million, strengthening micro-finance institutions throughout Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and the Caribbean. Its bilateral programmes and partnerships with many other agencies support the development and dissemination of best practice in micro-finance. DFID collaborates with many expert institutions in this field. They include the Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest, a coalition of donors and micro-finance practitioners developing new tools and approaches to improve delivery of micro-finance services all over the world.
<P>

<a name="11024w21.html_para11">DFID has also collaborated with the United Nations Development Programme in the Micro-Start programme, and the jointly funded micro Save Programme in East Africa that pilots and replicates new pro-poor savings methodologies. DFID also works with the International

 In 1999 the international community provided $1.816 billion in net official assistance to Russia. This year, my Department plans to provide approximately &#163;40 million, of which &#163;26 million will be through our direct programme and most of the balance through the EC. The purpose of DFID assistance to Russia is to support the Government's economic and social modernisation programme in order to reduce poverty, as set out in our country Strategy Paper 2001&#150;05 a copy of which is available in the Library. Current priorities include support to WTO accession, public administration reform and preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11024w21.html_spnew8"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The best data available are derived from annual surveys of pregnant women seeking ante-natal care. Extrapolations from the 2000 data suggest that up to 306,000 people aged 15 to 49 in Botswana and 190,000 in Namibia are HIV positive. This means that 38.5 per cent. of 15&#150;49 year olds in Botswana and 22.3 per cent. of this group in Namibia are infected. At present, no one in either country receives free anti-retroviral drugs (ARV) from the Government. The Government of Botswana plan to introduce a comprehensive scheme to provide free ARV treatment to all who are HIV positive by the end of the year. Botswana has a national Mother to Child Transmission programme that includes the provision of a single dose of Nevirapine to reduce the risk of peri-natal and ante-natal transmission of HIV.

 My Department is actively supporting the endeavours of the UN agencies&#151;including the UN World Food Programme, the Red Cross and non-governmental organisations to deliver as much food as possible through existing land convoy routes into Afghanistan.
<P>

<a name="11024w22.html_para0">We are also encouraging the opening of new land convoy routes by backing the representations of international humanitarian agencies to the Governments of neighbouring countries, requesting that they open their borders to allow the transportation of vital relief supplies into Afghanistan.

 A temporary cessation in military action would not remove our difficulties in getting supplies into Afghanistan which have been difficult for a long time and were halted after September 11 before the military campaign began.
<P>

<a name="11024w22.html_para1">The UN has recently increased its delivery of food although this is still short of what is required to lay down sufficient stocks for the winter.

 <i>[holding answer 15 October 2001]:</i> There has been a recent review of the evidence, in the journal Spinal Cord 2000, "High Dose methylprednisolone in the management of acute spinal cord injury&#151;a systematic review from a clinical perspective." Their conclusion was that,

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how much was paid, in 1990 values, to pharmacists for each prescription dispensed in each year since 1990&#150;91.  [7268]<P>

 Remuneration paid to pharmacies is intended to cover the generality of the National Health Service pharmaceutical services they provide. The scope of these services is not restricted just to dispensing prescriptions and has changed over time. The total remuneration to be paid in any given year is distributed through a system of fees and allowances, some of which relate directly to the number (and type) of prescriptions dispensed, some of which do not. However, if the total remuneration paid to pharmacies in each year is divided by the number of dispensing fees paid, the result is as set out in the table.

 On 19 October 2001, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced a &#163;1.5 million recruitment campaign, which is designed to increase the number of people interested in careers in social work and social care work in England. As well as this action to tackle recruitment problems, the Department is also working with the Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Social Services to help employers implement policies to improve recruitment and retention of staff.

 Patients who have their discharge from an acute hospital bed delayed may be awaiting transfer to other national health service care (such as intermediate care), transfer to a nursing or residential care home or for a package of care and support to allow them to return

<a name="11024w23.html_para3">Prior to June 2001 only data on delays to patients over 75 were collected centrally. From June 2001 figures have been collected for all adult patients, as well as those over 75, in order to give a more comprehensive picture of the reasons for delayed discharges.
