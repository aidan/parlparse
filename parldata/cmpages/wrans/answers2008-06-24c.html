This free advice suggests some common sense, precautionary measures that farmers can take to help reduce the risk of bovine TB transmission between cattle and between cattle and badgers.

 A number of Government departments (DEFRA, Department of Health, Food Standards Agency, Health Protection Agency, Health and Safety Executive) work together to protect the public from contracting infection caused by Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis). The potential risks to public health from exposure to wild animals infected with M. bovis are minimal, therefore no wildlife-specific public health protection measures are necessary. However, advice is available on the HPA website and from local animal health offices if people have concerns.</p>

 The Government have agreed to develop an adaptation toolkit to assist communities in adapting to change where constructing defences is not the most appropriate means of managing flood and coastal erosion risk.

Some parts of the toolkit are already in place&#151;for example strengthened planning policy for flood risk areas. Others are forthcoming.

 The intention behind the English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) measures which were introduced from August 2007 was to refocus funding on priority groups of vulnerable learners. We expect ESOL funding in 2007/08 to remain broadly similar to previous years at around &#163;300 million.</p>

 Since the code was launched in April 2007, 25 homes in four developments have reached code level 3 at design stage, with three dwellings in two developments reaching code level 4. Of these assessments, one design stage certificate for a code level 3 home has been issued and two post-construction certificates for homes which reached code level 4 have been issued since 1 May 2008.</p>

This is because of the time it takes to incorporate the code standards within the land acquisition and design process. Larger developments will inevitably take longer to reach a construction stage due to the statutory consultation process and negotiations involved.</p>

 Since 1997 the procedures for development by the Crown set out in Part IV of DOE Circular 18/84 have been revoked, following the implementation of part 7 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 in June 2006, which ended the Crown's immunity from the planning system. Crown bodies now have to apply for planning permission like any other developer subject to special arrangements for urgent development.

 My answer of 22 April 2008 provided figures on the number of children who went missing from their agreed placement for 24 hours or more during each of the years ending 31 March 2003 to 2007. Those are reproduced in table 1. These figures cannot be aggregated to give the number of children who had gone missing at least once over the five year period. This is because the same child may have gone missing from their agreed placement in more than one year and will be counted in each of those years. Aggregating the data would therefore lead to double counting.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 23 June 2008]:</i> As in previous years, the Department has received representations about aspects of the national curriculum tests, including marking. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) is responsible for the development and administration of national curriculum tests and the National Assessment Agency (NAA) administers the tests and manages the delivery contract with ETS Europe on the QCA&#146;s behalf. This function is performed independently of the Government. On completion of the test cycle, the NAA will fully evaluate the effectiveness of the test delivery systems, taking account of feedback from stakeholders, to ensure that any necessary improvements are made.</p>

 The fighting in Abyei could have posed a serious threat to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. The National Congress Party and Sudan People's Liberation Movement have shown their commitment to the CPA by agreeing a Roadmap on 8 June to resolve the Abyei dispute, which has been an obstacle to CPA implementation. We are working with both parties and international partners to implement fully the Abyei Roadmap and the CPA.</p>

 DFID is supporting action on HIV and AIDS through its country programmes in Burma, Cambodia, China, Indonesia and Vietnam. In Burma, DFID is contributing funds through a &#163;20 million contribution to a $100 million joint donor health fund, which includes support to activities in line with the national strategic plan for HIV prevention, treatment and care. In Cambodia, DFID has provided &#163;15.6 million over five years to support the Government of Cambodia&#146;s response to HIV and AIDS, and &#163;7.1 million for support to condom social marketing, which is aimed at improving condom use among high risk groups. In China, DFID is providing &#163;30 million over four and a half years to help the Government of China&#146;s national HIV and AIDS programme. This is part of a &#163;92 million programme that is also supported by the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. In Indonesia, DFID has contributed &#163;25 million over three years through the Indonesia Partnership Fund, which supports a National Action Framework on HIV and AIDS.

In both countries, DFID supports the Government&#146;s economic growth plans, focusing on the need to ensure that they bring benefits to the poor and vulnerable, particularly in rural areas. For example, in Tajikistan, our work with rural communities in the remote Zarafshan Valley has provided access to microfinance for its 270,000 population. This is already leading to the development of successful small businesses. We actively support the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development&#146;s work in the region through their Early Transition Countries Initiative (ETCI). A recent independent evaluation of the ETC Multi Donor Fund (we have contributed &#163;7.5 million over four years so far) confirmed that this was leading to a substantial increase in EBRD operations in most of the region.</p>

 To implement the Three Faces of India plan, the Department for International Development (DFID) will spend &#163;825 million during the period 2008-09 to 2010-11. A budget has not been set beyond this period, but, depending on developments, the overall aid allocation is likely to decline as India becomes a Middle Income Country.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what recent reports his Department has received on gender equality in primary school enrolment in Yemen. [212710]</p>

 In May 2008, the Yemen Ministry of Education reported to the Joint Annual Review of the Government&#146;s Basic Education Development Strategy. This is the most recent report the Department for International Development (DFID) has received, and includes data on gender equality in enrolment for the first nine years of education (basic education). According to the report, total girls&#146; enrolment in basic education was 1.8 million in 2006-07, compared to 2.5 million for boys. This represents a gender gap in enrolment of 29 per cent. However, many girls drop out of school early, with only 18 per cent. remaining until the last year of basic education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_676"><a name="80624w0029.htm_para6"><a name="080624128000102">DFID is contributing &#163;15 million over six years (2004-09) to a multi-donor basic education programme. This programme aims to increase enrolments for both boys and girls, and to improve the quality of basic education. It also includes targeted measures to improve girls&#146; admission and retention.</p>
