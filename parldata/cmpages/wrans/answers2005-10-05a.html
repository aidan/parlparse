</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">Information on the number of young people who have applied, enrolled and received EMA is available at Local Education Authority level, but not at constituency level. Attached is a breakdown by school/college of 16, 17, 18 and 19 year old students who have received EMA during the academic year 2004/2005 in the Local Education Authorities of Gloucestershire, Somerset, Bath and North East Somerset, City of Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire. If a young person attended and received payment from more than one institute then they will be counted more than once in this report.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">During the Academic year 2004/2005 EMA was available to all 16 years olds across England who met the eligibility criteria and also to those 17, 18 and 19 years olds who reside in former EMA pilot areas (and meet eligibility criteria).</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">Although there were no pilot areas in Gloucestershire, West of England and Somerset Local Learning and Skills Council (LSC) areas the attached data shows some 17 and 18 years olds having received EMA payments. This is because either the young person travels across area borders to attend school/college (assessment is based upon residence of young person) or they have moved residence from a non-pilot area during the academic year.</p>

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister recognises that there may some net additional costs to FRAs during the transition from the existing to the new arrangements and is committed to the new burdens principles whereby it will meet net additional costs to FRAs arising from the project. From the point when the last centre goes live, the new control centres are expected to achieve, on average, a steady state saving of some 30 per cent. over existing arrangements, which will result in net savings to each fire and rescue authority. However, figures are not yet available for each authority, as the FiReControl business case only exists at national level. We are working closely with fire and rescue authorities through the FiReControl Finance Working Group to give them the information they need for budgeting at local level.

<p><a name="st_53"><a name="51005w07.html_spnew1"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 The 50db threshold for benefit payment was set following the advice of experts in audio logy and the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council who determined that this level of loss equated to 20 per cent. disablement in the Industrial Injuries Scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51005w07.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_27">The Industrial Injuries Advisory Council advised that noise-induced hearing loss is only slowly progressive. Thus a person whose claim for disablement benefit has been disallowed is unlikely to suffer deterioration in their hearing loss due to noise to the degree that they fulfil the criteria for diagnosing occupational deafness (prescribed disease (PD) A10) in less than three years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51005w07.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_28">A claim cannot be made less than three years after the previous disallowance of a claim. This is because the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council advised that noise-induced deafness is only slowly progressive. A person who fails to fulfil the diagnostic criterion of a 50dB loss is unlikely to suffer deterioration in their hearing loss due to noise to the degree that they fulfil the criteria in less than three years.

 On 16 February this year my right hon.

The initiative aims to change attitudes within the general public at local and regional levels through communication projects. Research shows that getting attitude change is the best first step to behaviour change. Defra, working with partners (EST, CT, DTI, EA, DFT, UKCIP), NGOs and others, will begin implementing this communication initiative in 2005. A main component of the initiative is a Fund and grants from this to community and other groups will enable the establishment of local projects. This will be supported with a website, a communicators guide and local activities. The website will link with Defra&#039;s children&#039;s section which addresses climate change consistent with the main initiative.

The underlying decrease is a result of changing waste disposal practices and a reduction in fugitive emissions from fuels. Agriculture emissions were reasonably steady until the foot and mouth outbreak of 2001 led to reduced livestock numbers and a subsequent reduction in enteric fermentation.

The overall downward trend in N+O emissions is due to the gradual rise in emissions from energy being offset by a larger decrease in the industrial sector and general downward trend in agricultural emissions.

 The original intention of the Animal By-Products Regulation (EC) No. 1774/2002 was to impose a complete ban on former foodstuffs containing products of animal origin being sent to landfill from 1 January 2006. However, on 20 May this year, prior to a working group meeting in Brussels on 23 May, officials from my Department along with those in other member states received papers from the European Commission indicating a change in the Commission&#039;s approach to implementing the ban. Subsequently, at the meeting on 23 May, the Commission announced its intention to allow pre-treated former foodstuffs that member states believe do not pose a risk to animal or public health to continue to go to landfill, under the control of the EU Landfill Directive rather than the Animal By-Products Regulation. The Commission has now tabled a draft amending Regulation to bring this into effect. The draft covers former foodstuffs that are not considered safe to be fed to livestock but which can safely be disposed of to landfill or treated in an alternative system; and, those that can be fed to livestock (bread, pasta, etc) or be disposed of to landfill. The measure does not apply to raw meat and raw fish which are already banned from disposal to landfill and which must be disposed of in accordance with the Regulation i.e. by rendering, incineration, composting or treatment by biogas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51005w09.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_53">The Department did not ask the Commission to reverse the complete ban on former foodstuffs being sent to landfill. However, in the light of discussions with a variety of parties, we drew the Commission&#039;s attention to the difficulties they had with compliance, and particularly those that small retailers anticipated. We suggested to the Commission that these difficulties could be lessened if the requirements for commercial documentation and transport were brought more into line with existing environmental controls, and if alternative treatments were to be permitted providing livestock were not able to have access to the treated product. Nevertheless, we support the principle that as far as the Animal By-Products Regulation is concerned the ban on landfill should apply only to those former foodstuffs which present a risk to animal and public health. The Government is committed to reducing the UK&#039;s reliance on landfill, in order to reduce its environmental impact and because landfilling is a missed opportunity to recover value from waste. Therefore the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>5 Oct 2005 : Column 2808W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

Most recently, officials met a number of waste management companies and the Environment Services Association on 13 April, the UK Renderers&#039; Association on 10 May and 21 June, the Composting Association on 27 May and the Regulated Incinerator Operators on 21 June.

This trend is expected to continue with around 58 per cent. scans taking place in the NHS and 24 per cent. more in the independent sector, for NHS patients, by 2007&#150;08.

<p><a name="st_90"><a name="51005w12.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 The Department conducted a capacity planning exercise with strategic health authorities in 2004, which demonstrated that more diagnostic services were required, in order to meet waiting times targets for hospital treatment. Capacity plans showed the following:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36">Between 2004&#150;05 and 2007&#150;08, magnetic resonance imaging activity needs to increase by more than 100 per cent.</p>

 Until April 2002, local councils regulated independent sector care homes and health authorities regulated nursing homes.

The Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, was able to include an adjustment for the growth area initiative in this round of allocations. The growth area adjustment informs the target position of PCTs within the growth areas. It is the PCTs&#039; target positions that determine their fair shares of the revenue allocations.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment she has made of the level of abuse of methadone.  [6963]</p>








<p><a name="st_120"><a name="51005w15.html_spnew6"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 There have been no formal assessments made on the level of abuse of methadone. However, the Department recognises the key role that effective substitute prescribing has to play in meeting our overall aim of offering high quality treatment to drug misusers. It is because of this commitment that the Department published <i>Drug Misuse and Dependence&#151;Guidelines on Clinical Management (1999),</i> which is widely regarded as being extremely successful in assisting prescribers in offering appropriate treatment to their patients. Part of this also tackles the issue of diversion of methadone through advice on supervised consumption.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51005w15.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_95">Building on this, the National Treatment Agency (NTA), which has a remit to improve the availability and quality of drug treatment, has just completed an audit of prescribing services in England which will be available shortly. The NTA will also be undertaking series of reviews of community prescribing services with the Healthcare Commission, later in 2005. The NTA has performance management structures in place to effectively tackle those drug action teams assessed as underperforming, as far as provision of drug treatment is concerned.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51005w15.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_96">One of the key measures used to assess the quality of substitute prescribing, including levels of diversion, is the number of drug related deaths associated with its use. In 2003, the latest year for which figures are available, 167 deaths associated with the use of methadone were reported. This compares with 286 in 1999, a reduction of 42 per cent.

<p>
<a name="51005w15.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_97">As part of our ongoing commitment to continue to develop improved practise in substitute prescribing, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence will, within a comprehensive package of work that it will be undertaking on drug treatment, do a specific appraisal on the clinical effectiveness of methadone in the treatment of drug misuse.

 By 2007&#150;08, we plan to deliver an unparalleled expansion in most diagnostic services to reduce waiting time for patients further. Most of this expansion will be delivered through increasing investment and productivity in the national health service, using the record levels of NHS funding for the next three years and making the best use of existing equipment and facilities. These plans are based on understanding and meeting local needs for diagnostic services, which have been developed through working closely with local health communities to understand their needs for extra capacity. While the independent sector has a key part to play, NHS providers of diagnostics services also need to ensure that they are using their diagnostic capacity to the full.

<p><a name="st_159"><a name="51005w19.html_spnew7"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 Compulsory inspections of the hospital environment are undertaken every year through the patient environment action team (PEAT) process. This includes inspection of a sample of wards, but goes beyond this to assess a wide range of public and patient areas. The PEAT process is broad and considers more than hygiene standards, but cleanliness, including specific mention of wards, is weighted in the final score in recognition of its importance to patients. In addition to this national programme, many trusts undertake regular local inspections of their wards and other clinical areas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51005w19.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_119">Standards for the patient environment have risen since PEAT began in 2000. Then, around a third of hospitals were rated poor or unacceptable. Today, 95 per cent. of national health service trusts are rated as acceptable or better.

<p>
<a name="51005w19.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_120">Most scientific evidence stresses hand hygiene and sound clinical practices as being particularly important in preventing healthcare associated infections (HCAIs). It is unlikely that a more stringent environmental inspection regime alone would significantly reduce HCAI rates.

The information gained is being fed into the implementation plans for prison and probation areas. A national offender manager and 10 regional offender managers have also been appointed. The latter will play the main role in commissioning and will help to build partnership working locally. A performance test for prisons on the Isle of Sheppey has been announced and consideration is being given to the best organisational design to support the NOMS reforms.

<i>[holding answer 20 July 2005]:</i> The West Midlands Route Utilisation Strategy was published by the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) on 21 July. The Strategy concluded that Coventry Arena station would present low levels of traffic for most of the week with occasional large event demands requiring train capacity far in excess of the current provision. The cost of rail provision to meet these high peaks in demand would be very high. Consequently a proposal to meet this demand had not been evaluated by the promoter and no business case for the station had been received. The SRA concluded that it was unable to support the inclusion of the station on the Coventry-Nuneaton route.

<p>
<a name="51005w22.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_136">The SRA wrote to Coventry city council on 24 August 2004 identifying a number of areas of concern with the outline business case. If the council wishes to pursue the proposal, it will need to address those concerns and submit to the Department a viable and funded business case.
