<a name="50322w01.html_dpthd0"><h3 align=center>TRANSPORT</h3>

<a name="50322w01.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>Airports</h3>


<p><a name="50322w01.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what discussions he has had with <i>(a)</i> BAA and <i>(b)</i> other airport companies about improving (i) the facilities and (ii) cleanliness at UK airports; and if he will make a statement.  [221325]</p>




<p><a name="50322w01.html_spnew0"><b> Charlotte Atkins  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 14 March 2005]:</i> Regular meetings with BAA and other airport operators present a good opportunity to discuss a range of airport issues. However, the refurbishment of existing airport facilities and routine methods of maintaining cleanliness are primarily matters for the operators to decide, with appropriate regard to all relevant health and safety legislation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322w01.html_para0">
Enforcement arrangements are subject to local arrangements at each airport but generally the Health and Safety Executive is responsible for enforcement airside, while local authority inspectors are responsible for enforcement at terminal buildings and landside activities. Local authority inspectors are also responsible for enforcing food hygiene and food safety legislation throughout airports, and they consider health, safety and welfare issues affecting employees, including provision and adequacy of welfare activities.

<p><a name="50322w01.html_wqn1"><b> Geraldine Smith: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many pensioners in Morecambe and Lunesdale he expects will benefit from free bus transport.  [223475]</p>




<p><a name="50322w01.html_spnew1"><b> Charlotte Atkins: </b> 
 From April 2006, the Government are extending the existing statutory minimum requirement for concessionary fares so that people aged 60 and over and disabled people in England will be guaranteed free off-peak travel on their local bus services, with no charge for the pass.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322w01.html_para1">
In Morecambe and Lunesdale, all residents over 60 will benefit from free local bus travel. According to the 2001 census, there were then 20,223 pensioners (men aged 65 and over and women aged 60 and over) and 22,549 people over 60 in Morecambe and Lunesdale.
</p>




<a name="50322w01.html_sbhd2"><h3 align=center>Congestion Charge</h3>


<p><a name="50322w01.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. George Osborne: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how much has been spent on congestion <i>(a)</i> charges and <i>(b)</i> penalty charge notices by the Department since the commencement of the congestion charging scheme.  [213825]</p>






<br>&nbsp;<br><i>22 Mar 2005 : Column 630W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>



<p><a name="50322w01.html_spnew2"><b> Charlotte Atkins: </b> 
 Information on congestion charges and penalty notices incurred by vehicles provided to the Department by the Government Car and Despatch Agency is included in the response given by the Minister for the Cabinet Office on 28 February 2005, <i>Official Report</i>, column 957W.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322w01.html_para2">
The central Department has spent &#163;1,168.87 on congestion charges incurred by civil servants on official business. This figure does not include the Department&#039;s agencies as they do not record the charges separately from other travel costs and the information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322w01.html_para3">
The Department does not usually pay congestion penalty charges, as civil servants are personally responsible for such fines. One penalty of &#163;40 was paid soon after the charge was introduced as the penalty was incurred as the result of a payments error.
</p>




<a name="50322w01.html_sbhd3"><h3 align=center>Crossrail</h3>


<p><a name="50322w01.html_wqn3"><b> Clive Efford: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) whether a full cost benefit analysis has been made of the need for a Crossrail station at Woolwich; and if he will make a statement;  [223126]
</p>



<p>(2) what consultation has been carried out to ascertain the views of people in southeast London on a Crossrail station at Woolwich;  [223127]
</p>



<p>(3) what assessment has been made of whether a Crossrail station at Woolwich would meet the Government&#039;s integrated transport criteria for new rail schemes;  [223128]
</p>



<p>(4) if he will ensure that the merits of a station at Woolwich are properly assessed before the Crossrail Bill is presented to the House;  [223129]
</p>



<p>(5) what estimate has been made of the costs of building a station at Woolwich after the Crossrail link to Abbey Wood has opened.  [223130]</p>




<p><a name="50322w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 A Crossrail station at Woolwich was considered during the development of the project, but could not be justified on the current estimates of cost, passenger numbers and benefits. Crossrail will pass under Woolwich in deep tunnels and the cost of constructing an underground station would therefore be high. In view of this, powers have not been sought for a station at Woolwich in the Bill introduced into Parliament on 22 February 2005. However, the alignment of the tunnels has been designed so as to allow a station at Woolwich to be developed in the future, if it could be justified at that time. An area of land has also been safeguarded for this purpose.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322w01.html_para4">
No estimate has been made of the potential cost of constructing a station at Woolwich once Crossrail is operational. However, this would entail closure of the route from Custom House to Abbey Wood for a number of years, and therefore the cost would be greater than for construction before operation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322w01.html_para5">
Cross London Rail Links Ltd., the company set up to develop and promote the Crossrail project, consulted widely including two 12-week rounds of public consultation on the project. During both rounds, public information centres were held at Woolwich and Abbey Wood, to provide information and seek residents&#039; views.

These were supported by mail drops to those potentially affected, newsletters, a dedicated website and a 24-hour telephone helpline.

<a name="50322w01.html_sbhd4"><h3 align=center>Gatwick Express Service</h3>


<p><a name="50322w01.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Hammond: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) what safety issues <i>(a)</i> at stations and <i>(b)</i> on trains were considered prior to the publication of the Strategic Rail Authority&#039;s Brighton Main Line Route Utilisation Study proposal to remove the all day Gatwick Express Service;  [222162]
</p>



<p>(2) what account the Strategic Rail Authority has taken of the safety report commissioned by BAA and submitted to the Strategic Rail Authority in consideration of its plans to remove the all day Gatwick Express;  [222163]
</p>



<p>(3) if he will make a statement on the changes proposed for the Gatwick Express Service set out in the Strategic Rail Authority&#039;s Brighton Main Line Route Utilisation Study;  [222164]
</p>



<p>(4) what account the Strategic Rail Authority took of the expected increase in numbers of passengers using Gatwick airport outlined in the Air Transport Policy in its Brighton Main Line Route Utilisation Study proposals to remove the all day Gatwick Express service;  [222168]
</p>



<p>(5) what assessment he has made of the expected change in road use that would ensue if proposals to remove the all day Gatwick Express Service, as set out in the Strategic Rail Authority&#039;s Brighton Main Line Route Utilisation Study, are implemented.  [222177]</p>




<p><a name="50322w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The draft Brighton Main Line Route Utilisation Strategy does not propose removing the London Victoria to Gatwick airport service. It proposes keeping the fast, Gatwick to Victoria services, and increasing their frequency from four to eight trains per hour. Services will be extended to cover south coast destinations. In developing the strategy the SRA reviewed a number of documents and data sources to understand future growth demands, this included &quot;The Future of Air Transport&quot; White Paper. The SRA and Network Rail are continuing to work closely together regarding passenger handling issues at Gatwick airport station, and are considering the issues identified in BAA&#039;s safety assessment. Given that the RUS proposals aim to improve the performance and reliability of train services on the Brighton Main Line, making services more attractive to passengers, it is not expected to have an adverse effect on road congestion. The views raised in consultation will be taken into account before the final Brighton Main Line Route Utilisation Strategy is issued.

<a name="50322w01.html_sbhd5"><h3 align=center>Penalty Payments</h3>


<p><a name="50322w01.html_wqn5"><b> John McDonnell: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport whether he plans to waive penalty payments for train operating companies involved in industrial disputes.  [221006]</p>




<p><a name="50322w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 Penalty payments are one aspect of franchising. Under the Railways Bill, responsibility for passenger rail franchising would pass to the Secretary of State for Transport and Scottish Ministers as 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>22 Mar 2005 : Column 632W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
appropriate. Whether and how these specific powers will be used in the future is an issue we will want to consider once Parliament has completed its consideration of the Bill.

<p><a name="50322w01.html_wqn6"><b> Mr. Gill: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many recorded <i>(a)</i> deaths and <i>(b)</i> serious injuries there were on railway lines resulting from trespass in (i) Leicester and (ii) England and Wales in each year since 1997.  [222892]</p>




<p><a name="50322w01.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The Health and Safety Executive&#039;s Railway Inspectorate (HMRI) advises that between 1997 and 2004 there was one fatality (a confirmed suicide in 2000&#150;01), but the provision of more specific detailed information in the form requested would entail disproportionate cost.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322w01.html_para6">
Details of the number of fatalities and injuries resulting from railway trespass in Great Britain since 1997 are set out in the following table. HMRI advises that the provision of trespass data for England and Wales since 1997 could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

The second set of conclusions represents the Environment Council&#039;s recommendations to the Spring European Council on climate change, specifically medium to long term emission reduction strategies and targets.

Council conclusions on the Environment Council&#039;s contribution to the Spring European Council were adopted after a full discussion. Almost all delegations supported the presidency text and emphasised that environmental protection and economic growth went hand in hand. The Secretary of State supported the idea of a statement of principles for sustainable development, but emphasised that these should be integrated into the revised EU Sustainable Development Strategy. In this context, the Secretary of State referred to the recently published UK Sustainable Development Strategy, an executive summary of which was circulated to delegations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322w03.html_para9">
Council conclusions on climate change were adopted following a debate. The conclusions reaffirm the December 2004 Environment Council conclusions, referring to the global nature of climate change and the requirement for international co-operation, and to recent scientific research under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on the stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations required to meet the 2 degrees centigrade objective. Drawing on this research, the conclusions suggest the consideration of pathways to 2020 and 2050 for greenhouse gas emission reduction in developed countries. The agreed text makes clear that the EU wishes to explore the future framework with others and that the language on emissions reductions is an evidence-based assessment rather than a prescriptive call for action. The conclusions also invite the European Commission to continue its analysis of costs and benefits of reduction strategies, including the costs of inaction.

The Commission referred ministers to the recent statements to the Competitiveness Council and European Parliament on this issue, and other delegations took the view it was too early for Environment Council to discuss the scope of this measure. Austria, with support from a number of member states, raised an issue concerning the Commission&#039;s approach to national safeguard actions in relation to GM maize variety MON 810.

<p><a name="50322w10.html_spnew4"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The Sentencing Guidelines Council has no plans to set up any mechanism for the independent assessment of prevalence. This issue would form part of the sentencing argument in each particular case taking into account the guideline on seriousness.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322w10.html_para1">
That guideline states that generally the seriousness of an individual case should be judged on its own dimensions of harm and culpability rather than as part of a collective social harm. There may be exceptional local circumstances that arise which may lead a court to decide that prevalence should influence sentencing levels. But the guideline says that it is essential that sentencers both have supporting evidence from an external source (for example the local Criminal Justice Board) to justify claims that a particular crime is prevalent in their area and are satisfied that there is a compelling need to treat the offence more seriously than elsewhere. Sentencers must sentence within the guidelines once the prevalence has been addressed.

[208275]</p>




<p><a name="50322w10.html_spnew9"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 sets out the requirements that a witness statement must fulfil in order to be admissible in court. These include that it must be signed by the maker and contain a declaration by the maker that it is true to the best of his knowledge and belief. There is no provision in the Act governing the method or means by which that written statement is arrived at. As a matter of law, therefore, there is nothing to constrain police forces from adopting a policy whereby the text of a statement could be submitted or amended by e-mail.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322w10.html_para4">
Such an approach would however usually be inadvisable and inappropriate where a statement was likely to be challenged in court, which is the majority of cases. For example, a police officer may need to interview a witness in person to find out whether an offence has actually been committed and the legal elements. The process of interview also enables the officer to assess the quality of the evidence which a witness would be likely to give in court and inform the prosecutor as may be necessary. Finally, it could be difficult for the police to assess whether statements given by e-mail were influenced by pressure or intimidation exerted on a witness by the alleged offender or their associates.

A report of findings was produced and distributed to all local authorities. Training has been made available to Children&#039;s Information Services and to early years staff to improve their practice. A very wide range of information and resources on topics such as purchasing and using culturally sensitive toys and books and resources for staff about the Muslim culture is available via links on our website to those of other organisations.

The information from these projects is already informing the design and implementation of our current and future childcare initiatives. The Sure Start Unit&#039;s own work on childcare is part of the wider DfES plans to ensure that all education services engage with Muslim communities.

In particular, we will ensure that, through the significant expansion of provision in the Government&#039;s 10-year strategy on child care, we and our local authority partners work hard to further improve access to culturally sensitive childcare for Muslim families. Finally, our support and inspection arrangements for local authority childcare activities will assess that local authorities ensure local services respond sensitively to the Muslim communities in their area.

 The Government provide funding for higher education through the Higher Education and Funding Council for England (HEFCE). &#163;6,332 million in recurrent funding has been allocated for universities and colleges in England for 2005&#150;06. The total grant, which represents an overall increase of 5.6 per cent. compared with 2004&#150;05, provides an above inflation increase for teaching, &#163;120 million more for research and an extra 26,000 student places.

 In framing the variable fees policy, including the bursaries policy, we looked at overseas experience, especially in Australia and Ontario. We also looked at the results of offering Opportunity Bursaries to potential university students from poor backgrounds in selected parts of England.

<p><a name="50322w18.html_spnew2"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 Exactly how much the minimum standard bursaries cost any university each year will depend on what fees they decide to charge, and on the make-up of their student body in that year.

 The letter of guidance from the Secretary of State to the Director for Fair Access was published in October 2004, and is available on the DfES website. It suggests (section 6.1) that the director should expect the most, in terms of bursaries and financial support, from institutions whose records suggest that they have the farthest to go in terms of securing a broadly based intake of students. However, it also makes clear that it is for institutions to make proposals, and for the director to decide whether to approve them.

 On the basis of information provided by Ufi, 1.55 million learners have enrolled on learndirect courses since April 2000. 624,000 of these learners did not complete their course. The learndirect Winter Barometer Report 2005 identified lack of time (23 per cent.), work commitments (16 per cent.), problems accessing course (15 per cent.) and family/personal circumstances (15 per cent.) as the key reasons for non-completion. Current learner satisfaction is at an all time high of 90 per cent.

The Local Network Fund is an important part of the Change for Children programme which involves the creation of local children&#039;s trusts to plan and commission services for young people. We are currently finalising our advice and planning guidance to local authorities and other partners on the establishment and development of children&#039;s trusts. This will include transitional arrangements for programmes such as the Local Network Fund. We will take account of the success of the current management and delivery arrangements for the Local Network Fund in finalising the transitional arrangements.

The admission and selection of students is a matter for individual institutions. Therefore the decision on whether or not to recruit such students rests with the universities, and they would take such decisions according to the merit and potential of the individual applicants. Although there are currently no Government programmes for widening participation aimed specifically at medicine, Aimhigher, a national outreach programme operating most intensively in disadvantaged areas, enables local partnerships to design and deliver a range of activities to raise the aspiration and attainment levels of young people.

Asset freezing is an essential measure in countering the financing of terrorism by denying terrorists and their financiers access to funds across the world. Taking action not only freezes any funds in the UK but also creates a hostile environment to deter terrorists from using the UK&#039;s financial system in future.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on recent changes to <i>(a)</i> transfer pricing rules and <i>(b)</i> loan relationship rules.  [222095]</p>




<p><a name="50322w25.html_spnew1"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 I made a written statement to the House on 4 March 2005, <i>Official Report</i>, column 97WS.
</p>





<p><a name="50322w25.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Tyrie: </b> 
 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) what discussions took place with the private equity industry prior to the recent changes to <i>(a)</i> transfer pricing rules and <i>(b)</i> loan relationship rules;  [222096]
</p>



<p>(2) what discussions he has had with representatives of the private equity industry regarding recent changes to <i>(a)</i> transfer pricing rules and <i>(b)</i> loan relationship rules.  [222121]</p>




<p><a name="50322w25.html_spnew2"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 Following representations made by the British Venture Capital Association concerning the application of transfer pricing rules, officials from HM Treasury and Inland Revenue met representatives of the association on a number of occasions. Further meetings are being arranged.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what estimate he has made of the changes in tax revenue which will result from recent changes to <i>(a)</i> transfer pricing rules and <i>(b)</i> loan relationship rules.  [222125]</p>




<p><a name="50322w25.html_spnew3"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 The changes prevent tax avoidance that could otherwise have reduced current and future tax revenues of about &#163;300 million a year.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment he has made of the impact of recent changes to <i>(a)</i> transfer pricing rules and <i>(b)</i> loan relationship rules on (i) the private equity industry and (ii) the City of London.  [222127]</p>




<p><a name="50322w25.html_spnew4"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 The changes ensure that the tax rules provide a level playing field for different investors. The UK will continue to be an alternative location for private equity investment and the private equity industry. The new rules are in line with those of our major competitors such as the USA and Germany.

<p><a name="50322w25.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. McNamara: </b> 
 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many universities do not comply with Customs and Excise&#039;s preferred partial exemption method for VAT.  [219536]</p>




<p><a name="50322w25.html_spnew5"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 Customs and Excise do not have a preferred partial exemption method for universities or for any other organisation. Partly exempt organisations can either operate the standard method of partial exemption or, if they feel this is not suitable for them, they can seek approval for a special method that is individually tailored to their circumstances. Most universities prefer to operate a special method. Customs will approve any special method that is fair and reasonable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322w25.html_para1">
There is no definitive figure for the number of universities that operate partial exemption methods acceptable to Customs. This is because each university&#039;s VAT affairs are specific to them and change continually.

 There were full public consultations with regard to the Licensing Bill, the draft fees and draft regulations. A full Regulatory Impact Assessment was provided to Parliament with the Bill and it is available in the Library of the House. I am satisfied that the fee regulations and order are proportionate and fair and that the 2003 Act will not place an undue burden on small businesses, such as small licensed hotels and guest houses. Indeed, I expect the combined effects of reduced bureaucracy in the new system&#151;through integrating six existing licensing regimes into one&#151;and the encouragement of a more diverse offer to tourists will greatly benefit this important sector.

In addition to the awards made, funding from the New Opportunities Fund totalling &#163;4,986,197 has been allocated under the Coronary Heart Disease, Stroke and Cancer Programme Wales for the purchase of Angiography equipment for six NHS trusts in Wales. To date, only one trust, Bro Morgannwg NHS Trust, has purchased equipment, as most of the trusts have had to do a capital build to house equipment.

1. Figures in the &#039;below 40 per cent. mean&#039; column should be treated with caution and are considered less robust than results using higher thresholds.<br>

2. The estimates are based on sample counts, which have been adjusted for non-response using multipurpose grossing factors that control for tenure, council tax band and a number of other variables. Estimates are subject to both sampling error, and to remaining variability in non-response which is not corrected by the grossing regime.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. All figures are estimates and are taken from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). Due to regional volatility, regional estimates are based on a three year average from 2000&#150;01 to 2002&#150;03. The UK estimate is for 2002&#150;03 only, as the FRS did not cover Northern Ireland until 2002&#150;03.<br>

2. Results are presented as percentages as these can be estimated more reliably.<br>

3. Figures are based on a total income at 2002&#150;03 prices.<br>

4. The FRS is not designed to collect information on annual income. Earnings figures are based on last usual pay. Annual income is estimated by assuming that the income for the relevant period applied for the whole year.<br>

5. The figures relate to the percentage of individuals, including both adults and children, in households whose household income was in the band shown.<br>

6. The estimates are based on sample counts that have been adjusted for non-response using multi-purpose grossing factors. Estimates are subject to sampling error and remaining response bias.<br>

7. Total weekly household income consists of total income from all sources before deduction of income tax and national insurance. This includes all tax credits.<br>

8. Total income has not been adjusted for family size.<br>

Notes:<br>

Alcohol-related diseases: These are defined by a primary diagnosis of mental and behavioural disorders due to alcohol (ICD10 code F10), alcoholic liver disease (K70) or toxic effect of alcohol (T51) or a cause code of accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol (X45).<br>

Finished in-year admissions: A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the data-year. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

Diagnosis (primary diagnosis): The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

Cause code: The cause code is a supplementary code that indicates the nature of any external cause of injury, poisoning or other adverse effects.<br>

Grossing: Figures are grossed for both coverage and missing or invalid clinical data, except for 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04, which are not yet adjusted for shortfalls.<br>

 I am advised by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) that the use of antibiotics in human rather than veterinary medicines is thought to be the main source of resistant micro-organisms in the human population, but we recognise that transfer of resistant bacteria can also occur through the food chain. Action has been taken to phase out the use of antibiotic growth promoters in animals and to make sure that antibiotics are used responsibly in the treatment of sick animals. Measures to prevent food-borne disease, such as cooking, will also prevent the transmission of resistant bacteria.

 I am advised by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) that concerns have been raised, largely by some meat industry stakeholders, about the use of the Remedial Action Notice in response to the FSA&#039;s consultation on new food hygiene legislation.

<p>
<a name="50322w31.html_para11">
The proposed Remedial Action Notice would directly replace the existing Regulation 10 notice in current meat hygiene legislation. These notices are expected to be served in situations where requests for corrective measures to reduce the risk of contamination and consequent risk to public health have been ignored by the operator. Examples of where they might be used in slaughterhouses are:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">to promptly and effectively prohibit the use of a piece of equipment; impose conditions on, or the carrying out of a process; require the rate of production to be reduced or even stopped; or require the detention of any animal or food of animal origin for the purposes of examination.</p>

<p>
<a name="50322w31.html_para12">
Emergency Prohibition Notices and Orders are currently issued under the Food Safety Act 1990, and provision for Hygiene Emergency Prohibition Notices and Orders has been made in the draft Food Hygiene (England) Regulations. The current notices and orders are used where there is a real and imminent risk to health and the new provisions will replicate that requirement.
</p>

The FSA is considering the issues raised in the consultation to determine if the proposed legislation needs to be revised.

Finished consultant episode (FCE)<br>

An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

Speciality<br>

Care is needed when analysing HES data by speciality, or by groups of specialities (such as Acute). Trusts have different ways of managing specialities and attributing codes so it is better to analyse by specific diagnoses, operations or other recorded information.<br>

Grossing:<br>

Figures are grossed for both coverage and missing/invalid clinical data, except for 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04, which are not yet adjusted for shortfalls.<br>

<p><a name="50322w34.html_spnew1"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 The safety of all medicines and vaccines, including hepatitis B vaccine, is continuously monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with expert advice from the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). The MHRA uses a variety of data sources for this purpose 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>22 Mar 2005 : Column 755W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
including reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) which are reported through the yellow card scheme, clinical trials, published literature, epidemiological studies and periodic safety update reports from marketing authorisation holders.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322w34.html_para0">
The known side effects of medicines and vaccines are described in their product information. Arthralgia and arthritis (joint pain and inflammation) have been reported very rarely in relation to hepatitis B vaccines and these possible side effects are included in product information. There have been reports of suspected adverse drug reactions suggesting an association between hepatitis B vaccine with rheumatoid arthritis.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322w34.html_para1">
In light of concerns raised by reports of suspected ADRs, in 2003, the MHRA and the vaccine working group of the CSM reviewed all the available evidence relating to the possible links between hepatitis B vaccine and rheumatoid arthritis. This review examined published literature and studies and reports of suspected adverse drug reactions. The working group advised that there is no confirmed scientific evidence linking the vaccine with an increased risk of rheumatoid arthritis. The MHRA will continue to monitor the safety of hepatitis B vaccine.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what assessment he has made of differences in the <i>(a)</i> regulation and <i>(b)</i> supply of herbal products in each EU member state; and what steps he intends to take through the Herbal Medicinal Products Working Group to ensure that the requirements in respect of (i) quality standards and (ii) other matters for the registration of dossiers under the Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products Directive are set at a level appropriate to traditional herbal medicinal products; [222528]

[222531]</p>




<p><a name="50322w34.html_spnew2"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson </b> 
<i>[holding answer 17 March 2005]:</i> Before the European Commission brought forward proposals for the Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products (Directive 2004/24/EC) a study was carried out for the Commission on the then 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>22 Mar 2005 : Column 756W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
arrangements for regulation of herbal medicines across the European Union (EU). This demonstrated that there were significant differences between member states. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) understands from discussion with industry and regulatory authorities in other EU member states that this assessment has been widely supported, and we do not see any need to replicate the work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322w34.html_para2">
There are many thousands of herbal products on the market of one or more EU member state and variously falling within different categories, such as medicines, foods, food supplements, cosmetics or general consumer products. We do not see a case for commissioning a comparative assessment of the position in each member state and doubt its practicality.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322w34.html_para3">
The main requirements on quality and on the information and data to be included in dossiers flow directly from the terms of the Directive. There are existing European guidelines on the quality and manufacturing standards for medicines, including herbal medicines. We understand that the Herbal Medicinal Products Committee, based at the European Medicines Agency, may review whether any additions or modifications to existing guidelines are desirable or whether further guidelines are required on other issues relating to the Directive. However, there is no fundamental reason why quality standards, for example as to the identity and quality of ingredients, freedom from unacceptable levels of contamination, and the claimed shelf life of the product, should be lowered for traditional herbal medicines as compared with the requirements for other medicines with a marketing authorisation. The absence of such standards in the existing United Kingdom regime for unlicensed herbal medicines has been associated with evidence of risk to public health from low quality products. The UK appointed member of the Committee has extensive scientific and practical regulatory knowledge of herbal medicines and has regular discussions with industry and other interested parties. There is a range of opportunities for industry to make its views known to the Committee and the MHRA has encouraged the UK industry to contribute actively in this area.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322w34.html_para4">
Subject to the outcome of a further consultation on legislation to transpose the Directive into UK legislation, we intend to take advantage of the flexibility under the Directive to permit a transitional period to run until 2011 before products legally on the UK market at April 2004 are required to comply with the Directive. We also intend to permit product information to state the nature of the herbal tradition, which we believe will be helpful to consumers and to industry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322w34.html_para5">
The MHRA has an extensive programme of work in hand to help industry, and in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, prepare for the Directive. Measures have included: a programme of workshops for industry; around 30 meetings with individual companies to advise them on the possibility of registering their products under the Directive; extensive website guidance on the Directive; and regular discussions with the industry&#039;s Herbal Forum to identify and respond to issues of concern. The Agency has received considerable positive feedback on the help provided to industry.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>22 Mar 2005 : Column 757W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322w34.html_para6">
The MHRA gave indicative information on fee levels in the partial regulatory impact assessment published in 2003. In the light of detailed work that has taken place in the interim, updated specific proposals will be published for consultation by the early summer of 2005 along with an updated regulatory impact assessment. October 2005 is the date by which a registration scheme under the Directive must be introduced. It does not represent a deadline by which companies must apply to register products.

Many car parking charges are set to cover the cost of maintenance and security of the car park such as adequate lighting, car park attendants and security officers.

Isotretinoin is known to harm the foetus if used during pregnancy and the product information has always carried stringent warnings to guard against its use during pregnancy. The product information for isotretinoin products was recently reviewed at a European level by the Committee for Human Medicinal Products.

The pregnancy prevention programme consists of three parts; an education programme, therapy managements and distribution controls, which work together to raise awareness of the serious consequences for pregnancies exposed to isotretinoin.

<i>[holding answer 21 March 2005]:</i> In England, the Government has accepted each of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Long Term Care except the recommendation to provide free personal care in all settings.

Free personal care would not help the poorest in society, who receive means tested support nor would it help the sickest, whose bills are paid by national health service continuing care arrangements. Free personal care does not cover all residential care costs and people in residential care would still be expected to contribute to board and lodging costs if personal care was made free.

The estimated costs for future years are shown in the table. They take account of demographic change, in terms of numbers of older people by age, gender, household type and housing tenure. They assume that cost of care will rise by 2 per cent. per year in real terms, in line with average earnings. As with any projections, the figures should only be taken as broad estimates of the cost because of the uncertainty of projecting over such a long time scale.

<p><a name="50322w38.html_spnew1"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 Reports received by the Department on health effects associated with mobile phone technology have usually appeared in scientific journals or on the internet. The Department sometimes receives unpublished accounts, reports or letters, which it passes on to the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) for a considered view. The NRPB, or its independent Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation (AGNIR), have published reviews of the scientific knowledge based on the totality of work to date.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322w38.html_para2">
AGNIR provided a comprehensive review of the science &quot;Health Effects from Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields&quot;, (Documents of the NRPB, Vol 14, No2, 2003). More recently, the NRPB reviewed the progress on implementing the recommendations in the 2000 Stewart Report in &quot;Mobile Phones and Health 2004&quot; (Documents of the NRPB, Vol 15, No 5, 2004). These reports are available on the NRPB website (www.nrpb.org)

<i>[holding answer 17 March 2005]:</i> The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and its predecessor the Medical Devices Agency (MDA) has monitored research activities undertaken by pacemaker manufacturers to assess potential pacemaker interference from mobile phones, by participating in European and International pacemaker safety standards committees.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50322w38.html_para3">
For implanted pacemakers the power level and severity of interference signals from phone masts is much less than for mobile phones in proximity to the patients. MHRA issued guidance to clinicians about possible interference effects to pacemakers from mobile telephones in February 1996, via Pacemaker Technical Note PTN 61, which advised a minimum phone to pacemaker separation distance of 15 centimetres.

Notes:<br>

1. Expenditure is taken from audited health authority summarisation forms and primary care trust summarisation schedules which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. Figures are given in cash terms.<br>

2. Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of health authorities and primary care trusts.<br>

3. Figures for 1997&#150;98 and 2001&#150;02 have been prepared using gross expenditure figures. Figures for 2003&#150;04 have been adjusted to eliminate expenditure which would be double counted where an authority acts as a lead in commissioning healthcare or other services.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. The main operation is the first recorded operation in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details eg time waited but the figures for &quot;all operations count of episodes&quot; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.<br>

2. A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the datayear. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

3. Time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides count and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also HES, calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

4. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br>

 Expenditure on the purchase and postage of official Christmas cards is governed by departmental guidance on financial procedures and propriety, based on principles set out in Government Accounting. This allows for Ministers, members of the Defence Council, Head of Defence Export Services and the Director General of Media and Communications to send Christmas cards at public expense. Additionally, resulting from representational responsibilities at management levels below the Defence Council, individual Top Level Budget Holders may personally send a modest amount of Christmas cards at public expense. The regulations also allow for some TLB business areas to send official Christmas cards (on an exceptional basis) where this would facilitate the achievement of specific business objectives.

<sup>(37)</sup> Excludes Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) personnel but includes HR and Finance Function Reductions.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Totals shown are cumulative. Numbers are set out to the nearest 10, and represent our current assessment of how these reductions will be achieved (in some cases final decisions have yet to be taken). Numbers are based on full-time equivalent mid-year averages and include locally employed civilians (LEG). These figures do not include civilians employed in trading funds.<br>

2. &quot;Reductions Programmed in STP&quot;&#151;These are posts which have been assumed will not continue from previous years&#039; planning rounds. These posts fall mainly within the DLO, although some smaller reductions also fall within other TLBs and are due mainly to reorganisation measures which were ongoing prior to the efficiency programme.<br>

3. &quot;DCP Headcount Reduction&quot;&#151;These are posts which are being reduced as a result of the Department&#039;s major change initiative&#151;the defence change programme (DCP).<br>

4. &quot;LEC Measure Headcount Reduction&quot;&#151;In addition to the reduction in numbers of UK-based civil servant, the number of locally employed civilians (LECs) employed supporting permanently based forces is planned to reduce by up to 1,000 in the same time frame. Numbers of LECs employed in operational theatres have not been included in the planning.<br>

5. &quot;Other Rationalisation and Efficiencies&quot;&#151;These are posts which are being reduced as a result of non-defence change programme efficiency initiatives. The majority of these posts will come from reduced requirements for staff in, for example, the Head Office in Whitehall and in other Headquarters.<br>

6. &quot;Force Structure Reductions&quot;&#151;Posts which will be reduced as a result of changes to the force structure.<br>

7. &quot;Other Headcount Reductions&quot;&#151;Posts which are being reduced for reasons not included in the categories above.<br>

<p><a name="50322w41.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 The Depleted Uranium Oversight Board (DUOB), an independent committee established by the Ministry of Defence (MOD) is measuring uranium in the urine of personnel who served in the first Gulf Conflict 1990&#150;91 and in the Balkans Operations. This work includes personnel who have been discharged from service as well as those who are still serving. Similarly, under MOD&#039;s biological monitoring policy, the Defence Radiological Protection Service (DRPS) is assessing uranium in urine of both military personnel and MOD civilians on operations&#151;including Operation Telic in Iraq&#151;where there is potential for exposure. Depleted Uranium in urine is also being measured in a sample of personnel from across the battlefield as part of a wider study into the physical and psychological health of Operation Telic participants by King&#039;s College, London.

 Navigation, training or transit sorties (including low level) have not, in the last 30 years, required specific approval by an officer above Flight Lieutenant rank.

<p>
<a name="50322w41.html_para0">
The National Archives has microfilmed the front of these cards, which in most cases contains all the information they hold, and they are now available to researchers (in Class WO 372) in microfilmed format at Kew and through the National Archives website online.

<p>
<a name="50322w41.html_para1">
Ministry of Defence staff routinely discuss questions relating to records which may be worthy of permanent preservation with the National Archives staff, and both recognise the historical interest in the medal cards. With the agreement of the National Archives, the Ministry of Defence has been approaching institutions in the hope of finding one to which the cards could be presented. So far this exercise has been without success, but discussions continue.

<i>[holding answer 28 February 2005]:</i> A study into the future of the Army&#039;s Corps and Regimental Headquarters, which might also cover issues such as the locations of the Regimental Headquarters in the light of the restructuring of the Army and the Infantry, is under consideration but no decision has yet been taken.

It will ultimately fall to the MoD and the trustees of the museums to consider their future. The Scottish Division is also looking at a range of regimental issues arising from the formation of the Royal Regiment of Scotland, including the implications for museums.

 The Ministry of Defence and armed forces are committed to promoting equality and diversity and recognise and respect different religious beliefs. Sikh personnel in the armed forces and MOD Civil Service are therefore allowed to wear the Kirpan.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the objections of Defence Estates to the proposal to erect two 100 metre high wind turbines at Uglow Farm, Edgworth; and what the evidential basis is for the claim that these turbines may affect the efficiency of BAE Systems radars at Warton Aerodrome.

<p><a name="50322w43.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 An initial assessment of the proposed development at Uglow Farm, Edgworth was carried out last year at the pre-planning stage. This was unfortunately based on a misinterpretation of incomplete co-ordinates provided to the Department. Now that this error has been recognised, the developer has been informed and technical advisers are carrying out an urgent review of the proposal using the correct data. The true location of the proposed wind farm is some distance from that originally assumed, but it would be premature to say whether the radar at Warton will be affected.

The Working Time Regulations provide workers with the protection of a limit of an average of 48 hours a week working time. This is not an absolute cap of 48 hours in any one week. This average is normally calculated over a 17-week reference period, although this can be longer in certain situations (26 weeks) and can be extended by agreement (up to 52 weeks). Workers may choose to work more than 48 hours per week over the reference period by signing an opt-out agreement, but employers cannot force a worker to sign an opt-out, and workers cannot be subject to detriment for refusing to sign an opt-out.

The UK attends EU-ASEAN meetings as a member of the EU. Decisions on attendance are taken by consensus with the EU. It is too early for the EU to take a decision on the approach it will take in July 2006. This will depend on developments in Burma before then.

We are also using our regular bilateral and multilateral contacts with all ASEAN members, who are key to progress on this issue, to encourage them to press the military regime in Burma to enter into a meaningful dialogue with the democratic opposition and ethnic groups as soon as possible. There is a clear understanding that the prospect of Burmese chairmanship of ASEAN makes the need for change all the more pressing.

 The withdrawal of Syrian troops to the Beka&#039;a Valley in Lebanon and back to Syria is a first step in the implementation on United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559. Since the start of the withdrawal, the security situation has remained calm, as can be seen by the large-scale peaceful rallies that have been taking place in Beirut. So far, the Lebanese security forces have shown themselves to be capable of filling the security role left by the departing Syrian troops.

The London Meeting on 1 March 2005 was aimed at supporting the PA in its plans to build the institutions needed to underpin a future viable Palestinian state. At the meeting, PA President Abu Mazen promised &quot;100 per cent. effort&quot; on security, and set out detailed plans in this area, along with plans for governance reform and economic development. On security specifically, the early signs have been good and on 16 March 2005 Israel handed Jericho over to PA security control. It is imperative that the PA&#039;s efforts continue. We will continue to work with the parties and the international community to support the Palestinian Authority.

 We are not aware of Christian Arabs being driven out of the territories by the activities of Palestinian extremists. However, we do call upon the Palestinian Authority to continue with reforms, especially security reform, so that it can ensure Palestinian law and order and take effective action against rejectionist and extremist violence.

The ICI&#039;s report, issued to the UN Security Council on 31 January, concluded that, while the Government of Sudan had not pursued a policy of genocide in Darfur, a competent court would need to decide whether certain individuals had done so, and that the Government of Sudan, the Arab militias and the rebels are all guilty of serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law, which may amount to crimes against humanity and/or war crimes.

<p><a name="50322w47.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. MacShane: </b> 
 2005 is an important year for the global community to take action on climate change and on Africa in the context of sustainable development. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister is committed to using the opportunity offered by our twin presidencies of the EU and G8 to make real progress.

<p>
<a name="50322w47.html_para0">
The review of the EU&#039;s sustainable development strategy provides the EU with the opportunity to reaffirm its commitment to promoting sustainable development and tackling climate change in the context of the re-launched Lisbon strategy. But this is just one element of the EU&#039;s climate change strategy: implementation of the EU emissions trading scheme is helping the EU to meet its Kyoto targets; on future action, the EU will be seeking to reinvigorate international dialogue under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Engaging countries beyond the EU will be a vital part of this. The G8 too is firmly focused on climate change. The UK presidency of the G8 aims to build on past G8 initiatives, including on technology development, by promoting a broader understanding of the challenges of addressing climate change.

On Africa, the EU is the world&#039;s largest provider of aid to the region and an important trade partner. It is working to provide a sustainable response to the recommendations of the Commission for Africa, and to ensure that the millennium development summit gives new impetus to action on sustainable development and climate change in order to tackle global poverty and achieve the millennium development goals. The G8 is working to agree a comprehensive plan of specific actions to address the complex and inter-linked problems of Africa. This plan will build on the work of the Kananaskis G8 Africa Action Plan, the Commission for Africa, the African Union and the New Partnership for Africa&#039;s Development.

Uganda has a well-developed and consultative budgetary process. Donors are involved throughout, and have an opportunity to endorse the budget at the annual Public Expenditure Review.

Our Poverty Reduction Budget Support, and that of other partners such as the World Bank, is conditional on our endorsement of the budget and its subsequent execution.
