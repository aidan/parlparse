 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will make a statement on the awarding of digital licences by the Independent Television Commission.  [68958]

<P>
<a name="20722w01.html_spnew0"><B> Tessa Jowell: </B> 
 The Independent Television Commission are solely responsible for the award of licences under the Broadcasting Acts. They considered that the BBC/Crown Castle joint proposal was best suited to ensure the long-term future of digital terrestrial television, subject to conditions mainly designed to prevent any competition issues. This will give a fresh start to the platform, offering free-to-view digital TV and enabling many consumers to enjoy the benefits of digital television.

<a name="20722w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Local authorities are key providers of sport and recreation facilities and play a central role in the delivery of sport in the community. The provision of swimming facilities is a matter for local authorities to consider in the light of local needs and the appropriate mixture of pubic and private provision. The Government support the provision of sport and leisure facilities through various means including funding from the Sports Lottery Fund, and I understand that Leominster city council has applied to Sport England for such funding.

 129 properties in London have received grants administered under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and Local Government Act 1985. There is no power under this legislation to require public access as a condition of the grant. These grants are for external repairs and improvements which can be viewed by the public from the street. Some buildings do allow an element of public access by virtue of their function, such as places of worship and shops.

 Although digital broadcasting has relieved some pressure on spectrum, scarcity remains an issue.

The Government's position is set out in the document "The draft Communications Bill&#151;The 



<P>

<a name="20722w03.html_para0">The Radio Authority, which licences all independent radio services in the UK, is currently given discretion under the Broadcasting Act 1990 to award local analogue, satellite and cable licences to religious bodies, subject to compliance with the Authority's codes, and the ITC can also award cable and satellite TV licences to religious organisations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what separation distances she recommends should be imposed between GM and non-GM or organic crops of <i>(a)</i> sugar or fodder beet, <i>(b)</i> maize and <i>(c)</i> oilseed rape, to avoid contamination of the non-GM or organic crop above 0.01 per cent.

<a name="20722w03.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 There are insufficient data to determine separation distances between crops that would achieve a cross-pollination threshold of 0.01 per cent. Furthermore, 0.01 per cent. is below the level at which an incidental GM presence can reliably be quantified with current analytical methods.
<P>

<a name="20722w03.html_para5">In 2000 the National Institute of Agricultural Botany (NIAB) reported on the separation distances required to ensure that cross-pollination is below specified limits. These distances for oilseed rape and maize are shown in Table 1. NIAB did not recommend a distance for beet crops because beet is biennial and generally does not flower in the year of harvest, and any "bolters" can and should be removed before flowering. In addition, incoming pollen would not affect the vegetative parts of the plant (beet root and foliage). In 2001 the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment augmented the NIAB advice in respect of maize (Table 2). The NIAB study took account of work undertaken for the Soil Association by the National Pollen Research Unit (NPRU) which recommended separation distances to achieve an incidental GM presence which was not quantified but described as "very low risk". These distances are shown in Table 3. The NIAB study also reviewed work from a variety of researchers, such as Jones and Brooks&#151;"Effectiveness of distance and border rows in preventing outcrossing in corn"; Oklahoma Agricultural Experimental Station, Technical Bulletin No. T-38, 1950.

 The Environment Agency has developed a database to monitor progress at all the flood locations identified in their Lessons Learned Report on the autumn 2000 floods. The database covers locations for which local authorities are considering flood management options as well as those for which the Agency is taking the lead, and is reviewed every six months. A current review is nearing completion and I understand that the results will be available in early August. I have asked the Agency to provide you with the information requested as soon as it is available. Since the floods of autumn 2000, DEFRA has approved for grant aid a total of 274 new flood and coastal schemes and studies at an estimated cost of &#163;386 million, although of course not all relate to locations flooded that year.

 As a result of my Department's representations at the eleventh Conference of CITES Parties in April 2000, the CITES Bushmeat Working Group was established. We have contributed &#163;55,000 to the Group, which aims to help Central and West African range states develop and implement their own solutions, including the revision and harmonisation of their wildlife policies and legislation. We have also funded research analysing existing knowledge and expertise on the bushmeat trade, highlighting gaps in data and understanding, and making recommendations on further action. The results of this research have been made available to the CITES Working Group and we expect them to be discussed at the Group's next meeting, due to take place in Brazzaville later this month.

<a name="20722w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Plastics products comprise a wide range of polymerised organic compounds mixed with additives to enhance particular properties. By-products produced on disposal will depend on the type of plastic. When incinerated, plastics will mostly form carbon dioxide and water. Chlorinated plastics, such as PVC, will produce hydrochloric acid. In general they will not degrade to any great extent in landfill and will make little contribution to the production of leachate and landfill gas.

 There are a number of existing options under the Countryside Stewardship Scheme that may be relevant to dairy production. For example, buffer strips within improved grassland are designed to protect habitats and conservation features from potentially damaging agricultural operations. Capital works programmes under the Scheme can also be relevant to livestock units, including those that are primarily involved with dairy production. In addition, we have recently begun a six-year research programme to investigate a range of possible environmental measures that would be compatible with intensive dairy farming.

 No such criteria exist because the only rights that can be created under the regulations are private ones.

In November 2001 the Countryside Agency published a report entitled "Rural Services in 2000" which revealed that 85 per cent. of parishes had a village hall or a community hall in 2000. The proportion of parishes with a hall is 32 per cent. for those below 100 population, 77 per cent. for those with between 100 and 300 people, 92 per cent. for those between 300 and 500, 94 per cent. for those between 500 and 1,000, 95 per cent. for those between 1,000 and 2,000, 98 per cent. for those between 2,000 and 5,000, and 96 per cent. for those over 5,000.

There is a much larger number of substances which have never been approved for use as pesticides in the UK, but may be used in other countries.

To ask the President of the Council, pursuant to his answer of 15 July 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 83W, to the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth), on parliamentary pensions, if he will estimate the additional cost to the Exchequer of that part of those improved pensions which are not covered by the increase in hon.

 The Exchequer contribution to the parliamentary pension scheme is set by the Government Actuary, as part of his triennial valuation of the scheme. The Government Actuary is currently working on his valuation of the scheme as at 1 April 2002. He will take into account, in setting the Exchequer contribution to apply from April 2003, the number of hon. Members and office holders who choose to pay higher contributions to secure a higher pension accrual.
<P>

<a name="20722w06.html_para9">The Government Actuary has estimated the cost of the improved pension as 5.1 per cent. of pay. If all hon. Members and office holders were to decide to opt to pay increased contributions of 9 per cent. of pay rather than 6 per cent. with effect from 15 July 2002, the additional costs to the Exchequer over the period to 31 March 2003 may be estimated as being in the order of &#163;600,000 in the year 2002&#150;03 and &#163;860,000 for a full year.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what initiatives her Department has taken in 2002 in connection with education projects within the Commonwealth.  [70614]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20722w07.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The Government are strongly committed to the Millennium Development Goals on education: achieving universal primary education by 2015 and eliminating gender disparities in primary and secondary schooling by 2005. Since May 1997, DFID has committed over &#163;700 million to support primary education for poor people, mainly in the Commonwealth. We are using these funds to support national education policies which form part of developing country Governments' broader poverty reduction strategies. In 2002 our priority is to implement successfully these long-term programmes and to develop new partnerships with Commonwealth Governments.




<P>
<P><I>22 Jul 2002 : Column 714W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20722w07.html_para2">Achieving these education goals will require a strong commitment from Commonwealth Governments to prioritise primary education within their spending plans. Many Commonwealth countries will also need considerable external assistance. The Government are working to mobilise the international community in support of Education for All. Our aim is to achieve consensus by the end of 2002 on well co-ordinated international action for mobilising new resources and better co-ordinated programmes designed to meet this goal. We are giving high priority to working with the World bank to develop its new Action Plan for accelerating progress towards Education for All. We believe the Action Plan's fast track initiative provides an opportunity to try to ensure that no country genuinely committed to economic development, poverty reduction and good governance is denied the chance to achieve universal primary education through lack of resources.
<P>

<a name="20722w07.html_para3">The bank's fast track initiative offers seven poor Commonwealth countries the chance to qualify for additional financing for primary education if they can demonstrate that their Government is fully committed and has effective policies in place. A further four Commonwealth countries can apply for assistance in building capacity, filling gaps in data and developing effective policies for primary education. We will continue to support the fast track proposals and participate in on-going discussions with the World bank about implementation arrangements.

 There have been a handful of attacks on aid workers in some areas of Afghanistan and we remain concerned about reports of insecurity in northern Afghanistan, including attacks on aid workers. We support the actions of the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General, Lakhdar Brahimi, who has written to President Karzai, and visited the north to discuss security issues with the various factions.

 I have regular discussions with Cabinet colleagues on a number of issues. Reform of the security sector is vital to the future stability of Afghanistan. DFID, in consultation with colleagues in the FCO and MOD, is working for the creation of accountable national military and police forces subject to the rule of law and under central and civilian control; anti-narcotics activities; and the re-establishment of an appropriate judicial system. The UK has in principle committed $33 million to this process.

 Pledges for the reconstruction of Afghanistan were made at the Tokyo Conference. Precise data on the disbursement of aid to Afghanistan are not yet available. However, we estimate that donor pledges to Afghanistan amount to a little under $2 billion in 2002, of which about $1.1 billion has been committed and about $0.8 billion disbursed. The pace of further disbursements will now depend on improvements in security and access and on the completion of the National Development Framework and development budget.

 We have no development programme to Liberia. Over the last few years my Department has supported a limited number of projects, most of which have been delivered through civil society organisations. These have included community development projects, and projects to enhance peace and promote reconciliation between ethnic groups. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has also provided support to promote democratic values and reduce tension between ethnic groups.

 At Kananaskis last month, the G8 reaffirmed their commitment to the full financing of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, and agreed to provide an additional US$1 billion for the HIPC Trust Fund to help the multilateral development banks meet their share of HIPC costs. The additional money will provide the remaining financing required under the HIPC initiative, and will help to ensure that those countries whose debt position has worsened because of the global economic slowdown and falls in commodity prices will get enough debt relief to enable them to exit the HIPC process with sustainable levels of debt.

Tackling corruption, thereby ensuring resources (including those going to health and education) were no longer wasted, would be a tangible indicator of this commitment.

 The Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria is now legally established as a foundation in Switzerland. WHO is providing administrative support and the World bank is the trustee. The first board meeting of the fund took place in Geneva in late January 2002 during which the legal and framework documents for the purpose, scope and operations of the fund were approved. The second Global Fund Board in April made two key decisions. It selected Richard Feachem as Executive Director, and approved funding for the first tranche of proposals. Of 380 proposals received, 40 programmes in 31 countries were approved, totalling $378 million over two years. A further 18 proposals from 12 countries were approved subject to clarifications, totalling $238 million over two years. Total pledges to the fund now amount to around US $2 billion.

 The United Nations estimates that more than four million people have been displaced from their homes in Angola. Three million of these require urgent nutritional and medical assistance. The UK made strong representations to both the United Nations and the Government of Angola to agree a framework for humanitarian assistance and we have made contributions of &#163;3.3 million this year, including &#163;1.65 million to the

<P>

<a name="20722w08.html_para4">With a genuine peace agreement now in place, people are starting to return to their homes. It is vital that human rights are respected during this time. This is the responsibility of the Angolan Government though we expect the UN to monitor the process. The UK are assisting with the disarmament, demobilisation, and re-integration of former UNITA combatants. My Department also has an emergency response team assessing the humanitarian situation in Angola at present. We will continue to monitor the situation as access to more remote areas becomes feasible and maintain a dialogue with the UN.

 My Department supports a number of initiatives aimed at monitoring the impact of the corporate social responsible strategies of UK companies on developing countries. For example, in the retail sector, we have supported the work of the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) since its establishment in 1998. The ETI is an alliance of 28 UK businesses (with a combined turnover of over &#163;100 billion), NGOs and trade unions that work to improve labour conditions in the supply chains of the company members. The ETI is conducting research to assess the impact of its code of conduct on workers and suppliers, and the business case for adopting such codes.

 In general, work of substance may not be carried out to a parish church or certain other Church of England places of worship without a "faculty" or permission from the Chancellor of the ecclesiastical court of the diocese or, in some cases involving less significant changes, from the archdeacon. (Separate controls apply to cathedrals.) The faculty system is a legal system of controls which has been strengthened by recent legislation; it predates secular listed building controls, is broader in scope and also applies to unlisted buildings. Because it satisfied Government requirements for "ecclesiastical exemption", Church of England churches are not in general subject to listed building control, though they are not exempt from the need for planning permission where that applies.
<P>

<a name="20722w09.html_para4">It is for the court alone to decide whether to grant the faculty or permission, but with limited exceptions the Chancellor or archdeacon must seek the advice of the Diocesan Advisory Committee before doing so. Three members of that committee are appointed in consultation with English Heritage, with the National Amenity Societies and with Local Government associations.

<P>

<a name="20722w09.html_para5">There is also statutory provision in the faculty jurisdiction system for consultation with a range of bodies, including English Heritage, in appropriate cases. Parishes contemplating changes to listed churches are in any case encouraged to seek its informal advice and that of the Amenity Societies as early as possible. English Heritage will need to approve any works for which it is providing grant aid, and must also be consulted where it has in the past made a grant to a particular church.

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what the Government policy is on the use of open source software to enable increased value for money in IT procurements across the public sector.  [72633]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20722w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 This Government are intent on securing the best value for money in its IT procurements by encouraging the development of a flourishing IT industry which supplies both proprietary and open source software solutions to the public sector. Government procurement decisions will be based on the ability of the solutions to deliver effective and economic systems and services.
<P>

<a name="20722w10.html_para2">I am pleased to announce new policy on the use of open source software within UK Government. It explains how we will consider open source software solutions alongside proprietary ones in IT procurements and award contracts on a value for money basis, seeking to avoid lock-in to proprietary IT products and services. In addition, the UK Government will consider obtaining full rights to bespoke software code or customisations of COTS (Commercial Off the Shelf) software it procures, wherever this achieves best value for money. It will also explore further the possibilities of using OSS as the default exploitation route for Government-funded R&D software.
<P>

<a name="20722w10.html_para3">The open source software policy has been formulated for use within UK Government because we seek to embrace the fast moving pace of the software industry and to acknowledge the clear potential for open source software to change the software infrastructure marketplace. It also serves as an appropriate response to the recent European Commission's Action Plan for the initiative eEurope&#151;an information society for all. UK Government, in joining with its European partners to explore the availability of open source software solutions, will seek to realise the significant potential for cost-savings in the future and to achieve an increased flexibility in the development, enhancement and integration of our IT systems.

 The Government have today published the report of the review which was jointly sponsored by the Cabinet Office and the Treasury. Pam Alexander led the review.
<P>

<a name="20722w10.html_para6">The review has far-reaching implications for improving the delivery of central Government services. It concludes that the agency model has been a success in improving, and in some cases transforming, services and functions delivered by central Government and has brought customer focus and a performance culture into the civil service. However, it find that agencies have in some cases become detached from Ministers and from Departments' increasing focus on strategic aims; controls over processes have reduced effectiveness and responsiveness without providing a shared strategic direction
<P>

<a name="20722w10.html_para7">The report makes 12 recommendations to achieve and maintain strategic connection and improve service delivery. These include:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>departmental leadership which values equally policy and delivery skills and agency management with a clear understanding of ministerial objectives;
<P>

alignment of departmental and agency key targets and a cycle of reviews to ensure that structures and processes across Departments support the achievement of key objectives; and

maximum use of financial and managerial delegations to support responsive, flexible and effective delivery.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20722w11.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Pond: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what plans he has to introduce new pension arrangements for the Civil Service; and if he will make a statement.  [72618]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20722w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 I am today laying before Parliament, under the provisions of the Superannuation Act 1972, three amendment schemes. The first of these amends the rules of the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme (PCSPS) and introduces new provisions for those joining the pension scheme on or after 1 October 2002. The second amendment scheme makes consequential changes to the Civil Service Compensation Scheme, and the third amendment scheme removes the injury benefit provisions of the PCSPS to a separate scheme.
<P>

<a name="20722w11.html_para4">Pension arrangements for civil servants (and those in employments and offices listed in Schedule I to the Superannuation Act 1972) will change on 1 October 2002. New entrants joining after that date will generally be given the choice of a final salary pension or a stakeholder pension with an employer contribution. The new arrangements are being introduced on a cost-neutral basis for employers.
<P>

<a name="20722w11.html_para5">We recognise that pensions form a significant part of the Civil Service remuneration package, and we want civil servants to be able to choose the pension that suits them 



<P>
<P><I>22 Jul 2002 : Column 729W</I><P>
best. Today's Civil Service does not offer a job for life and is benefiting from greater interchange with other sectors at all levels within the organisation. Final salary pensions may be good for those who spend a long period with one employer, but those who change jobs frequently during their career may prefer their employer to contribute to a stakeholder pension. By giving our new staff a choice of two good quality pension alternatives we aim not only to support a more diverse Civil Service but also to raise awareness and appreciation of the value of the pension element of the pay package.
<P>

<a name="20722w11.html_para6">The new final salary option will be known as the premium scheme. It will provide a pension based on one-sixtieth of final pensionable earnings for each year of service. Other features of the premium scheme include:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>option to exchange part of pension for lump sum on retirement;
<P>
<BR>
ill-health pensions varying in amount depending on the extent of incapacity;
<P>
<BR>
death-in-service lump sum of three times pay;
<P>
<BR>
pensions for surviving spouses of 3/8ths of the member's pension;
<P>
<BR>
pension payable to a surviving eligible unmarried partner if the member does not leave a spouse;
<P>
<BR>
pensions for children
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20722w11.html_para7">Existing members of the PCSPS will have the option of joining the premium scheme or remaining with the current provisions (to be renamed the classic scheme). Members opting for classic will continue to earn a pension based on 1/80th of pay for each year of service plus a retirement lump sum of three times pension. Members opting to join the premium scheme will have their past service reduced&#151;typically to 92 per cent. of its previous amount&#151;to reflect the improved benefit structure. Members may also opt for classic plus; this option effectively provides premium scheme benefits for service from 1 October with service before 1 October continuing to be pensioned broadly on the classic model.




<P>
<P><I>22 Jul 2002 : Column 730W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20722w11.html_para8">We are moving to the new arrangements on a cost-neutral basis, with the entire cost of benefit improvements being met by increased contributions by members. None of the cost of the benefit improvements will fall on the taxpayer. All premium and classic plus members will pay the new contribution rate of 3.5 per cent. Members opting to remain in the classic scheme will continue to pay contributions of 1.5 per cent. of pay.
<P>

<a name="20722w11.html_para9">The stakeholder pension alternative will be known as the partnership pension account. Employees will choose their pension provider from the following panel:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>AMP Corporate Pensions
<P>
<BR>
Scottish Widows
<P>
<BR>
Standard Life
<P>
<BR>
TUC.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20722w11.html_para10">Employees opting for a partnership pension account do not need to contribute, but will be encouraged to do so by having their contributions matched up to 3 per cent. of pay. In addition, the employer will pay contributions based on age, varying from 3 per cent. of pay for those under 21, to 12.5 per cent. of pay for those aged 46 and over. Lump sum benefits of up to three times pay on death in service and on ill health retirement will be provided separately, and will be the subject of future schemes under the Superannuation Act.
<P>

<a name="20722w11.html_para11">Civil Service remuneration is set having regard to the need to recruit, retain and motivate staff of the appropriate quality. Full account is taken of the value of pension arrangements, including the cost of index-linking, in setting the balance between the pay and pension elements of the reward package.
<P>

<a name="20722w11.html_para12">The Civil Service unions have been involved throughout the development of the new pension options, both in negotiating the terms and also in appraising their members of the options open to them. The unions' constructive involvement throughout this process stands as a testament to the value of partnership working.

DIRECTS is research into the feasibility of an electronic system for charging drivers to use busy roads. It is intended to help local authorities interested in setting up their own local charging scheme; it should also assist the design of the national lorry charging system.
<P>

<a name="20722w13.html_para2">Temporary equipment will be set up on a small network of roads in south-east Leeds and local volunteers will have a small electronic charging unit fitted inside their vehicles to test the system.

 The strategy for maintenance, which is based on the principles of minimising whole life cost, has been derived over the years from a number of studies. The effect of ad hoc repairs is always considered within a maintenance scheme against planned maintenance as part of a value management process and thus ensures value for money. The process, which has been developed over time, takes account of historical records of ad hoc repair costs and the effects of delaying planned maintenance for the specific network length under consideration.

Authorities were also told that their maintenance allocations for each of the three years 2003&#150;04, 2004&#150;05, and 2005&#150;06 would be at least 75 per cent. of their allocation in 2002&#150;03.

<a name="20722w14.html_para7">

<BR>
Tim Matthews has been asked by the Transport Minister for the Department for Transport to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the proportion and the length of the strategic road network currently requiring maintenance. I am replying since Tim is currently away on Highways Agency business.
<BR>
The Highways Agency aims to ensure that the network is retained in an optimum, safe condition on a basis that minimises costs over time. To achieve this requires that the proportion of the network requiring maintenance is held between 7% and 8% which equates to between 2,400 and 2,700 lane km.
<BR>
An assessment of the network was made at the end of March 2002 and this indicated that 7.5% of the network required maintenance.

375 of these properties were at Standard 1 for condition at the time of release. This represented 2 per cent. of the total number of service family properties in GB at Standard 1. Whenever possible, the houses released for disposal are those at lower standards, but the sale agreement requires that properties are released in groups rather than individually. This can result in some higher standard properties being released because of their location. Defence Housing Executive area managers maintain close liaison with local service commanders on the selection of surplus properties for disposal.<P>

 The Medical Quinquennial Review recommended the closure of the Duchess of Kent's Psychiatric Hospital (DKPH). Following advice from a leading independent consultancy in mental health services, it was recommended that defence mental health services should be switched toward care in the single service community, in line with the approach already well established in the NHS. Most service patients requiring mental health care are already treated by the Defence Community Psychiatric Service, where the emphasis is on local, out-patient care. The reduced requirement for in-patient facilities means that DKPH would no longer be required. Closure of the hospital is currently subject to consultation and no final decision has yet been taken. However, we would not close the hospital until absolutely satisfied that high quality replacement facilities were in place and that suitable alternative arrangements had been made for existing patients.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20722w18.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Approximately 24,000 SA80 A2 rifles have now been deployed to the armed forces and eight Equipment Failure Reports (resulting in an inoperable weapon) have been received from units. These reports includes weapons deployed with service shooting teams and infantry units as well as troops deployed to Afghanistan. Three of these reports relate to the trigger guard, three to magazine related parts, one was a welding failure on the sighting system and one related to stoppages experienced. Those reports that related to damage in transit have been disregarded since they are not an equipment failure.
<P>

<a name="20722w18.html_para11">There have been 1,361 recorded faults (resulting in an inoperable weapon), with the SA80 A1 in the last three years. A breakdown of recorded faults with the SA80 since 1986 could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20722w18.html_spnew13"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The SA80 A2 rifle entered service late last year. There have been no indications of reliability or accuracy problems when using the A2 in conjunction with the Rifle Grenade General Service (RGGS). Tests were conducted by QinetiQ prior to the A2's introduction to validate with the modified rifle the results of earlier exhaustive performance trials using the SA80 A1 with the RGGS. Some rifle-launched grenades no longer in use did on occasion cause damage to the A1 and its optical sight, but since its introduction into service in 1996 the RGGS has been found to be safe in this respect. For maximum accuracy it is used with a dedicated prismatic sight.

<P>

<P>
<a name="20722w18.html_spnew14"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The modified SA80 A2 was accepted onto the NATO nominated weapons list in March 2002. We have no intention of seeking the readmittance of the SA80 A1 onto the list as it is being replaced by the modified SA80 A2.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20722w18.html_spnew15"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Both the SA80A1 and the SA80A2 were tested during trials in 2001 against the Battlefield Mission rather than a 10,000 round target. The 10,000 round figure relates to the manufacturer's expected life of component parts of the weapon. The new Battlefield Mission requires the rifle to fire in a number of different environments over a prolonged period of time. These included cold and dry conditions in Alaska, hot and wet conditions in Brunei, hot and dry conditions in Kuwait and temperate conditions in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="20722w18.html_para12">The SA80A2 averaged 98 per cent. reliability during trials across all climates and during testing in Kuwait achieved 95 per cent. reliability. The target set for SA80A2 is 90 per cent. reliability. The SA80A1 averaged 55 per cent. reliability across the various climates and during testing in Kuwait achieved 6 per cent. reliability.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what inquiries were made by his Department into whether the use of the stabiliser developed by Warminster was considered in SA80 modifications.  [70701]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20722w18.html_spnew16"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 I assume the stabiliser the hon. Member is referring to is the Vortices Activated Muzzle Stabiliser (VAMS), which was designed to improve the accuracy of the Light Support Weapon. Trials were undertaken at Warminster in 1992 using SA80 A1s, but when fitted with the VAMS, the weapon failed to meet accuracy requirements. The VAMS was not therefore procured.

 <i>[holding answer 18 July 2002]:</i> HMS Nottingham deployed for duties associated with the Five Power Defence Arrangements including Exercise Stardex. She was subsequently assigned to Coalition maritime operations in the Middle East, and was being held at notice for this purpose while deployed to the Asia Pacific region. She was also programmed to undertake a series of port visits in support of our defence diplomacy goals and wider security objectives in the region. It will not be possible to deploy another ship to undertake the full range of these duties. However, HMS York has been nominated as the ship held at readiness in support of the fight against terrorism, and options are being investigated for United Kingdom participation in Ex Stardex.

It is not possible, from existing records, to separate the cost of repairs from those for the refit. However, the overall cost of this package of work including replacement equipment was some &#163;45 million at that time. The duration of the repair and refit was 92 weeks.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the impact of the development of large scale wind farms in the North sea on <i>(a)</i> existing radar defence and <i>(b)</i> the UK's ability to co-operate with the USA in respect of the Missile Defence programme; and if he will make a statement.  [70045]

<a name="20722w19.html_spnew13"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 All wind farm proposals are examined on a case-by-case basis to establish whether they are likely to have an adverse effect on air defence radar. Rotating turbines can send false returns to radar heads and a study is currently being undertaken in conjunction with the DTI to see what measures, if any, can be taken to mitigate this.
<P>

<a name="20722w19.html_para1">An independent review of the United Kingdom's air defence radar was instituted following the terrorist attacks of 11 September, and this work will inform on-going work on SDR New Chapter.
<P>

<a name="20722w19.html_para2">No assessment has been made of the impact of wind farms on the type of radar currently used for missile early warning, or on those that might be developed for missile tracking, but there is no reason to expect wind farms to affect such radars in view of their different operating characteristics.

 The G8 Action Plan for Africa includes commitments on market access for least developed African countries. These reaffirm pledges made at the United Nations' Third Conference for least developed countries in Brussels in May last year, and reiterated in the context of the Doha development agenda of multilateral trade negotiations. We are keen to see action by other G8 countries to open their markets to LDCs, matching that taken by the EU in its February 2001 "Everything but Arms Initiative". Acting on the Kananaskis commitment to African LDCs would be an important step in this direction.

 With its African partners, the G8 intends to deliver a joint plan, by 2003, for the development of African capability to undertake peace support operations (PSO), including at the regional level. This will involve improving co-ordination of existing donor peacekeeping training programmes, especially those of the UK, US and France in West Africa and elsewhere. Joint donor missions will be carried out to assess the logistical and training needs of sub-regional organisations like ECOWAS and SADC to improve, where possible, their capacity. Plans are already well advanced for the co-ordination of G8 support to the establishment of the Kofi Annan Peacekeeping Training Centre in Accra, Ghana. Bilaterally, the UK is already expanding the capacity of its PSO training programmes in Ghana, Kenya and South Africa and considering how best to provide regional PSO training support in Southern Africa.

 As independent organisations it is for further education (FE) colleges to agree the pay and the terms and conditions of their staff within the context of the overall resources available to them.
<P>

<a name="20722w22.html_para3">Extra resources have been made available to FE colleges to support improvements in pay and conditions and to help raise standards in colleges. The total funding for FE has increased by over &#163;1.1 billion between 1997&#150;98 and 2002&#150;03, a 20 per cent. real terms increase. In 2002&#150;03, the Learning and Skills Council has increased colleges' participation funding rates by 2.5 per cent. in cash terms, compared to a 1.5 per cent. increase in 2001&#150;02. We planned to increase total spend on FE by over &#163;300 million in 2003&#150;04. However, the Chancellor's statement of 15 July giving additional resources for education, including a 1 per cent. per annum real terms increase for FE in the unit of core funding, will mean more money in 2003&#150;04 than originally planned, and further real terms increases in future years. We also expect to announce in due course substantial additional resources to take forward elements of the "Success for All" strategy for reforming further education and training.

 Earlier this year on 7 February 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1074W, I told the House that ECGD would give priority to its business and systems in order to make itself ready for establishment as a capitalised Trading Fund, my preferred option for its future operation. Work has now progressed sufficiently for me to confirm that ECGD will become a Trading Fund.
<P>

<a name="20722w24.html_para10">In making this commitment, I am conscious of the need for ECGD to complement market provision of export insurance and guarantees. As a result, ECGD should do more to stimulate the private market and develop new ways of working with them to benefit the UK economy by supporting UK exporters and investors in overseas markets.
<P>

<a name="20722w24.html_para11">ECGD will have greater operational autonomy as a Trading Fund. This will offer an improved service to customers, who have expressed concern during the programme of work, about ECGD's ability to provide adequate levels of support to exporters. Customers can expect greater clarity and certainty as to the levels of ECGD's support. I have also asked ECGD to improve its customer care for new customers and make it easier for them to access its support.

 With regard to liability of the UK nuclear industry in the event of a nuclear accident, the UK is a contracting party to the Paris and Brussels conventions on third party liability in the field of nuclear energy. One of the underlying principles of the Paris convention is that all liability arising from a nuclear accident is channelled to the operator of the nuclear installation on a no fault basis. Present UK legislation requires operators to cover their liability by insurance, (the Nuclear Installations Act 1965) and operator's liability is currently limited to a maximum &#163;140 million per accident.

 The United Kingdom does not allow the import of "nuclear waste". Spent nuclear fuel belonging to overseas owners is imported for reprocessing in the UK. Details of fuel deliveries and the programming of reprocessing fuel owned by individual customers are operational and commercial matters for BNFL and its customers. It can be noted, however, that BNFL published in 1993 a document setting out the economic and commercial justification for THORP. This included details of the amounts of fuel contracted for reprocessing during the baseload period of THORP's operation. From this it can be seen that the total amount of overseas owned fuel to be reprocessed during that period is 4,547 tonnes.

The most recent inventory was published in 1999. A copy is in the Libraries of the House. An updated edition of the inventory is due for publication later this year. Reprocessing is an activity carried out in order to recover reusable materials from spent nuclear fuel and to separate out the waste contained in the spent fuel. Radioactive waste is not reprocessed.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20722w26.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 I am assuming the question relates to movements by rail of spent nuclear fuel discharged from UK nuclear power stations.

The power stations that are the source of the spent fuel are situated throughout Great Britain.
<P>

<a name="20722w26.html_para4">The total volume of spent fuel that is transported in any given year would depend entirely on operational factors. Such transports are undertaken by Direct Rail Services (DRS), BNFL's rail freight subsidiary. DRS does not collate information on the total tonnage of fuel that is transported each year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what percentage of the United Kingdom's electrical power came from wind power in the last year for which figures are available; and what is being done to increase the amount of wind farms.  [70802]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20722w27.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 In 2001, the last year for which figures are available, electricity generation from wind power in the United Kingdom was 965 GWh. This was 0.3 per cent. of total UK electricity generation for that year.
<P>

<a name="20722w27.html_para2">Wind energy, along with other forms of renewable energy, stands to benefit substantially from the introduction of the Renewables Obligation from 1 April this year. This places an obligation on electricity suppliers to supply a specified proportion of their electricity from renewable sources. The level of the Obligation is set to rise each year reaching a target of 10 per cent. by 2010, by which time its value could be up to &#163;1 billion per year. The Obligation has been set up for a 25 year period (2002&#150;27), providing the right climate for expansion of wind energy and renewable energy generally.

 Departments are required to comply with the Government's general policy on insurance, which is set out in Government Accounting, Chapter 30, para 30.2.5, which notes that the Government do not need to purchase insurance to protect the viability of its business, and should consider insurance only where the value of claims met would exceed the cost of insurance premiums. Commercial insurance of a building is acceptable in cases where 



<P>
<P><I>22 Jul 2002 : Column 791W</I><P>
<i>(a)</i> insurance is a condition of a lease <i>(b)</i> the lessor will not accept a Government indemnity <i>(c)</i> incurring the total cost of the accommodation in question, including the cost of the insurance, is more cost-effective than other accommodation options [Government Accounting, para 30.2.11a]. Therefore, my Department does not normally insure the buildings it occupies. However, in some instances our landlords do insure their buildings and we make annual payments of around &#163;100,000 to cover this. These payments have not risen since 11 September 2001.

<P>

<a name="20722w29.html_para1">There is no formal procedure for notifying those against whom complaints have been made about excessive noise prior to an investigation being made. However, the types of noise complaints that local authorities are called upon to investigate vary considerably and not all will be considered by the investigating officer to constitute a statutory nuisance. It is common for complaints to receive at least some investigation before the person or business against whom the complaint is made is approached or advised of its receipt. In some instances this may be because the officer handling the complaint decides to try and witness the noise before determining whether or not it merits further investigation as a potential or actual statutory nuisance. In other circumstances it might actually frustrate the investigation of the noise if the person causing it is alerted in advance.
<P>

<a name="20722w29.html_para2">Some individuals take exception to being approached by a local authority without any effort having been made to establish the credibility of the complaint made against them, others may be upset that they have not been contacted immediately. It is not practicable to set out procedures that will satisfy all situations and it is often best that the most appropriate response to a particular complaint is judged by the case officer in the light of his or her knowledge and experience.

<a name="20722w29.html_para3">An example of the procedures adopted by local authorities is contained within the "Nuisance Guidance Note" published by Ellesmere Port and Neston Borough Council on their web site at http:// www.ellesmereport-neston.gov.uk/. This sets out their particular procedures with regard to noise nuisance and envisages cases where the complainant may not wish monitoring visits to start until after a letter has been sent to the person complained about. Otherwise it seems monitoring is carried out before or at the same time as a letter is sent.
<P>

<a name="20722w29.html_para4">In 1997 the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health (CIEH) produced a noise management guide titled "Guidance on the Creation and Maintenance of Effective Noise Management Policies and Practice for Local Authorities and their Officers". This provides guidance to local authorities on best practice and procedures to be adopted when dealing with noise complaints. To reflect the changes in the noise environment within the UK and the availability of new techniques, CIEH and DEFRA have agreed to jointly revise the document over the next nine months. When this becomes available we will circulate it to all local authorities in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and place copies in the House Libraries.
<P>

<a name="20722w29.html_para5">The CIEH guidance is referred to in the Department of the Environment Circular 8/97 dealing with the Noise Act 1996. The Circular provides advice on the investigation of noise complaints but makes it clear that, in the context of that Act,


<BR>
"the purpose of the initial investigation is to decide whether or not the noise complained of, exceeds, or might exceed, the permitted level . . .".

<a name="20722w29.html_para6">The Cabinet Office promotes the adoption and use of the Enforcement Concordat by central and local government organisations with an enforcement function (details are available on their web site).

 City status is not a right that can be claimed by the meeting of specific criteria, but an honour granted by Her Majesty the Queen under the Royal Prerogative, on the advice of Ministers. Important Royal anniversaries (such as The Queen's Golden Jubilee) are the usual occasions for awards of city status to be made. Awards were made, exceptionally, to mark the Millennium. Her Majesty has not yet expressed a wish to create any more new cities and no awards are foreseen in the near future.

 QinetiQ Ltd, which is the contractor responsible for setting up the 1901 census online website and providing the online service, has been making technical improvements to it.
<P>

<a name="20722w31.html_para3">QinetiQ is currently testing the site and the Public Record Office is also carrying out its own independent test programme. By the very nature of testing, solutions to particular issues often require a more general retesting, to verify that there are no adverse effects on the system as a whole. It is therefore not feasible to quantify what proportion of the testing programme has been completed at any particular time. The Public Record Office's own independent test company has undertaken a test to simulate the experience of one million user per hour accessing the system. These results will be analysed along with the other test results as soon as they are available. The final testing is now under way and it is anticipated that this will be completed by the end of July.

<a name="20722w31.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Making the 1881 and 1891 censuses available in electronic form is a high priority for the Public Record Office because census records are very heavily used by family historians, who constitute its largest single user group. Any organisation can seek a non-exclusive licence to use digital images of material contained in public records on a commercial basis. Such licensing contracts do not constitute any form of partnership between that organisation and the Public Record Office. MyFamily.com has already applied for, and received, a licence to digitise the census returns from 1841 to 1891 and make this material available on the internet. Other organisations have sought non-exclusive licences to make CDs of the images of these censuses and some for the 1891 census are already on the market. It is open to QinetiQ Ltd to apply for, and to be granted, a licence in a similar manner.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is responsible for dealing with all of the Department's Public Service Agreement targets.
<P>

<a name="20722w33.html_para3">All DWP projects, including modernisation of payments, are subjected to a gateway process staged review and approval by the director of project management throughout their lifecycle. They are subjected to structured independent peer reviews and undertake a formal risk assessment using the Department's assumption based risk identification methodology.

<a name="20722w33.html_para4">Risk identification is carried out at a very senior level and this provides an outward facing strategic approach to risk presence.

 Over 40 per cent. of payments for benefit claimants are already paid directly into their bank or building society. This provides a more modern, secure and efficient way of making payments. The table provides details broken down by benefits as at March 2002.
<P>

<a name="20722w33.html_para6">Girocheques are not a normal method of payment option for any benefit other than JSA. The estimated number of JSA customers paid by girocheque is 77 per cent.

 Under the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000, local authorities have a duty to assess and meet the needs of young people aged 16 and 17 who they continue to look after or who have left care. Income-related benefits are therefore not available to these young people. However, other benefits intended to meet a person's special needs, such as non-contributory Incapacity Benefit, may be available. Once they reach 18, care leavers are eligible to claim benefits in the normal way, and in general, the local authority no longer has the major responsibility for their welfare.

 <i>[holding answer 4 July 2002]:</i> We have taken powers in the Social Security Fraud Act 2001 to strengthen benefit fraud investigation and punish persistent offenders more severely. The provision to sanction people convicted of two separate benefit fraud offences in a three year period came into force on 1 April 2002, and can be applied only to people who commit two separate benefit offences after that date. It is therefore too early for this new sanction to have been applied in practice.

Sanctions are applied when people receiving a relevant benefit are found by a court to be in breach of their orders. The sanction lasts for a maximum period of four weeks.

In deciding on the sector classification of Network Rail, the main documents that the ONS used were: international statistical manuals&#151;The European System of Accounts (1955) and The System of National Accounts (1993), copies of which are available from the Library. The ONS also studied many legal documents, provided on a commercial and confidence basis. These documents are exempt from disclosure under section 13 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

 The Valuation Office Agency (VOA) is responsible for the valuation of business property for rating purposes. One of the difficulties for valuation officers (VOs) in identifying game farms is the fact that most of them are in remote rural areas and operate on land which was, quite properly, exempt from rating as agricultural land.
<P>

<a name="20722w37.html_para3">Game farms are not exempt from rating, but VOs have difficulty in keeping their records up to date to show when land that was exempt is no longer in agricultural use and should be assessed as a game farm.

<i>Official Report</i>, column 634, on street crime, what resources are available to the Metropolitan Police, what information he has received regarding those of the New York Police Department; and if he will make a statement.  [44397]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20722w37.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 July 2002]:</i> The net budget requirement for the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) in 2001/2 was &#163;1,980 million which has risen to &#163;2,038 million in 2002&#150;3. At the end of September, 2001, there were 25,374 police officers in the MPS, a rise of 679 from September 2000. At the same time, there were 10,240 civilian staff (93 more than the previous year) and 669 traffic wardens (60 fewer than the previous year).
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20722w38.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 March 2002]:</i> The requested information is not routinely collected centrally.
<P>

<a name="20722w38.html_para0">A research study, 'Mobile phone theft' (by Victoria Harrington and Pat Mayhew, Home Office research study 235), included provisional results of a survey of 15,000 11&#150;15 year olds which estimated that 12 per cent. of those questioned had been a victim of phone theft at least once in the last year. However, this survey was conducted in deprived areas.
<P>

<a name="20722w38.html_para1">A MORI survey in early 2001 of 5,000 11&#150;16 year olds, also quoted in the research study, estimated that 5 per cent. had been a victim of mobile phone theft at least once in the last year. The sample used was regarded as being more representative.
<P>

<a name="20722w38.html_para2">The research study separately estimated that, overall, in police areas where the research took place, 48 per cent. of all victims of phone robbery, and 63 per cent. of those accused of the offence, were under 18.
<P>

<a name="20722w38.html_para3">We are working with the police and the mobile phone industry to reduce mobile phone robbery, undertaking public awareness campaigns and joint tracking exercises. Our discussions with operators have recently borne fruit. 



<P>
<P><I>22 Jul 2002 : Column 826W</I><P>
By the summer all five of the main operators will be able to bar stolen handsets by reference to the unique IMEI number which identifies the handset. All of the operators are also working together to develop a shared database of stolen phones, which will allow them to disable stolen phones if there is an attempt to use them on a different network. We believe that this is a very important step forward, as it should remove one of the major incentives for robbery.
<P>

<a name="20722w38.html_para4">Operators have also agreed to improve security as they invest in new systems. We are pressing the handset manufacturers for similar commitments. A start has been made, but more needs to be done before Britain's mobile phone system can lead the world in security. The mobile phone industry needs to show more interest in the security of phones they are selling to British consumers and, as the motor industry has done, do more to prevent their customers from becoming the victims of crime.

<P>
<a name="20722w38.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Several crime reduction initiatives provide the opportunity for funding for such projects.
<P>

<a name="20722w38.html_para5">Under the crime reduction programme CCTV initiative up to &#163;80&#150;85 million will be spent in 2002&#150;03 on 279 CCTV schemes in residential areas. Funding for a number of these schemes also includes provision for improved street lighting.
<P>

<a name="20722w38.html_para6">Under the communities against drugs initiative the &#163;50 million funding for 2001&#150;02 (crime and disorder reduction partnerships' baseline allocation) comprised 32 per cent. for capital expenditure. Some partnerships' use of the funding includes regeneration works.
<P>

<a name="20722w38.html_para7">Under the safer communities initiative &#163;20 million funding is available in 2002&#150;03. There is no specific capital element but funding can be used to purchase capital items. Partnerships' plans are still being developed.
<P>

<a name="20722w38.html_para8">There is also funding from the capital modernisation fund to assist small retailers in deprived areas to improve the security of their businesses&#151;&#163;3 million in 2001&#150;02, &#163;6 million in 2002&#150;03 and &#163;6 million in 2003&#150;04. While this funding is not specifically directed towards residential neighbourhoods, environmental improvements such as better lighting and landscaping of shopping parades may well impact on crimes affecting residential neighbourhoods as well as those impacting on small retailers, since many small shops and parades of shops are located within, or close to, residential areas.
<P>

<a name="20722w38.html_para9">Approximately a fifth (&#163;380 million) of the &#163;1.9 billion allocated over ten years to the new deal for communities areas and a fifth (&#163;180 million) of the &#163;900 million allocated over three years to the 88 neighbourhood renewal areas will go towards tackling crime. Money allocated to an area is spent according to priorities agreed by the area and its local strategic partnership. Central records of this spending are not kept and so it is not possible to set out how much is spent specifically on initiatives to change the physical arrangement of an area.

The implications of this research will be considered carefully.

 <i>[holding answer 5 July 2002]:</i> The Prison Service suicide prevention strategy was reviewed in 2000 and my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw), the then Home Secretary, announced the launch of the new three-year suicide and self-harm strategy in February 2001. Work on the development of the new strategy started in April 2001 and will run to March 2004.
<P>

<a name="20722w39.html_para2">One of the projects currently being developed as part of the new strategy is the Care of Prisoners project. This project includes a review of procedures for prisoners at risk of suicide and self-harm (the F2052SH system) referred to in the answer to my right hon. Friend's question of 26 February. A new process for managing at risk prisoners is being developed and will be piloted in the autumn.

<P>

<P>
<a name="20722w39.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis informs me that no officers were drafted into London from other forces following the events of September 11. However, officers from all London boroughs were deployed to meet security needs. Crime statistics published on 12 July (Home Office Statistical Bulletin 07/02) showed that, in the period following this redeployment of officers, there were falls in recorded burglary in Westminster and rises in outer London boroughs. A less marked effect was seen in relation to levels of vehicle crime, but there was no noticeable impact on robbery in Westminster during the same period. Operational deployment is a matter for the Commissioner.

 No recent research has been commissioned on the improper influence and intimidation of jurors. The Home Office has commissioned more general research into juries and jurors' experiences and perceptions of the criminal justice system. A report is scheduled for publication later this year.

 Antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) are community-based civil orders, which can be applied for by the police or local authority, in consultation with each other against an individual or several individuals whose behaviour is antisocial. Applications are to the magistrates court acting in its civil capacity.
<P>

<a name="20722w39.html_para4">ASBOs were introduced from 1 April 1999. The data given in the table cover the period up to the end of December 2001 (latest available).
<P>

<a name="20722w39.html_para5">We are currently considering whether any further checks are needed to ensure the accuracy of the number of ASBOs reported.

 As set out in chapter 5 of the White Paper "Secure Borders, Safe Haven: Integration with Diversity in Modern Britain", in co-operation with the voluntary sector the Government are looking at how to offer the victims of trafficking particular support so that they can escape their circumstances and, in certain cases, help law enforcement against organised criminals. Where victims are willing to come forward to the authorities, we are considering special arrangements for their protection. We will also consider whether it would be appropriate to allow them to remain here.
<P>

<a name="20722w40.html_para0">Where they are to return home, we are looking at how to assist them to do so, providing them with initial counselling, ensuring that they have suitable accommodation to return to, and providing help to enable them to reintegrate into their own community and find employment.

 The Home Department received two complaints about consultation exercises published in 2001. The first concerned the consultation exercise on 'justification for the use of X/Gamma radiation scanners by the Immigration Service for detecting people seeking to enter the United Kingdom illegally in vehicles and/or freight, by clandestine means' and was received in printed format. The second concerned the 'consultation paper on revising the definition of categories of deaths of members of the public during or following police contact' and was in electronic format.

<a name="20722w42.html_wqn0"><B> Jeremy Corbyn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department for each English police authority, how many specialist police houses have been sold in the past three years.  [36620]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20722w42.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 July 2002]:</i> The only information available relates to the sale of police dwellings. The number of dwellings sold in the past three years by English police authorities is detailed in the table.
<P>

<a name="20722w42.html_para0">In its report entitled "Action stations&#151;Improving the Management of the Police Estate" (published March 1999), the Audit Commission recommended that police forces identify and dispose of buildings that were unsuitable or had maintenance liabilities which were beyond the forces' means. further it recommended that the remaining residential estate was rationalised. In some cases, for example, it may be appropriate to sell off some vacant accommodation in order to refurbish and bring back into use other accommodation.
<P>

<a name="20722w42.html_para1">In those areas where high housing costs are hindering recruitment and retention of police officers, allocations from the starter home initiative (SHI) will help about 1,100 police staff to buy first homes over the three years to March 2004. (In London about 550 police staff are expected to benefit from the first round allocations announced in September 2001).
<P>

<a name="20722w42.html_para2">We have also recently agreed with the Department of Health that the role of the national health service housing co-ordinator will be extended to cover the police service and a secondee from the police service is due to join the co-ordinator's team shortly.

 The courts have a statutory duty and right to commission pre-sentence reports where they think it appropriate to do so and the area Probation Service has a statutory duty to provide them. A pre-sentence report may take the shorter form of a Specific Sentence Report where there is reason to believe that the offender presents a lower risk or the court has a specific sentence in mind. National Standards for the supervision of offenders in the community 2000 require pre-sentence reports to be prepared within a maximum of 15 working days of the court's request.

 <i>[holding answer 11 July 2002]:</i> The target to which the hon. Member refers is set by the Ombudsman for Prisons and Probation. The Ombudsman sets a target of issuing a final report of his investigations within 12 weeks. In his annual report for 2000&#150;01, published on 27 June, the Ombudsman reports a decline in performance in meeting this target in the case of complaints from prisoners, from 73 per cent. of cases dealt with in 1999&#150;2000 to 63 per cent. of cases dealt with in 2000&#150;01. As explained in his report, the drop in performance was largely brought about by a 53 per cent. increase in the number of eligible complaints, an increase which he attributes to a speeding up of the Prison Service complaints system so that more prisoners are prepared to complete the complaints process before going to the Ombudsman direct. Most complaints and appeals are now answered by the Prison Service within six weeks. The Ombudsman can only investigate once the internal complaints process has been completed.
<P>

<a name="20722w43.html_para0">The Ombudsman was awarded additional resources to cope with the backlog in 2001&#150;02 and it has now substantially decreased.
<P>

<a name="20722w43.html_para1">The Ombudsman's remit did not extend to complaints relating to the National Probation Service until September 2001, and they are not covered in his annual report. All these complaints are being completed by his office on time.

On a Saturday the cost to support the entire network of 15,000 desktops across England and Wales would be &#163;8,704. On a Sunday, the same cost would be &#163;11,600. To deliver this service the supplier has to provide people on call around the country, responding to incidents and resolving problems. These costs would only be paid should this work be needed. To date, in the lifetime of this contract, it has not been. The cost to move a workstation would be &#163;192. The contract represents good value for money.

 <i>[holding answer 11 July 2002]:</i> Probation Service national standards provide clear guidelines on what the Probation Service is expected to deliver in respect of enforcement of breach action. Performance is closely monitored and there is clear evidence of an improvement increases of breach action from 51 per cent. of cases in 1998 to 70 per cent. in September 2000 (the last date for validated returns). This is against a target of 90 per cent. This improvement has been achieved at the same time as the standard against which performance was measured was significantly toughened during the period.

 We announced in February of last year that standard and enhanced disclosures will be issued free of charge in the case of volunteers. The Police Act 1997 (Criminal Records) Regulations 2002 define a volunteer as a person engaged in an activity which involves spending time, unpaid (except for travel and other approved out-of-pocket expenses), doing something which aims to benefit some third party other than or in addition to a close relative. Those persons in the categories mentioned who met the criteria for these levels of Disclosure which are set out in the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (Exceptions) Order 1975 and section 115 of the Police Act 1997 and whose remuneration amounted only to travel and other approved out-of-pocket expenses would, of course, be entitled to a free Disclosure.

<P>

<a name="20722w43.html_para9">Additionally, for the Immigration and Nationality Enquiry Bureau number, the use of an 0870 number was agreed on the grounds that the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) would reinvest any money earned back into improving the telephone bureau operation and thereby customer service. This has been done and &#163;0.75 million was invested this spring in the purchase of a new switchboard with increased functionality.

ending December 2000 and 2001. There has been a significant increase in the numbers of new recruits to the Metropolitan Police Service, and the training school now places more emphasis on helping those officers who do not achieve the required standard within 18 weeks to achieve the appropriate level of competence by extending the basic training period. This is more efficient and cost effective than the previous approach, where it was more generally the case that the force would dispense with the services of officers failing to meet the required standard by the end of the 18-week foundation training course.

 On 24 October 2001, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary asked the Police Negotiating Board (PNB) to explore and agree a package to modernise police pay and conditions of service. On 27 December 2001, the PNB reached agreement in principle, subject to ratification by all parties following consultation with their members. On 25 February, PNB failed to ratify the agreement reached on 27 December 2001. As required by the PNB Constitution, a period of conciliation followed. On 26 April, the conciliators for the official and staff sides of the PNB agreed on a recommendation for settlement. The details of the recommended conciliated settlement were placed on the Home Office website on the same day.

 Work is in progress, in consultation with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), to produce guidance to police authorities on dealing with perpetrators of domestic violence within police ranks. A target date will be set for issuing the guidance once the new ACPO lead takes up his post and consultation will take place with relevant bodies once the guidance is drafted. In addition to this, work is being undertaken on ensuring that police discipline procedures complement any guidance to be issued. Some police forces already have procedures in place to ensure they respond effectively to any indication that police staff may be perpetrating domestic violence and evidence of good practice may be incorporated into the guidance where appropriate.

 <i>[holding answer 11 July 2002]:</i> Probation service national standards set out what the probation service is expected to deliver in respect of providing pre-sentence reports to the court. Performance is closely monitored and there is clear evidence of improvement in magistrates courts from 54.6 per cent. in 1996&#150;97 to 79.5 per cent. in 2001&#150;02. This is against a target of 90 per cent. The probation service is working with the courts to improve further performance in this area.

 Following discussions in the Lawrence Inquiry Steering Group meeting in October 2001, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has issued further guidance to staff. All cases, whether submitted for preliminary advice or as files for prosecution under Part III of the Public Order Act 1986, will be considered by a small team of lawyers within the Casework Directorate at CPS headquarters, in order to ensure that best practice is followed and that there is consistency in decision making.

Closed Circuit television (CCTV) is present in some areas of the prison, but not in the residential areas. In those areas of the prison where CCTV is present, it might contribute to the prevention of self-harm but this is not its primary purpose.

 The numbers of special constables in England and Wales from 1991 to 2001 are given in the table. From 1990 to 1995, statistics on the strength of the special constabulary in England and Wales were collected by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. These were compiled at the end of the calendar year until 1993, and then for the financial year 1994&#150;95. Since 1995, these statistics have been collected by the Home Office Research Development and Statistics Directorate. They are compiled at the end of March and September each year.

<a name="20722w46.html_para0">No comparable data were collected before 2000&#150;01. From 2000&#150;01, delivery targets for literacy and numeracy in prisons have been for the number of basic skills qualifications achieved annually by prisoners. In 2000&#150;01, prisoners achieved 12,500 basic skills qualifications at level 2, rising to nearly 16,000 in 2001&#150;02. Targets for this year and next have been widened to cover the achievement of basic skills qualifications at all levels. This will help establishments to be more responsive to the range of prisoners' basic skills needs.
<P>

<a name="20722w46.html_para1">The Government expects prisoners to achieve 28,800 basic skills qualifications in 2002&#150;03 rising to 32,000 in 2003&#150;04. By helping to equip prisoners with the skills they need to resettle effectively back into the community on release, these achievements will contribute to reduced rates of re-offending and to making communities safer.

 <i>[holding answer 13 June 2002]:</i> Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) and the Standards Unit have separate and complementary roles. They work together to identify where forces and basic command unit's (BCUs) need support to improve their performance. HMIC will continue to report on performance across the whole service, alerting the Police Standards Unit (PSUs) where it believes its support is needed to improve performance: PSU by contrast will focus on particular areas where BCUs and forces need help to improve performance.
<P>

<a name="20722w46.html_para2">In doing this, PSU will draw on advice from HMIC, monthly crime data by BCU and the Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP) (and other sources where available). Its early work includes developing analysis and assessment frameworks to make best use of police performance data and quality assurance processes to ensure the accuracy and reliability of this data.

A further 26 cases were sent to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for review, but no charges were laid in any of these cases. The CPS reviewed each case before charges were brought, with the result that no case in which charges had been brought was discontinued. 31 of those charged pleaded not guilty to the allegations made against them, and one pleaded guilty. Five of these 31 were convicted. In total 530 complaints were received in the course of the operation; all complainants were identified.

<P>
<a name="20722w47.html_spnew1"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The policy on the exercise of discretion in safe third country cases where family ties to the United Kingdom are claimed is that potential third country cases would normally have their asylum claims considered substantively in this country where:

<BR>
(a) an applicant's spouse is in the United Kingdom;

(c) the applicant has an unmarried minor child in the United Kingdom.

<P>

<a name="20722w47.html_para5">The policy in <i>(a)</i> would not be applied in cases where a marriage was contracted after the applicant's arrival in the United Kingdom. In all cases "in the United Kingdom" is to be taken as meaning with leave to enter or remain or on temporary admission to this country as an asylum seeker prior to an initial decision on their application.
<P>

<a name="20722w47.html_para6">Discretion may be exercised according to the merits of the case where:
<P>

<a name="20722w47.html_para7">

<BR>
(d) a married minor was involved but the criteria in <i>(b)</i> or <i>(c)</i> above were otherwise fulfilled. (We would be less likely to consider cases under (c) than (b) under these circumstances).
<BR>
(e) the applicant was an elderly or otherwise dependent parent;
<BR>
(f) the family link was not one which would normally be considered but there was clear evidence that the applicant was wholly or mainly dependent on the relative in the United Kingdom and that there was an absence of similar support elsewhere.




<P>

<P>

<a name="20722w47.html_para8">I would expect cases falling into this latter category to be rare.
<P>

<a name="20722w47.html_para9">Factors which might influence the exercise of discretion in these cases, such as language, cultural links or the number of family members in the United Kingdom may have a bearing, but there would need to be a compelling combination of such factors to ensure the exercise of discretion in favour of an applicant.
<P>

<a name="20722w47.html_para10">Cases citing family ties which would not normally be considered and which did not display any of the features, which engaged the exercise of discretion, would not normally be considered substantively. This means that a brother, who was not dependent on his sibling(s), would not normally have his case considered here, no matter how strong his cultural or linguistic links with the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="20722w47.html_para11">The intention of the policy is to re-unite members of an existing family unit who, through circumstances outside their control, had become fragmented. However, I emphasise that where the relationship did not exist prior to the person's arrival to the United Kingdom, the policy would only be applied in the most exceptionally compelling cases.
<P>

<a name="20722w47.html_para12">I am satisfied that this policy complies with the United Kingdom's obligations as regards the European Convention on Human Rights and that it is consistent with our obligations under the Dublin Convention, as set out in Article 1 of Decision 1&#150;2000 of the Committee set up by Article 18 of the Dublin Convention concerning the transfer of responsibility for family members in accordance with Article 3(4) and Article 9 of the Convention.

<a name="20722w47.html_para17">As affirmed in the White Paper "Managing the Nuclear Legacy" the Government intend to separate the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority Constabulary from the UKAEA and reconstitute it as a stand-alone force, overseen by a statutory Police Authority, in order to make it independent of the nuclear industry and provide improved governance arrangements. The constabulary's role, which has remained broadly unchanged since its inception in 1954, is to protect specified nuclear sites and escort sensitive nuclear material in transit. It is not envisaged that reconstitution will affect its size, role or the locations where it serves.

<a name="20722w48.html_para0">The circumstances in which confidential information about individuals can be disclosed are governed by the common law duty of confidence. This legal obligation in no way constrains health professionals and others who hold confidential information from disclosing such information appropriately where children are at risk.
<P>

<a name="20722w48.html_para1">The Department issued guidance entitled "The Protection and Use of Patient Information" to the national health service in March 1996. This explains that patient information should only be released on a need to know basis if it is required by statute or the courts, is supported by the consent of the individual, or if it is judged that there is a strong public interest justification in disclosure which overrides the duty of confidence to the patient. For example, in circumstances where failure to do so may expose the patient or others to a risk of death or serious harm or the information is needed to prevent serious crime. Disclosure of information in the public interest is a matter of professional judgment and must be decided on a case by case basis by the health professional responsible for the patient's care.
<P>

<a name="20722w48.html_para2">In child protection cases, the overriding principle is to secure the best interests of the child. Therefore, if a health professional has knowledge of abuse or neglect they may disclose relevant information to an appropriate person or authority where disclosure is felt to be in the medical interests of the child patient.

 The information is provided in the table which is in the Library. Of the Department's agencies and non-departmental public bodies, only the National Health Service Estates Agency had a regional structure in 1997. Currently only the National Care Standards Commission, which was established in 2002, has a regional structure.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health, pursuant to the answer of 24 June 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 740W, on hospital discharges, (1) where and when the target for a reduction in the number of people experiencing delayed discharge by 20 per cent. between March 2002 and March 2003 was published;  [65186]

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20722w49.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The 20 per cent. target figure was published in the Department's "Priorities and Planning Framework 2002&#150;03" in December 2001, which is available on the Department's website. There is no target for bed days lost. We expect that there will be an increase in the number of available bed days as a consequence of the reduction in numbers of patients delayed, in line with that seen over the last two quarters of 2001&#150;02.

 Carer support and strength of caring arrangements are two of the areas assessed when putting together a care plan for the patient leaving hospital. The written care plan which the patient is given includes the support carers are willing and able to offer.

 The main Government agency for research into the causes of and treatments for disease is the Medical Research Council (MRC), which is funded via the Department of Trade and Industry. The MRC has not supported any research in this area in the last five years. The MRC always welcomes high quality applications for support into any aspect of human health and these are judged in open competition with other demands on funding. Awards are made according to their scientific quality and importance to human health.
<P>

<a name="20722w49.html_para1">The Department directly funds research into policy and the delivery of effective practice in health and social care, and provides national health service support funding for research commissioned by the research councils and charities in the NHS. The Department has not supported any work in this area in the last five years.
<P>

<a name="20722w49.html_para2">Management of much of the research supported by NHS research and development funding is devolved and expenditure at project level is not held centrally by the Department.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the vacancy rate was for consultant psychiatrists in <i>(a)</i> England and <i>(b)</i> each region in each of the last six years.  [67710]

<P>
<a name="20722w49.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The number of consultants in post in the psychiatry group has increased from 2,808 in September 1999 to 3,030 in March 2002. This is an increase of 8 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20722w49.html_para3">The national health service vacancy survey has only been conducted in March each year since 1999. The survey collects information on the number of posts which trusts are actively trying to fill which have been vacant for three months or more.
<P>

<a name="20722w49.html_para4">There are six specialities within the psychiatry group. In 2001, the vacancy survey focused on specialties that were considered particularly problematic. For this reason, only four of the six specialties were collected.
<P>

<a name="20722w49.html_para5">Increased vacancies are to be expected at a time when we are trying to dramatically increase the size of the workforce. New investment enables NHS trusts to create new posts; however, there can be a delay in providing sufficient staff for all the posts.

The department was satisfied that the CRB would be able to meet the demands for disclosures. The CRB has experienced early operating difficulties which have lead to delays in responding to applications for Disclosure, measures are being taken to overcome these. We are determined that the CRB will be in a position as soon as possible to meet the high standards of service that it has made clear it will deliver to its customers. The short-term implications for particular service areas using the CRB service are being closely monitored.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has received six parliamentary questions from the hon. Member and one letter from Catherine Pope, chair of the Society of Chartered Physiotherapists. I can confirm that the national service framework for mental health emphasises the importance of a multi-disciplinary approach to care and treatment, and that there is good evidence that regular physical activity reduces the risk of depression and has positive benefits for mental health. This is important for people with severe mental illness who may be at particular risk of physical ill health.

<a name="20722w51.html_spnew5"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Decisions about the configuration of services to meet the needs of people with mental health problems are a local matter, in the context of national guidance. The national service framework (NSF) for mental health emphasises the importance of a multi- disciplinary approach to care and treatment. It also emphasises the importance of attention to physical health and the value of exercise. However, the NSF is not prescriptive about the numbers of different professionals needed. Instead, it emphasises the outcomes to be achieved, and the importance of evidence-based practise. I understand that services are being planned in order to ensure that mental health service users who require physiotherapy continue to receive this both now and in the future.

 Physiotherapists are experts in movement and mobility. They are trained to use their skills to promote good health, prevent disability and treat people who may have any of a wide range of health problems, including mental health. In order to use and apply the physiotherapeutic skill base with mental health patients, it is necessary for professionals to have a good understanding of mental illness and the health effects from mental illness, in this case particularly physical presentations as part of their condition.
<P>

<a name="20722w51.html_para4">The physical needs of people with mental health problems are recognised in the mental health national service framework (NSF). Following publication of the NSF in 1999, the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy commissioned an evidence-based bulletin of the role of physiotherapy in mental health.

<a name="20722w51.html_wqn8"><B> Rev. Martin Smyth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many patients claim to have Gulf War Syndrome; and what funds are available in 2002&#150;03 for research into its cause and cure.  [67805]

 <i>[holding answer 16 July 2002]:</i> I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20722w51.html_para6">The Ministry of Defence does not recognise "Gulf War Syndrome" as a medical condition. It accepts that some veterans of the 1990&#150;91 Gulf Conflict have become ill and that many believe this ill health is unusual and related to their Gulf experience. A large number of multi-system, multi-organ, non-specific, medically unexplained symptoms have been reported by some Gulf veterans as well as recognised medical conditions. The overwhelming consensus of the scientific and medical community is that there is insufficient evidence to enable this ill-health to be characterised as a unique illness, condition or 'syndrome'.
<P>

<a name="20722w51.html_para7">Nevertheless, a paper published in the British Medical Journal dated 1 September 2001 entitled: "Prevalence of Gulf war veterans who believe they have Gulf war syndrome: questionnaire study" suggested that approximately 17 per cent. (9,000) of United Kingdom Gulf veterans believed they have "Gulf War Syndrome".
<P>

<a name="20722w51.html_para8">During financial year 2002&#150;03, the MOD expects to spend approximately &#163;1 million (including VAT) on Gulf veterans' illnesses research projects. This figure does not include current and planned MOD research into DU munitions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health whether the Food Standards Agency complied with its obligation to consult those directly affected in the case of its proposed ban on sheep intestine on its decision.  [68500]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20722w51.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 July 2002]:</i> As no new legislation was being put forward the Food Standards Agency were under no statutory obligation to consult interested parties on the recommendations of the core stakeholder group. The agency did, however, consult over 1,000 interested parties in May of this year. The consultation gave the opportunity for a wide range of interested parties to comment on what was, in effect, a report considering the agency's possible policy options.
<P>

<a name="20722w51.html_para9">As it is the agency's stated aim to conduct its business in an open and transparent way it decided to obtain the views of those most likely to be directly affected at the earliest opportunity, even though they were not proposing new legislation.
