<a name="90505w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Tyrie: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 17 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>665</i>, on special advisers, if he will give the total travel cost of each occasion when <i>(a)</i> departmental and <i>(b)</i> non-departmental advisers have travelled abroad in an official capacity since 2 May 1997 and the place visited.

<P>
<a name="90505w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 For the period 2 May 1997 to 27 April 1999, Special Advisers in my Department have travelled overseas in an official capacity on two occasions to Brussels and once to Washington. The total cost of travel and any hotel accommodation for the visits to Brussels was &#163;433.00. The cost of the visit to Washington was accounted for in the answer given by the Prime Minister to the hon. Member for Lichfield (Mr. Fabricant) on 13 March 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>366-67</i>. Because of the block booking arrangements, the cost per person for travel was &#163;3,500. All travel complied with the requirements of the Ministerial Code and the Civil Service Management Code.

<P>
<a name="90505w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The results of independent assessments conducted by Her Majesty's Fire Service Inspectorate up to 12 April were reported to the Action 2000 National Infrastructure Forum on 21 April. The latest position is that 45 out of 49 brigades in England and Wales have so far been assessed. Of these, 22 are classified as prepared, and 23 have been given an Action Plan. All are expected to be prepared by September. It is not my intention to name individual brigades at this stage.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90505w01.htm_wqn6"><B> Mr. Fearn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what is his Department's estimate of the number of animals used in experiments in <i>(a)</i> 1996, <i>(b)</i> 1997 and <i>(c)</i> 1998;  [82910]
<P>

(3) how many project licences were issued in <i>(a)</i> 1996, <i>(b)</i> 1997 and <i>(c)</i> 1998 for animal experiments.  [82909]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90505w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Information on the use of animals in scientific procedures is published each year in the Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals. Table 1a gives details of the number of animals used. In 1996, the total was 2,646,026 and, in 1997, it was 2,573,088.
<P>

<a name="90505w01.htm_para3">Figures for animal use during 1998 are being collated and will be published in July.
<P>

<a name="90505w01.htm_para4">Scientific procedures must normally be carried out at designated establishments. The Annual Reports of the Animal Procedures Committee 1996 and 1997 list the numbers of such establishments and also give the number of project licences issued. They show that:
<P>

<a name="90505w01.htm_para5"><P>

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90505w01.htm_para7">Figures for 1998 will be published shortly. They will show that there were 286 certificates of designation in force on 31 December 1998 and that 1,104 project licences were granted during 1998.
<P>

<a name="90505w01.htm_para8">In specific circumstances (such as field trials), experiments can also take place at places other than designated establishments. Details of the number of such places are not held centrally.
<P>

<a name="90505w01.htm_para9">Of the 286 certificates of designation in force on 31 December 1998, 107 were registered as commercial concerns. The number of companies may differ slightly from this: some companies, for example, may hold more than one certificate of designation each covering a different facility.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90505w01.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 There is no reliable estimate of the number of illegal firearms in circulation in this country.
<P>

<a name="90505w01.htm_para10">The existence of illegal firearms is of great concern to the Government.

 To meet its customers' needs the Passport Agency is now prioritising applications by customers' declared travel dates. Its secondary standard of service target is to give priority to customers' travel needs aiming to meet their declared travel dates for at least 99.99 per cent. of passports issued. The Agency is meeting this target and will continue to do so.
<P>

<a name="90505w01.htm_para11">The Agency's aim is to reduce turnround times in all the six regional passport offices to its target of ten days by September and in the meantime to meet customers' declared travel needs. It will do this by injecting additional resources, through system improvements and clear messages to passport applicants on how they can best assist the Agency to meet their needs.

<P>
<a name="90505w02.htm_wqn0"><B> Lorna Fitzsimons: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what approach the Government are taking in relation to statements about the compatibility of new legislation with the Convention rights set out in the Human Rights Act 1998.  [83540]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90505w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 A statement under section 19(1)(a) of the Human Rights Act may be made where, in the view of the Minister, the provisions of the Bill are compatible with the Convention rights. In other cases a statement under section 19(1)(b) of the Act should be made: such a statement is not one that the provisions of the Bill are incompatible with the Convention rights but only one to the effect that the Minister is unable to make a statement of compatibility. A section 19(1)(a) statement is a positive statement of compatibility.
<P>

<a name="90505w02.htm_para0">If a section 19(1)(a) statement is to be made, a Minister must be clear that, at a minimum, the balance of argument supports the view that the provisions are compatible. Lawyers will advise whether the provisions of the Bill are on balance compatible with the Convention rights. In doing so, they will consider whether it is more likely than not that the provisions of the Bill will stand up to challenge on Convention grounds before the domestic courts and the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. A Minister should not be advised to make a statement of compatibility where legal advice is that on balance the provisions of the Bill would not survive such a challenge. The fact that there are valid arguments to be advanced against any anticipated challenge is not a sufficient basis on which to advise a Minister that he may make a statement of compatibility where it is thought that these arguments would not ultimately succeed before the courts.
<P>

<a name="90505w02.htm_para1">Section 19 of the Act applies where a Minister of the Crown is in charge of a Bill, that is, either a Government Bill or a Consolidation Bill. Section 19 does not apply to Private Members' bills: there is no duty to make a statement about their compatibility with the Convention rights. Where the Bill is directly assisted by the Government, however, the Minister responsible for the policy should, as a matter of good practice, express the Government's views on compatibility with the Convention rights during the Second Reading debate.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to change <i>(a)</i> the name of and <i>(b)</i> ceremonials associated with Remembrance Day.  [83272]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90505w02.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 There are no plans to change the name "Remembrance Day", which is also known as "Remembrance Sunday". Nor are there any plans to change the present arrangements for the official ceremony at the Cenotaph, which are generally recognised as successfully uniting the nation in memory of all those who made the supreme sacrifice and all who mourn them.
<P>

<a name="90505w02.htm_para2">The Royal British Legion, which organises the march past the Cenotaph that follows the official ceremony on Remembrance Sunday, has made proposals which will allow greater participation in future years by non ex-Service groups and individuals. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has welcomed the proposals for expansion of the march past put forward by the Royal British Legion, and Home Office officials are discussing the details with them.

 The Royal Air Force's stock of 209,625 HB876 bomblets (as at 1 April 1999), the sub-munition for the JP233 runway denial weapon, is being withdrawn from service to comply with the Ottawa Convention and destroyed by a contractor in Germany. Destruction will be completed by 1 January 2000, well ahead of the schedule stipulated under Ottawa of the four years after entry into force of the Convention. No anti-personnel mines are held by either the Royal Navy or UK Special Forces.

<P>
<a name="90505w02.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 Providing details of those weapon systems being developed by other NATO forces currently carrying out operations in Kosovo is a matter for those nations concerned. The Ottawa Convention, and the Landmines Act 1998, prohibit the UK from developing, stockpiling, using or transferring either <i>(a)</i> anti-personnel mines, or <i>(b)</i> weapons containing anti-personnel mines.

In the case of <i>(c)</i>, the UK's equipment programme (including those weapons in service; being developed in collaboration with other NATO countries; or awaiting procurement decisions) currently contains the following anti-vehicle systems.

 Details of the UK's anti-biological warfare agent immunisation programme for the Gulf conflict were declassified in December 1996. An explanation of the vaccines used and the reasoning behind the programme was published in October 1997 in the MOD paper "Background to the Use of Medical Countermeasures to Protect British Forces during the Gulf War (Operation GRANBY)". A copy of this publication has been placed in the Library of the House at that time.
<P>

<a name="90505w02.htm_para4">A Fact Finding Team within the Ministry of Defence's Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Unit (GVIU) was established in September 1997 to look into the implementation in-theatre of the 1991 programme of immunisation against biological warfare agents. This review is based on oral testimony and extant documentary evidence. with a view to making public as much information as possible. The team's fieldwork was completed last autumn and a paper based on their work, and on other contemporary material that has been located, is in the course of preparation. This will be published once it is completed, which is expected to be within the next three months.
<P>

<a name="90505w02.htm_para5">In May 1997, the Government announced the funding of a research programme to investigate the possible adverse health effects of the combination of vaccines and tablets which were given to troops in the Gulf to protect them against the threat of biological and chemical warfare agents. An Independent Panel has been set up to oversee this research programme. The Panel consists of experts in fields of toxicology, immunology, virology, microbiology and epidemiology and includes two members who have been nominated by Gulf veterans groups. The programme as a whole is now expected to take some three and a half years to complete. However, we expect to publish results from the first phase of work during the first half of 1999.
<P>

<a name="90505w02.htm_para6">This research involves an in depth study into the potential adverse health effects of interactions between the vaccines which could have been administered to Service personnel at the time of the Gulf War, both with

and without pyridostigmine bromide (PB) which was present in the NAPS tablets given to UK troops in the Gulf War as a pre-treatment against nerve agents.
<P>

<a name="90505w02.htm_para7">Investigation of the specific combination of anthrax and pertussis vaccines is a priority element of the programme. The National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) have been asked to repeat the tests they carried out in the late 1990 that led the Department of Health to notify the MOD that it had anxieties about the simultaneous use of anthrax and pertussis vaccines. NIBSC will commence this work later this year, when protocols are finalised. Their programme is expected to run for two years.
<P>

<a name="90505w02.htm_para8">Initial dose-ranging work at CBD Porton Down on the physical effects of vaccines and PB in rodents is nearing completion and a meeting of the Independent Panel held in March this year gave CBD permission to proceed with longer term studies to investigate potential cognitive and neurophysical effects of the vaccines/PB combination. NIBSC have also been invited to participate (in particular in the anthrax/pertussis work) and it is intended that a number of other scientific and academic bodies will contribute to the research in due course. It is expected that this study will report towards the end of 2002.
<P>

<a name="90505w02.htm_para9">The Independent Panel also approved a study to determine whether CBD Porton Down staff, who have received multiple immunisations including anthrax and plague in the course of their duties, exhibit higher levels of ill-health than their non-vaccinated colleagues. This study is expected to be complete by the end of this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on <i>(a)</i> the level of Yugoslav air defence capability and <i>(b)</i> the threat to NATO aircraft from (i) non-portable, (ii) towed and (iii) self-propelled air defence weaponry, following the initial NATO air campaign.  [82474]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90505w03.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 The Yugoslav air defence capability has been and will continue to be damaged by the NATO air campaign. All Yugoslav operational air defence weapons are portable to a greater or lesser extent. Their towed anti aircraft guns present a limited threat to NATO's high altitude air attacks. These guns and their self-propelled air defence weapons still pose a credible threat to NATO aircraft, if operating at low level. NATO continues to take appropriate measures to minimise the threat.

 We estimate that NATO has destroyed 70 out of 450 aircraft of all types. This includes seven MiG-29s, 16 MIG-21s and 35 ORAO/GALEB aircraft. Between 5 per cent. and 10 per cent. of their aircraft might have been non-operational before the NATO campaign began. The Yugoslav Air Force continues to fly a limited number of combat missions but NATO action has had a considerable impact on its capability.

<a name="90505w04.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 We have undertaken a comprehensive investment appraisal and business case study to inform a decision on the location of the headquarters of the Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO) following its Foundation Year. I am now able to announce that, subject to full consultation with the Trades Unions, the headquarters will be based from 1 April 2000 at Ensleigh in Bath. The headquarters will comprise only a very small proportion of the DLO's staff, but its new location is the best site to enable it to drive forward the revolution in logistic support, deliver the full scale of early business improvements expected from the newly unified organisation, work closely with the Defence Procurement Agency to develop the Smart Procurement initiative and meet the DLO vision to excel as an integrated and responsive defence logistics team. Once agreement is reached with the Trade Unions, transition planning will begin in earnest with the aim of a progressive move to the new location completed by 1 April 2000.

<a name="90505w04.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 April 1999]:</i> The closure of any successful business, whether operated by a foreign or indigenous company, is always a matter for regret. The DTI's Invest in Britain Bureau and its partners seek to ensure that, where multi-national firms are considering global rationalisation, the case for the UK is put forward strongly to local management. However, commercial decisions taken in the light of world market conditions rest with the companies themselves.

The good practice recognises that the cost of clearing up after unauthorised encampments can be high, and suggests that costs might be reduced by the provision of refuse collection and disposal services during the encampment.
<P>

<a name="90505w06.htm_para0">We want to encourage local authorities to think creatively about how best to manage unauthorised camping. Part of their thinking may involve the provision of temporary, serviced sites as advised in Department of the Environment Circular 18/94 "Gypsy Sites Policy and Unauthorised Camping", and latterly in the good practice guidance.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if civil airlines flying into United Kingdom airports are required to have radar enabling their pilots to detect other planes or flying objects directly below them.  [82849]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90505w06.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Many passenger transport aeroplanes flying in UK airspace already have an airborne collision avoidance system installed and operating. This system is known as Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) II. It can provide advisory information including recommended avoidance manoeuvres to the pilot if another aircraft equipped with an operating transponder beacon is likely to pass too close. The intruder aircraft may be coming from any direction and may be above, below or at the same level as the aeroplane equipped with TCAS.
<P>

<a name="90505w06.htm_para1">With effect from 1 January 2000, all aeroplanes with more than 30 passenger seats or with a maximum take off mass that exceeds 15,000 kilogrammes will need to be equipped with an improved version of TCAS II that offers enhanced operational performance. It is intended that by 1 January 2005 this requirement should be extended to all aeroplanes that have more than 19 passenger seats or a maximum take off mass of more than 5,700 kilogrammes.

 I understand that this package, which was misdirected from the United States, arrived at Stansted Airport on Saturday 24 April 1999, as part of a normal shipment of radioactive material, and was placed in Federal Express's radioactive material store. When it was recognised that this package did not belong in the United Kingdom, the consignor was contacted and its proper destination ascertained. The package was returned to the United States on Monday 26 April 1999. At no time did it leave the control of Federal Express during its brief stay in the United Kingdom. The material was correctly contained in a package approved by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the US Department of Transportation in compliance with the requirements of the International Civil Aviation Organization's Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air (Class 7) which governs the international transport of dangerous goods by air. I also understand that the package bore the appropriate markings and the correct labels, enabling it to be properly and safely handled. I would emphasise that the package at no time posed any threat to the health of workers, the public or to the environment.

<P>

<a name="90505w07.htm_para0">The targets are designed to assist in developing a seamless and integrated service of flood forecasting, warning and response as well as a more certain delivery of Government policy towards flood and coastal defence.

 <i>[holding answer 4 May 1999]:</i> Firstly, I congratulate the Rugby Football League (RFL) on their successful bid for this major international sporting event and look forward to a world-beating competition next year.

<P>

<a name="90505w08.htm_para0">The RFL have been in close contact with UK Sport both before and after bidding for this event and are currently drawing up a business plan which will enable UK Sport to make a full assessment of their financial requirements. I offered my support as venue sponsor for staging the draw for this prestigious event, which took place on 26 April, and I would welcome the opportunity to become involved in profile raising events, in co-ordination with the RFL's strategy for promoting the World Cup.

 <i>[holding answer 4 May 1999]:</i> As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced on 12 January 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>131-32,</i> the BBC funding review panel will report to him by the end of July this year. There will then be a period of public consultation.

<a name="90505w08.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Maude: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will list for each of the years 1997-98 to 2001-02 all cross-departmental budgets, the spending accounted for by each and a breakdown of how that spending is allocated between the departmental totals in Table A1 of the 1998 Comprehensive Spending Review.  [68391]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90505w08.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 The table sets out the information requested. Cross-departmental budgets are defined for this purpose as those budgets expenditure from which is accounted for by more than one department.
<P>

<a name="90505w08.htm_para1">In addition, there are several other programmes which are subject to joint financial management and planning arrangements between two or more departments, but which are accounted for on one department's vote. The Single Regeneration Budget falls into this category, as do the Sure Start programme and the single asylum budget established in the Comprehensive Spending Review. The CSR also established joint strategic planning arrangements for the criminal justice system and on drugs, and similar arrangements are being developed for DETR and MAFF's countryside and rural development programmes.

 The Inland Revenue is currently working on the 1999-2000 drafts for the self assessment tax calculation and tax calculation guide to include all necessary changes including those coming from the Budget. These documents are, at this stage, in the process of change from the 1998-99 versions. Further work will be carried out during the course of this year including consultation with the representative bodies and usability testing with taxpayers. Final drafts should be available towards the end of 1999 once this process has been completed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90505w09.htm_spnew1"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 April 1999]:</i> The additional personal allowance is to be abolished as part of the package of reforms leading to the introduction of the children's tax credit. It is primarily claimed by people who are not married and living with their spouse and have one or more qualifying children resident with them, but in a minority of cases it is claimed by married people who have a totally incapacitated spouse and a qualifying child resident with them. Most people in this situation will benefit from the introduction of the children's tax credit, which will be worth more than twice as much as the additional personal allowance.

<a name="90505w09.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Efford: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to the letter of 16 July 1997 from the Minister for Trade and Competitiveness in Europe to the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins) regarding permanent health insurance schemes for employees, what steps he has taken to monitor the sound and prudent management of such schemes; and if he has found it necessary to take action under the Insurance Companies Act 1982.  [82169]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90505w09.htm_spnew2"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 None. In the first instance, the management of such schemes is a matter for the insurers themselves. However, most insurers have undertaken to abide by the Association of British Insurers Codes of Practice.
<P>

<a name="90505w09.htm_para0">The statutory regulation of insurance companies aims principally at ensuring that only properly authorised insurers carry on business in the United Kingdom; that there is sound and prudent management; and that there are systems of managerial and financial control sufficient to ensure that an authorised company is able to meet its liabilities to policyholders and potential policyholders. In the performance of the administrative and supervisory tasks contracted out to them by the Treasury, the Financial Services Authority will take account of the criteria of sound and prudent management set out in Schedule 2A of the 1982 Act when reaching a view on the management of an authorised insurance company.

[80877]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90505w09.htm_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The number of married couples in which the eldest spouse turns 65 after 5 April in both 2000-01 and 2001-02 is not known. It is therefore not possible to estimate the number who will pay income tax as a consequence of the loss of the Married Couples Allowance.

 <i>[holding answer 4 May 1999]:</i> Based on the DSS Lifetime Labour Market Database, there were 2.2 million people with Class 1 and/or Class 2 contributions paid on earnings less than 25 times the Lower Earnings Limit (&#163;58) in the 1995-96 tax year. The figures are based on those who have actually paid contributions at the full rate. They exclude women paying Reduced Rate Class 1 contributions and do not take any credited contributions into account. However, they do include students and others working for only part of the year.

 <i>[holding answer 4 May 1999]:</i> The Government intend that the Financial Services Authority (FSA) should have statutory objectives setting out what the Government expect it to deliver. It is for FSA to determine how to achieve those objectives, bearing in mind the circumstances of the different market sectors it covers.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how much the Government have spent implementing the recommendations of the Alcohol and Tobacco Fraud Review since its publication in January 1998; and what stage the consultation exercise which Her Majesty's Customs and Excise is currently undertaking with the trade has reached.  [83147]

<P>
<a name="90505w09.htm_spnew8"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 May 1999]:</i> The Alcohol and Tobacco Fraud Review (ATFR) was published in July 1998 as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review. The Government have allocated &#163;35 million to Customs and Excise over three financial years from 1999-2000 to implement the ATFR recommendations, of which &#163;15 million is for 1999-2000. In addition, the Government approved a claim on the Reserve for Customs during 1998-99 for &#163;9 million which has enabled Customs to make an early start on implementing the ATFR.
<P>

<a name="90505w09.htm_para1">The consultation exercise with the trade which seeks to establish the cost to industry of implementing those recommendations which involve procedural changes to tighten up on fraud is at an advanced stage. Subject to the outcome of that consultation, a final decision will be taken on how and when such measures are to be implemented during 1999.

 Having completed the pre-production trialing of the Euro notes due to be introduced in 2002, the European Central Bank has asked the Bank of England to assist with the next stage of technical preparations. This is to produce sample banknotes for each denomination to be used for reference purposes by those countries participating in production later this year. The bank will be involved in printing a further 1.5 million Euro 500 notes, which is equivalent to less than one day's normal production of Sterling notes. The cost of some &#163;60,000 will be paid out of the proceeds of the note issue.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on his Department's policy when <i>(a)</i> conducting legal proceedings and <i>(b)</i> seeking legal advice as to the circumstances in which Queen's Counsel should be instructed; and for each of the last three years (i) on how many occasions his Department instructed Queen's Counsel and (ii) what was the total cost of instructing Queen's Counsel.  [81758]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90505w10.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 The DTI's policy is similar to that of other departments. The Crown Prosecution Service, the Treasury Solicitor's Department, the Serious Fraud Office and the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers predominantly use junior counsel when it is necessary to instruct counsel to provide legal advice or to conduct legal proceedings.
<P>

<a name="90505w10.htm_para0">In civil cases, the two First Treasury Counsel are both junior counsel and they will advise and represent the Government without a Queen's Counsel in many of their important cases. In addition, the Attorney-General maintains four panels of junior Counsel whom Departments are expected to use for the majority of the Government's civil litigation. The approval of the Attorney-General or the Solicitor-General is required before a Queen's Counsel can be instructed to appear for any Government Department in civil litigation.
<P>

<a name="90505w10.htm_para1">A panel of Standing Counsel who are all junior counsel, exists in London and the South Eastern circuit to provide advice and to handle most work at the Central Criminal Court and Crown Court in that area. More generally, the 



<P>
<P><I>5 May 1999 : Column: 407</I><P>
Department maintains circuit based lists of junior counsel to conduct almost all its criminal casework in the Crown Court in England and Wales. Within and outside London, Queen's Counsel are instructed occasionally in very serious or complex casework prosecuted by the Crown.
<P>

<a name="90505w10.htm_para2">In determining the level of counsel to use, the Department will consider the individual circumstances of each case. It will take into account, inter alia, the importance and sensitivity of the case, the complexity of the law, the weight and complexity of the evidence, and the degree of experience and expertise required before deciding whether to instruct Queen's Counsel or junior counsel.
<P>

<a name="90505w10.htm_para3">The number of occasions on which the Department has instructed Queen's Counsel in the last three years, and the cost of doing so, is not collected centrally and could not be obtained without incurring disproportionate cost.

<a name="90505w10.htm_para4">Nevertheless, holiday companies, and others, in the United Kingdom offering or selling package holidays are covered by "The Package Travel, Package Holidays and Package Tours Regulations 1992".

 Agreement on the handling arrangements for claims from former British Coal miners suffering from lung related diseases, in both Wales and England was announced in the High Court in Cardiff on 26 March. A contract for the delivery of a national spirometry programme has now been awarded, which will enable miners to receive fair compensation. We aim to have thirty centres, the first of which opened in Newport during April, operating throughout the coalfield communities by the Summer. Results from these testing centres will enable offers of interim payments and some full and final payments to be made later this month whilst we tender for the medical services needed to deliver the medical assessment process. I am hopeful that significant numbers of full and final settlement offers for valid claims will start flowing early in the second half of this year.
<P>

<a name="90505w11.htm_para2">In the meantime, the Government have made payments totalling &#163;28 million to former coal miners and widows, &#163;6.83 million being made to claimants living in Wales.

<a name="90505w13.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Fatchett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 May 1999]:</i> The export of food and medicines has never been prohibited under sanctions. We are aware of claims that large numbers of children are dying every month. We have some concerns about the original sources of this information and the way the data have been interpreted. According to the most recent UN report on the implementation of "oil for food", the UN humanitarian programme is making a real difference to the humanitarian situation in Iraq. It made clear that in the north, where the UN is responsible for distribution, there were very few if any shortages of essential drugs, and malnutrition was decreasing. In the centre and south, however, the Iraqi Government refuse to engage constructively in the programme. They refuse to make efforts to prioritise properly what is purchased for the programme, to target it towards the most vulnerable, or to improve the poor distribution system.
<P>

<a name="90505w13.htm_para0">We are determined to do what we can to improve all aspects of the humanitarian situation. Together with the Netherlands, the UK has tabled a draft Security Council resolution which attempts to translate the work of the three UN Iraq panels into action. On the humanitarian side, our draft resolution brings together a whole range of measures including lifting the ceiling on Iraqi oil exports under "oil for food", streamlining Sanctions Committee approval procedures, allowing local procurement and the payment of local costs, and commissioning expert advice on how to increase Iraq's oil production. These measures should make significant improvements to the humanitarian situation in Iraq.

<P>
<a name="90505w14.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The National Blood Service is a vital part of the National Health Service and, as such, is expected to provide high quality, cost efficient services. Over the past year, following the report we commissioned from Professor Cash on the Liverpool Blood Centre, the NBS has been working to improve the quality of the services it provides to blood donors, clinicians and patients. But, to achieve lasting improvement, it also needs to modernise the management of the service, both nationally and locally and to develop a clear strategic direction within which all parts of the service can operate. We have therefore approved proposals, submitted by the National Blood Authority, to effect these changes and to ensure a first class future for the National Blood Service.
<P>

<a name="90505w14.htm_para0">The existing 3 zone structure into which the National Blood Service is currently organised will be replaced by a single integrated structure. This will improve the performance of the service by creating a greater sense of strategic direction, shared ownership of priorities with the wider NHS and clearer accountabilities. In addition, local services will be enhanced by the appointment of a Blood Centre Head who will lead local service delivery to hospitals and patients.

 Physical Education forms an integral part of the National Curriculum in Wales. Outdoor and adventurous activities form part of the programmes of study for Physical Education at Key Stages 2 to 4. There is compelling evidence that habits formed by young children at primary school age persist into later life and that fit and active children will be much better placed to enjoy a fulfilling and healthy adult life. Elements of "games", such as running, throwing and jumping, that are taught as a compulsory part of the primary school curriculum, help address concerns that some areas of Wales have the highest rates of heart disease in Britain. In other areas of the curriculum, schools use outdoor environments to support programmes of study as appropriate. Awdurdod Cymwysterau, Cwricwlwm ac Asesu Cymru/The Qualifications, Curriculum and Assessment Authority for Wales (ACCAC) will be consulting in the summer term on proposals for a new curriculum to be introduced from September 2000.
