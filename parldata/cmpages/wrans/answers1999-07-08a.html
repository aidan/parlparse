To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what is the status of her review of the state of terrorist ceasefires.  [87879]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Secretary of State keeps the ceasefires of all paramilitary organisations under continuous review. The judgment needs to be made in the round, taking into account all relevant information including the advice she receives regularly from her security advisers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Every effort has been made by both the British and Irish Governments to reach a satisfactory resolution to the Drumcree dispute. No such resolution has yet been reached, but our efforts continue. The decision taken by the Parades Commission to reroute the planned parade by Portadown LOL District is a legal one, and I am pleased to note that on Sunday 4 July the marchers complied with the conditions imposed by the Parades Commission.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w01.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Plaskitt: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what legislation he plans to introduce to implement his proposed reforms of the Post Office.  [90730]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 Much of the package of reforms for the Post Office that I have set out in the White Paper I have published today can be implemented without any change in the law. But I propose three pieces of legislation to complete the reform package:




<P>
<P><I>8 Jul 1999 : Column: 580</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90708w01.htm_para0">First, I am today laying an order under Section 69 of the British Telecommunications Act 1981 to reduce the Post Office monopoly to letters for which the post is not more than 50 pence (or which do not weigh more than 150 grams). The new limits will have effect from 1 April 2000. This will supersede the Order made in 1981 to fix the monopoly limit to items costing less than &#163;1 for a period of 25 years, ending in 2006.
<P>

<a name="90708w01.htm_para1">Secondly, I am today also making available the draft of a Regulation I propose to make shortly under section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 to implement the European Union Postal Services Directive on common rules for the development of the internal market of Community postal services. As the intention of the Directive is, inter alia, to provide a regulatory framework for postal services and the creation of a national regulatory authority, and to establish common rules for the provision of a universal postal service, the proposed Regulation will establish a new regulatory regime, designating the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and a new Postal Services Commission, that will assume its duties from 1 April 2000, as the national regulatory authorities for the postal sector in the United Kingdom, and to amend the Post Office Act 1969 so as to define in the legislation the minimum levels of service to be provided by the Post Office.
<P>

<a name="90708w01.htm_para2">Thirdly, as soon as Parliamentary time permits, I will bring forward primary legislation to consolidate the reform of the Post Office and the postal market. The Bill will
<P>

<a name="90708w01.htm_para3"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>ensure that the Post Office can take full and certain advantage of the commercial freedoms proposed in the package;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90708w01.htm_para4"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>convert the Post Office into a plc to underline the commercialisation of the business (though the legislation will not provide for any disposal of shares without further Parliamentary approval, and in particular no share sale will be possible without further primary legislation);
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90708w01.htm_para5"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>clarify and consolidate the independent regulatory and consumer representative framework, putting it on a basis similar to that for the private utilities; and
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w01.htm_wqn4"><B> Mrs. Gilroy: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when he will announce further decisions on power station proposals currently with his Department.  [90734]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 I have today given directions under Section 14 (3) of the Energy Act 1976 to Southern Electric and Sabre Power not to proceed with a number of their gas-fired schemes. The schemes affected are Southern Electric's mini power plants (49 MW) at Loudwater, Nr High Wycombe and Quidhampton, Salisbury and Sabre Power's mini power plants (50 MW) at Hirwan, Rhondda and Bridgwater, Somerset. These decisions have been taken in accordance with the policy set out in the White Paper entitled "Conclusions of the Review of Energy Sources for Power Generation and Government response to fourth and fifth Reports of the Trade and Industry Committee" (Cm 4071).




<P>
<P><I>8 Jul 1999 : Column: 581</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90708w01.htm_para7">Decisions on other proposals under consideration will be announced in due course.
<P>

<a name="90708w01.htm_para8">Copies of the Press Notice and the relevant decision letters are being placed in the Library of the House.

<a name="90708w01.htm_sbhd5"><H4><center>EU Takeovers Directive</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w01.htm_wqn5"><B> Mr. Gibb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will list the legislative changes required by the proposed EU Takeovers Directive.  [90092]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 It would not be possible to say, until the Directive had been finally adopted by the Council and the European Parliament, following its consideration for the second time by the European Parliament under the co-decision procedure, precisely what legislative changes would be required to Implement the Directive. However, it is likely that such legislation would formally designate the supervisory body which would be responsible in the UK for regulating takeovers (this could be a private body such as the Takeover Panel). In addition, some basic aspects of the regulatory framework set out in the Directive--such as the general principles which are presently included in Article 3--would no doubt have to be incorporated into legislation.

<a name="90708w01.htm_sbhd6"><H4><center>Genetic Engineering</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w01.htm_wqn6"><B> Mr. Etherington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will list the United Kingdom patents which have been <i>(a)</i> applied for and <i>(b)</i> granted since 18 May 1998 in respect of genetically engineered animals and processes for creating such animals.  [89932]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 I can only give information about patent applications which have been published. Prior to publication such information is confidential. There have been a total of three applications filed under the Patents Act 1977 and published since 18 May 1998 relating to genetically engineered animals and processes for preparing them. Patent No. GB 2331301 relates to a transgenic mammal for use as a model in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, Patent No. GB 2327679 relates to transgenic fish and Patent No. GB 2331751 relates to methods of cloning animal embryos. Only Patent No. GB 2327679 has so far been granted.
<P>

<a name="90708w01.htm_para9">Three other patents have been granted since 18 May 1998. They are Patent No. GB 2312899 for transgenic mammals useful as models for the treatment of bone disorders, GB 2291646 which relates to transgenic fish transformed with growth hormone and GB 228807 which relates to mammals transformed with a gene encoding a neurotoxin.
<P>

<a name="90708w01.htm_para10">This information covers only applications filed at the UK Patent Office and does not include applications filed at the European Patent Office and which may have the legal effect of UK patents when granted by that Office.

<a name="90708w01.htm_sbhd7"><H4><center>EU Artists' Resale Right Directive</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w01.htm_wqn7"><B> Mr. Gibb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on his policy regarding the EU Artists' Resale Right Directive.  [90089]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w01.htm_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Government are concerned that the current proposal would drive sales out of the EU and hit our art market far harder than others, while bringing little 



<P>
<P><I>8 Jul 1999 : Column: 582</I><P>
or no benefit to the majority of artists. We therefore welcome the postponement of a decision on the draft Directive by the 21 June Internal Market Council to allow more time for discussions to continue and see if a way forward can be found to overcome the very substantial difficulties the UK and others still see with it.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w01.htm_wqn8"><B> Mr. Gibb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what meetings he has had with members of the National Market Traders Federation to discuss whether to seek an extension to the derogation permitting loose from bulk produce to be sold in imperial only measures.  [90096]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w01.htm_spnew8"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 July 1999]:</i> I have had no specific meetings with the National Market Traders Federation to discuss metrication but I met representatives of the Federation at a reception in the House of Commons on 10 May 1999. The Federation had previously submitted written representations to me concerning the derogation.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w01.htm_wqn9"><B> Mr. Gibb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment his Department has made of the likelihood of the United States adopting metric measurements as the authorised units for pre-packaged food by 31 December 2009.  [90101]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w01.htm_spnew9"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 July 1999]:</i> As part of the US metrication programme, pre-packaged goods (foods and non-foods) marketed in the USA are already required to be marked with an indication of quantity in metric and US customary units. The European Commission is in discussion with the US Government about permitting indications of quantity to be given only in metric units by 2009.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w01.htm_wqn10"><B> Mr. Gibb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what estimate he has made of the cost to <i>(a)</i> market traders, <i>(b)</i> delicatessens and <i>(c)</i> other retailers arising from the expiry of the derogation permitting loose from bulk produce to be sold using imperial measures only.  [90103]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w01.htm_spnew10"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 July 1999]:</i> The DTI published a compliance cost assessment when the legislation to phase in the gram and the kilogram was made in 1994. The assessment identified the conversion or replacement of weighing machines as the main cost for traders. At today's prices, according to the United Kingdom Weighing Federation, the average cost of a conversion is about &#163;100 and the cost of a new weighing machine starts at about &#163;450. According to the Federation, 80 per cent. of machines should be capable of conversion. The cost of a set of metric weights is about &#163;50.
<P>

<a name="90708w01.htm_para11">If, as the Government expect, the European Commission's proposal to permit dual indications in metric and non-metric units until 31 December 2009 is adopted, weighing machines that show metric and imperial units will not have to be converted or replaced if the imperial units are not larger than the metric ones.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w01.htm_wqn11"><B> Mr. Gibb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what representations he made to the European Commission calling for it to extend the derogation permitting loose from bulk produce to be sold using imperial measures only; and what reasons underlie his policy on making such representations.

<P>
<a name="90708w01.htm_spnew12"><B> Dr. Howells </B>

<P>
<a name="90708w01.htm_spnew13"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 July 1999]:</i> The DTI is putting together a programme of measures to inform and advise small traders and their customers about using the gram and kilogram for goods sold loose. The projected cost of the programme is &#163;400,000.

 Two reviews of Insolvency Law and Practice were announced in the Competitiveness White Paper. The first was an internal review of insolvency (and particularly bankruptcy) law and the extent to which it contributed to the stigma of failure and inhibited enterprise. Officials reported to Ministers on 30 April 1999, and work to further develop the ideas generated is underway. The second review is a joint DTI/HM Treasury Review of Company Rescue Mechanisms, the Terms of Reference of which were announced on 2 February 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>580</i>. That review will now report by the end of 1999.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what action he is taking to prevent disqualified company directors becoming involved with new companies.  [90094]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w02.htm_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Action is taken by a combination of active monitoring of the appointment of new directors by Companies House and of the enforcement of disqualification law by the Insolvency Service.
<P>

<a name="90708w02.htm_para0">Companies House records details of all disqualified directors in a public register and since 1995 has been taking continuous steps to improve the accuracy of, and access to, the register. It has also been carrying out checks to ensure that disqualified directors resign their directorships in active companies. It also routinely checks that new directors of companies notified to it are not already disqualified.
<P>

<a name="90708w02.htm_para1">In addition, the Insolvency Service--through Official Receivers and insolvency practitioners--reports contraventions of disqualification orders for prosecution; liaises with central and local government departments and agencies which may identify breaches in the course of their own contacts with businesses; and has set up a telephone hotline for the public and business to report disqualified directors who continue to act while banned.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w02.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what estimate he has made of <i>(a)</i> the cost of the climate change levy to his Department and <i>(b)</i> the savings from the reduction in national insurance contributions that will occur when it is introduced.  [88862]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w02.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The net impact of the climate change levy and the associated reduction in main rate of employers' National Insurance Contributions on the Ministry of Defence will depend on the rates of climate change levy. The final rates of climate change levy will not be set until Finance Bill 2000.
<P>

<a name="90708w02.htm_para2">In addition, the Government are still considering a number of detailed issues on the tax treatment of different energy products which could have a significant impact in some instances. It is, therefore, not possible to give definitive figures about the impact of the climate change levy on the Ministry of Defence.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1) what assessment he has made of the economic impact of the climate change levy on those chemical industries which are based on the electrolysis process; and if he will make a statement;  [88198]
<P>
<UL>(2) what estimate he has made of <i>(a)</i> the number of extra jobs which will be created as a result of the reduction in employers' National Insurance Contributions 



<P>
</UL><P><I>8 Jul 1999 : Column: 585</I><P>
<UL>and <i>(b)</i> the extent of job losses in manufacturing industry following the introduction of the climate change levy; and if he will make a statement.  [88406]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w02.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="90708w02.htm_para3">The climate change levy is estimated to save around 1.5 million tonnes of carbon a year by 2010, thereby making a very significant contribution to meeting the Government's legally-binding target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions set under the Kyoto Protocol, and its domestic coal of a 20 per cent. cut in carbon dioxide emissions by 2010.
<P>

<a name="90708w02.htm_para4">The climate change levy will entail no increase in the overall burden of tax on business as the revenue will be fully recycled via a 0.5 percentage point cut in employer National Insurance Contributions. Business will also benefit from an additional &#163;50 million for schemes aimed at promoting energy efficiency and support for renewable sources of energy, like solar and wind power.
<P>

<a name="90708w02.htm_para5">Following Lord Marshall's recommendations, and the Government's Statement of Intent on Environmental Taxation, the Government recognises the need for special consideration to be given to energy intensive industries given their energy usage and exposure to international competition. Consequently, significantly lower rates of tax will be set for those energy intensive sectors that agree targets for improving their energy efficiency. A number of sectors including the aluminium, iron and steel, and chemicals sectors are currently involved in those negotiations. The net impact of the climate change levy and the associated reduction in National Insurance Contributions on individual sectors will depend on the rates at which the levy is set. The final rates of the levy will not be set until Finance Bill 2000.
<P>

<a name="90708w02.htm_para6">The Government is keen to work with business on the detailed design and administration issues relating to the levy. HM Customs and Excise have just completed a further round of consultation on these issues and the Government is assessing these responses alongside other representations in deciding how to design the levy to maximise the environmental benefits while safeguarding competitiveness.
<P>

<a name="90708w02.htm_para7">As the Government's climate change consultation document makes clear, all sectors of the economy will need to play their part in tackling the problem of climate change. It is not the Government's intention to introduce new taxes on domestic fuel and power, for social policy reasons. However, there are a number of measures in place to encourage energy efficiency in households, including the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme. These measures are set out in the climate change consultation document and will form part of the climate change strategy to be published later this year.
<P>

<a name="90708w02.htm_para8">The UK is not alone in having to meet targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, or in using economic instruments to do so. Since 1990, seven EU countries have introduced explicit taxes on the carbon or energy content of fuels, including most recently, the 'Eco-Tax' introduced by the German Government. On current projections, most OECD countries will have to introduce new measures of one form or another to meet their Kyoto obligations.

 The Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service, RMAS, Naval Armament Vessels are employed primarily for freighting armament stores and other dry cargo.
<P>

 Outside London, local authorities may provide concessionary travel for people who are mentally handicapped, but not for people who are mentally ill (except for those who would be refused a driving licence on medical grounds). Local authorities also have the power to provide concessionary travel for people with a number of specified physical disabilities (including those who are blind) as well as those people with a disability or injury which seriously impairs their ability to walk. In all these instances, the decision on whether to allow concessionary travel for any or all of these groups of people is a matter for the local authority.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w03.htm_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Highway Code (Rule 218) makes it clear that motorists should not park on the footway or pavement as it can seriously inconvenience pedestrians, people in wheelchairs, the visually impaired and people with prams and pushchairs. Enforcement is a matter for the police under the law relating to obstruction.
<P>

<a name="90708w03.htm_para1">Motorists should also be aware that where there are yellow line or clearway restrictions in operation, it is an offence to park on the adjacent pavement or verge.
<P>

<a name="90708w03.htm_para2">Pavement parking is a specific offence in London, unless there is a positively signed exemption. Local authorities in London are generally responsible for enforcement of pavement parking under the Road Traffic Act 1991.
<P>

<a name="90708w03.htm_para3">Elsewhere, local authorities can also make pavement parking a specific offence in individual streets or over a wider area by the making of traffic regulation orders and placing the appropriate signs. We are encouraging local authorities outside London to apply for decriminalised parking enforcement powers under the 1991 Act as this offers scope for them to target enforcement where it is most needed--such as pavement parking.
<P>

 As I explained in my answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty) on 9 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>167</i>, we are expecting to receive a number of exemption applications from train operating companies whose designs for new rail vehicles were well advanced prior to the 1998 Regulations coming into force.
<P>

<a name="90708w05.htm_para0">We have received applications from both Central Trains Ltd. for their Class 170/5 rail vehicles and Anglia Railways Train Services Ltd. for their Class 170/2 rail vehicles. The exemptions have been assessed by our statutory advisers, the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee. They are mostly of a minor nature and have been requested for a relatively short time only.
<P>

<a name="90708w05.htm_para1">The exemptions will not prevent disabled people from using the new trains. Indeed we believe that their introduction will make a significant contribution to improving mobility opportunities for disabled people. Exemption Orders have been laid in Parliament today.

<P>
<a name="90708w05.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Burgon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he expects to announce new designations under the European Commission's Shellfish Waters Directive.  [90923]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w05.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 A list of 93 areas in England to be designated under the Shellfish Waters Directive has been placed in the House. New designations will be made in 76 locations and the existing 17 designations will be included within revised boundaries for those areas.
<P>

<a name="90708w05.htm_para2">These new designations take account of views expressed in a wide ranging public consultation exercise. I believe that they will more than meet the expectations 



<P>
<P><I>8 Jul 1999 : Column: 594</I><P>
of the shellfish industry. This extensive package of new designations will improve our environmental credentials in Europe. It represents very good news for the shellfish industry, the quality of whose harvests will be improved. But, more importantly from a water quality viewpoint, it should be good news for environmentalists, who should see yet further improvements in water quality around our coasts and in estuaries. Pollution control measures for designated waters will help improve nearby bathing waters.
<P>

<a name="90708w05.htm_para3">I believe that all shellfish waters currently in need of protection are now covered by the pollution prevention measures which apply following designation. But I will keep the situation under review so that other shellfish areas can be protected where necessary.
<P>

<a name="90708w05.htm_para4">For public health reasons, we need to minimise the levels of bacteria in shellfish. The Government's aim is that bacteriological standards should be achieved in designated waters which allow harvesting areas to achieve at least category B standard under the system applied by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to classify shellfish harvesting areas for food safety purposes.
<P>

<a name="90708w05.htm_para5">We expect the total cost of improvements to continuous and intermittent discharges affecting shellfish waters in England to be around &#163;81 million between 2000 and 2005. Much of this expenditure is necessary to achieve other water quality and environmental objectives, including those for bathing waters. The current Periodic Review of water company price limits will include allowance for the necessary investment by water companies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w05.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Town and Country Planning (Trees) Regulations have been laid in both Houses today, and are due to come into force on 2 August. The Regulations will replace all existing secondary legislation in England and Wales on the subject of tree preservation orders.
<P>

<a name="90708w05.htm_para6">A consultation paper setting out our proposals for these Regulations was issued in July last year. A summary of responses to the consultation paper, 204 in all, has been placed in the House Library.
<P>

<a name="90708w05.htm_para7">A large majority of respondents broadly supported our proposals, so we have modelled the new Regulations closely on the provisions in the consultation paper.
<P>

<a name="90708w05.htm_para8">We have made some revisions, however, in response to detailed points made in consultation. Local authorities were concerned that our proposals on compensation would lead to an unwelcome increase in petty claims for minor loss or damage caused by protected trees, so we have taken steps to rule out such claims by setting a lower limit of &#163;500. In response to a general call for tree preservation orders to be circulated more widely, local authorities will be required to copy each new order to the people whose property adjoins the land on which the protected trees stand. In response to concerns that our proposal to exempt the pruning of fruit trees was open-ended, we have included new provisions making 



<P>
<P><I>8 Jul 1999 : Column: 595</I><P>
clear that such pruning must be carried out in accordance with good horticultural practice. Our proposals for speeding up appeals to the Secretary of State, which are made against a local authority's refusal of consent to do work on protected trees and handled without an inquiry or hearing, have also been revised to bring them into line with forthcoming reforms of planning appeals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w06.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 I have laid before Parliament Regulations to amend the Fire Precautions (Workplace) Regulations 1997 to the necessary extent to address the Commission's concerns about meeting the terms of the directive in full. The Regulations, as amended, apply throughout Great Britain. A regulatory impact assessment is attached to the Regulations showing that the estimated costs to employers attributable to these Regulations is expected to be between &#163;2.3 million and &#163;28.2 million. I am satisfied that the balance between cost and benefit is 



<P>
<P><I>8 Jul 1999 : Column: 598</I><P>
the right one in the circumstances. Copies of the Regulations and the regulatory impact assessment are in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90708w06.htm_para0">There are two main changes to the 1997 Regulations. First, the deletion of most of the exceptions from the application provisions of these Regulations (among them, one for fire certificated premises) to meet the Commission's concerns. Second, in the light of the views expressed in response to the public consultation exercise we conducted, we have also taken this opportunity, for reasons of consistency, to provide the Regulations with a criminal sanctions only regime that is in line with existing fire safety and health and safety legislation. The Regulations, in their amended form, come into force on 1 December 1999. This, we hope, will give everyone sufficient time to prepare for their introduction.
<P>

<a name="90708w06.htm_para1">We expect to publish fresh guidance for employers on 22 July to help them to meet their fire safety responsibilities in the workplace. To complete the picture, new guidance on the enforcement provisions and other requirements of the amended Regulations will be issued to fire authorities this autumn, after consultation of interested parties.

<a name="90708w06.htm_para3">However, I would regard a law enforcement agency for these purposes (and having regard to the serious crime provision in section 1(4) of the 1989 Act) as being a public body or government department whose functions include investigation of serious crime.

Information on the duration of criminal cases is available from the magistrates courts Time Intervals Survey which is carried out by the Lord Chancellor's Department. The latest available results refer to 1998 when the survey collected information on cases completed in magistrates courts in one week of each of February, June and October. The date of first appearance in court is not collected by the survey but the date of first listing--which is the same as first appearance when the defendant appears at first listing--is collected. The 1998 surveys do not specifically distinguish between adult and youth

 The available information is given in the table. This relates to people who have applied for asylum and is a separate measure from those who arrived in the United Kingdom under the recent humanitarian and medical evacuation programme. Under those programmes, 4,380 Kosovars have arrived in the United Kingdom. A number of these may subsequently apply for asylum and thus be included in the tables. In addition, 2,736 arrived under earlier programmes announced from 1992 and 1995. I regret that, prior to 1996, statistics for the former Yugoslavia were not recorded under the individual states. It is also not possible separately to identify Kosovars within the available statistics for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

 The details of the advice I receive from my officials are confidential, but I am advised that prosecution in these circumstances is not necessarily incompatible with the United Kingdom's obligations under Article 31.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w07.htm_spnew6"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 Police permission is not required for people to assemble and protest peacefully. Marches or processions must be notified to the police. Under the Public Order Act 1986, the police have powers to impose conditions if it is necessary to prevent serious public disorder, serious damage to property, or serious disruption to the life of the community or intimidation. The Commissioners of Police, in both the City and Metropolitan police areas may, with the consent of the Secretary of State, make an order prohibiting the holding of processions for a specified period within their police areas.
<P>

<a name="90708w07.htm_para2">In most cases, organisers contact the police who will advise on how the protest should be held without causing obstruction, breach of the peace or contravening any other legislation. Inevitably, there are cases where the numbers attending a demonstration will cause some obstruction and arrangements are made which endeavour to strike the correct balance between the rights of the protesters and those people going about their day to day business.
<P>

<a name="90708w07.htm_para3">The policing of demonstrations in the neighbourhood of the Palace of Westminster is undertaken by the Charing Cross Division of the Metropolitan police with due regard to various legislation including the Public Order Act 1986, the Highways Act 1835, Common Law and the Sessional Orders.
<P>

<a name="90708w07.htm_para4">Under Section 52 of the Metropolitan Police Act 1839 and Sessional Orders, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police instructs all constables of the Metropolitan police to facilitate free passage to and from the Palace of Westminster on any day when Parliament is sitting. In carrying out this duty, no march will be authorised where there is any possibility of interference with Members travelling to or from the Houses of Parliament.

The focus for this pilot will be the fashion industry in London. The aim of the pilot is to improve services to business through joint working (eg combined visits and trader education) to help traders understand what they need to do to meet legislative requirements. The pilot will also be looking to identify ways of raising compliance and reducing fraud and creating a level playing field for business so that legitimate business can thrive.

 We are working with our G7 partners to shape expectations so that private-sector creditors know that they will be expected to bear the consequences of the risks they take. There are several ways in which this can be achieved. First, there needs to be a greater use of 



<P>
<P><I>8 Jul 1999 : Column: 606</I><P>
market-based tools to involve the private sector in forestalling and managing crises, for example through a broader use of collective action clauses in sovereign debt contracts. Second, efforts should be made to ensure there is better communication and co-operation between emerging market countries and their creditors. Third, the G7 countries have agreed that a broad framework for involving the private sector in crisis resolution should be drawn up, which sets out in advance principles, considerations and a broad range of tools.

 At last week's summit in Cologne, G7 leaders announced a six-point plan for strengthening the international financial system. This included measures to increase the effectiveness of the IMF and the other international financial institutions; proposals to promote transparency and best practice, with the IMF monitoring compliance with new codes and standards; a new framework for involving the private sector in crisis prevention and management; steps to strengthen financial regulation in industrialized countries, and macroeconomic policies and financial systems in emerging markets where the IMF will work with the World Bank in providing advice and assistance; and promoting social policies to protect the poor and most vulnerable to ensure that they are better protected from the burden of adjustment at times of crisis.
<P>

<a name="90708w08.htm_para3">Taken together these recommendations represent a significant strengthening of the international financial system which will help reduce the risk of financial crises and make it easier for the international financial community, especially the IMF, to manage future crises effectively.

 The climate change levy is estimated to save around 1.5 million tonnes of carbon a year by 2010, thereby making a very significant contribution to meeting the Government's legally-binding target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions set under the Kyoto Protocol, and its domestic goal of a 20 per cent. cut in carbon dioxide emissions by 2010.
<P>

<a name="90708w08.htm_para4">The climate change levy will entail no increase in the overall burden of tax on business as the revenue will be fully recycled via a 0.5 percentage point cut in employer National Insurance Contributions. Business will also benefit from an additional &#163;50m for schemes aimed at promoting energy efficiency and support for renewable sources of energy, like solar and wind power.
<P>

<a name="90708w08.htm_para5">Following Lord Marshall's recommendations, and the Government's Statement of Intent on Environmental Taxation, the Government recognise the need for special consideration to be given to energy intensive industries given their energy usage and exposure to international competition. Consequently, significantly lower rates of tax will be set for those energy intensive sectors that agree targets for improving their energy efficiency. A number of sectors including the aluminium, iron and steel, and chemicals sectors are currently involved in those negotiations. The net impact of the climate change levy and the associated reduction in National Insurance contributions on individual sectors will depend on the rates at which the levy is set. The final rates of the levy will not be set until Finance Bill 2000.
<P>

<a name="90708w08.htm_para6">The Government are keen to work with business on the detailed design and administration issues relating to the levy. HM Customs and Excise have just completed a further round of consultation on these issues and the Government are assessing these responses alongside other representations in deciding how to design the levy to maximise the environmental benefits whilst safeguarding competitiveness.

<a name="90708w08.htm_para7">As the Government's climate change consultation document makes clear, all sectors of the economy will need to play their part in tackling the problem of climate change. It is not the Government's intention to introduce new taxes on domestic fuel and power, for social policy reasons. However, there are a number of measures in place to encourage energy efficiency in households, including the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme. These measures are set out in the climate change consultation document and will form part of the climate change strategy to be published later this year.
<P>

<a name="90708w08.htm_para8">The UK is not alone in having to meet targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, or in using economic instruments to do so. Since 1990, seven EU countries have introduced explicit taxes on the carbon or energy content of fuels, including most recently, the 'Eco-Tax' introduced by the German government. On current projections, most OECD countries will have to introduce new measures of one form or another to meet their Kyoto obligations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what action he has taken to reduce hospital waiting lists; and if he will make a statement.  [89854]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w10.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jon Owen Jones: </B> 
 Since April 1997, the Government have invested &#163;58 million to help NHS Wales reduce waiting lists and cope with increased pressures from emergency medical admissions during the winter months. An additional &#163;19 million per year has been made available recurrently from 1999-2000.
<P>

<a name="90708w10.htm_para0">Between March 1997 and March 1999 in-patient and day case waiting list figures fell from 67,609 to 65,315, following a peak of 76,016 in August 1998.
<P>

<a name="90708w10.htm_para1">Since then, in-patient and day case waiting list figures have increased and stood at 67,732 at the end of May 1999.
<P>

<a name="90708w10.htm_para2">Bringing waiting lists down remains a priority for the Government.
<P>

<a name="90708w10.htm_para3">Following the transfer of functions on 1 July 1999, waiting lists are now a matter for the National Assembly for Wales to address.

<P>
<a name="90708w10.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Berry: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will state the <i>(a)</i> cost of and <i>(b)</i> numbers affected by amending the law to ensure entitlement to Incapacity Benefit is reliant on a requisite record of past National Insurance contributions in (i) one of the last three complete tax years, (ii) one of the last four complete tax years, (iii) one of the last five complete tax years, (iv) one of the last six complete tax years and (v) one of the last seven complete tax years.  [89714]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w10.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 Under current legislation entitlement to Incapacity Benefit depends on a minimum number of National Insurance contributions having been paid in only one tax year. The table shows the benefit savings and numbers affected in the first, third and tenth years of requiring the same amount of contributions to have been paid in one of the last three, four, five, six and seven years. Only about 30 per cent. of those affected would have a cash loss. In 70 per cent. of cases Income Support would fully compensate for loss of entitlement to Incapacity Benefit.

Of the claimants aged over 80, 31,000 have partners of pension age, of whom 30,000 are receiving some State pension. Information on the type of pension in payment to a partner cannot be included in the table, as the sampling methods used to obtain this information relate to individual pensioners, not benefit units.<P>

2. Estimates of the number of Income Support claimants aged over 80 years, and the number of partners, are rounded to the nearest thousand.<P>

3. Estimates of Income Support and State Pension caseloads are based on a 5 per cent. sample size, and are therefore subject to a degree of error.<P>

 We have commissioned a qualitative research study into the financial arrangements of couples on benefit, which should give us a better picture of the arrangements that couples make to manage their benefit income. The results of this study should be available later this year.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w11.htm_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Current rules provide for benefit paid in respect of a family to be paid to the main claimant. However, there are provisions to allow the payment of all or part of the benefit to be paid to a third party, including the claimant's partner, where this is in the interests of the family; for example in cases where the claimant has difficulties in budgeting or suffers from alcohol or drug abuse. We have included provisions in the current Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill to allow these splitting arrangements to apply to hardship payments of Jobseeker's Allowance, but we have no plans for any further extensions to these arrangements at present.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if the Lord Chancellor will open meetings of the Advisory Council on Public Records to the public; and how many representations the Lord Chancellor has received on this matter since May 1997.  [90058]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w12.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The Government's policy document "Quangos: opening the doors" stated that NDPBs, of which the Advisory Council on Public Records is one, should hold open meetings where practicable and appropriate. The Council is keen to conduct its business in as public a manner as possible. However, one of its main responsibilities is in respect of the 30-year rule. This involves the discussion of information which is invariably confidential and frequently has significant security and foreign relations implications. Notwithstanding this, the 



<P>
<P><I>8 Jul 1999 : Column: 622</I><P>
Council is prepared to consider any request for public access to its deliberations which would not interfere with the proper discharge of its functions.
<P>

<a name="90708w12.htm_para2">In accordance with this approach, the Council made arrangements for a particular part of its business to be televised last year. It would be prepared to make arrangements of a similar nature in future. The Council is anxious that the activities which it undertakes on behalf of the public are as widely publicised as possible.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will make a statement on the response of the Chairman of the Advisory Council on Public Records to June 1997 petition from the census historians seeking the right to inspect 50-year-old decennial censuses of population for England and Wales; and if he will list the hon. Members who have made representations to the Lord Chancellor on this matter.  [90059]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w12.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 A copy of the petition was sent to the chairman of the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Council on Public Records by a Mr. Denis McCready on 14 June 1997. Mr. McCready had been in lengthy correspondence with the Lord Chancellor, his Department, the Council and the Public Record Office, and the Lord Chancellor had instructed his private secretary to write to him to say that further letters would receive no reply. The secretary of the Council replied to Mr. McCready's letter on 17 June to say that the chairman had decided not to put the matter to the Council since the closure of the census had already received very full consideration over the years and that the Lord Chancellor's instructions about further correspondence applied to the Council. The Lord Chancellor has received no representations from hon. Members on this matter.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w12.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 We have now banned the use of lindane to treat seeds in England, Scotland and Wales. We have considered carefully the representations received as a result of our announcement of 18 June 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>233-34</i>, that we planned to implement in full the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Pesticides. We understand that the decision will cause real difficulties to some companies and farmers but we have not received any further evidence to suggest that the risk to operators from treating seed with lindane was significantly less than that assessed by the Committee. I have therefore acted, with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, Scottish Ministers and the Welsh Assembly to revoke the approvals for the use of lindane to treat seed as of July. Similar steps are being taken in Northern Ireland.




<P>
<P><I>8 Jul 1999 : Column: 623</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90708w12.htm_para4">The Committee has advised that the risk to farmers from using lindane-treated seed is acceptably low. Farmers may also adopt other strategies to combat pests including other cereal seed treatments or crop sprays.
<P>

<a name="90708w12.htm_para5">Consumers may be reassured that other approved uses of lindane, which continue for the present, do not constitute an unacceptable risk to consumers.

 We have published two leaflets on this issue today. The first, "Farm Biosecurity: Protecting Herd Health" covers general disease prevention and the second "TB in Cattle: Reducing the Risk" is aimed more specifically at reducing the threat of tuberculosis.
<P>

<a name="90708w12.htm_para6">This is an important area; through these leaflets we are aiming to raise farmers' awareness of the importance of good practice in reducing disease risk and the benefits it offers. These leaflets offer good advice that farmers throughout the country should follow.
<P>

<a name="90708w12.htm_para7">The leaflets will be given to cattle farmers by State Veterinary Service staff and Local Veterinary Inspectors during farm visits and are being made widely available through markets, the Farmers' Unions and local Agricultural Department offices.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w13.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Campbell-Savours: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what plans he has for consultation on the proposed level of fees for cattle passports.  [90839]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w13.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Cattle Tracing System (CTS) was launched by the Government in September 1998. The system is run by a new organisation, the British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS). The new system enables a full record to be kept of cattle and where they have been throughout their lives, helping the livestock industry to provide assurance to its customers.
<P>

<a name="90708w13.htm_para0">Since its launch and until 5 July 1999, 2,330,113 passports for cattle have been issued by BCMS, at an average rate of 11,650 per day. It is expected that between 2&#189; and 3 million cattle passports will be issued annually. At the current time, 90 per cent. of passports are issued within 3 working days of an application being received. In addition, since last September, 1,446,993 movements of cattle have been recorded on the new system: and 221,506 calls from farmers have been handled by the BCMS call centre since it opened in July 1998.
<P>

<a name="90708w13.htm_para1">The Government announced in February 1998 that they would pay for setting up the Cattle Tracing System (CTS) and for running it during its first full year of operation. This represented a benefit of some &#163;36 million to the livestock industry. The Government believe that as the main beneficiaries, the livestock industry should now take over the costs of running the CTS from 27 September 



<P>
<P><I>8 Jul 1999 : Column: 624</I><P>
1999. In a consultation document issued today, interested organisations are being consulted on the level of charges, what they cover and the methods of payment.
<P>

<a name="90708w13.htm_para2">We propose that the fee should be &#163;7 per cattle passport. This is in the lower half of the &#163;5 to &#163;10 range indicated in November 1997.
<P>

<a name="90708w13.htm_para3">This proposed fee does not include the cost of time spent checking the eartags and passports of animals handled by the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS). Instead it is proposed that the MHS should recover these costs directly from abattoirs. The cost to the abattoir sector is likely to be around &#163;2 million per annum.
<P>

<a name="90708w13.htm_para4">The Government propose not to charge for temporary passports, known also as calf passports. Calves are less valuable than older animals. The passport fee will be payable however if a temporary passport is submitted for conversion to a full cattle passport.
<P>

<a name="90708w13.htm_para5">A copy of the consultation package, including a draft Regulatory Impact Assessment, are being placed in the Library of the House. Comments are sought by 9 August. There will be separate consultations by the administrations in Scotland and Wales, but it is expected that the fee will be at the same rate in all three countries of Great Britain.

To ask the Prime Minister, pursuant to his Oral answer to the right hon.

[90801]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90708w13.htm_spmin3"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 We are committed to improving hours and working conditions of junior doctors, and are doing so. The number of junior doctors working more than 56 hours was 4,793, or fewer than one in six in September 1998, having fallen every six months since March 1997 when it stood at 6,485.
<P>

<a name="90708w13.htm_para15">The numbers are likely to have fallen further since then, given the continuing action to improve working hours. The regional task force chairmen--who are responsible for providing support and advice to the NHS on reducing junior doctors hours--have confirmed that, keeping to a consistent definition of hours worked, they would have expected the numbers of junior doctors working more than 56 hours to have fallen further since September 1998, continuing the trend after March 1997.
<P>

<a name="90708w13.htm_para16">However, in December 1998, with the support and agreement of the Junior Doctors Committee, we introduced new and tougher compliance criteria in order to safeguard the quality of rest periods for junior doctors. Although they would not in fact represent a change in actual hours worked, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made clear on 19 May 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1139, that any figures on this new basis could well be higher. As expected, around 8,500 posts were found not to be complying with this different and tougher measure, which for the first time included, for example, the number of rest hours while on call and at weekends, as well as actual hours worked. We are committed to reducing this number further.

 We certainly inherited a large backlog of repairs and improvements when we took office.

This represents a doubling of investment compared to the previous Government and will substantially reduce the backlog. LEAs are responsible for their own maintenance programmes. By developing Asset Management Plans, which we are supporting and encouraging they will be able to make a more accurate assessment of capital spending needs and priorities, in consultation with their schools and their local partners.

matters. The Department has not separately issued advice to schools or commissioned research on the impact of these masts.
<P>

<a name="90708w16.htm_para0">Since July 1997, the Department has received two letters from schools, 25 letters from members of the public and six letters from hon. Members about the possible health effects of radio transmitters on school premises. Of these 33 letters, 31 were received during the past two weeks. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has received a number of representations at his constituency office in Sheffield.
<P>

<a name="90708w16.htm_para1">We take very seriously the recent public concern about the siting of these masts on school premises and the possible health risks to children. Discussions are taking place urgently with the other Departments involved to see what further research and guidance or other action may be necessary.

 Each year we have increased substantially the resources available for the Schools Access Initiative, to invest in making mainstream schools more accessible to those with disabilities and sensory impairments. For the three years from April 1999 we will be allocating a total of &#163;100 million of new money. The &#163;20 million we have allocated this year will improve access for pupils in over 1,600 schools.

 Subject to Parliament enacting the Disability Rights Commission Bill, which had its Report and Third Reading in this House on 30 June 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 365-400, we expect the Commission to begin operations in April 2000. Initial planning for the establishment of the Commission has begun. However, much of the work cannot commence until after Royal Assent of the Bill and when the Chairman, Chief Executive and Commissioners have been appointed. It will be for them to decide the range of services available from its operational date.
