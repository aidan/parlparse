 On 20 October 2011, we published our proposals for the levels of support available for renewable electricity generation, including sustainable biomass electricity, under the renewables obligation (RO) for the period 2013 to 2017. Our proposals aim to support the most cost-effective biomass generation such as conversion from coal which we expect to be fuelled from imports. They represent a cautious approach to the growth of new dedicated biomass plant and take account of the availability of sustainable feedstocks and the demand in non-energy sectors.</p>

In this case, I understand that the Environment Agency have assessed the risks both in relation to fracking fluid and methane gas and, on present information, do not consider that these shale drilling operations pose a risk to the environment—including to water resources. If the drilling operations were to change the Environment Agency would reassess the risk, and any necessary monitoring and control measures would be put in place to protect the environment, including any drinking water sources.</p>

 On 31 October 2011, the Government published a consultation setting out proposed new tariffs for solar photovoltaics (PV) under the feed-in tariffs scheme. The consultation proposes that new tariffs will be implemented from 1 April 2012 but will apply to all new PV installations with an eligibility date on or after 12 December 2011. The eligibility date is the date on which a valid application is received by the feed-in tariff licensee, normally the applicant's electricity supplier.</p>

 Ministers are in general not responsible for determining whether exemptions should apply to information sought in requests made under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, although they may be consulted for their views by departmental officials. In the case of the exemption at section 36—prejudice to the effective conduct of public affairs—the Act requires the opinion of a Minister of the Crown that the section is engaged with respect to the information being requested. Without that opinion, the exemption cannot apply.</p>

 My Department has already taken a number of steps to support local action to bring empty homes back into use. Through the New Homes Bonus we have introduced a powerful new incentive scheme, for tackling empty homes. Under New Homes Bonus Government match the council tax for six years, using the national average in each band, for any empty homes that becomes a new home for somebody, with an additional amount being provided for those brought back into use as new affordable homes.

               <i>[holding answer 27 October 2011]:</i> The Department for Communities and Local Government ministerial team have had many discussions both internally and with external partners regarding social enterprises since May 2010. Given that a number of these discussions were informal, ad hoc and sometimes took place as part of other meetings it would be impossible to list all of them.</p>

               <a name="11110721000103"> However the Department believes that community-based social enterprises have a particularly important role in supporting citizens and communities to take power into their hands and build the big society, and are vital to help grow a sustainable and dynamic economy. The Department is currently undertaking a range of actions to help support the development and maintenance of these organisations.</p>

               <a name="11110721000104"> Through the Localism Bill we are giving communities the right to challenge to run local authority services, where they believe they could do this differently or better, and to ensure that community organisations have a fair chance to bid to take over community assets important to them. This presents a greater opportunity for communities to use the social enterprise model as a method to run assets and services on a sustainable basis.</p>

               <a name="11110721000105"> We have provided capital (grants and loans) to social enterprise-orientated organisations through the Communitybuilders Fund (which has been endowed to the Adventure Capital Fund) and other Departmental Funds. We also continue to support the Asset Transfer Unit which provides expert advice, guidance and support concerning the transfer of under-used land and buildings from the public sector to community social enterprises.</p>

The Department is also working closely with the sector to demonstrate the value of social enterprise to the new Local Economic Partnerships. The results of this work will be published shortly.</p>

 Over the period of the last 12 months, the Ministry does not hold a central record of the total number of persons undertaking unpaid work experience, work placements and internships. To establish this information will require an examination of locally held records and this will incur a disproportionate cost. However, the Ministry has engaged in the new Whitehall Internship programme pilot for 2011, which provided two unpaid interns for two weeks from 25 July 2011.</p>

Dangerous Dogs Act 1989, section 1(6)—Having custody of dog in breach of disqualification order.
<sup>(2)</sup> The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.
<sup>(3)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.

 The main difference between the November 2009 and August 2010 versions of the Principles of Competition is that the former version set out the general principles as to how mark-ups would be applied rather than the specific amounts that appear in the later version. For example, the November 2009 version provides a formula that would be used to calculate the allocation of indirect costs whereas the August 2010 version states a specific percentage of 6.5%. The August version was necessary both to provide this specific detail and to use the most up-to-date figures available prior to bidders completing their pricing submissions.</p>

For example, the provision of foreign language interpreters, British Sign Language interpreters, hearing loop systems and Braille signage. Visits to courts are also available to witnesses to enable them to familiarise themselves prior to court hearings. In accordance with legislation (Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999), intermediaries are also available to those assessed as requiring assistance in their communication. Court staff, judiciary, prison and probation officers receive equality and diversity training to adequately support those people with communication needs.</p>

 The Department's data on adoption show significant local variations in the number of adoptions from care and in the timeliness of adoptive placements. The new Children in Care and Adoption Performance Tables help local authorities to compare their performance with other authorities and identify where improvements are urgently needed. They do not include targets. I want to see more children in care adopted where this is in their best interests, and I want to speed up the system so that they are adopted at a younger age. However, the child's welfare must always be the paramount consideration for local authorities when considering the most appropriate route to permanence for a child who cannot live with his or her birth parents. In some cases, a special guardianship order or a residence order may be more appropriate than adoption, for example where an older child does not wish to sever their legal ties with their birth parents.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 31 October 2011]:</i> To get information on the number of full-time equivalent staff employed on consultancy contracts in the Department could be provided only at disproportionate cost. However, I can tell you that as a result of spending controls introduced into the Department in 2010, consultancy spend fell by 76% in the first six months of 2011/12 compared to the same period in 2010/11 and continues to fall.</p>

 The Department has commissioned research on the impact of the English Baccalaureate which suggests that schools and pupils are making sensible GCSE subject choices. The survey, carried out with nearly 700 schools, suggests that English Baccalaureate subjects are being opened up to many more pupils, reversing declines in entries to languages, history and geography. It also indicates that more than half of the pupils who were starting key stage 4 from September have chosen to follow a set of subjects which will not lead to the English Baccalaureate. We will continue to monitor the impact of the English Baccalaureate on other subjects, including through review of GCSE entries in 2012.</p>

 This Government are committed to tackling bullying of all forms, particularly prejudice-based bullying. We want to support schools to deal effectively with bullying, while also reducing bureaucratic burdens and the amount of guidance from central Government. One of the aims of the anti-bullying advice is to signpost schools to key specialist organisations who could provide further advice and support. In doing so, we cannot list every organisation. We have listed those that we believe will be useful for the greatest number of schools. Transphobic bullying is an issue which directly affects a relatively small number of schools, so we have not included any organisations which specialise in that issue. GIRES is, however, a member of the Anti-Bullying Alliance—an umbrella organisation listed in our guidance. If schools identify transgender-related bullying issues, the ABA can signpost them in turn to GIRES or another specialist transgender organisation.</p>

 Allowing, or disallowing, dogs into classrooms or, indeed, any parts of a school where pupils or staff with allergies may be present, is for schools to determine. The Department for Education does not have a specific policy on this. There could be good reasons to have dogs or other animals in school, for instance to support the teaching of biology, the study of life and living organisms. As I stated in my answer of 21 October 2011, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1174W, we would expect schools to take common sense steps to protect the health and safety of all in the school.

 The Government put valuations of the public service pension schemes on hold while the consultation on the discount rate used to calculate contribution rates was taking place. The outcome of the consultation was announced in Budget 2011, but valuations remain on hold. Valuations are dependent on assumptions about the value of future costs, design of benefits and other factors. Many of these are currently under review as part of the Government's proposed reforms of the public sector pension schemes. The Teachers' Pensions Regulations 2010 require the scheme's actuary to carry out a valuation of the scheme at intervals of no more than four years but the actuary cannot do so until the Department and HM Treasury have set out the funding methodology, which will not be determined until the future structure of the pension scheme is clear.</p>

 The Independent Public Service Pensions Commission, chaired by Lord Hutton, was invited by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, my right hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr Osborne), and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, my right hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander), to conduct a fundamental structural review of public service pension provision and to make recommendations on pension arrangements that are sustainable and affordable in the long term, fair to both the public service work force and the taxpayer and consistent with the fiscal challenges ahead, while protecting accrued rights.</p>

               <a name="11110727000227"> In making his recommendations on pension reform, Lord Hutton considered the reforms already made to the public service pension schemes—in 2007 in the case of the Teachers’ Pension Scheme—and while he acknowledged that savings had been achieved, he pointed out that the cost of public service pensions had increased by around a third because of longer life expectancy over the last 50 years. As a result, cash expenditure on paying pensions to public service pensioners had increased to £32 billion over the last decade. Against this background, Lord Hutton concluded that there is a clear case for further reform of public service pension schemes, including the Teachers’ Pension Scheme.</p>

 The majority of immigration detainees held for more than 12 months are foreign national offenders who are liable to be deported from the United Kingdom. There is no presumption to detain in such cases and our powers only allow us to detain for as long as there is a realistic prospect of removal within a reasonable timescale. Our policy does however take into account the imperative to protect the public from foreign nationals who have offended in the UK and are liable to deportation. For this reason, proximity of removal, risk of reoffending (based on National Offender Management Service assessments) and risk of absconding are all taken into account at the point at which the detention decision is made.</p>

We do however review detention every 28 days to assess whether it remains lawful and appropriate.</p>

 We have introduced a new model for supporting adult victims of human trafficking in England and Wales, which provides accommodation and support tailored to the needs of individual victims. In its capacity as prime contractor under this new model, the Salvation Army has contracted with various organisations to deliver a range of support to meet the diverse needs of victims. This provision includes safe houses across England and Wales. Local authorities have a statutory duty under the Children Act to safeguard and promote the welfare of any child in need. Each child in local authority care is allocated a social worker who assesses their needs and draws up a care plan which sets out how the authority intends to respond to the full range of the child's needs.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 3 November 2011]:</i> The Department participated in a recent cross-industry research project that assessed the costs and benefits of replacing the 750V DC third rail electrified system with a 25kV AC overhead system. A summary of the research results is available at:</p>

These include lower running costs, greater resilience to snow and ice, increased train performance and the capacity to run more services. However, the cost of such a conversion would be significant, at around £3-4 billion. Network Rail is now taking forward a more detailed assessment of the costs and benefits.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 13 October 2011]:</i> The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) has co-operated with Government Departments and the Trinity House Lighthouse Service in the conduct of trials to determine the effects of Global Positioning System (GPS) jamming. It was found that simple and widely available jammers can disrupt the very low strength GPS signals received in surface vessels. The loss or denial of GPS signals is normally shown to the mariner through an alarm on the equipment in use. Losing GPS position information means that the mariner must use the other means available to them to determine their position. These means vary by vessel location and the equipment carried.</p>

 Focusing specifically on the Jobcentre part of DWP operations delivering local services, we announced last week our plans to close 19 small Jobcentres in the vicinity of other Jobcentres that were offering a full range of services, this did not include any Jobcentres in Merseyside. The spending review 2010 announced that DWP would deliver 26% savings in real terms from its core budget over the four year period to 2015. Operational parts of DWP, including the Jobcentre network across the country and in Merseyside, will contribute to these savings by driving up efficiency in the way it works through more use of its online services and implementing ideas that help improve processes and productivity. Where this results in the need to reduce jobs we will do this through normal turnover where possible. There are no plans above this to reduce  <br/>

 From 31 October 2011, the time limits for returning the questionnaire (ESA50) were reduced from 42 days to 28 days overall. This is because the time scales were based on those for incapacity benefit, which included an additional 14 days for claimants to contact their GPs to make an appointment. This is not needed for employment and support allowance claims and the Government believes that it is therefore reasonable reduce the time scales for returning the form from 28 days to 21 days, and the time for reminders to seven days from 14, which makes an overall total of 28 days. We would not wish for this to impinge on a claimant's ability to provide further evidence to support their claim as they will still be required to complete the remaining Work Capability Assessment process, of which, the return of ESA50 is just the start.</p>

Decision Makers must consider the claimant's state of health, nature of disability and whether they were in Great Britain before deciding if the claimant has good cause for not completing the questionnaire on time.</p>

 An exact number of tier 1 and tier 2 subcontractors is inaccurate as soon as it is published. DWP does not hold exact numbers but stock takes at points in time. The most recent stock take of the position regarding tier 1 and tier 2 Work programme supply chains found comparatively few changes from those listed in the initial bids with the voluntary sector maintaining the highest share at around 46%.</p>

 We monitor religious freedoms in the middle east and north Africa closely. We are aware that the Algerian authorities have closed some places of worship which had not been registered under Ordinance 06-03, including those of Christian groups, since the regulations governing religion in Algeria came into effect in May 2007. I discussed the situation with a delegation of Algerian Christians when I met them on 26 October and they confirmed our understanding that Church representatives, Ministry of Religious Affairs and Ministry of Interior officials are taking part in working sessions to discuss the implementation of the laws.</p>

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) ceased hard copy library and information services on 31 March 2008 with the exception of a small legal library which remains for reference and research use by its legal advisers. The Department did not maintain a central record of the library’s expenditure and it would incur disproportionate cost to establish such historical data. It did not keep historical data about book issues. A new electronic library was introduced in 2010 to provide information services via the desktop throughout the global network, including access to electronic books.</p>

ECHO'S separate budget line is an important factor in enabling it to deliver effectively, giving it greater scope to provide long-term and predictable funding to at-risk areas as well as the ability to hold funds in reserve for response to unforeseen disasters and humanitarian crises.</p>

 The UK is a firm supporter of EU enlargement and we look forward to Croatia's accession to the EU. The treaty concerning Croatian accession, which will be adopted in accordance with Article 49 TEU is due to be signed by the EU member states and by Croatia in December 2011, and the current target date for accession is 1 July 2013. Article 49 TEU deals specifically with accession agreements, which set out the conditions of admission of the acceding state and adjustments to the treaties which that admission entails. Article 49 cannot be used to alter the balance of power or competences between existing member states and the EU. Accession treaties deal with the transfer of power and competence from the acceding state to the EU.</p>

One of these, Section 36 prejudice to the effective conduct of public affairs, can only apply if it is the reasonable opinion of a qualified person that the exemption applies. The Act states that in relation to information held by Government, the qualified person must be a Minister. A ministerial submission is produced by the lead business area and submitted to the Minister with responsibility for the topic that the FOI covers. In addition, any FOI received from an MP or their support staff, must receive a response from a Minister. Again, this is the Minister with responsibility for the topic that the FOI covers.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 21 October 2011]:</i>Traditionally, we mark the anniversary of the conclusion of a conflict rather than its beginning. So the main commemorations will be on the centenary of the end of the First World War in 1918. However, given the importance of the centenary of World War I, a number of anniversaries of key events from 2014 to 2018, including the beginning of the war, will be marked in an appropriate way. The Prime Minister has asked my hon. Friend the Member for South West Wiltshire (Dr Murrison) to act as his special representative and co-ordinator for World War I Commemorations. Dr Murrison will work with international partners to ensure that the UK plays a full and active role; and will co-ordinate the cross-Whitehall effort in respect of the commemorations.</p>

 HM Treasury pays members of senior civil service payband 1 a London allowance of £2,000 per annum. The total cost of the allowance in 2010-11 was £151,000. Staff below the senior civil service do not receive a London allowance. These payments reflect the need to compete with other London-based organisations to attract suitable senior staff.</p>

 The two year public sector pay freeze announced in the emergency Budget on 21 June 2010 applied to HM Treasury in 2010 and 2011. Under the terms of the freeze, those earning a full-time equivalent salary of less than £21,000 were to receive an annual salary increase of at least £250. This was the only basis for civil servants in HM Treasury to receive a pay rise other than promotion in the last two years. The number of staff affected and the average increase is shown in the following table.</p>

Over the last three fiscal events the Government have published detailed analysis of the distributional impacts of reforms for tax, tax credit and benefit changes, and has shown the cumulative impacts of these reforms on households. Charts A.2 and A.3 of Budget 2011 show the most recent analysis by income decile, and present estimates in cash terms and as a percentage of net income. This analysis shows that, when looking at the cumulative impact of reforms introduced by this Government, it is clear that the top decile contributes the most to the fiscal consolidation, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of net income.</p>

As households with more individuals require higher levels of household income and expenditure to achieve the same standard of living, an internationally standard process of adjustment called equalisation is used to ensure households are compared on an equal basis. Further details on this can be found in the Data Sources document accompanying Budget 2011. The following table sets out the lower bounds for equivalised income deciles used at Budget 2011.

 The Government keep all tax matters under review. The general principles are that the provision of free health care and the dispensing of medication by an NHS hospital are not treated as being a "business" activity for VAT purposes. Consequently, the NHS is unable to recover from HMRC the VAT it incurs on drugs. However, the funding that NHS bodies receive from the Department of Health takes account of this irrecoverable VAT.</p>

The guidance set out significantly increased expectations for the priority that institutions should give to fair access and widening participation. In particular we identified the effectiveness of collaborative working on widening participation, recognising that many institutions were already doing this and that access agreements should build on that work. We also highlighted that such collaboration also encourages the sharing of good practice. The director mirrored Governments' advice in his own guidance to the sector in March on how to develop access agreements.</p>

 The aim of the Government's proposals for higher education reform, including the proposal to decouple degree awarding powers from teaching, is to drive greater diversity and competition to improve the range and quality of provision available to students while safeguarding the strong international reputation of English universities. Any organisation, including non-teaching bodies, wishing to acquire taught degree awarding powers will, as now, have to meet specific criteria to determine if it is fit to exercise the powers being sought. We are currently reviewing the degree awarding powers criteria as part of those reforms but believe that broadly the same principles as set out in the current criteria can and should apply and that the key principles will be applicable to non-teaching bodies as well.</p>

All pilots have measures in place including bursaries and waivers to ensure that ability to pay is never a barrier to participation in the programme.</p>

 Detailed figures across all 2011 pilots are not currently available but the largest NCS provider, The Challenge Network, which delivered over 3,100 places in 2011, reports that 3% of its participants had been looked-after children, indicating that participation among young people from this background was significantly higher than their prevalence in the population as a whole. National Citizen Service is open to young people aged 15 to 16 in the summer after year 11.</p>

 We are committed to improving the oral health of school children but have decided against the reintroduction of school screening checks. In 2006, the National Screening Committee (NSC) advised that the routine dental screening of children in primary schools was ineffective in improving children's oral health. The NSC found that children, who were identified as requiring treatment, were not accessing a general dental practice where it could be provided.</p>

 All providers of regulated activities, including hospitals and care homes, are required by law to have policies in place that protect people from the risks of inadequate nutrition and dehydration. The Care Quality Commission assesses and monitors compliance with this requirement as part of the process of inspection and regulation.</p>

               <a name="1111081000460"> It is for health and social care providers to develop local nutrition and hydration policies. There are a number of best practice resources and guidelines available to help providers do this. These include the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence clinical guideline to help the national health service identify patients who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition, and the “Essence of Care” benchmarking system which includes “food and drink”.</p>

 The Government Actuary’s Department estimates that in 2008, the pension of an NHS Pension Scheme member with 30 years continuous service will retire with an average pension of approximately £15,000. This is based on currently contributing members rather than those in receipt of benefits.

It is estimated that this would require pension contributions of around 30 to 40% of pay, depending on what investment returns might be achieved.</p>

                     <i>Notes:</i>
1. Finished consultant episode (FCE): A finished consultant episode (FCE) is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.
2. Number of episodes in which the patient had a (named) primary or secondary diagnosis:
The number of episodes where this diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once, even if the diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record. The ICD-code used to identify obesity is E66.
3. PCT/SHA data quality: In July 2006, the NHS reorganised strategic health authorities (SHA) and primary care trusts (PCT) in England from 28 SHAs into 10, and from 303 PCTs into 152. As a result data from 2006-07 onwards is not directly comparable with previous years. Data has been presented for those SHA/PCTs which have valid data for the breakdown presented here. As a result some SHA/PCTs may be missing from the list provided.
4. Data quality: HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.

We will not be able to deliver on our ambition to deliver improved survival rates by focusing solely on the more common cancers and the strategy sets out our commitment to work with a number of rarer cancer-focused charities to assess what more can be done to encourage appropriate referrals to secondary care for earlier diagnosis. The other key factor likely to influence survival rates for pancreatic cancer is ensuring that all patients have access to the appropriate treatment.</p>

In addition, the PCRMP Scientific Reference Group are supporting further work on measuring the levels of PSA testing, which is building in questions around GP knowledge and education about the programme.

Where the CQC has concerns regarding a declaration, it will ask further questions to determine whether the provider is compliant with Regulation 13 of the CQC (Registration) Regulations 2009, which requires providers to ensure the "financial viability" of their enterprise, before deciding whether to register them.</p>

 The chief executive officer (CEO), Jamie Buchan, of Southern Cross Healthcare first wrote to me on 3 August to introduce himself and to request a meeting to discuss the United Kingdom care sector as a whole and Southern Cross's role within it. This letter did not warn that Southern Cross faced immediate financial difficulties; rather, the letter explained the pressure that a difficult settlement from the forthcoming comprehensive spending review (CSR) would place on Southern Cross's business model, and it explained the improvements that the company's board planned to make to its services. The same letter was received separately from the CEO's personal assistant on 30 July, and a departmental official responded, declining the request for a meeting, on 19 August.</p>

After careful consideration officials decided that significant work would have been needed to strengthen the design of KWAT's proposal for us to be able to fund it. Officials therefore decided the most effective way to reach the largest number of IDPs quickly would be to increase our existing support to those organisations that had ongoing programmes which could be scaled-up, rather than designing and approving new programmes as would have been necessary in order to support KWAT.</p>

 Under the waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) directive, the UK is working with EU member states to prevent the illegal export of electronic waste to developing countries. Under the WEEE directive, it is illegal to export hazardous e-waste from the UK for disposal in developing countries. The UK has a national intelligence team and a national environmental crime team. As part of their remit, these teams are required to prevent the illegal export of e-waste. They use an intelligence-led approach to target the most prolific, serious and organised illegal waste exporters. This has led to a 98% success rate of finding electrical waste when stopping targeted shipping containers.</p>

 I am fully supportive of the Charter to End Extreme Hunger’s aim to reduce the likelihood of crises such as that currently taking hold in the horn of Africa taking place in the future. In at-risk areas such as this, the Government have committed in their Humanitarian Policy to support strengthened warning systems and contingency plans and to build resilience to disasters. Already, in Ethiopia we are helping 7.8 million people to break their need for emergency food programmes by providing support before food insecurity reaches famine levels.</p>

 In south-central Somalia, DFID is supporting the efforts of the United Nations Childrens Fund, OXFAM and Action Against Hunger to provide clean water to 500,000 people and construct over 2,000 latrines. DFID and other donors are also supporting partner programmes to upgrade water and sanitation facilities in health centres, promote good hygiene and sanitation practice to prevent diarrhoea and cholera, and do clean up campaigns in high risk areas. With donor support, UNICEF has also engaged world experts from the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research Bangladesh to train staff and treat cholera cases in 17 hospitals.</p>

 Since July, the UK Government have allocated £57 million to support humanitarian aid in Somalia, the vast majority of it in Southern Somalia where people are most in need. To date UK aid has provided 247,000 people with food assistance, treated some 7,500 severely malnourished children, vaccinated 500,000 children against measles and supplied 400,000 doses of drugs to treat malaria. I have also pressed other countries to pay their share. The 2011 UN Consolidated Appeal for Somalia is nearly 80% funded—the best funded appeal globally, Nonetheless, huge needs remain unmet.</p>

               <a name="1111081000693"> The Department for International Development (DFID) humanitarian support is guided by core humanitarian principles, including impartiality. Aid is therefore prioritised to reach those in greatest need. In Somalia most of the people suffering from famine are in areas under the control of Al Shabaab. DFID works with trusted and experienced United Nations, Red Cross and international non-governmental humanitarian organisations who have managed to maintain some access to vulnerable people in Al Shabaab-held areas. DFID partners put in place robust systems to minimise the risks, and ensure aid reaches those most in need.</p>
