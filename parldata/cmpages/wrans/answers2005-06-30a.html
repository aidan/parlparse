<i>[holding answer 21 June 2005]:</i> If an animal reacts positively to the skin test it is generally considered to have bovine TB. However, it is not always possible to confirm infection in any particular animal by post-mortem examination at the slaughterhouse, or by culturing <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> in the laboratory. This is because in the early stages of the disease, it is not always possible to see lesions with the naked eye, and, due to the fastidious nature of the organism, it is not possible to culture from samples in every case.

<sup>(24)</sup>Data downloaded from State Veterinary Service database on 19 May 2005. All data provisional and subject to change as more data become available.<br>

<sup>(25)</sup>In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the foot and mouth Disease (FMD) outbreak. When testing resumed in 2002, resources were concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk herds tested immediately after the FMD outbreak was greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, data for 2001 and 2002 are not comparable with other years.<br>

However, in order to fulfil this undertaking the Department needs to agree a licence with Mr. Feakins and Mrs. Hawkins, as the owners and occupiers of the land, in order to gain access to the land. This licence will also include detailed method statements for the operations required.

The only recent objective national survey of rat presence is within the English House Condition Survey (EHCS). The 1996 survey revealed that 0.23 per cent. of properties had rats indoors and 1.6 per cent. had rats present outside. A report on the rodent element of the 2001 EHCS will be published this summer.

 The criteria that the sports councils use to decide whether an activity should be recognised as a sport are derived from their Royal Charters, and ultimately from the Physical Training and Recreation Act 1937.

 The way in which education and training are delivered in prisons, and the content of the learning offered, are changing. From August 2005, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) will in three regions (the North West, North East and South West) take responsibility for delivering an integrated learning and skills service for offenders both in custody and the community, linking it much more explicitly with mainstream provision for post-16 learners. A greater focus on skills will lead to greater employability on release, thereby making a significant contribution to reducing re-offending. The remaining six regions in England will follow in August 2006.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what the remit of the Everything but Arms agreement is; and what assessment has been made of its effectiveness.  [5621]</p>








<p><a name="st_258"><a name="50630w12.html_spnew8"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The Everything but Arms initiative (EBA) is the EU scheme to give all least developed countries duty and quota free access to the EU market for all products, except armaments. The scheme was introduced in February 2001. Three products, however, were deemed sensitive enough for the EU not to open its borders to them immediately. Full, unrestricted market access for these products&#151;sugar, rice and bananas&#151;is being phased in gradually and will be completed in 2009.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50630w12.html_para13">
<a name="stpa_196">There have been several assessments of the effects of the scheme, including by the World Bank who concluded that the impact of EBA has been relatively limited, partly because the vast majority (some 99 per cent.) of EU imports from the LDCs are in products that the EU had already liberalised, and the complete removal of barriers to the key remaining products, rice, sugar and bananas has been delayed. There is a group of the LDCs for whom EU trade preferences on existing exports are not significant since these exports are mainly of products where the normal rate of duty is already zero. Export diversification is the key issue for these countries. For other LDCs, EU preferences have the potential to provide a more substantial impact on trade.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50630w12.html_para14">
<a name="stpa_197">However, the World Bank assessment shows that only 50 per cent. of EU imports from those eligible LDCs, who are not from the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) grouping, actually request preferential access to the EU. The prime reason for this low level of utilisation would appear to be the rules of origin&#151;how or where a product can be produced in order to qualify for a preference. This is because in many cases, the criteria are set so that in practice an LDC must produce a product entirely within its borders, including any inputs or components, in order to qualify for preferential treatment. This requirement is beyond the

The World Bank, and indeed many others, recommends more simple and liberal rules of origin to enhance the impact of EU trade preferences both in terms of improving market access and in stimulating diversification towards a broader range of exports. We have already seen this effect in certain African exports to the US, and some Asian exports to Canada.

<a name="50630w13.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_199">The picture of girl&#039;s access to education is not uniform across Africa. As reported in the United Nations Millennium Development Goal Report (2005), Sub-Saharan Africa has made limited progress towards increasing girl&#039;s access to education. The most recently available figures from 2001 indicate that 86 girls per 100 boys are enrolled at primary school and 79 girls per hundred boys are enrolled in secondary school. The UN&#039;s 2004 chart shows that this region is not on track to meet the equal girls enrolment in primary and secondary school MDG targets by 2015 without dramatically scaled up efforts. However the picture is quite different in Northern Africa, with 93 and 96 girls per 100 boys enrolled in primary and secondary schools respectively and the region on track to meet both these MDG targets.

fees are a significant barrier to poor people&#039;s access to basic health services. In the poorest countries, there has been little success implementing fee exemptions and waivers targeted to poor people.

At Gleneagles we are calling for an extra $50billion a year in development assistance. DFID has regular policy discussions with the World Bank at both Headquarters and country level. This includes discussions on options for financing of health services&#151;the World Bank does not have a blanket policy on user fees.

<a name="stpa_210">The region appears to be on track to meet its 2015 targets for education, access to water and sanitation, and reducing hunger. In particular, rapid progress has been made towards reducing the prevalence of underweight children, universalising net enrolment in primary schools, reducing child and infant mortality, and increasing the proportion of the population with access to improved water sources. Insufficient progress has been made, however, on getting all children to actually complete primary school, halting the spread of HIV, and reversing the loss of environmental resources. Mixed progress has been made on income poverty and hunger reduction, the coverage of improved sanitation, and the various indicators of gender equity. While the proportion of the region&#039;s population living in slums has fallen slightly, absolute numbers have actually increased.

<p><a name="st_269"><a name="50630w15.html_spnew0"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Progress towards the Millennium Development Goals varies. The world is on track to meet the poverty reduction goal. The number of people in Asia living on less than $1 a day dropped by nearly a quarter of a billion between 1990 and 2001. However progress toward the other seven goals is more varied. Sub Saharan Africa in particular will not meet any of the goals by 2015 if current rates of progress continue. The Commission for Africa chaired by the Prime Minister has set out plans for faster progress including action by African governments, and stronger support by international partners. The UK has made Africa central to our presidency of the G8 this year. We are looking for the Gleneagles G8 summit next week, and the Millennium Review Summit in September, to further strengthen international support to Africa through aid, debt relief and trade.

<p><a name="st_282"><a name="50630w16.html_spnew5"><b> John Reid  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 28 June 2005]:</i> The legal basis for the operation of the No Fly Zones over Iraq was the need to avert an immediate and overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe threatened by the then Iraqi Government against the people living on the ground in those zones. This was combined with a need to monitor the effect of UNSCR 688 which demanded that Saddam Hussein cease the repression of his people. RAF aircraft attacked only targets which were an actual or imminent threat to coalition aircraft or were contributing to such a threat, namely air defence related assets. Thus, all the ordnance released was in response to an actual or imminent attack on coalition forces.

 On 7 and 10 June 2005, during the preliminary commissioning of the Primary Circuit Decontamination (PCD) facility, which will be used during the Long Overhaul Period (Refuel) of HMS Victorious at Devonport, two small leakages of water occurred. Some parts of the equipment had previously been used in the overhaul of another nuclear-powered submarine and, as a result, the water contained very low

<a name="stpa_223">Nuclear safety remains of paramount importance and while these incidents were minor and did not present any hazard to the workforce or to the public, they could have been avoided. For this reason, the Environment Agency served an Enforcement Notice on the nuclear site licensee, Devonport Royal Dockyard Ltd. (who trade as Devonport Management Ltd.), which required the company to review and, where appropriate, improve the arrangements for controlling the release of radioactive waste to the environment. Accordingly, DRDL suspended PCD commissioning activities. These recommenced on 23 June 2005 once the recommendations from the review had been implemented. The PCD equipment is not due to be connected to HMS Victorious for some weeks and there should therefore be no long term impact on her programme.

<i>[holding answer 23 June 2005]:</i> The Government target additional resource to authorities where there are higher numbers of pupils living in deprived circumstances because these pupils are more likely to have additional educational needs, and they will require higher levels of funding if they are to have equality of opportunity. At national level, the formula for distributing funding for schools to local authorities comprises a basic entitlement for each pupil of the same age, which is the same across the country, plus top-ups reflecting the relative needs of each area, including a top-up for each pupil with additional educational needs. (The other top-ups are for higher area costs in some areas and sparsity in others). In addition, some specific grants such as Excellence in Cities have been directed towards deprived areas.

<a name="50630w18.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_6">The funding that individual schools receive in their budget shares is a matter for local authorities through their local funding formulae.

Work on the joint HM Treasury/Department for Education and Skills review of the ways in which local education authorities fund schools for the effects of social deprivation started in the autumn of 2004. The collection of evidence from stakeholders and drafting of the report is largely complete and the review will be published when conclusions have been finalised. As stated in the Child Poverty Review document published in July 2004, those conclusions will need to recognise the priority of maintaining stability and predictability in school funding, while ensuring that funds are accurately targeted according to need.

<sup>(1)</sup>The combined LEA and school based expenditure includes all expenditure on the education of children in LEA maintained establishments and pupils educated by the LEA other than in maintained establishments. This includes both school based expenditure and all elements of central LEA expenditure except youth and community and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA). Figures for 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99 are drawn from the Revenue Outturn (RO1) spending returns which local authorities submitted to the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions. Figures for 2002&#150;03 onwards are drawn from the Section 52 Outturn Statement (Table A) submitted to the DfES.<br>

<sup>(2)</sup>Pupil figures include all pre-primary pupils, including those under-fives funded by the LEA and being educated in private settings, pupils educated in maintained mainstream schools and other LEA maintained pupils. The pupil data for pupils attending maintained nursery, primary, secondary and special schools are taken from the DfES Annual Schools Census. Private voluntary and independent (PVI) under-five pupil numbers are taken from the Early Years census but are only available since 1999&#150;2000. Other LEA maintained pupils includes all pupils attending schools not maintained by the authority for whom the authority is paying full tuition fees, or educated otherwise than in schools and pupil referral units under arrangements made by the authority drawn from the Form 8b submitted to the DfES. Also included as other LEA maintained pupils are all pupils attending pupil referral units who are not registered at a maintained mainstream school drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census. All pupil numbers are adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

<sup>(3)</sup>The AEN Index used in the allocation of Education Formula Spending Shares to LEAs in 2004&#150;05 is used to identify the top and bottom 10 per cent. most deprived local authorities in 2003 and these LEAs have been compared over the years listed in the above table. The Index is calculated using the percentage of children in families in receipt of income support, job seekers allowance and working families tax credit, the percentage of primary pupils with mother tongue other than English and of secondary pupils from low achieving ethnic groups. However, due to local government reorganisation on 1 April 1998, five LEAs included in the 10 per cent. least deprived LEAs and did not exist in 1997&#150;98 and have therefore been excluded for this year.<br>

<sup>(4)</sup>The percentage difference is defined as the difference between spending per pupil in the 10 per cent. most deprived LEAs and 10 per cent. least deprived LEAs as a percentage of spending per pupil in the 10 per cent. least deprived LEAs (i.e. (column (b)&#151;column (a))/(column (a)).<br>

<sup>(5)</sup>Spending in 1997&#150;98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998&#150;99.<br>

<sup>(6)</sup>Expenditure data for 2004&#150;05 are not due to be collected by the Department until October 2005.<br>

 The school funding formula distributes resources to authorities on the basis of where pupils are counted on the school roll.

Nevertheless, Worcestershire retains some residual responsibility for pupils who reside in their area&#151;e.g in relation to SEN statementing&#151;and therefore Worcestershire&#039;s LEA formula spending share (LEAFSS) includes an element of funding which is based on pupils&#039; residence.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills for what reasons maintained secondary schools are not permitted to enter pupils for the international mathematics GCSE examination.  [7999]</p>








<p><a name="st_14"><a name="50630w19.html_spnew9"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 For qualifications to be taught in the maintained sector they must be accredited by the QCA and approved for use under section 96 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000. The international GCSEs were designed primarily as qualifications for overseas candidates, and have not been put forward for accreditation. IGCSE in Mathematics therefore is not approved for use by pupils in maintained schools and is unlikely to be, since it is not currently aligned to the national curriculum programmes of study.

<a name="stpa_24">Revenue expenditure figures on the maintenance and improvement of schools are likely to vary from year to year depending on the unique circumstances of a particular LEA. For example, revenue expenditure will increase in years where there have been adverse weather conditions (e.g. repairing storm damage) and is also likely to vary with the number and age of the school buildings within the LEA. Revenue expenditure will also be affected by the amounts of capital allocated to each school.

<sup>(8)</sup>Figures for 1998&#150;99 to 2001&#150;02 cover the repair and maintenance of buildings, fixed plant and grounds which includes all expenditure on non-capital building works, including repairs and maintenance of buildings, and non-capital expenditure on fixed plant and grounds. Figures for 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 are the combination of the revenue expenditure on building (including fixed plant) maintenance and improvement and grounds maintenance and improvement categories (CFR categories E12+E13). Any capital expenditure on school buildings is not included in this table.<br>

<sup>(9)</sup>Figures are provided for the six years to 2003&#150;04, the latest year for which data are available. Data for 1997&#150;98 and earlier are not available for comparable areas due to local government re-organisation. Figures for 2002&#150;03 onwards will not be directly comparable with figures for earlier years as figures for 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 are not available and have therefore been excluded for these two years. Also, for some LEAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the schools sectors was reported within the LEA part of the Section 52 form in 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 and would therefore be excluded from the totals for<br>

 The new Teaching and Learning Responsibility payments for teachers, which replace current management allowances from 1 January 2006, will make a positive contribution to improving the performance of our schools by focusing payments to teachers for additional responsibilities on matters related to the teaching and learning of pupils, rather than those management functions which do not require a qualified teacher.

 In September 2004, the Secretary of State announced that work would begin to look at the options for implementing a system of post-qualification application to higher education. Officials have been taking this work forward, consulting widely with interested parties and engaging with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Government, of course,

potential for higher education (HE) study, or recognising ability which may not be reflected fully in Level 3 examination results, is a key issue for fair admissions. The steering group&#039;s report in September 2004 suggested that a test that is able to predict performance in HE may help to uncover hidden talent. It also acknowledged the potential burden for applicants of up to six sets of admissions requirements and means of assessment. The report therefore recommended a national research study to assess the idea of a national test of potential. We support this as an early task for a new centre of expertise on admissions which the steering group also recommended. The HE sector is discussing the formation of that centre. Whilst we do not believe in tests for tests sake, if there is a genuine need for a national test it would be right to explore the opportunity.

James Wolfensohn set out his plans for assisting disengagement, including to help both parties implement the actions required of them, to encourage them to co-ordinate fully with each other and for the international community to support Palestinian economic and institutional development. G8 Foreign Ministers offered support and appreciation for his work.

 Education and Library Boards&#039; psychology services and behaviour support services offer advice to schools in relation to the management of pupils with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The type of support offered is dependent on the needs of the school or child but can range from advice on writing an individual behaviour plan to placement in a primary or post-primary guidance centre. Most pupils with ADHD have such extremely challenging behaviour that boards maintain statements of special educational need for them and provide funding for additional support to assist the school to meet the pupil&#039;s needs.
