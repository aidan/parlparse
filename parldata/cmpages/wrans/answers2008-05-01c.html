 The Government have introduced a number of measures since 1997 to help older people out of poverty. These include the introduction of the minimum income guarantee and its successor pension credit.

For 2008 we raised the standard minimum guarantee to &#163;124.05&#151;an increase of 4.2 per cent.&#151;more than keeping pace with earnings and prices.

This is also covered in the Defence Technology Strategy. A copy of both strategies is available in the Library of the House.</p>

 The Emerging Technologies Group (ETG) is responsible for keeping the core receiver requirements for the digital switchover help scheme (DSHS) under review. In recent weeks the ETG has been considering the viability of including return path capability in the DSHS set-top-box. There are however, a number of concerns about this vision, the main one being that there is not an open standard for return paths. The ETG proposes therefore to establish a dialogue with manufactures to explore the scope for the development of an open standard before taking a view on the most practical and economic way forward.</p>

The British Parking Association is the only existing ATA for the parking industry. Following the consultation, it was not considered necessary to extend this requirement to those who apply via the manual, paper-based channels due to the fact that each application is considered individually and additional evidence that must be provided.</p>

 We continue to encourage train operators to carry bikes on trains where possible. The Department for Transport&#146;s Cycling Policy document and the rail strategy White Paper published last year set out our policy: train operators should facilitate the carriage of cycles on off-peak services and accept the folding cycles at all times. However, during the peak hours, where capacity is under pressure, it can be in the interests of the majority of passengers not to permit non-folding cycles on board. It is for individual train operators to determine which services cannot accommodate non-folding bicycles and of course to determine the number of bikes which can be carried at other times.</p>

1. For the years 2003-04 to 2005-06, the figure for Suffolk is a combination of the figures for Central Suffolk PCT, Ipswich PCT, Suffolk Coastal PCT, Suffolk West PCT and Waveney PCT.<br>
For the year 2006-07, where PCTs were reorganised in October 2006, the figure for Suffolk is a combination of the figures for the old PCTs listed above and the new Suffolk PCT. For the financial year 2007-08, the figure is for the new Suffolk PCT alone.<br>
2. The figure for 2006-07 does not include prescribing in the area of the former Waveney PCT after October 2006, when the PCT joined the former Great Yarmouth Teaching PCT to become Great Yarmouth and Waveney PCT.<br>
3. The figure for 2007-08 includes prescribing for 11 months only (April 2007 to February 2008). Data for the remaining month are not yet available. This figure also excludes prescribing from the former Waveney PCT area, which now forms part of Great Yarmouth and Waveney PCT.<br>
4. The PACT system covers prescriptions by general practitioners, nurses, pharmacists and others in England and dispensed in the community in the UK. For data at PCT level, prescriptions written by a prescriber located in a particular PCT but dispensed outside that PCT will be included in the PCT in which the prescriber is based. Prescriptions written in England but dispensed outside England are included. Prescriptions written in hospitals/clinics that are dispensed in the community, prescriptions dispensed in hospitals and private prescriptions are not included in PACT data. It is important to note this as some British National Formulary (BNF) sections have a high proportion of prescriptions written in hospitals that are dispensed in the community. For example, BNF chapter 4, &#147;Central Nervous System&#148;, has a proportion of items written in mental health clinics that are dispensed in the community&#151;these prescriptions are not included in PACT data.<br>

Most notably this has been through the reservation of 60 seats in the National Assembly and a third of all directly elected seats in local government for women. The Department for International Development (DFID) has supported these reforms through nearly &#163;1 million of assistance to civil society to work with political representatives at all levels. We have also contributed &#163;6 million to the United Nations Development Programme in support of women&#146;s empowerment, including the establishment a women&#146;s political school that has trained over 20,000 female Councillors. In addition, we have provided extensive support for training and promoting voter awareness during the recent elections. This targeted over 170,000 potential women voters and 5,000 female domestic election observers as part of a &#163;3 million support package.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_344"><a name="80501w0015.htm_para9"><a name="08050192001283">The End of Custody Licence Scheme (ECL) came into effect on 29 June 2007. Prisoners serving sentences of four weeks or more but less than four years who meet the eligibility criteria are released under licence up to 18 days earlier than they would otherwise be released. Between 29 June 2007 and 31 March 2008 about 23,700 prisoners have been released under the scheme. Of those released NOMS have been notified that about 3 per cent. have been recalled and just 1 per cent. have been notified as allegedly offending during the ECL period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"><a name="80501w0015.htm_para10"><a name="08050192001284">All prisoners who are subject to HDC/ECL including those who are not subject to Post Release Licence are liable to recall if they are reported to have misbehaved during the HDC/ECL period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="80501w0015.htm_para11"><a name="08050192001285">During the HDC/ECL period offenders who are subject to Post-Release Licence are required to meet their Offender Manager after release and to have regular contact after that in line with Probation Service National Standards. During the HDC/ECL period prisoners are encouraged to seek employment and training and to engage with relevant community resources. These measures apply only to those who have accommodation to go to.</p>

 Under section 123 of the Local Government Act 1972 and section 233 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, local authorities can dispose of land, including property, in any manner they wish.

One important solution is the launch of the National Skills Academy for Nuclear (NSAN). NSAN is a subsidiary company of Cogent and, responding to employer demand in the sector, its focus is UK-wide with responsibilities for assuring training provision to agreed standards.</p>

The initiatives include a web-based career pathways service and development of apprenticeship/modern apprenticeship frameworks, a nuclear industry training framework and national occupational standards along with the associated Scottish/national vocational qualifications, and foundation degrees. The career pathways scope the skills to deal with current nuclear waste volumes and the requirements of a future national nuclear waste repository.</p>

This Government was the first to introduce statutory support for part-time students, in 2000/01. In 2006/07, we introduced the most generous package of financial support ever for part-time students in England. This included increasing the maximum fee grant by 27 per cent. and an above-inflation increase in the income threshold for receiving this support.</p>

 Iran&#146;s overall human rights record is poor. We have a number of concerns about human rights violations in Iran, including the increasing use of the death penalty (and its continued use for juvenile offenders) and the growing restrictions on any form of dissent or organised protest.

So far this year the EU has raised human rights issues with the Iranian authorities at least seven times in meetings and made public statements on a number of issues including individual death sentences, the treatment of members of the Baha&#146;i faith, detained human rights defenders and students, and the draft Islamic penal code. We also discuss human rights issues bilaterally with Iranian officials. Most recently, on 6 March, I issued a statement calling for the release of two detained trade unionists in Iran, and on 1 April I called in the Iranian ambassador to raise our concerns about articles of the draft penal code that would make apostasy punishable by death.</p>

 We remain concerned about the situation in Tibet. We regularly raise our human rights concerns with the Chinese authorities and continue to urge full compliance with international human rights obligations including; rights to freedom of association, expression, religion, access to fair trial and respect for prisoners' fundamental rights. We have urged the Chinese authorities to exercise maximum restraint in dealing with any further unrest in the Tibetan region. Most recently, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer and my noble Friend Lord Malloch-Brown raised issues of human rights in Tibet during their meetings with Chinese leaders at the Economic Financial Dialogue from 14 to 16 April.</p>
