To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if he will give estimates of the cash allocations for each of the New Opportunities Fund's initiatives for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, according to the methodologies announced at Second Reading of the National Lottery Bill in the House of Lords; and if he will make a statement.  [40120]<P>

<P>
<a name="80427w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 I have today published preliminary drafts of Policy Directions which I intend to give to the New Opportunities Fund. Copies have been placed in the Library. These set out the proportion of money from that fund to be allocated between each of the four

<P><I>27 Apr 1998 : Column: 2</I><P>
countries of the UK for each of its first initiatives. The National Lottery is proving more successful and raising more money than anyone anticipated. I am determined that this extra money should be spent on projects which bring wider benefits to more people across the whole of the UK.
<P>

<a name="80427w01.html_para0">I have decided that the money from the New Opportunities Fund should be allocated between each of the four countries of the UK on a basis appropriate to each of the different initiatives it will support. So: the &#163;300 million for healthy living centres will be allocated on the basis of population size, weighted by deprivation factors; the &#163;400 million for out of school hours activities will also be allocated on the basis of population size, weighted by deprivation factors; the &#163;250 million for information and communications technology training for teachers and librarians will be divided by the number of teachers and librarians in each country.Decisions have not yet been taken on the allocation of the &#163;50 million for content creation.
<P>

<a name="80427w01.html_para1">The Lottery is played by the majority of adults across the UK and I want to ensure that as far as possible every area benefits from the money it raises for good causes.
<P>

<a name="80427w01.html_para2">Current estimates of what this will mean in cash terms for the next five years are shown in the table.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if he will publish drafts of policy directions which he intends to give to the New Opportunities Fund under Section 26(1) of the National Lottery etc. Act 1993 and Section 43C(1), to be inserted into the 1993 Act by the National Lottery Bill [<i>Lords</i>].

<P>
<a name="80427w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 I am publishing today preliminary drafts of the Policy Directions for the New Opportunities Fund, with accompanying explanatory notes. As drafts, these will, of course, be subject to further refinement and consultation with the Board of the New Opportunities Fund when it is established, before they are formally issued.
<P>

<a name="80427w01.html_para3">The Directions will ensure the New Opportunities Fund will deliver the objectives of the three initiatives set out in the White Paper (health, education and the environment) and overwhelmingly supported in the subsequent consultation exercise; set up a framework for the New Opportunities Fund's operation as an efficient,

<a name="80427w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what action he is taking to help local authorities to meet the waste recycling targets of <i>(a)</i> 60 per cent. reduction of wastes going to landfill by 2005, <i>(b)</i> recovery of 40 per cent. of municipal waste by 2005, <i>(c)</i> 25 per cent. household waste recycled by 2000 and <i>(d)</i> 75 per cent. of local authorities actively promoting composting by 2000.  [38616]

<P>
<a name="80427w01.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Our prime aim is to move waste management up the waste hierarchy--reduction, re-use, recovery (which includes composting, recycling and energy from waste), and finally disposal--having regard to the Best Practicable Environmental Option (BPEO). On the national targets mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, we have taken the actions set out below.
<P>

<a name="80427w01.html_para4"><i>(a)</i> The target in the previous Government's White Paper "Making Waste Work" is to reduce the proportion of controlled waste going to landfill to 60 per cent. by 2005. The landfill tax is the main tool we have for reducing the amount of waste going to landfill and the increase in the standard rate of tax (for active waste) from &#163;7 to &#163;10 per tonne, which takes effect from April 1999, will build on the reduction that has already taken place since the introduction of the tax. The same proportion--20 per cent.--of additional revenue generated by this increase will be available for distribution to environmental bodies as is the case for funds under the current scheme. The Government will also be considering whether the environmental bodies scheme could be enhanced, and in particular examining how it could be used to encourage more recycling.
<P>

<a name="80427w01.html_para5">Under the United Kingdom's presidency of the European Union, a Council Common Position has been agreed on the draft landfill directive, which would entail substantial reductions in the landfill of biodegradable municipal waste.
<P>

<a name="80427w01.html_para6"><i>(b)</i> "Making Waste Work" also set a target of 40 per cent. recovery of municipal waste by 2005. We have accepted all of the recommendations of the cross-sectoral Review Group on the Role of Local Authorities in Recycling, one of which was that Waste Disposal Authorities and Waste Collection Authorities should work together to formulate integrated municipal waste management strategies. Such a strategy would bring into play all the various ways of dealing with waste--composting, recycling, energy from waste and final disposal. With the increasing cost of final disposal to landfill, I would expect waste management options further up the hierarchy to play a more important role in an integrated waste management strategy than they do at present. Composting, recycling and energy from waste all count towards this national recovery target.
<P>

<a name="80427w01.html_para7">The Department has recently issued guidance to local authorities on revising their recycling plans and strategies. The emphasis in the guidance is very much on authorities working together towards integrated municipal waste strategies, of which we expect waste collection authorities' recycling plans to form an integral part.
<P>

<a name="80427w01.html_para8">The Packaging Regulations will also have an important role to play in meeting this target. The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 were introduced by the previous Government and reflect a shared approach agreement between business sectors as a means of implementing the EC Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste. These Regulations are a first step towards changing attitudes in industry and in society more generally towards consumption, disposal and recycling. The targets in the Regulations are staggered in such a way that will allow the UK to meet the Directive targets as required in 2001, 



<P>
<P><I>27 Apr 1998 : Column: 4</I><P>
that is that at least 50 per cent. of packaging waste be recovered each year from 2001 and thereafter, and at least 15 per cent. of each material be recycled.
<P>

<a name="80427w01.html_para9">The Regulations are currently being reviewed by the Advisory Committee on Packaging. Among the matters under consideration is the scope for strengthening the local authority role. The Committee is to report at the end of May. Consultation on any proposed changes to the Regulations will take place in the summer.
<P>

<a name="80427w01.html_para10"><i>(c)</i> As far as the target of recycling 25 per cent. of household waste is concerned, we do not now expect it to be met. However, it needs to be recognised that some local authorities are already recycling 25 per cent. of their household waste, although others only manage less than 3 per cent. The important thing is for those authorities with lower recycling rates to benefit from the experience of those achieving higher rates, and to this end the Department is currently undertaking a Good Practice project, which will disseminate to all authorities the good practice of, and lessons learnt by, about forty authorities.
<P>

<a name="80427w01.html_para11"><i>(d)</i> "Making Waste Work" contains targets on composting, including for 1 million tonnes of organic household waste a year to be composted by 2001. This administration is keen to increase the quality and quantity of municipal waste which is composted. One of the main barriers to centralised composting is the lack of markets for the end product. In November last year we issued guidance to local authorities on designing and marketing their compost to large-scale users, mainly in the horticultural and landscaping industries. At the same time, we issued guidance to a wide range of prospective users in those sectors on the benefits of specifying waste-derived compost.
<P>

<a name="80427w01.html_para12">We have also set up a Composting Development Group to identify the problems and obstacles of marketing waste-derived composts to the agricultural, land restoration, landscaping and horticultural sectors, and to develop proposals to help overcome them. The Group is due to report in the summer.

 <i>[holding answer 24 April 1998]:</i> The current estimate of the cost of the works to improve Ranscombe Lane junction is &#163;155,000. There has been no assessment to establish the merits of combining this scheme with the Highways Agency's future scheme to install a cycle path between Lewes and Beddingham. It would not have been practicable to carry them out simultaneously, Ranscombe Lane junction was a high priority safety project and improvement was essential to reduce the number of accidents there. The proposal for a cycle path between Lewes and Beddingham is still at an early stage of preparation, for possible implementation in this financial year.

 There is a complex relationship between changes in gross domestic product and carbon dioxide emissions because the types of fuel used, the structure of the economy, and energy efficiency are all changing over time. We estimate that under present conditions every 1% increase in GDP would increase emissions of carbon dioxide by about 0.5%, other things being equal. But changes in the other factors mentioned mean that the trend in UK emissions of carbon dioxide is falling at present, whilst gross domestic product is increasing.

In prioritising the remedial actions necessary to resolve millennium problems, forces and brigades will take into account the date by which particular systems need to be compliant. Priority will be given to those key systems which will need to be compliant by the start of 1999. For other systems, the end of 1999 will be the target date for compliance.

 The claim was received in the Firearms Compensation Section on 28 August 1997. The Option A and B elements of the claim, and of an accompanying ex gratia application under the voluntary surrender scheme for small-calibre pistols, were processed on 23 January 1998 and payment made. The remaining Option C elements, which will require individual consideration of the evidence of value provided, will be dealt with later in the year. As I have said to the House on many occasions, the number and complexity of these compensation claims, and the need for careful examination to counter fraud and ensure payment at the correct rates, are all factors contributing to the processing time.

To ask the Prime Minister, pursuant to the oral answer of the Secretary of State for the Home Department of 30 March 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 887-88, if he will discuss with each of the host countries during his forthcoming Middle East visit the extent to which <i>(a)</i> Lockerbie and <i>(b)</i> the case of WPC Yvonne Fletcher underlie United Nations sanctions against Libya.  [38213]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80427w05.html_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 April 1998]:</i> Lockerbie is an issue of the greatest importance to this Government. During my visit to the Middle East I stressed the need for progress in implementing the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions. They relate to Lockerbie, not to the murder of WPC Fletcher. That tragic case, with Lockerbie, is a major obstacle in our bilateral relations with Libya.

He has been tasked with overseeing a Comprehensive Spending Review of existing drug resources, which has informed the Government's new anti-drugs strategy, to be launched today. This shows that the Government currently spend about &#163;1.4 billion a year on anti-drugs activity. An announcement on funding from 1999-2000 will be made later in the year, following the outcome of the Comprehensive Spending Review.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what were the findings of the 1996 study into the demographic and geographical distribution profile of potential recruits to the reserves which was announced in the Government response to the Twelfth report of the Defence Committee in January 1996 (HC 188).  [39636]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80427w05.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 In 1996 my Department employed an independent consultant to conduct a detailed study into recruitment to the Territorial Army (TA). This study suggested that the approach to TA recruitment was insufficiently nationally co-ordinated, and that it was not therefore possible to make a proper assessment of the 



<P>
<P><I>27 Apr 1998 : Column: 20</I><P>
demographic and geographical distribution profile of recruits and potential recruits to the Reserves. Following the study's conclusions, my Department is developing a management information system which will allow analysis of geographic and demographic trends, and in turn enable us greater focus in TA marketing and recruitment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80427w05.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The total establishment of the Royal Marines Reserve is presently 1,000, of which some 600 billets are for fully trained personnel. As at 1 March their total strength was 871, of which 525 were fully trained.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what new roles for RAF reservists have been <i>(a)</i> identified and <i>(b)</i> established since the enactment of the Reserve Forces Act 1996.  [39630]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80427w05.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 As the Reserve Forces Act 1996 focused primarily on terms of employment rather than types, no new roles have been identified or established as a direct consequence of the Act. However, since the enactment in April 1997, 3 further Role Support Squadrons have been formed to complement the first, the Helicopter Support Squadron, which formed in October 1996; a fifth squadron is to be formed in July 1998. Their roles reflect a new concept of operations which requires them to supply manpower to augment regular RAF units deployed on contingency force, peacekeeping, and humanitarian and disaster relief operations. Use has already been made of the new categories of reserve service introduced within the Act. All Reservist Aircrew have volunteered to serve as High Readiness Reservists, and some 17 officers and 18 other ranks are currently employed under the new Full Time Reserve Service terms in a range of posts.

<a name="80427w05.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 At the end of March 1998 the actual strength of the Merchant Navy Reserve was 978 against an establishment of 1,000. There is no specific recruitment target at the present time. Members of the MNR receive an annual taxable bounty of &#163;200.

 The Chemical Weapons Convention, with which the United Kingdom is fully compliant, permits activities which protect against the use of chemical weapons.

In order to re-emphasise our commitment to openness, a copy of the 1997 summary outlining the UK chemical defence programme, which has been forwarded to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in the Hague, has been placed in the library of the House.

 Outline proposals were drawn up at MOD's request by CBD Porton Down in May--July 1997 for a research programme into the possible health effects of the combination of vaccines and tablets given to troops in the Gulf to protect them against the threat of biological and chemical warfare. The proposals were described in the policy statement "Gulf Veterans Illnesses: A New Beginning" published on 14 July 1997.

<P>
<a name="80427w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Information Age strategy launched by the Prime Minister on 16 April 1998 demonstrates the Government's commitment to electronic commerce. Electronic commerce is crucial to the future prosperity of our economy and to the competitive position of our industries, and the UK is well placed to play a leading role. Building on the success of the Programme for Business, the Government are now putting in place the policy and legal framework in which electronic commerce can flourish. From schools to high finance in the City the Government are committed to ensuring everyone benefits from advanced electronic communications.
<P>

<a name="80427w07.html_para0">It is also important to make electronic commerce more secure. Users cannot afford to let the information they transmit across the Internet (or any other network) be compromised. They must have confidence that both the integrity and confidentiality of their information will be protected. At the same time, users must be able to trust both the technologies which allow such security and the commercial organisations providing it. To that end, I am announcing today proposals for legislation to introduce voluntary licensing arrangements for bodies offering cryptographic services to the public to ensure that minimum standards of quality and service are met. They will apply to both Certification Authorities (providing electronic signature services) and other bodies providing encryption services. The arrangements will set minimum technical and competence standards for bodies that wish to seek licences. The legislation will also enable users to place greater reliance on digital signatures, through a presumption of legal recognition for those signatures generated by licensed Certification Authorities. Fuller details of this policy are set out in a Statement which is being lodged in the Libraries of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="80427w07.html_para1">It is not, however, in the interests of business or the public for criminals and terrorists to be able to exploit these new technologies to disguise or conceal their activities. To meet these concerns, the Government will also introduce legislation making provision for law enforcement agencies to gain legal access, under a properly authorised warrant and on a case by case basis, to encryption keys or other information protecting the secrecy of stored or transmitted information. The purpose

 I have received a number of representations from the UK textile industry and others about the provisional anti-dumping duty that the Commission, against the wishes of a clear majority of member States, has decided to impose on imports of grey cloth. When consulted by the Commission, we made clear our firm opposition to such a step, which we believe to be against the interests of both the Community textile industry and EU consumers and will cost jobs. Collection of the duty is a matter for HM Customs and Excise.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if the review of the arrangements for reporting surveys on pesticide residues in food has been completed; and if he will make a statement.  [40011]<P>

<P>
<a name="80427w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Government are committed to informing the public about all food safety matters. Following the changes announced last year, and the new arrangements announced for veterinary drug surveys on 6 April 1998, I have now agreed to further improvements in the reporting of surveillance results for pesticide residues surveys. To continue to improve openness and information to consumers, the brand names of products tested in future pesticide residue surveillance exercises will, subject to some minor exceptions, be published on a regular basis.
<P>

<a name="80427w08.html_para2">The UK has in place a pesticide residues surveillance programme to fulfil its Community obligations to monitor pesticide residues in fruit and vegetables, cereals and products of animal origin. This programme is undertaken each year under the auspices of the Working Party on Pesticide Residues. The results are published in the Working Party's annual report although any results of public interest are published earlier together with any necessary advice to consumers.
<P>

<a name="80427w08.html_para3">The publication of brand names will require some restructuring of the pesticides surveillance programme to ensure that surveys are representative of particular produce on the market. The new arrangements will, therefore, apply for surveys conducted from 1998 onwards. As with the other programmes there will be 



<P>
<P><I>27 Apr 1998 : Column: 30</I><P>
certain minor exceptions, such as surveys whose sample are pooled, where publicising brand information would be inappropriate.
<P>

<a name="80427w08.html_para4">Planned surveys for residues of pesticides will continue to be announced in advance, as has been practice for some years. However, the sheer scale of this programme precludes releasing the brands to be sampled in advance.
<P>

<a name="80427w08.html_para5">We are committed to giving consumers the maximum possible information on the presence of pesticide residues in food and will ensure that this is provided with appropriate advice on the public health significance of any results. Of course, we will make every effort to ensure the fairness of any tests and not seek to select one manufacturer or source over another. I believe the new arrangements will allow consumers to make a more informed choice about the food that they buy.

 Following a review of the Certificate of Competence Scheme for the purchase of organophosphorus (OP) sheep dips in February 1997, the Veterinary Products Committee (VPC) concluded that the marketing of OP sheep dips should continue.

The leaflet has been sent to known sheep farmers.

 The Evaluation Department very seldom receives external requests for individual Department for International Development Project Completion Reports, none of which is publicly available since, unlike <i>ex post</i> evaluation reports, they are not cleared with the recipient governments. But we do make publicly available our periodic synthesis analyses of the broad findings of the most recent batches of Project Completion Reports. In 1997-98 a total of 158 copies of our <i>ex post</i> evaluation reports were sent out in response to external requests.

 We are still in the process of identifying individual projects for full retrospective impact evaluation in 1998-99 once residual work on the previous programme is complete. Initially the new work will focus predominantly on two broad themes: sustainable rural livelihoods; and the strengthening of revenue collection systems. Subsequently we shall turn our attention to three additional themes: gender; the public sector and the role of the state; and participatory approaches. Work from the previous programme due for completion and publication in 1998-99 includes the following:

 During 1997-98 we approved 124 projects and programmes which include support to women's empowerment, spread across the broad range of developing countries where we work. New spending commitments to projects and programmes, across all sectors, which take account of women's concerns, added up to &#163;266 million in 1997-98.

<a name="80427w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 We seek to support women's empowerment across the board in our international development assistance programme. The Department for International Development expenditure commitments which include an explicit consideration of gender concerns and which seek to promote gender equality have been steadily rising, a trend which we expect to continue. During 1997-98 new funding commitments across all sectors explicitly taking account of gender concerns add up to about &#163;266 million, representing more than 35% of total bilateral commitments for the year.

 We remain seriously concerned about human rights in Afghanistan, especially the rights of women and girls. The UK continues to advocate respect for these rights in the relevant international fora and in direct contacts with the Taliban and other groups inside Afghanistan.

The Common Position commits the EU to work for the protection and promotion of equal rights for men and women in Afghanistan, including access to education and health facilities. In addition the United Nations Strategic Framework for Afghanistan, which has the full support of the UK, includes as one of its four main strategies the protection and advancement of human rights, with particular emphasis on gender issues.

<P>

<a name="80427w11.html_para2">A key theme of this year's session of the CSD, which began on 20 April in New York, is freshwater.
<P>

<a name="80427w11.html_para3">The UK will promote a clear objective of securing access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation for all, the reduction of water related diseases and greater food security through sustainable management of water contributing to the elimination of poverty.
<P>

<a name="80427w11.html_para4">We are supporting this objective by increasing our assistance in the water sector and ensuring that this support is used more effectively. To this end, we are continuing to promote the importance of meeting international targets in this area and the need to develop appropriate indicators to monitor progress.
<P>

<a name="80427w11.html_para5">Official Development Assistance can meet part but not all of the funding requirements. It can be focused on priority areas of meeting basic human needs and building capacity.

<P>
<P><I>27 Apr 1998 : Column: 40</I><P>

We aim to encourage development of a broad range of partnerships, in particular with the private sector, which can better generate and manage the additional funds required. We recognise the importance of recovering all the costs for water systems to be viable and sustainable, but this must be linked to transparent and well targeted subsidies to protect the poorest who cannot pay full costs. This can lead to the mobilisation of resources and greater access to basic water and sanitation services for poor people--essential if we are to meet goals of universal access to these services.

 Since April 1996, we have supported the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in its development of international humanitarian law (IHL) materials appropriate for use in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the promotion of IHL courses within public and private higher academic institutions in the Russian Federation and the CIS. The activities are continuing and has involved a commitment to date of &#163;127,000.

<a name="80427w11.html_para6">We also provided a contribution of &#163;15 million to the ICRC in February 1998, of which &#163;4 million was provided specifically for the dissemination of humanitarian law within the ICRC's global programmes.

We will host a ministerial meeting in London on 23 June to give exposure to Mr. Otunnu's work programme and priorities to our European partners and NGOs. We will also explore opportunities for working together in countries which are particularly affected by children serving as soldiers, such as Sierra Leone and Liberia.

 Two regulations governing the use of development funds for human rights promotion and protection are currently under discussion at working group level in the Council. Once agreed, the Regulations will provide a legal base and policy framework for projects financed from relevant EC external assistance budget lines. We have been pressing for the inclusion of references to social and economic rights, as well as civil and political ones, in the negotiations.

 The Department for International Development's contribution to the UK Government's objective of achieving human rights for all will be to focus on the rights which are essential for eliminating poverty and for achieving sustainable livelihoods and dignity for disadvantages people in poorer countries. This encompasses economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights of poor and disadvantaged peoples in poorer countries.

 We are committed to supporting the creation of a stronger peace-building and conflict management capacity for regional organisations and are working within the European Union (EU) and United Nations to achieve this.

<P>

<a name="80427w12.html_para0">PIMS was reviewed at the end of 1997 following the publication of the White Paper on International Development. It was agreed that the system needed to be revised to reflect better the Department for International Development's (DFID) new agenda and Statement of

This has been achieved through the introduction of a three-tiered approach whereby projects and programmes are marked against DFID's aim of poverty elimination (Poverty Aim Marker); DFID's three new Objectives (Policy Objective Marker); sub-elements of the Objectives, other policy areas and international reporting requirements (new PIMS markers of which there are now 33).

<P>
<P>
<a name="80427w12.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland, pursuant to the answer of 27 October 1997, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>726,</i> on rented housing, what would be the gross cost to the public sector if all local authority rents in Scotland were to be cut by 10 per cent; and what would be the cost net of savings in housing benefits. [37199]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80427w12.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Macdonald </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 April 1998]:</i> Scottish local authorities determine their rents according to local needs and circumstances. In England, guideline rents are set by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and, in certain circumstances, rental income is used to offset the cost of rent rebates. Because of these and other differences in the systems of local authority housing finance, it is not possible to give estimates for Scotland which are directly comparable with those for England given on 27 October 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>726.</i>
<P>

<a name="80427w12.html_para6">A 10 per cent. reduction in Scottish local authorities estimated rented income for 1997-98 would, however, have resulted in an estimated reduction in housing benefit in that year of around &#163;79 million. And local authorities' housing expenditure in the same year would have been reduced by &#163;107 million. As a result, authorities would have had this amount less to invest in repairs and maintenance and for other housing related expenditure. That, in turn, could have led to an increase in Housing Support Grant and pressure also to increase Housing Revenue Account allocations, although it is not possible to be precise about the size of such increases. The net effect on overall public expenditure cannot therefore be reliably estimated.

3. The 1997-98 AEF figure includes &#163;105.6 million which was paid to local authorities as a special grant (outside AEF) in respect of Strathclyde Passenger Transport. &#163;95 million has also been included in the 1998-99 AEF figure for the same purpose.<P>

4. Grand Aided Expenditure (GAE) does not include expenditure on loan and leasing charges.<P>

5. Prior to 1991 Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) was known as Assessments of Relative Expenditure Need.<P>

6. Prior to 1991-92 Aggregate External Finance (AEF) was known as Aggregate Exchequer Grant.<P>

7. Aggregate Exchequer Grant consisted of Rate Support Grant and Specific Grants only. The Non-Domestic Rate Income (NDRI) figures have therefore been added to these years for comparison purposes.<P>

8. The total capped expenditure figures represent total relevant non-housing net current expenditure (excluding loan and leasing charges). For the years 1988-89 to 1997-98 the figures are actual budgeted expenditure figures. For 1998-99 the figure is the maximum capped expenditure permitted under the Secretary of State's capping principles.<P>

9. The numbers in the second table have all been converted to 1997-98 prices using the latest HM Treasury's GDP deflators dated 13 March 1998.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="80427w14.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Head lice infections are not notifiable and are often managed within the privacy of people's own homes, making accurate counting difficult. A study <sup>1</sup>  in the south of England suggests that in a year on average 10 per cent. of children catch lice. The health authorities in Staffordshire believe incidence in Staffordshire to be similar to that experienced in other parts of the country. The Public Health Departments and School Health Services in both North and South Staffordshire are active in providing support and advice to health care professionals, schools and parents about managing head lice.

 There is no single effective treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). The condition varies significantly from one patient to another and therefore individual patients benefit from different treatment regimes. Therefore, we consider that it is more appropriate for clinical guidelines to be produced by clinicians themselves or through their representative professional bodies. Furthermore, the Medical Royal Colleges point out that, whilst CFS/ME should be managed by general practitioners, it is inappropriate at present to issue clinical guidelines given the lack of methodologically sound research.

<a name="80427w16.html_para0">On a national scale, the Government are committed to examining the means of delivering more automatic help to the poorest pensioners, around one million of whom do not take up their Income Support entitlement. We have commissioned independent research into the barriers to pensioners claiming their entitlement.

 The pensions review is looking at ways to meet the Government's commitment to strengthen and support occupational pensions because we recognise the importance of occupational pensions in providing income for retirement.

The tax credit will replace the child care disregard in Family Credit and other income-related benefits.

<a name="80427w16.html_para9">Since July 1997, lone parents participating in the New Deal for Lone Parents programme have also been eligible for help with childcare costs of up to &#163;60 per week (or &#163;100 per week for two or more children from June 1998) while undertaking various activities helping them secure a job, for example attending job interviews; attending an interview with the Personal Adviser and attending certain kinds of training courses or programmes.

<a name="80427w17.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Clapham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security (1) if she will commission a comparison between her Department's predicted values in the lung function test and the European Community for Steel and Coal study undertaken in 1993;  [39921]
<P>
<UL>(2) when the survey of the general population, which is the basis of the predicted performance used in the lung function test was undertaken; how many males were included in the survey; what proportion of those taking part smoked; and when it was last updated;  [39920]
<P>
(3) what is the basis of the predicted performance used in the lung function test; how it is calculated; and when it was first devised;  [39918]
<P>
(4) if the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council has re-evaluated J. E. Cotes' Lung Function Assessment in Medicine used by her Department, since the European Respiratory Society recommended the use of ECSC values; and what was the outcome.  [39919]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80427w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Industrial Injuries Advisory Council provides Ministers with expert independent advice on matters relating to the Industrial Injuries Benefit Scheme. The Council re-evaluated the use of the Cotes equation for the lung function test in their review of the prescription of chronic bronchitis and emphysema. That re-evaluation included consideration of the European Community for Coal and Steel study published in 1993. The Council concluded that the Cotes equation remained as appropriate as any other available equations, including that published in the latter study. A copy of the Council's report of their review entitled "Chronic Bronchitis and Emphysema" (Cm 3240) which was published in May 1996 is in the Library. Particulars of the Cotes equation and the reference populations used in Cotes are set out in detail in "Lung Function: Assessment and Application in Medicine" by J. E. Cotes (ISBN 0-632-00033-3).

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what plans her Department has to set target times for processing appeals under the Benefit Integrity Project.  [39912]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80427w17.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We are committed to looking at various ways of improving the way in which the Benefit Integrity Project operates. For example, from 1 May all review requests will be subject to new faster processes. The aim is to reduce the time taken to process review requests from 10 to 11 weeks to 4 to 5 weeks in the majority of cases. We are also examining ways of speeding up the processing of appeals against decisions made under the Project and discussions have begun with the Independent Tribunal Service.
