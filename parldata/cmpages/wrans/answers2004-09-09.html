<a name="40909w01.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>Waste Management</h3>





<p><a name="40909w01.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Hancock: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the latest figures are for the amount of compostable material disposed of each year in England; how much is reclaimed and recycled as compost; and what plans she has to increase this figure.  [187547]</p>








<p><a name="40909w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Municipal Waste Management Survey of local authorities in England for 2002&#150;03, shows that 14.28m tonnes of biodegradable municipal waste was disposed of to landfill, and 1.2m tonnes composted. In addition 1.1m tonnes of paper and card were recycled. As yet there is no method of measuring the amount recycled through home composting.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40909w01.html_para0">
From the Environment Agency&#039;s National Waste Production Survey of a sample of 40,000 businesses, conducted in 1998, it is estimated that 2.78m tonnes of biodegradable industrial and commercial waste was disposed of to landfill, 0.85m tonnes composted and a further 4.75m tonnes of paper and card recycled.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40909w01.html_para1">
The Government are taking a number of steps to increase the amount of biowaste composted. For example, we have established the Waste Implementation Programme (WIP), to support local authorities in achieving the UK&#039;s Landfill Directive targets to divert biodegradable municipal waste from landfill. The Government have also established the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) to create stable and efficient markets for recyclates, including organic material. WRAP is also running a home composting programme and has already organised distribution of over 60,000 composting bins to households in England. In addition Defra, through the Environmental Action Fund (EAF), has provided the Composting Association with &#163;282,000 over three years to raise awareness of composting.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40909w01.html_para2">
These and other measures have seen the proportion of municipal biowaste composted rise to 32 per cent. of all municipal waste recycling in England in 2002&#150;03.


</p>







<p><a name="40909w01.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Wiggin: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent steps she has taken to improve the United Kingdom&#039;s recycling performance.  [186939]</p>








<p><a name="40909w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Waste is a devolved issue. The Government have taken numerous steps to increase recycling in England. For example, national household waste recycling targets have been set, supported by statutory recycling and composting targets with an increase in funding for local government waste activities for each local authority. Government have also 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>9 Sept 2004 : Column 1332W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
established the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) to create stable and efficient markets for recycled materials across the UK.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40909w01.html_para3">
This specific action on recycling is supported by steps to move municipal waste management up the waste hierarchy. For example, in England, a Landfill Allowances Trading Scheme for local authorities is being developed and the Waste Implementation Programme (WIP) has been established, to support authorities in achieving the UK&#039;s Landfill Directive targets to divert biodegradable municipal waste from landfill. In addition, the Government have committed to increasing the UK Landfill Tax rate to &#163;35 per tonne of active waste in the medium term.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40909w01.html_para4">
As a result of these and other actions the proportion of municipal waste being recycled in England has increased to 15.6 per cent. in 2002&#150;03 and we expect to meet our 2003&#150;04 national household waste recycling target of 17 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40909w01.html_para5">
Steps taken to increase recycling of non-municipal waste include amending the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997: new UK targets were set last year to raise overall recovery by obligated companies from 59 per cent. in 2003 to 63 per cent. this year and 70 per cent. by 2008, with the percentage to be achieved through recycling rising to 95 per cent. in 2007&#150;08. We will also be announcing shortly a package, funded by Landfill Tax escalator receipts from business more resource efficient, to help business in England become more resource efficient.
</p>






<a name="40909w01.html_sbhd1"><h3 align=center>Energy Efficiency Implementation Plan</h3>





<p><a name="40909w01.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Rosindell: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the Energy Efficiency Implementation Plan.  [185904]</p>








<p><a name="40909w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 &quot;Energy Efficiency: The Government&#039;s Plan for Action&quot; was published on 26 April 2004.

<a name="40909w01.html_sbhd2"><h3 align=center>Flooding (Insurance)</h3>





<p><a name="40909w01.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Liddell-Grainger: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many <i>(a)</i> homes and <i>(b)</i> farm holdings have been unable to obtain insurance policies against flood damage in the last year for which statistics are available; and if she will make a statement.  [186685]</p>








<p><a name="40909w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Firm statistics will not be available from the Association of British Insurers (ABI) until later this year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40909w01.html_para6">
Initial indications from the ABI are that insurers are maintaining cover for homeowners in high flood risk areas in all but a handful of cases.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40909w01.html_para7">
The ABI are not aware of any instances where renewal has been refused on farm holdings. Farm buildings in general do not tend to have flood insurance due to the nature of their construction and lack of foundations.
</p>






<a name="40909w01.html_sbhd3"><h3 align=center>GM Crops</h3>





<p><a name="40909w01.html_wqn4"><b> Joan Ruddock: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what thresholds for GM contamination of non-GM seeds the Government intends to support within the EU.  [187620]</p>








<p><a name="40909w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 We are awaiting revised proposals from the EU Commission on labelling thresholds for approved GM seeds in non GM seeds. The UK Government position on the proposals will be based on scientific advice, the practicability of the measures that would need to be applied to ensure that we could enforce the regulations, and recognition that any thresholds set for seeds must be achievable by seed producers.
</p>






<a name="40909w01.html_sbhd4"><h3 align=center>Flood Defences (Efficiency Savings)</h3>





<p><a name="40909w01.html_wqn5"><b> Norman Baker: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether changes to flood defence provision will be made to achieve efficiency savings as announced in the Spending Review, broken down by financial year.  [185892]</p>








<p><a name="40909w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Environment Agency has agreed to deliver efficiencies in its flood defence activities of &#163;15 million for each of the financial years covered by the 2004 Spending Review (2005&#150;06 to 2007&#150;08). These efficiencies will be achieved through better procurement practices, greater use of new technology and a reduction in the process costs of delivering the capital programme. These savings will offset the effects of inflation and increases in construction costs currently estimated at 4 per cent. per annum.
</p>






<a name="40909w01.html_sbhd5"><h3 align=center>Warm Front</h3>





<p><a name="40909w01.html_wqn6"><b> Ms. Drown: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will change the Warm Front scheme by <i>(a)</i> not time-limiting a second application where it is for heating which had not previously been claimed for and <i>(b)</i> allowing old and inefficient boilers to be replaced before they break down.  [186062]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>9 Sept 2004 : Column 1334W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40909w01.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Department is currently developing a Fuel Poverty Implementation Plan which will consider options for better targeting and will review the eligibility criteria and effectiveness of current measures offered under Warm Front.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40909w01.html_para8">
In response to the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee and the National Audit Office we have introduced a pilot to establish how best households with intermittently and ineffective working boilers can be assisted by the scheme. The results of this pilot will be assessed later in the year.

<p><a name="40909w02.html_wqn0"><b> Ms Atherton: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what criteria were used in making the decision to close the Exeter office of Watervoice; and what process was followed.  [185771]</p>









<p><a name="40909w02.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The original decision to close the Exeter office was based on a recommendation made by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in its report on the organisation and regional structure of the Consumer Council for Water. PwC recommended that the offices in Exeter and Bristol currently serving the south west and Wessex regions should be merged into one office and located either in one of the existing offices or at a new site in Taunton.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40909w02.html_para0">
However, we have since given very careful consideration to a number of representations received and reviewed the decision to close or relocate regional offices. We concluded that against the background of the representations and the current periodic review of water prices, the benefits for water customers in maintaining the existing regional system of consumer representation outweighs the benefits of rationalisation at this time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40909w02.html_para1">
We now intend to leave it to the new CCW to consider PwC&#039;s recommendations and to decide, in the light of future circumstances what changes, if any, it wishes to make to its regional structure.

</p>



<p>(2) what research his Department has carried out into technical solutions for blocking the use of hand-held mobile phones in cars.  [186394]</p>








<p><a name="40909w02.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 Representatives of mobile phone and bar manufacturers have been involved in discussions with the Department for Transport on a new European Directive that will replace the current Directive 95/54/EC on electromagnetic compatibility. This requires cars to have a minimum level of immunity to interference such that electronic devices, including mobile phones, do not cause malfunctions of the vehicle&#039;s electronics.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>9 Sept 2004 : Column 1335W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40909w02.html_para2">

<p><a name="40909w02.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 UK Airlines carry first aid and emergency medical kits in accordance with common requirements established by the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA). The content of these kits is being reviewed following a proposal from the European Civil Aviation Conference for considering several improvements to the kits but granting some flexibility to meet an operator&#039;s route specifications. The UK supports these changes and will implement them once they have been adopted by the JAA following public consultation.

 The Blue Badge Scheme is designed primarily to assist people with severe difficulty in walking, whatever the cause of their disability. People who are registered blind also qualify under the Scheme. Drivers with a severe disability affecting both arms may also be eligible.

<p>
<a name="40909w02.html_para7">
Given the close correlation between disability and age, the regulations we have introduced to require new trains, buses and coaches to provide a range of features to improve access are also benefiting many older people. During the last three years over 1,400 new fully accessible rail vehicles have entered service and there will be over 1,000 more within the next year. Around 29 per cent. of buses seating over 22 passengers are already accessible, and in major cities the proportion is much higher.

Early consultation between police officers and crown prosecutors will assist in getting the charge right first time, and reducing remedial work often required to bring cases up to appropriate quality standards. Weeding out weak prosecutions at an early stage will save further effort for both the police and the Crown Prosecution Service. In addition, an increase in guilty pleas will result in fewer trials, with benefits for not only the police and the Crown Prosecution Service, but also the courts. These improvements will result in an estimated 3.2 per cent. efficiency gain on contested cases going through the criminal justice system.

 We are taking the following measures to stop the illegal removal of organs from deceased adults and children.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40909w10.html_para0">
The Retained Organs Commission (ROC) was set up in April 2001 to oversee the return of organs and tissues to families, and where requested, to provide advocacy to families and to advise trusts. The ROC issued its final report in March 2004 and this can be found at http://www.nhs.uk/retainedorgans.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40909w10.html_para1">
The Government&#039;s Human Tissue Bill, which had its second reading in the House of Lords in July 2004, provides the regulation of removal, storage and use of human organs and tissue. The Bill also makes provision for the creation of a new body, the Human Tissue Authority (HTA), which will prepare statutory guidance on all matters within its remit, as set out in the Bill.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40909w10.html_para2">
Pending completion of the Bill&#039;s passage through Parliament and the establishment of the HTA, the Department published two documents in April 2003: &quot;The Use of human organs and Tissue, An Interim Statement&quot; and &quot;Families and post mortems, A Code of Practice&quot;. These provide guidance on the use of human organs and tissue and recommended practice for ensuring consent is obtained for hospital post-mortems and for the retention and use of organs following a hospital or coroner&#039;s post-mortem. These publications can be found on the Department&#039;s website.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40909w10.html_para3">
The Department has also provided Section 64 grant funding to the National Bereavement Partnership to set up a helpline to support families and the general public affected by issues around post mortems and the possible retention of organs or tissues. This helpline will be able to provide essential information and advise those affected how they might take an inquiry forward with their local national health service trust.

 We are undertaking the most fundamental reform of national health service dentistry since the inception of the NHS. The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 provides the commissioning of general dental services is to be delegated to primary care trusts from October 2005. This will ensure that the developing dental specialities in primary care, including orthodontics, are given the right opportunities to contribute more to NHS patient care. Provision of more specialist dental care in a high street setting will mean that practitioners no longer need to refer patients who could be treated in a primary care setting to hospital. In this way, staff at hospital dental departments will be able to concentrate on more complex treatments.

Note:<br>

1. An in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1April at the start of the datayear. Periods of care ongoing at the end of the datayear (unfinished admission episodes) are included. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

2. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

3. Time waited statistics from hospital episode statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. An &quot;average pensioner&quot; has been interpreted as being single, aged 65 or over with no dependents, no severe disabilities and no additional income or costs (such as annuities, trust fund payments, mortgage interest payments, etc.).<br>





2. In order to make the above calculation, it has been assumed that rent and council tax levels for the average pensioner are &#163;44 and &#163;12 respectively. These are the average amounts used in the DWP Tax Benefit Model Tables.<br>

3. Withdrawal rates do not include the impact of tax i.e. tax withdrawal is not included in total withdrawal rate figures.<br>

4. N/a indicates there is no title to this benefit at, or above, this level of income.<br>

<p><a name="40909w17.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 The Department for International Development&#039;s (DFID) support for water and sanitation is predominantly channelled through our country programmes and support to multi-lateral institutions. Expenditure allocations reflect developing country governments&#039; own priorities, and our assistance is co-ordinated with that of other donors. DFID works to assist countries to use their budgets for greatest impact on reducing poverty and achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). For these reasons, DFID has not made a forward commitment specifically for the water sector.

However, DFID significantly supports the water sector providing the UK&#039;s bilateral expenditure of approximately &#163;90 million (the last period for which

precise data are available is 2001&#150;02 when bilateral water expenditure was &#163;87 million), which represents approximately 6 per cent. of the bilateral aid budget. This includes programmes in which water and sanitation and hygiene promotion are the main aims, and those where water and sanitation are components associated with wider objectives such as better health or education or improved urban management. DFID&#039;s contribution to multilateral expenditure on water and sanitation is estimated to be in excess of &#163;40 million per year. As a result, the UK was the fourth largest contributor of financial aid to the water sector in 2000 and 2001, and fifth in 2002. DFID is in the process of updating projections of bilateral and multilateral water-related expenditure through to 2007&#150;08, taking into account the autumn 2004 resource a location round.
