<a name="01211w01.html_spnew8"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The White Paper has been published today. It is entitled "Eliminating World Poverty: Making Globalisation work for the Poor".
<P>

<a name="01211w01.html_para3">This White Paper stands alongside our first White Paper published in 1997. It reaffirms our commitment to the elimination of poverty and the achievement of the International Development Targets.
<P>

<a name="01211w01.html_para4">We are living at a time of profound historical change. One in five of the world's population--two thirds of them women--live in abject poverty, at a time of growing material plenty. If the poorest countries can be drawn into the global economy, and get increasing access to modern knowledge and technology, we could move forward to a period of massive progress and the removal of abject poverty from the human condition. But if this is not done, we will see growing poverty, marginalisation, conflict and environmental degradation.
<P>

<a name="01211w01.html_para5">We need to work collectively to tackle the problems of conflict and corruption, boost investment in education and health, spread the benefits of technology and research, strengthen the international financial system, reduce barriers to trade, tackle environmental problems and make development assistance more effective.
<P>

<a name="01211w01.html_para6">This White Paper sets out the Government's policies in these areas. It reflects our commitment to work across all parts of Government in order to work with other governments and international institutions to significantly reduce poverty. It provides an agenda for managing globalisation in a way that will help to ensure that the new wealth, technology and knowledge being generated brings benefits to the world's poor.

 Hepatitis C testing is available in the National Health Service other than through blood donation.

Those who test positive will be referred to a specialist for confirmatory testing, further assessment and treatment, if appropriate.

This covered a bid for resources for the Office to undertake its financial audit and value for money duties. These resources include a small provision for the investigation of not-for-profit companies where the C&AG has secured access to--but not the audit of--records on a case by case basis. However, under existing companies legislation the

 I understand from the Archbishops' Council, whose responsibility these matters are, that although the total number of stipendiary clergy in the Church of England is projected to decline on present trends, the number of new people coming forward for ordination training has risen over the last five years. It is equally encouraging that the number of non-stipendiary priests and Readers continues to grow.

 I was very encouraged, as indeed was the Church of England in general, by the announcement on 8 November by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of Exchequer that the Government wish to seek a reduction in the rate of VAT levied on repairs to listed buildings that are places of worship. I understand that a letter has already been sent to the European Commission on the scope for such a reduction. Any reductions in VAT realised in this area would directly benefit thousands of parishes who currently bear a very heavy and ongoing VAT burden in respect of the necessary repair of their churches.

<a name="01211w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Recent scientific results from the Hadley Centre have shown that the observed temperature rise over the last 50 years is most likely to have been caused by greenhouse gasses emitted through human activities. There is some evidence of solar effects causing warming in the early part of the century but these are now secondary to the effects of greenhouse gasses. Cyclical influences due to the earth's orbit are important on time scales of thousands of years but currently have a negligible influence on global warming.

The Group recommended a precautionary approach, comprising a series of specific measures, to the use of mobile phone technologies until we have more detailed and scientifically robust information on any health effects.

 Tomorrow my right hon. and noble Friend the Minister for Transport will be launching a national consultation document on air transport, entitled "The Future of Aviation". This is the first major step towards a new White Paper on air transport. The consultation document invites views on a wide range of aviation and airports issues that underpin air transport policy. In particular, it will examine consumer issues; the best use of airspace and airport capacity; environmental questions; and planning for airport development. The closing date for responses is 12 April 2001. Copies will be placed in the Libraries of the House. Two supporting studies will also be issued alongside the consultation document: part 1 of a UK Air Freight Study and a study into the Potential Impact of Changes in Technology on the Development of Air Transport in the UK. Copies of these studies will also be placed in the Libraries of the House.

 In accordance with the policy set out in my Department's Guidance on Local Transport Plans, West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority sought a provisional view on the economic appraisal for two proposed extensions to the Midland Metro, prior to seeking the necessary powers under the Transport and Works Act (TWA).

 Bosnia and Herzegovina held general elections under OSCE supervision on 11 November. Voters chose between 44 political parties and 6,000 candidates for six levels of Government. The OSCE released final verified results on 27 November. In the State-level Parliamentary Assembly and the Federation House of Representatives, moderate parties won a slim majority of seats. In Republika Srpska, candidates for the nationalist Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) won the Presidency and the Vice-presidency and emerged as the largest single party in the Republika Srpska National Assembly, with 31 of the 82 seats.
<P>

<a name="01211w04.html_para6">Although it will take several months for coalition Governments to emerge in the Federation, Republika Srpska or in the State-level Parliamentary Assembly, both the war-time nationalist and moderate parties are claiming victory. Nationalists point to the increased SDS vote and the relative success of the HDZ and the SDA. In fact, the results confirmed the progressive trend (seen in every election since Dayton) way from the nationalist parties. Thus for the first time since Dayton, the nationalist parties failed to secure a majority at either Entity or State level.

Friend the Foreign Secretary welcomed the release of Dr. Flora Brovina, who had been illegally detained by the Milosevic regime, and urged President Kostunica to release the other Kosovo Albanian prisoners detained in similar circumstances. We have re-emphasised this point in discussions through our Embassy in Belgrade.

 President Kostunica confirmed publicly on 3 December that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will respect both the Kumanavo Military Technical Agreement and UN Security Council Resolution 1244. We welcome the ongoing dialogue between KFOR/NATO and Yugoslav authorities on developments in the Presevo valley. A lasting solution in this area can be found only through dialogue.

 The Nice European Council took decisions on arrangements for the involvement in ESDP of non-EU European members of NATO and other accession candidates.

 NATO remains the foundation of the collective defence of its members and retains an important role in crisis management.

Nothing in the evolution of ESDP has changed that position.

 For ease of reference I will answer each element of the question using the same numbering as the hon. Member. I should also point out that there is neither a Crown court centre nor judges' lodgings at Colchester.
<P>

<a name="01211w05.html_para1">Prior to 1997, lodgings were administered locally and it would incur a disproportionate cost to collect comparable cost information for 1995-96 and 1996-97. While sitting figures exist for the Crown court for these years, there are no readily available lodgings data against which to make a useful comparison and they have therefore been omitted from my answer.
<P>

Similarly, time taken by the judge in writing judgments and decisions during and at the end of cases and on occasions when other High Court judges stayed at lodgings while on other official business would count as judicial occupation but not sitting days.

<a name="01211w06.html_spnew0"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 The Football Foundation will devote 75 per cent. of its income to improving grassroots football facilities and coaching across England. This will be in the region of &#163;18 million in the current year and double from April 2001 onwards. Grant criteria are a matter for the Foundation, but I would expect primary and secondary schools to be eligible provided facilities and/or coaching was for both the school and the wider community.

 One of the key objectives for the space for sport and arts scheme is to create new, and modernise existing, sports and arts facilities for primary schools where existing facilities are poor, inadequate or simply do not exist. The prospectus sent to 65 local education authorities in early October highlighted this objective, and this key message was further re-enforced during a series of regional workshops held with the LEAs in October and November. Sport England received outline proposals from the LEAs last week and these are currently being assessed against a number of criteria, including the condition of existing facilities. We will announce in January details of projects which have been given, in principle, support.

<P>
<a name="01211w06.html_spnew4"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 Sport England has already reviewed the way in which it assesses Lottery applications under its School Community Sports Initiative. As a result Sport England no longer has a specific requirement that school facilities must be available for 40 hours of community use per week. Rather it assesses the overall sporting benefit to the community together with any particular factors affecting the level of community use in deciding whether to award a grant. Facilities provided by primary schools under the space for sport and the arts scheme will be available to the community, but there will be no requirement for 40 hours of such use.

Many resorts are in a position to benefit from funding opportunities in the new European structural funds and UK assisted areas maps or from this summer's single regeneration budget announcement. I announced a four-point support plan for resorts at the start of a tour I made this summer to learn at first hand about the problems and best practice in seaside resorts. In line with our funding agreement with the English Tourism Council, its resorts task force is due to produce its report early next year, which will recommend a programme of actions for resort regeneration.

<P>
<a name="01211w06.html_spnew12"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 Many of our proposals are directed towards increasing the number of qualified coaches working with schools.
<P>

<a name="01211w06.html_para2">The school sports co-ordinator scheme will provide 1,000 co-ordinators in secondary schools by 2004. Most of the co-ordinators will be based in secondary schools and linked to specialist sports colleges, of which there are now 83 designated across 58 different local eduction authorities. The sports colleges draw on the coaching expertise of local sports clubs and are developing excellent facilities across a range of sports, and, through their partnerships with local primary schools and community groups, are giving many children the opportunity to gain a head start in sport.
<P>

<a name="01211w06.html_para3">Alongside the co-ordinators scheme, we recognise the need to invest in volunteer training to increase the links between schools and elite sports. That is why we have set aside &#163;4 million from our spending review settlement to invest in two levels of volunteer training and support from 2002. We will underpin the training and support for young people aged 14 to 19 to develop leadership skills in sport and in their local communities where they can act as role models for younger children and perhaps prepare themselves for careers in sport. We will be working closely with NGBs to develop volunteer strategies to encourage and support more adults to get involved as leaders, coaches, officials and administrators.
<P>

<a name="01211w06.html_para4">The Sport Strategy Implementation Group has been looking at ways to increase the number of qualified sports coaches working with schools, and once the recommendations have been presented to Ministers on 13 December, the implementation process will proceed.

<a name="01211w07.html_para7">However, Government support for tourism is not confined to grant for tourist boards. DCMS is also spending some &#163;1 billion in 2000-01, for example, on the arts, royal parks and palaces, museums and galleries, much of which directly benefits tourism. Moreover, English local authorities are estimated to have spent over &#163;90 million last year on tourism, or &#163;1.81 per head; comparable figures for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are not available.

 The Government are committed to supporting a viable bid for the Olympic Games, but the British Olympic Association has primary responsibility for UK bids and has not yet taken a decision on whether to bid for 2012.

Where the Department makes use of a private sector publisher the publishing and printing costs are generally met by the publisher as part of their acceptance of the risks of publication.

 Departments are asked from time to time, under Governments of any party, to cost the policies and pledges of their political opponents. Since Departments would provide factual answers (subject to the limits on disproportionate cost) to questions from MPs about the costs of identifiable changes in activities or benefits, there is no objection to officials providing such factual information. These rules have applied under successive Governments.




<P>
<P><I>11 Dec 2000 : Column: 46W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="01211w09.html_para3">The basis on which this is done is that Ministers, assisted if they wish by their special advisers, are responsible for identifying the text of commitments together with any further interpretations or assumptions necessary to allow the commitments to be costed. Departments then provide factual material, drawing attention to any additional assumptions or qualifications which they have made (eg territorial basis, price level, first year or full year) including possible overlaps with other similar costings. Very often the exercise will be co-ordinated by the Treasury, who will then be in a position to exercise their own scrutiny and check consistency with other costings. When the exercise is not being co-ordinated by the Treasury, individual costings are cleared with the Treasury before being published.
<P>

<a name="01211w09.html_para8">The rate of rebate for members of salary-related schemes was set for the five years beginning 6 April 1997 following a review by the Government Actuary. That rebate is flat rate, based on a range of economic and demographic assumptions, using weighted averages with regard to age and sex, and including a contingency margin and expense loading. The weights assumed comparatively few members in the age range affected. The effect on the rebate of the changes to SERPS announced on 29 November would have been insignificant compared with the total level of the rebate. Age-related rebates for members of money purchase schemes and personal pensions would not have been affected because of the cap which applies at older ages.

<P>

<a name="01211w10.html_para6">The 1996 BCS included a special self-completion component that addressed the extent of domestic violence in 1995. Respondents recorded significantly more incidents when asked about domestic violence via a self- completion module. This found a best estimate of 6.5 million 'domestic assaults' against men and women during 1995, and that 2.9 million of these incidents resulted in injury. A report is in the Library (Home Office Research Study No. 191).

<a name="01211w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Home Office does not collect data on the number of children involved in prostitution. The hidden nature of this problem makes it difficult to produce reliable estimates of the extent of child prostitution. Those studies that have attempted to examine this have focused on particular geographic areas, but no accurate national data exist.

 There have been three self-inflicted deaths at Eastwood Park this year. Overall deaths of women prisoners have totalled three in 1997 and 1998, four in 1999 and eight in 2000. Breakdowns in the form requested are given in the tables.

<a name="01211w10.html_para8">The three deaths at Eastwood Park, like those elsewhere, were, or are, being investigated to assess the adequacy of suicide awareness procedures with a view to implementation of action plans to address deficiencies. The numbers of self-inflicted deaths among women prisoners are relatively low but unfortunately rising this year. The Prison Service is reconsidering with Ministers its suicide/ self-harm prevention strategy and an announcement will be made early in 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what representations he has received on the prohibition of foreign donations in the application of Schedule 15 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, to permitted participants to a referendum in Northern Ireland where an order is in force under section 70(1) of that Act to allow foreign donations to political parties participating in the same referendum; what discussions he has had with Northern Ireland political parties and others about them; and if he will make a statement.

 The effect of any order made under section 70(1) of the Act on the foreign funding of a referendum campaign in Northern Ireland was extensively debated during the passage of the Bill. There have been no separate discussions between my Department and Northern Ireland political parties and others about this aspect of the special provision for Northern Ireland parties. During the consideration of the Bill in another place, we received two letters on this matter from Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish.

 We intend to commence a substantial part of the Act, including section 4 and Parts II, IV to VII and IX, on 16 February 2001. We propose to consult the Electoral Commission before coming to a final view on the timing of commencement of the Commission's general functions set out in sections 5 to 13 of the Act. Subject to the Commission's views, our provisional intention is to bring sections 10, 12 and 13 into force on 16 February, 1 April and 1 July 2001 respectively. We also propose to consult the Commission and the main political parties before a decision is taken on the commencement of the amendments made to the Representation of the People Acts by Part VIII and sections 141 and 144 of Part X. However, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary indicated at Second Reading, 10 January 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 44, that the reduction in the qualifying period for registration as an overseas elector (provided for by section 141) would not be brought into force until after the next election.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he proposes to lay before the House a draft order under section 70(1) of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000; what consultations he plans to have with <i>(a)</i> Northern Ireland political parties and <i>(b)</i> other political parties prior to the draft order being laid; what representations he has received regarding the terms of the draft order; and if he will make a statement.

<a name="01211w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 We intend to lay before the House a draft order under section 70(1) of the Act shortly after the Christmas recess with a view to it coming into force, subject to parliamentary approval, on 16 February 2001, that is at the same time as Part IV of the Act is brought into force. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland met with the six main Northern Ireland parties in February to discuss the special provision for Northern Ireland parties in what is now section 70 and plans to do so again in advance of the draft order being laid. This provision was the subject of extensive debates both in this House and in another place during the passage of the Bill. Outside those debates we have received no recent representations about the terms of the draft order.

 <i>[pursuant to his reply, 6 November 2000, c. 111W]:</i> I placed in the Library a paper by the Improvement and Development Agency setting out the proposed arrangements for giving both political parties and the Electoral Commission on-line access to all electoral registers in order to facilitate the checks which will need to be undertaken to comply with Part IV of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. In the period between 16 February 2001, when Part IV comes into force, and the roll-out of the proposed arrangements for on-line access, registered parties will need to make appropriate interim arrangements to check donors against the relevant local electoral register which will be supplied to parties free of charge. Both the Association of Electoral Administrators and the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives have been actively involved in the consideration of the interim and permanent arrangements for providing parties and the Commission with ready access to electoral registers.

 The Electoral Commission was established on Royal Assent of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. The Commission is wholly independent of the Home Office and, more generally, of the Government of the day. Questions relating to the way the Commission carries out its statutory functions should accordingly be directed to the Chairman of the Commission once he has been appointed and, in the interim, to the Commission's Chief Executive, Roger Creedon. The Commission's address is:

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the interim solutions considered by his Department on access to the electoral register together with his estimate of the cost of each solution and the reasons why each solution would not provide value for money; and if he will make a statement.  [141479]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01211w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 We considered one interim solution put forward by the Improvement and Development Agency (IDeA). This would have involved registration officers sending their registers (together with the monthly updates under rolling registration) to a contractor who would create and maintain a central electronic register. A second contractor would then have 



<P>
<P><I>11 Dec 2000 : Column: 58W</I><P>
provided access to the data to political parties and the Electoral Commission via a secure intranet or internet route. The key difference between this approach and the proposed permanent solution is that under the permanent arrangement access would be to the locally held registers, obviating the need to send copies to a central point and thereby ensuring the data are always up to date. The estimated cost of this interim solution was &#163;440,000 a considerable sum for a solution with only a limited shelf-life.
<P>

<a name="01211w11.html_para5">This proposed interim solution would have been a considerable IT project in its own right with all the attendant risk. In particular, there was no certainty that the necessary contractual arrangements could be made, the technical issues resolved and the data supplied in time to enable the arrangement to run from February.

 The Criminal Cases Review Commission has to date referred the cases of 106 people to an appellate court. Their names, and the date on which their case was referred, are set out in the table. Some of these individuals were dead, and others were not in custody, when their case was referred. The referral by the Commission of the conviction or sentence of someone who is in custody brings no automatic entitlement to bail. If an application for bail is made, it is for the court to decide whether or not it should be granted. No central record is kept of whether bail was applied for, and if so when, and whether it was granted, in these cases, and this information is not readily available.

<a name="01211w12.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Ruane: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many children have been reported as missing in each of the last 20 years.  [141678]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01211w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Figures are not available to confirm the precise numbers of children reported missing each year since this information is not routinely collected in many forces. However, indications of the total number of children reported missing are available from a number of separate research studies, and estimates can be made on this basis. One study, published in 1992, estimated that 43,000 persons under the age of 18 were reported missing in England and Scotland in 1990. This would equate to a total number of missing children 'incidents' of 102,000, since some missing children disappear on more than one occasion. Repeat missing children is a significant problem. The vast majority of missing children reported to the police return home safely within 24 hours.
<P>

<a name="01211w12.html_para5">On-going Home Office research indicates that between 65 and 80 per cent. of all missing persons reported to the police will involve individuals under the age of 18. This would suggest that in 1999, there were between 150,000 and 190,000 cases of reported disappearances of children throughout the United Kingdom.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) when he received a bid from Boyd Valley Ward in South Gloucestershire to participate in his parish warden scheme; and what level of financial contributions was to be made by the parties concerned at the time when the bid was submitted;  [141344]
<P>
<UL>(2) what financial contribution was required from parishes participating in his parish warden scheme when the scheme was first introduced; and what change there has been to the level of contributions required.  [141343]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01211w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Neighbourhood Wardens grant programme bidding guidance states that the Government would fund up to 50 per cent. of the cost of schemes. At the time when the bid was received on 7 July 2000, the estimated total cost of the funding for years one and two of the scheme to cover four parishes was &#163;313,000. The bid was for a total of &#163;156,550 worth of grants from the Neighbourhood Warden programme. Full match funding details were not provided by the four parish councils concerned.
<P>

<a name="01211w13.html_para0">The schemes are currently working on their implementation plans with the help of technical support consultancy advice. The completed implementation plans are due in by 15 December. Until the completed implementation pans have been received I am unable to say whether the level of funding details have changed.

 There is no single or precise measure of police morale. In any service one will find some people who are happy about their work and others who are less than happy.
<P>

<a name="01211w13.html_para1">The number of people leaving a profession may be taken as an indicator of morale. Total wastage from the police service is very low. Figures for the last four years are given in the table. As total wastage includes ordinary retirements of officers who have completed 30 years service, the table also shows the number of voluntary resignations from the service.

By measuring public spending more accurately and providing new incentives for Departments to manage their resource more effectively, I anticipate that RAB will bring about significant improvements in the value for money of public services over the next five years and beyond.
