 We have assessed deep geothermal energy alongside other innovative renewable technologies. A particular barrier is the sector's ability to secure upfront capital support, which we have addressed through the two rounds of the Deep Geothermal Challenge Fund. The first round awarded £4 million in capital grants to three projects in financial year 2009-10, while the second round is currently under way with several bids under consideration. Another potential barrier is establishing investor confidence in ongoing returns at a commercial rate. This is provided by deep geothermal power's eligibility for 2 ROCs under the Renewables Obligation, as for other innovative renewable power technologies. Deep geothermal energy has also been considered during the development of the Renewable Heat Incentive. In addition, some in the industry have commented that the lack of a licensing regime creates a barrier to the sector's development. My officials are looking into this as set out in my answer today to my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park (Zac Goldsmith) to question 28470.</p>

<i> [holding answer 1 December 2010]:</i> The security of supply of gas is a top Government priority in the UK. Gas is fungible and DECC does not distinguish between types of gas consumed in the UK but instead aims to create an environment where there are incentives for investing in all viable forms of gas production. The energy security and green economy bill contains measures to strengthen the market incentive mechanism for ensuring sufficient gas is available.</p>

Recent increases in shale gas production in the United States has reduced the US's demand for imports of LNG, freeing up this LNG to be imported by other countries such as the UK and helping to put downward pressure on wholesale gas prices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="101206w0001.htm_para11"><a name="10120610000485">Further increases in the global production of shale gas are expected. This may help the UK to meet its demand for gas either directly (i.e. by being consumed in the UK) or indirectly (i.e. by freeing up other gas resources for consumption by the UK).</p>

<i> [holding answer 3 December 2010]: </i>The Government have not yet made a decision on whether to grandfather bioliquids under the Renewables Obligation (RO). In our response to the consultation on grandfathering biomass in the Renewables Obligation we committed to do further work on bioliquids derived from wastes. This work is currently being undertaken in discussion with the industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="101206w0001.htm_para18"><a name="10120610000500">12 companies have made representations to the Government that jobs in this sector are dependent on investor certainty, which is in turn dependent on grandfathering RO support rates. These representations indicate that although some projects and companies may be significantly affected, the overall impact on green jobs is likely to be small. Nevertheless the Government are keen to promote both green jobs and energy from waste and is therefore considering the issue very carefully.</p>

 Article 90 of the Scottish Parliament (Elections etc.) Order 2010 allows returning officers to provide documents in different languages, in graphical representations, or in such ways as to make them more accessible to people who might otherwise not have reasonable access to information. The Parliamentary Voting Systems and Constituencies Bill includes a similar provision. In addition, the Electoral Commission will be sending an information booklet to all households explaining how to vote at both the Scottish Parliament election and the referendum. The Commission are working with the Central Office of Information to ensure that the public information they provide will be accessible.

<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="101206w0002.htm_para0"><a name="10120610000956">In rural areas parishes are often grouped together into multi-parish benefices or team ministries which can range in number from two to five parishes to 17 to 24 in which usually an ordained minister is assisted by voluntary workers to ensure that within each parish worship and pastoral care is provided appropriately. The committed ministry of volunteers, particularly from within local congregations is essential to sustaining and extending the work of the church in rural parishes. Recently we have focused on developing the skills and gifts of rural congregation members which has allowed rural churches to explore new ways of ensuring regular worship and a high standard of pastoral care and outreach in rural communities. Stress in clergy particularly those with charge of several parishes is of great concern to the church.

Wherever possible, we want to see churches as living buildings where as much community activity as possible takes place, and the Church Commissioners will always support such activity. At the recent 'Faith in the Future of the Countryside' conference members of the Church of England discussed the Government's latest plans for the 'Big Society', development and housing in the countryside and the future of the government forests with several of our ecumenical partners. The conference urged the Church to engage with sustainable communities in its work on the 'Big Society' ensuring the safeguarding of ecological, cultural, economic and spiritual benefits which are already evident in the work of the Church in local communities.</p>

However, from April 2004, local authorities have had the discretion to set the council tax discount on properties considered to be second homes at between 50% and 10%.</p>

<i> [holding answer 3 December 2010]:</i> Last month, "Skills for Sustainable Growth" and "Investing in Skills for Sustainable Growth" set out the Government's plans to abolish central targets and increase freedom and flexibility for Further Education colleges and training organisations to respond effectively to the needs of employers, learners and their communities. Support for employers to offer more Apprenticeships will be a key part of that response. The Apprenticeships Programme is demand led, so the Government do not set targets for Apprenticeships by sector or level. But the Government have announced that they will increase annual funding for Apprenticeships by up to £250 million a year, so that by 2014-15 up to 75,000 more places will be available than under the previous administration.</p>

I want to encourage both to take responsible decisions and to strengthen protection where necessary, particularly for the most vulnerable.

Among those being considered are that the Government should work with lenders to provide information on high-cost credit loans through price comparison websites, and that the Government work with credit reference agencies to explore ways in which high cost credit lenders could provide information to credit reference agencies on the payment performance of their customers, allowing those with good payment records to use mainstream lenders more easily in the future.</p>

 Reducing tax loss, whether it stems from avoidance or evasion, is a key priority for this Government and we have recently announced that £900 million will be made available over the spending review period, to enable HMRC to step-up its activity in tackling tax loss to bring in £7 billion additional benefits per annum by 2014-15.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="101206w0004.htm_para86"><a name="10120630000314">HM Revenue and Customs deployed approximately 31,000 staff across all grades at 31 March 2010 on a variety of compliance activities including risk assessment, addressing inaccurate returns and verifying repayment claims, debt collection and criminal investigations across all heads of duty. We estimate that at 31 March 2011 there will be approximately 29,000 compliance staff. HMRC are expected to find resource savings of 15% through the better use of new technology, greater efficiency and better IT contracts. HMRC are not able to provide estimates for 2012 yet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="101206w0004.htm_para88"><a name="10120630000316">The additional tax liability (including penalties and interest) resulting from all HMRC compliance work in 2008-09 was £12 billion. Data for 2009-10 is not yet available. HMRC do not have a breakdown of how much they hope to recover from compliance activity in 2011-12 or 2012-13. The Government's investment of £900 million should raise additional benefits of around £7 billion by 2014-15.</p>

For those in receipt of tax credits, around 400,000 are estimated to face a deduction rate of 70% or less; 1,345,000 a deduction rate of between 71 and 73%; 5,000 a rate of between 73 and 76%; and 145,000 a rate of over 76%.</p>

 Legislation requires that adult offenders serving an immediate determinate custodial sentence must be released from custody at the halfway point of the sentence. Those serving determinate sentences of 12 months or more serve the second half of the sentence on licence in the community under supervision, and subject to recall to custody. Eligible offenders serving a determinate sentence of less than four years may be released under the home detention curfew scheme up to four and a half months earlier than the half-way release point if they pass a risk assessment. Offenders serving an indeterminate sentence, either a life sentence or a sentence of imprisonment for public protection (IPP), must serve in custody the full minimum term imposed by the court. After that point it is for the Parole Board to determine if and when they are safe to be released on licence.</p>
