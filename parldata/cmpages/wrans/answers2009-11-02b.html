 The Government believe that the time is right for the Northern Ireland Assembly to complete the process of devolution by requesting the transfer of policing and justice powers. However, the actual timing of devolution remains for the Assembly itself to decide upon, as set out in section 4 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. Good progress continues to be made towards the completion of devolution and I believe that the financial package set out by the Prime Minister should enable the parties to move forward with the process.</p>

<i> [holding answer 28 October 2009]:</i> Defence&#146;s main effort is Afghanistan and in the very difficult financial climate hard decisions have had to be taken. This has resulted in a reduction to the funds available for this year to our Cadet Forces, and specifically to the Army&#146;s Cadets. This decision has not been taken lightly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="91102w0006.htm_para3"><a name="09110238000393">The Department&#146;s commitment to the Youth agenda remains undiminished as evidenced by our recent response to the Milburn Report where, despite the challenging financial situation, we have accepted in principle the recommendation to ensure that those state school pupils who wish to get involved in Cadets may do so. We are investigating innovative methods of extending cadet provision to state school pupils which include working closely with the Department of Children Schools and Families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="91102w0006.htm_para4"><a name="09110238000394">Financial constraints prevent the Government from meeting this recommendation in full, immediately. However this year, for example, we have delivered an additional six London Challenge Partnerships (Independent School CCFs offering Cadet places to neighbouring state school pupils) and the Air Cadet Organisation plans an annual expansion, targeted at state school pupils, of 700 cadets per year until 2018.</p>

 The provision of good quality living accommodation for both married and single service personnel continues to be a top departmental priority. Decades of under funding means that the standard of service accommodation has lagged behind the expectations of our people. Some housing stock is old.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="91102w0006.htm_para5"><a name="09110238000399">Investment over the last seven years has begun to correct this, but there is much more to be done. The Department plans to invest some &#163;3 billion on accommodation improvement programmes over the next decade. Since 2001, over &#163;200 million has been spent upgrading some 14,000 service family accommodation (SFA) properties to the top standard for condition.</p>

<i> [holding answer 9 September 2009]:</i> The following table gives the numbers of surviving UK Service personnel whose injuries included those coded as a traumatic or surgical amputation, partial or complete, for either upper or lower limbs between 1 April 2006 and 30 September 2009 as a result of operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. This injury code covers injuries ranging from the loss of part of a finger or toe up to the loss of an entire limb or limbs. To indicate the number with severe multiple limb injuries, those classified as &#147;significant multiple amputees&#148; have suffered limb amputations above the wrist or ankle on more than one limb; in other words, they have lost at least two hands or feet. Note that there were no significant multiple amputees arising from operations in Iraq in this period.</p>

A single programme has been established to deliver the VFM agenda, encompassing existing work and initiatives from the OEP and the Public Value Programme. This includes benchmarking of Defence back office costs and a review of MOD assets, where progress will be reported at Pre-Budget Report 2009.

 Some basic humanitarian assistance has been entering Gaza through the crossings from Israel, but the overall flow of goods into Gaza remains severely limited.

On average, the government of Israel allows the transfer of just 60 per cent. of the industrial fuel required per week to operate Gaza&#146;s only power plant at the current maximum capacity of 80 megawatts. The number of trucks carrying humanitarian and commercial goods is routinely restricted to approximately a third of the weekly average before restrictions were tightened.

However, as pirates have been using mother ships to attack shipping further than 200 nautical miles from the Somali coast, the FCO also advises mariners to maintain a high level of vigilance and to exercise extreme caution when anywhere near Somali waters.</p>

 The Bovine TB Eradication Group for England has recently reviewed the approach taken to setting routine TB testing frequencies to a risk based approach as announced in its report published on 8 October. Extending more frequent routine TB testing to more of the country would come at a high cost. As TB is a largely regional issue, concentrated in England in the South West and West Midlands, with large areas in the north and east predominantly clear, this risk based approach is deemed a more proportionate and effective use of resources.</p>

 Neighbourhood policing is central to providing a police service that is responsive to local crime and antisocial behaviour (ASB) concerns.

In December 2008, we introduced the Policing Pledge, which outlines commitments that the police service have made to the public, including minimum response times, holding monthly meetings to understand local concerns and providing regular updates on action taken to deal with those concerns.</p>

Although the decision on a visa application may be made in another location, applicants continue to submit their applications to, and collect their visas from the visa application centre in their country of residence, or the visa application centre designated to handle applications from applicants of their nationality. The registration part of the process can, in many cases, be separated from the decision part, making full use of modern communications systems and our partnerships with VFS Global and CSC Wordbridge.</p>

 The decision on whether to detain or not is made very carefully on a case by case basis. While the UK Border Agency always aims to detain immigration offenders for the shortest period of time possible, the likely duration of detention is dependent on a range of factors, such as the relative difficulty of obtaining the appropriate travel document with which a person&#146;s removal can be effected, or where there is reason to believe that the person will fail to comply with the conditions attached to a grant of temporary admission or release.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="91102w0017.htm_para0"><a name="09110238001595">As an alternative to detention, the introduction of better contact management through the use of physical reporting at reporting centres and police stations together with the use of electronic monitoring (tagging and voice recognition) has allowed the UK Border Agency to maintain contact with individuals at all stages of the asylum process and with those who have breached immigration law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="91102w0017.htm_para1"><a name="09110238001596">The UK has not participated in and has no plans to implement the EU Returns Directive 2008/115/EC. We agree that a collective approach to removal can have advantages. However, we are not persuaded that this Directive delivers the strong returns regime that is required for dealing with irregular migration. Our current practices on the return of illegal third country nationals are broadly in line with the terms of the Directive, but we prefer to formulate our own policy, in line with our stated position on retaining control over conditions of entry and stay.</p>

 Neighbourhood policing is central to providing a police service that is responsive to local crime and antisocial behaviour (ASB) concerns. Since 2002, we have invested heavily to ensure that there is now a neighbourhood policing team in every neighbourhood, including in total more than 13,500 officers and 16,000 PCSOs. The latest British crime survey (BCS) figures released in October 2009 show an improving trend, that, nationally, 50 per cent. of the public now agree that the antisocial behaviour and crime issues that matter locally are being dealt with.</p>

The NHS Constitution has set out the right for staff to have healthy and safe working conditions, one which has no place for bullying, harassment or discrimination. The NHS has taken strong steps to eliminate bullying and harassment in the workplace and all NHS employers are expected to have policies and procedures in place to tackle this.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 21 October 2009]:</i> The Government are fully committed to ensuring that individuals are able to achieve their full potential and ambitions for work.

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="91102w0024.htm_para1"><a name="09110249001057">With this in mind, the Government launched 'Valuing Employment Now: real jobs for people with learning disabilities' on 24 June 2009. Our aspiration is to close the gap between the employment rate for people with learning disabilities and that of the disabled population as a whole.

We are currently exploring how we can ensure that the programme provides the most flexible, responsive and appropriate support for all customers, and to ensure that the funding is focussed on those who need it most, including customers with learning disabilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="91102w0024.htm_para3"><a name="09110249001059">Currently customers are limited to 26 weeks of job coach support.

Work Trials give customers the opportunity to 'try out' work, and also builds employer confidence in their ability to do the job. Work Trials can last from a few days to six weeks and because there is a genuine job vacancy at the end they are a direct route into paid employment. This may be another route in to meaningful work for people with learning disabilities.</p>

 Information on the number and percentage of contracts awarded to small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) in a year is not maintained by the Department for Work and Pensions and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. As part of the DWP Commercial Strategy, the Department tracks centrally the number of SMEs the Department, its agencies and non-departmental public bodies does business with in each financial year and the amount it spends with each supplier. This process does not break these figures down into individual agency or NDPB. In 2008-09 the number of SMEs that had contracts with the Department was 9,212 and the total expenditure with them was &#163;429.7 million or 11.2 per cent. of total DWP procurement expenditure in the year. The latest available figures for 2009-10 are &#163;239.3 million or 11.4 per cent. of total procurement expenditure in the period April to end September 2009.</p>

 In July 2009, The Office for Disability Issues commissioned the Institute of Employment Studies to undertake research examining organisations&#146; responses to the Disability Discrimination Act and the impact of the amendments made to the Act in 2005. This research is investigating how easy employers feel it is to employ people with a range of mental health conditions. The research is due to be completed by March 2010 and we will be comparing the findings with similar research undertaken in 2006 and 2003 to explore changes over time.</p>

On the same principle, the network of benefit delivery centres can, and do, move work around the country on a weekly basis to maximise speed of claim processing. Although benefit delivery centres are in the main linked to regions/countries, such work movement and some centralised functions mean there is not a clear distinction. For example, applications for national insurance numbers are processed in two centres, Glasgow and Isle of Wight, so staff numbers will be included in the Government office region for Scotland and south east respectively.</p>

 The prisoner transfer agreement between the United Kingdom and Libya was one of four agreements in the field of judicial cooperation signed by the United Kingdom and Libya on 17 November 2008. Signature of these agreements is a tangible sign of the normalisation of the relationship between Libya and the United Kingdom and between Libya and the wider international community following its renunciation of international terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.</p>

At present Her Majesty&#146;s Court Service pays &#163;1.2 million pension and national insurance contributions with respect to the Law Lords. For transparency this was transferred to the UK Supreme Court from 1 October. This does not represent any additional cost to the public purse. For the first year we have provided an additional &#163;300,000 to cover transitional set-up costs, this is being met from within existing resources.

 The Adaptation Fund was established under the Kyoto Protocol of the UNFCCC and launched at COP-7 in Marrakech, in 2001. Its aim was to finance concrete adaptation projects and programmes in vulnerable developing countries. The Board of the Adaptation Fund was then established in 2008. The Fund is expected to become operational before the climate change conference in Copenhagen at the end of this year. The Adaptation Fund has a unique mechanism for financing, which is not dependent on contributions from specific countries. Instead, it is financed by a market-based source of funding&#151;a 2 per cent. levy on the proceeds of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which was also established under the Kyoto Protocol. Nevertheless, the UK has been supporting the design and implementation of the Adaptation Fund both as a board member and through provision of &#163;0.5 million start-up funding.</p>
