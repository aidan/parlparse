To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what representations he has received on the impact of the Climate Change Levy on the transport industry.  [94161]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 As part of an ongoing process of dialogue and consultation between Government and business on the Climate Change Levy, I held a meeting with business representatives, including the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, on 20 October 1999.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will list the environmental non-Governmental organisations with which he has held meetings during the past 12 months to discuss the proposal to establish a World Trade Organisation agreement on forest products.  [93834]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 My predecessor, Ministerial colleagues from other Government Departments, officials and I myself have held numerous meetings with environmental and other non-governmental organisations over the past 12 months to discuss the proposed new Round of multilateral trade negotiations in the World Trade Organisation. Proposals for tariff reductions on forest products have been dealt with in these meetings in the context of the United Kingdom and European Union approach to trade liberalisation in a new Round.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w01.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many copies of the Europlanner disc have been created; at what cost; and how have they been distributed.  [95230]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The EuroPlanner (floppy disc) is a practical, self-help tool to help businesses prepare for the euro. Over 105,000 copies of the EuroPlanner have so far been distributed by Business Links, other intermediaries, the Treasury's euro telephone line (08456 01 01 99) and my Department to business to help them prepare their euro strategy. It is also available on the internet (www.connectbestpractice.com) and on a Euro CD ROM. The development and production costs for 155,000 copies of the disc were &#163;109,000.
<P>

<a name="91025w01.htm_para0">My Department launched the EuroPlanner on 23 February in response to requests from UK businesses and Business Support Organisations. It is important that UK firms consider the implications of the single currency and where necessary take steps to prepare. I would encourage British companies to use the EuroPlanner to help them do this.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w01.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will list, by country, the total amount of state aid approved by the Commission since the signing of the Single European Act.  [95407]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Between 1987 and 1997, the Commission approved a total of approximately 861,438 million euros in State aid throughout the EU, of which 430,240.21 million euros was paid to the manufacturing industry.
<P>

<a name="91025w01.htm_para1">These data were compiled from the Commission's surveys on aid to industry across the EU; the most recent being "The Seventh Survey on aid in the EU in the manufacturing and certain other sectors", which was published in March 1999. The Eighth Survey, covering the period 1997-98, has not yet been published. The surveys provide a broad overview on aid granted across the EU, but data on State aid to agriculture, fisheries, coal, steel, transport and the financial services sector are not broken down by country.
<P>

<a name="91025w01.htm_para2">The table sets out the total State aid to the manufacturing industry granted by each member state in millions of euro.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will list the total value of contracts awarded to date in Kosovo since the cessation of hostilities, broken down by nationality of company.  [95405]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Almost all the contracts awarded to date to agencies and companies have been those to meet the immediate humanitarian needs in Kosovo. There is no central register of the multiplicity of such agencies which have won such contracts either through bilateral aid support or through that provided via other organisations such as the United Nations. However, British Trade International, the recently established joint DTI/FCO trade promotion organisation has, in conjunction with the British Office in Pristina, been asked (through the joint private sector Kosovo Taskforce established by the Secretary of State) to put together a list with details of all British companies which have won contracts in Kosovo.
<P>

<a name="91025w01.htm_para3">The most significant of these to date is the concession awarded to a British consortium led by Mott MacDonald to manage the power sector in Kosovo over the next seven

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, pursuant to his answer of 22 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>115</i>, what is the latest position regarding the possible lease of Sombrero Island for the purpose of launching commercial satellites.  [94800]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 Officials from the British National Space Centre remain in contact with the Government of Anguilla providing technical advice and assistance on the outer space aspects of the request by the US company Beal Aerospace to lease Sombrero Island for the purpose of launching commercial satellites. Officials are also helping the Anguillans to assess the probable environmental consequences of the proposed activity. ICF Kaizer have conducted an Environmental Impact Assessment on behalf of Beal and a Planning Inspector has been appointed to advise the Anguillan Government. It is hoped that a public consultation with interested parties will soon be conducted.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 ECGD's support for the project was conditional upon an export licence being obtained.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w01.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 We estimate that about 100,000 parents will take parental leave each year when the rights are fully established in 2004. We have not estimated how many will choose to take parental leave in each of the first five years after the rights come into force. Parental leave is a new right and we do not have enough information to make such detailed estimates.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w01.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Caborn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 October 1999]:</i> I visited Poland from 21 to 23 September. My visit encompassed ministerial meetings, the opening of an all-British trade fair in Warsaw, visits to British businesses, a visit to Krakow to open the new British Council Offices and to support a project run by a British company to recycle the waste from the steel mill in Krakow.




<P>
<P><I>25 Oct 1999 : Column: 658</I><P>

<P>

<a name="91025w01.htm_para4">The main reason for my visit was to raise the profile of British companies in Poland as part of British Trade International's strategy for encouraging more companies to consider the market. However, in meetings with Polish Ministers I also took the opportunity to raise the question of Polish coal exports to the United Kingdom and to underline our support for Poland in the EU accession process.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w01.htm_spnew9"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 October 1999]:</i> Responsibility for ensuring competition laws are not broken lies with the competition authorities, the Office of Fair Trading within the UK or the European Commission for activities which affect trade between member states. I look to these bodies to ensure fair competition, and for those with concerns to put them to the competition authorities for investigation.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w01.htm_wqn10"><B> Mr. Mackinlay: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will set up an independent inquiry into predatory pricing activities by low-cost airlines.  [94709]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w01.htm_spnew10"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 October 1999]:</i> We have no such plans. However, if my hon. Friend has any evidence of predatory pricing activities he should bring it to the attention of the competent authorities. In the UK this is the Director General of Fair Trading, and for activities which affect trade between member states it is the European Commission.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The UK's international nuclear trade, including the export of Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuel, is undertaken strictly within the terms of international agreements on nuclear non proliferation, safeguards and physical protection and is entirely consistent with the UK's obligations in these areas. Very stringent physical protection and safeguards measures are applied to MOX at all time, including during transport, to prevent its theft or diversion to non-peaceful purposes. The Government are satisfied that the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation from the manufacture and use of MOX in Europe and its export to Japan is minimal.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Department received this application on 12 November 1998 and designated it as a major one under the Article 31 procedure of the Planning (Northern Ireland) Order 1991 on 12 March 1999. The Roads Service is actively exploring the options that may be open to the developers to fund or part fund the next stage of the Comber By-Pass. An Environmental Statement in support of the application was submitted on 21 June 1999 and the on-going assessment of this Statement has identified a number of shortcomings that the agent has been asked to address. This information has not yet been received and is of importance because the proposal raises a number of conservation issues which require careful consideration since the site impinges upon the Strangford Lough Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and adjoins an Area of Special Scientific Interest, a proposed Special Protection Area, a Special Area of Conservation and a Ramsar Site. It is too early yet to say when a decision on the application can be made as it may be necessary to hold a public local inquiry into the proposal.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>First, you asked about the volume of traffic on Newtownards Road near the cemetery in Comber, the benefits of a pedestrian crossing at this location and how many pupils are enrolled at Comber Primary and Comber High Schools.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The last comprehensive survey of traffic volumes on Newtownards Road close to the cemetery was carried out in 1996. The survey recorded an annual average 24-hour flow of 12,480 vehicles with a peak hour flow of 1,080 vehicles. A more recent survey of peak hour traffic volumes was carried out on 27 September 1999, when the peak hour flow was found to be 1,250 vehicles. This would equate with an annual average 24-hour traffic flow of 14,500 vehicles.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As regards the provision of a pedestrian crossing at this location, Roads Service carried out a survey of pedestrians and vehicles on Monday 27 September 1999.

In the circumstances, Roads Service has no proposals to provide a pedestrian crossing at this location.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The flow of traffic at this junction has been assessed in the past but, as it is some time since a full appraisal was carried out, we will undertake an appraisal taking account of the volume of traffic, the lengths of traffic queues and the delays experienced.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<a name="91025w04.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Some medicinal and illegal drugs can impair driving ability and its is already an offence to drive while impaired through drugs. The Association of Chief Police Officers is researching suitable training for police to recognise the outward signs of drug taking and to assess driver impairment. The Department and the Home Office are supporting that and the development of roadside screening devices to further assist the police in enforcing the law effectively. However, the effect of drugs, both medicinal and illegal, on driving ability is a very complex issue and, in contrast to alcohol, it is very difficult to correlate directly the level of consumption with impairment of driving. Research is ongoing into the extent of the problem--an essential first step in formulating suitable and effective countermeasures. The Department is also participating in European Union research projects to develop roadside devices to screen for the presence of drugs and to detect impairment in a driver.
<P>

<a name="91025w04.htm_para1">The Department is considering how the risks of driving under the influence of drugs might be publicised. The acknowledged success of the Department's drink drive campaigns was accompanied by effective enforcement and good knowledge of the way in which alcohol impairs driving. That makes such campaigns effective overall because they are authoritative, well targeted and there is a real threat of getting caught. For drugs (both illegal and medicinal), we would need to target any such campaigns towards the precise nature and extent of the problem and would need to give positive advice informed by well based knowledge.
<P>

<a name="91025w04.htm_para2">I understand from the Medicines Control Agency that the current guidelines for pharmaceutical companies dictate that all medicines must comply with European Commission Directive 92/27/EEC on the labelling of medicinal products for human use and on package leaflets. All products have a Summary of Product Characteristics which explains how the medicine acts, how it should be used and any side effects that might be experienced, including a section on the effect of the medicine on the ability to drive. Prescribers are also provided with information on the effects of medicines on the ability to drive in the British National Formulary. This also lists standard pharmacy labels which pharmacists add when dispensing medicines that may affect a patient's ability to drive. Information for patients about medicines, including the effects on the ability to drive, is also provided to patients in Patient Information Leaflets. These should now be supplied with all medicines.
<P>

<a name="91025w04.htm_para3">The information included in the Summary of Product Characteristics, including the effects on the ability to drive, is based on data supplied by pharmaceutical company at the time a product licence is applied for. This may be updated as further information becomes available.

My Department has also set up a sounding board with representatives from local and central Government and the voluntary sector to consider further proposals to give effect to our Manifesto pledge to increase the protection afforded to unintentionally homeless people in priority need. We have also set up a joint liaison committee, the Youth Homelessness Action Partnership, to look specifically at issues affecting homelessness among young people.
<P>

<a name="91025w04.htm_para4">One of the first priorities the Prime Minister set for the Social Exclusion Unit was to report on Rough Sleeping. They identified that rough sleepers' problems and needs span the responsibilities of several central Government Departments. In response to this, a new Ministerial Committee on Rough Sleeping (MCRS), chaired by the Minister for Local Government and the Regions, has been established to ensure effective co-ordination of Government policy on this.
<P>

<a name="91025w04.htm_para5">The Government have also established the Rough Sleepers Unit, which has the tough target of reducing the number of people sleeping rough by two-thirds by 2002. It is directly responsible to the MCRS for progress against the target and has a budget of &#163;145 million over three years. This money is provided from a range of departmental sources (including DETR, DoH, DSS and DfEE) and will be used as a flexible integrated budget to tackle the health, education, training and benefit, as well as housing, aspects of rough sleeping.
<P>

<a name="91025w04.htm_para6">We have also announced a &#163;34 million funding over the next three years for over 250 projects outside London under the New Homelessness Action Programme. Sefton has received &#163;44,034 to provide workers for two projects. Early in the New Year we will be inviting further bids for funding from voluntary organisations in the light of the forthcoming national strategy document on rough sleeping.

 My Department is not aware of any incident involving the named ships that created a risk of marine pollution. However, the ships were involved in incidents in July this year that resulted in a risk to safety. Greenpeace manoeuvred inflatable boats near the ships owned by Pacific Nuclear Transport Limited. The Greenpeace ship had positioned itself in the approach channel to Barrow. Its crew did not provide information on their intentions, despite several requests that they do so. Without any clear indication of Greenpeace's intentions, there was concern that their activities could result in injury or loss of life. My Department's Maritime and Coastguard Agency therefore issued a direction requiring the M/V Greenpeace to leave specified areas of the UK's territorial sea. We cancelled the direction once there was no longer a risk to safety in the UK territorial sea.

 UK legislation requires ship operators to provide my Department with information on dangerous and polluting cargoes, including radioactive material, carried by ships calling at UK ports. It also requires ship operators to report incidents to HM Coastguard. These requirements give effect to international rules adopted through the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and to an EC directive. We cannot require ships that pass through UK waters without calling at a UK port to provide us with information except in accordance with IMO approved schemes. Any such requirement would conflict with the navigational rights and freedoms enjoyed by foreign ships according to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982, to which the UK is a party. Information on the number of ships passing through the Irish Sea without calling at a UK port is not available.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, Keith Hill, has asked Lawrie Haynes, the Chief Executive of the Highways Agency, to reply to your recent Parliamentary question about the timing for the opening of the M60 between Denton and Middleton.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The date for opening the whole of the Denton to Middleton section of the Manchester Outer Ring Road is Summer 2000. However, the Highways Agency is considering the possibility of opening some individual sections earlier. Whether it would be practical to do so is dependent upon the contractors' programmes for completion of the outstanding works. This will become clearer towards the end of the year. Traffic impact on the local road network is also a major consideration and the Agency is in discussion with the relevant local authorities about this.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the danger to rail travellers of the increased number of cases of broken rails since 1994-95; and what action he plans to take.  [95173]<P>

<P>
<a name="91025w07.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Broken rails result from a range of causes including rail age, increased traffic density and particular additional freight carriage. The general upward trend in the number of broken rails demonstrates that infrastructure maintenance, inspection and track replacement efforts must be increased. HSE's Railway Inspectorate (HMRI) has recently ordered Railtrack to define an urgent action plan to improve track maintenance and inspection to significantly reduce the number of broken rails across the network. Extreme damage to rails could potentially lead to train derailment and HMRI take

 The Government's freight grants scheme is designed to assist companies in moving goods from road to rail where payment is justified by the environmental benefits. Capital grants are available towards the cost of new or refurbished freight facilities, including terminals, wherever they might be located. The Highways Agency has a Memorandum of Understanding with Railtrack to facilitate effective co-operation and understanding between the two organisations, and one of the areas of mutual interest mentioned in the Memorandum is the development of opportunities for the transfer of freight from road to rail through the provision of interchange facilities with access directly or indirectly from the trunk road network, including motorways.

<a name="91025w08.htm_para2">The Government response is the first stage of the process to identify, develop and implement the best possible management option for radioactive wastes--one which commands widespread public support. It sets out the Government's commitment to a comprehensive policy for long-lived radioactive wastes, developed in an open and transparent way on the basis of widespread consultation to ensure the maximum possible public acceptance. The next stage will be full consultation on the management options for radioactive waste. Subsequent steps will need to be considered in the light of the results from this consultation. There is no question at this stage of looking at the potential suitability of any particular sites. This would only be necessary if, in the light of consultation, underground disposal were the chosen option. In any case, this would be some years away.
<P>

<a name="91025w08.htm_para3">The Government have also accepted that it is possible that at least some plutonium may be declared a waste in the future. The response therefore also sets out our intention to consult with BNFL, British Energy and UKAEA on the likely future uses for the UK plutonium stockpile.
<P>

<P>

<a name="91025w08.htm_para6">I have also today published the 1998 UK Radioactive Waste Inventory. Copies of the summary report have been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="91025w08.htm_para7">The Inventory was jointly commissioned by Nirex and my Department. It describes all stocks of waste held in the UK at 1 April 1998, together with predictions of wastes arising into the future. There has been an increase of around 12 per cent. in the total volume of wastes in stock since the last inventory in 1994 due to the continued accumulation of intermediate and high level wastes in the absence of disposal facilities. However, the predictions of future arising have been revised downwards since the last report (17 per cent. for high level waste; 26 per cent. for intermediate and 2 per cent. for low level waste) due to developments in waste conditioning, better estimates of volume and some changes in the scale and nature of future operations.
<P>

<a name="91025w08.htm_para8">The UK is one of the few countries where such information is made publicly available. Organisations involved with the nuclear industry, and relevant non-governmental organisations, will receive a free copy on compact disk.

 Maintenance of public order is primarily a matter for chief officers of police. The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) has established a millennium co-ordinating committee to ensure the readiness of forces and continuity of service over the millennium period. I understand that all forces have millennium planning teams in place to ensure

business continuity and contingency planning for this period. Arrangements are in place for mutual aid between forces should this become essential.
<P>

<a name="91025w09.htm_para1">The infrastructure preparedness, supply chains and business continuity plans of police forces in England and Wales have been independently assessed by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary using a process based on Action 2000 methodology.

<P>

<a name="91025w09.htm_para2">A police information centre will operate at Scotland Yard on 31 December, reporting to the President of ACPO. In addition, the Home Office's own millennium operating regime will ensure that Ministers are fully appraised of developments on the night.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w09.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Last year the Government announced that the police service in England and Wales would receive an additional &#163;1.24 billion over three years from 1999-2000. Our plans allow for police expenditure to increase by around 2.8 per cent. in 2000-01. No final decisions have been taken about the allocation of funding to individual forces for the coming financial year. We expect to announce provisional allocations towards the end of the year.
<P>

<a name="91025w09.htm_para4">Police recruitment is not centrally managed from the Home Office. It is a matter for individual chief constables.

 The Department has been in extensive consultation with the Local Government Association, the Association of Local Government and a variety of local authorities about the new support arrangements for asylum seekers in Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Bill which are due to come into effect in April 2000, and the statutory interim arrangements in Schedule 8 of the Bill which are due to come into effect shortly after Royal Assent.
<P>

<a name="91025w09.htm_para5">For the statutory interim arrangements, the Government have invited local government to devise a voluntary dispersal scheme which will enable asylum seekers to be dispersed to cluster areas around the country so that no single local authority bears a disproportionate burden. The statutory interim arrangements will underpin this scheme. The statutory interim arrangements also include provisions which will enable dispersal to take place if there is no voluntary scheme in operation.
<P>

<a name="91025w09.htm_para6">From April 2000, the new support arrangements will enable the Department to provide support in cluster areas around the country and to disperse to those cluster areas asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute and who claim the full support package.
<P>

<a name="91025w09.htm_para7">For the period of the statutory interim arrangements, local authorities will be able to claim up to &#163;150 per week for single adults and up to &#163;220 per week for families who are being supported. When the new support arrangements are implemented, the Home Office will bear the costs of the provision of support (including accommodation, vouchers, cash, interpreter services and travel).

<P><I>25 Oct 1999 : Column: 685</I><P>
The Road Traffic Act 1988 contains two offences of causing death.

 We have no current plans to change the definition of the offence of "careless driving" under section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. Research is, however, currently being conducted into the way in which cases involving "bad" driving proceed through the criminal justice system. The results of that research will help to establish whether any changes in the law are desirable.

<a name="91025w10.htm_para4">Since July a number of measures have been introduced to improve the service offered by the Immigration and Nationality Enquiry Bureau (INEB). Significant numbers of new staff are now available to answer calls, a support team undertakes follow-up work generated by calls, and there have been improvements in training staff in call handling techniques and the mentoring of new and existing staff. In recent weeks the service provided by INEB has improved substantially with around 4,000 calls a day being answered (75 per cent. of incoming calls). Further changes are being considered to improve performance.

 There are 83,796 cases held in the Work in Progress Store of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate. This is a reduction of over 26,000 cases since July. Of the cases held in the Work in Progress Store, 12,654 have been outstanding for more than six months, 32,206 have been outstanding for more than one year, and 38,936 have been outstanding for more than two years. A number of measures have been taken to tackle the backlog, including the creation of the After Entry Clearance Team, which has had a major impact on the backlog of the after entry case backlog.

 The primary responsibility for tackling crime falls to police forces in conjunction with the local crime and reduction partnerships, established by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. The policing plans and the strategies developed by the partnerships will deal explicitly with rural crime where that is a significant local issue. Some parts of the &#163;400 million Crime Reduction Programme are likely to be diverted to crime in rural areas. There is no other Home Office provision dedicated exclusively to rural crime.

 The spending on official publications since May 1997 by the Home Office, apart from the Prison Service; which includes the costs incurred by the Department in publishing, preparation, production and purchase of copies for official use; was approximately &#163;4.6 million in 1997-98, &#163;4.3 million in 1998-99 and &#163;2.5 million to date in 1999-2000. The figures exclude the cost of publications produced for internal use. Where the Department makes use of a private sector publisher, the publishing, printing and design costs are generally met by the publisher as part of their acceptance of the risks, of publication.

 The timetable for implementation of the Criminal Records Bureau is under review. I shall make an announcement shortly. We have received some representations calling for the Bureau to be brought into operation as early as possible, and that is my intention. The Government have considered very carefully the many representations that we have received arguing for charges to be waived for checks carried out by the Bureau in the case of volunteers. This presents substantial problems of principle and would inevitably increase costs either for the public purse or for other applicants for certificates. But the concerns which have been expressed have increased our determination that the cost of certificates from the Bureau should be kept as low as possible. The cost of certificates has been previously estimated at between &#163;5 and &#163;10 depending on type of certificate.

 I am pleased to announce that the last operational UK anti-personnel mines--the HB 876 sub-munition to the RAF's JP 233 weapon system--were destroyed on 19 October. We have completed the UK's destruction programme over three years ahead of the timeframe laid down in the Ottawa Convention. The destruction programme was accelerated to demonstrate to the world the UK's clear and unequivocal commitment to the Ottawa Convention. As provided for in Article 3 of the Ottawa Convention, the UK will continue to hold the minimum necessary numbers of anti-personnel mines for the development of and training in mine detection, mine clearance, or mine destruction techniques.

<P>
<a name="91025w12.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The decision to end the field gun competition runs parallel with the decision to end the Royal Tournament. In part this is because the event cannot easily be replicated in a suitable public venue outside Earl's Court, but also because it accounted for more than half the personnel resources used at the Tournament. It is recognised that the field gun competition is an event with 



<P>
<P><I>25 Oct 1999 : Column: 696</I><P>
much audience loyalty, and is held in special regard by Service personnel, particularly those who have participated in the past. It has also been a tremendous spectacle for over 90 years, and it was fitting that the final run should take place in the centenary year of the action it commemorated.
<P>

<a name="91025w12.htm_para1">The event was, however, no longer fully representative of the Royal Navy or its contemporary activities. Consequently, the Royal Navy is keen to look to the future and concentrate on supporting events that more accurately reflect the training and operational activities of the Service in the next millennium.

<P>
<a name="91025w12.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Royal Tournament has made a major contribution over the years to British life and to the Service charities. I therefore pay tribute to the organisers and participants who have given such great pleasure to so many.
<P>

<a name="91025w12.htm_para2">The Royal Tournament had been under scrutiny for some time. In part this was because the event had lost money in recent years--for example, it lost &#163;400,000 last year--and this made the viability of the event questionable, particularly given its charitable status. More fundamentally, however, the format of the event could send only a limited message about the role and operational capabilities of the Armed Forces in the modern world. Moreover, the audience had reduced in recent years and as a result the Tournament neither informed the public nor attracted potential recruits to the extent we would have wished. Despite failing to meet our needs, it still placed a very considerable demand on our personnel, a minimum of 30,000 man-days per annum. This was hard to justify in the light of operational commitments and overstretch. Such considerations led the Services themselves to conclude that the Royal Tournament should end in order to help reduce commitments.
<P>

<a name="91025w12.htm_para3">We have thought very carefully as to how we might bring about necessary change while preserving the best of the old Tournament. Next year a one-off event, the Royal Military Tattoo 2000, will be mounted against the spectacular backdrop of Horse Guards Parade. The Tattoo, which has the theme "Defence of the Realm: past, present and future", will involve 1,200 men and women from the Services, 75 per cent. of whom will be musicians. It will be a dramatic 90-minute show, recounting with pride 1,000 years of military history, whilst also celebrating the present and looking to the future. The Tattoo will combine imaginative staging, state-of-the-art technology, pageantry, son et lumiere, lasers, fireworks and, I understand, the largest video screen to be seen in Europe. It will be held during the period 10-15 July 2000 and the planning team is working hard to ensure that the event is a great success.
<P>

<a name="91025w12.htm_para4">A military Tattoo will continue to be held in London from 2001 onwards. Again using the spectacular backdrop of Horse Guards Parade, the Tattoo will build on the traditional pageantry that has been such a popular element of the Royal Tournament over the years and a special feature of London in Summer. A military festival will also be held outside London at varying locations that will allow the Armed Forces to showcase their equipment and 



<P>
<P><I>25 Oct 1999 : Column: 697</I><P>
to demonstrate their capability in an exciting and modern way. The festival will be based on existing and successful Service events starting in 2001 with the Royal Navy's International Festival of the Sea at Portsmouth. It will last for a whole day, enabling spectators to see a wide range of military activities, view the latest military equipment, meet personnel and participate in interactive displays in a way that is not possible with the existing Royal Tournament format.

<a name="91025w13.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The agreement announced on 28 April is to be formalised by extending the scope of the UK-US Master Information Exchange Memorandum of Understanding (MIEM). The new agreement is an Information Exchange Annex entitled: "UK-US Master Information Exchange Memorandum of Understanding Annex Concerning Persian Gulf Veterans Health Research". It is not envisaged that the agreement will lead to the formation of new working groups or committees. Work has been and will continue to be taken forward by arrangements already in place. The main participants will be the UK Ministry of Defence, the US Department of Defense, the US Department of Veterans Affairs and the US Department of Health and Human Services. Non-governmental research institutes, academic departments, other organisations and individuals will be involved as appropriate.
<P>

<a name="91025w13.htm_para2">Prior to this agreement there were no formal agreements between the US and UK governments on Gulf veterans' illnesses. However, there has been a close history of co-operation between the two governments on Gulf veterans' illnesses matters.

The second meeting of the Air Force Board was held on 14 July 1999 and the only item on the Board's agenda was the officer branch structure review.

Although not the responsibility of this Department, we are aware of two officers who are studying privately in the UK. Such studies are not inconsistent with the EU's Common Position. Information on the location of these establishments has been withheld under Exemption 4 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

 There are no plans to contract out the airbridge service to and from the Falkland Islands. The Ministry of Defence will of course look at any unsolicited proposals from commercial airlines, to determine best value for money. The examination of previous unsolicited proposals did, however, conclude that, taking into account the operational requirement to retain the Royal Air Force Tristars, the use of military aircraft was the most cost-effective solution.

It imposes no limitations on other military activities in outer space.

 The Service Families Task Force works across Government to tackle the problems caused by the mobile lifestyle of Service personnel and their families. It works with other Departments to address problems identified by the Service Families Associations. It has achieved some impressive results. These include: making it easier for Service spouses to claim Jobseeker's Allowance in the UK; the new DfEE Code of Practice on Schools Admission taking account of the particular needs of Service families; Service representation on Schools Admission Forums in areas where there are large populations of Service children; extra money for pre-five education for Service children in Northern Ireland; and 24 schemes in areas with large numbers of Service families to encourage dentists to take on more NHS patients. Work on other issues is continuing.

 The draft scheme under the Pastoral Measure 1983 proposing the closure of the church of St. John, Whitby was, as with all such schemes, served on, inter alia, the relevant incumbent, team vicar, pcc, archdeacon and rural dean. It was also published in the Whitby Gazette and Middlesbrough Evening Gazette and displayed on the door of the churches of St. Mary, Whitby; St. John, Whitby; and St. Hilda, Whitby. It was open to anyone to make representations and the statement of 21 September 1999 to which my hon. 



<P>
<P><I>25 Oct 1999 : Column: 708</I><P>
Friend refers sets out who made representations in favour of the scheme and who made representations against. My hon. Friend will have noted that there were views for and against among Whitby churchgoers. An earlier identical draft scheme (which had to be withdrawn when procedural flaws in the diocesan consultations came to light) was the subject of a visit to Whitby by a Sub-Committee of the Commissioners' Pastoral Committee. On that occasion, the Sub-Committee met the incumbent, the Whitby pcc and the St. John's congregation.
<P>

<a name="91025w16.htm_para0">All views were most carefully taken into account but ultimately the Commissioners concluded that the case for declaring St. John's redundant had not been made as, in their view, it was required as a chapel of ease in the centre of Whitby.
<P>

<a name="91025w16.htm_para1">The Commissioners' Pastoral Committee provided, in effect, a place of appeal against the proposal by the diocese of York to declare this church redundant. The Pastoral Measure 1983 provides no procedure for appeal against a decision by the Commissioners not to proceed with a draft scheme but the diocese is free to promote fresh proposals for pastoral re-organisation in Whitby.

 I visited Kosovo on 24-25 August to assess need and plan the shift of the Department for International Development's (DFID) assistance from an emergency to a longer-term programme. The overall message that I received was one of cautious optimism. We found there had been steady progress in rehabilitation, although much remained to be done. We emphasised to UNMIK and the EC the importance of moving quickly and enabling the Kosovars to take on a bigger role in the reconstruction effort. We continue to work with the international community and the local population to help achieve this. Our operations are now in transition to a longer-term programme of assistance. My officials will visit the region early next month to take this process forward.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the timing of the transfer of cash management from the Bank of England to the Debt Management Office.  [95866]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w16.htm_spnew7"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced on 6 May 1997 that the functions of debt management and cash management would be transferred from the Bank of England to the Treasury. The UK Debt Management Office (DMO) was established on 1 April 1998 and took over debt management from that date. The Government's debt management plans for 1999-2000 which were published in the Debt Management Report in March 1999 anticipated that cash management would be transferred from the Bank to the DMO during 1999-2000. This transfer, when complete, will separate the Bank's monetary policy operations from the DMO's debt and cash management operations. This will avoid any perceptions of conflicts of interest between the two operations, and further deliver the Government's policy of predictability and transparency in debt management.
<P>

<a name="91025w16.htm_para6">The transfer of cash management from the Bank to the DMO during 1999-2000 will be effected on a phased basis. The phasing is designed to avoid placing undue requirements on the markets in the period before and immediately after the change to the Year 2000 date.
<P>

<a name="91025w16.htm_para7">From 15 November, the DMO will become accountable for the new Debt Management Account, which will take over from the Gilt-Edged Official Operations Account as the Treasury account for debt (and later) cash management operations. During January 2000, the DMO will start to issue Treasury bills from the Debt Management Account. During February, the DMO intends to undertake a limited range of bilateral transactions with counterparties. From the end of March 2000, full responsibility for managing the government's daily cash position will be transferred from the Bank to the DMO.
<P>

<a name="91025w16.htm_para8">In order to enable the DMO to start the phased introduction of these cash management operations from 15 November, I have today laid before Parliament revised Treasury Bill regulations SI 1999-2907 and made a Commencement Order SI 1999-2908 (C.76) under paragraph 3 of Schedule 26 of the Finance Act 1998. Taken together, these statutory instruments will enable the Debt Management Office to begin accounting for its debt

and cash management operations through the new Debt Management Account, which will be subject to NAO audit. The Gilt-edged Official Operations Account is currently used to bring debt management operations to account. The Commencement Order will also provide for the transfer of the debt assets of the Gilt-edged Official Operations Account to the Debt Management Account.
<P>

<a name="91025w16.htm_para9">The Executive Agency Framework Document for the DMO has also been revised to take account of the transfer of the cash management function to the DMO. Copies of the revised Framework Document have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament.

 No decision has been taken on whether to introduce a tax on the use of pesticides.
<P>

<a name="91025w17.htm_para0">Research commissioned by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions on a possible tax or charge on pesticides was published on 24 March focusing on various design options for a charge scheme or tax, and attempting to evaluate the potential impact. Views were invited on the issues raised in the research and this consultation exercise closed on 24 June. The Government are considering the findings of the research project and the views expressed in the consultation exercise in deciding how best to proceed.

We do not, at the moment, notify forest land sales directly to the public. However we are in the process of reviewing our policy on community participation and involvement and are considering ways in which sales might be notified to local people. Of course when land is offered for sale on the open market it is advertised widely by our selling agents.

 Tackling Europe's organised crime problem effectively means that we have to ensure that police officers are properly trained and encouraged to co-operate with forces in other countries. We see the role of the European Police College, which will start off as a network of existing national training institutes, as fulfilling these functions by supporting the establishment of a common approach to tackling transnational organised crime, and by drawing together work already being carried out by individual Member States on training police officers to tackle organised crime effectively. We envisage that, over time, those trained by the college will form a Europe-wide body of expertise about European policing and cross border operations. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, together with colleagues in other Member States, will take forward the work on establishing the College.

 As a consequence of the new constitutional arrangements under the Scotland Act 1998, I have approved a reallocation of certain functions of the Secretary of State for Scotland to other Ministers of the Crown with appropriate functional responsibilities.

One of these is the transfer to the Home Secretary of the Secretary of State for Scotland's functions in relation to the issuing of warrants for the

 We continue to see a case for reforming the industrial injuries scheme so that it reflects better the needs of today's labour market and improves incentives for prevention and rehabilitation. Initial discussions with key stakeholders confirmed our belief that there is scope for reform. However, much work remains to be done to decide the best way forward. Against the background of the current major programme of reform to other parts of the Social Security system the work cannot be completed quickly.

 The Benefits Agency is meeting most of its targets for the payment of benefits. In the recent past, some delays in paying benefits have been caused by complications arising from the introduction of the National Insurance Recording System (NIRS2). The majority of problems have now been resolved. Regrettably claims for Widows Benefit are still affected and the contingency arrangements in place take longer than normal to process.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w19.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 We are committed to reducing fraud and error in the benefits system. One key part of our strategy is to develop stronger links between the Benefits Agency (BA) and local authorities (LAs). Most recently, following testing of the electronic transfer of information between the BA and LA in Lewisham, we started to extend this facility to other LAs. Fourteen LAs are now piloting the system which we aim to roll out nationally from next April. In Lewisham, the evaluation indicated significant reductions in processing times and overpayments. We have also introduced a national liaison service level agreement (SLA) and a specific fraud SLA, both of which are mandatory on BA and strongly endorsed by the LA Associations.
<P>

<a name="91025w19.htm_para0">&#163;6 million has been allocated to BA Area Directors to fund joint working initiatives which identify an activity or programme that enhances the liaison between the BA and the LA and through that liaison will combat fraud and error in the benefit system.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what measures his Department is taking to help people move from welfare into work.  [93770]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w19.htm_spnew11"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 In the last two years we have launched an ambitious series of welfare-to-work reforms. We have invested almost &#163;4 billion in New Deals, representing an unprecedented assault on worklessness. We are on target to meet our manifesto commitment to help 250,000 young people move from welfare into work, with 135,000 young people into jobs by the end of July. Our reforms are putting work at the heart of the benefit system.

 We aim to enable the first stakeholder pension schemes to be set up from April 2001.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Gross costs and potential numbers affected are supplied by the Government Actuary's Department. An explanation of the method for calculating gross costs of Additional Pension is given in the Government Actuary's Department publication 'National Insurance Fund: Long Term Financial Estimates', Appendix D (paragraphs 14.39 to 14.45), available in the House of Commons Library.<P>

2. Precise estimates of net costs are not available.<P>

3. Estimates of numbers affected assume that all widows and widowers have some SERPS entitlement although in reality there will be some who do not. Cases where the widower is over State pension age but the deceased partner is under State pension age are included in the estimates. These will both tend to overestimate the numbers affected.<P>

4. Gross costs are rounded to the nearest &#163;10 million, and are in 1999-2000 price terms. Potential numbers affected are rounded to the nearest 10,000.<P>

5. Estimates assume average earnings growth from 1999 onwards of 1.5 per cent. per year above prices. The State Second Pension and Welfare Reform Bill changes are not taken into account in these figures. <P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. In order to model option (iii), it is necessary to make further critical assumptions about the current regime for contracting out of SERPS. If this were to cease at the same time that SERPS stops accruing, there would be a significant effect on private pension provision although highly dependent on the behavioural response of individuals and employers. Alternatively, if contracted out rebates continued to be available, there would be a large incentive for those who had previously been in SERPS to take advantage of the rebates, at significant extra cost to the public finances. Again this would depend on behavioural responses, unless private second pensions were made compulsory. The estimates in the table are based on assumptions which avoid the need to model behavioural responses ie those who are already contracted out continue to receive their rebates, whereas those in SERPS have no replacement second pension once SERPS accruals cease. This is not a sustainable set of assumptions in policy terms, but does provide a basis for answering the question as set out.<P>

2. The estimates have been arrived at using the DSS's PENSIM model. PENSIM is a dynamic microsimulation model which projects future pensioners' incomes on the basis of past labour market and pensions information. Because the model is dependent on the assumptions used and the cohort sampled to generate the work and pensions histories, it is primarily a tool to compare policy options rather than to project the future course of pensioners' incomes with accuracy. Results so far into the future, even of a comparative nature, must be treated as broad brush.<P>

3. The quintiles have been derived by dividing each income distribution in to five equal sized groups in ascending order of income size. The first quintile contains the fifth of the distribution with lowest incomes while the fifth quintile contains the fifth with highest incomes.<P>





4. The income figures given are on a benefit unit basis. Therefore, the income of couples is that of both members of the couple combined.<P>

5. Figures are expressed in 1999 prices rounded to the nearest ten pence.<P>

6. Earnings indexation of the minimum income guarantee is assumed. The earnings assumption in the PENSIM model is 1.5 per cent. per year above inflation.<P>

7. The State Second Pension is assumed to be introduced in 2002.<P>

8. The suggested age addition to the Basic State Pension refers to three quarters of the gap between the full basic state pension and the maximum minimum income guarantee of a single person aged 80. It is assumed to be introduced in the year 2000. Under this option, the year 2000 also marks the end of all new SERPS accruals. Existing SERPS entitlements continue to be paid. <P>

 Only pension schemes which are not themselves able to pay a pension require their members to take pension benefits in the form of an annuity, so as to guarantee a pension income throughout retirement. We propose that this should also apply to stakeholder pensions. We will consider whether there is a case for changing the present age 75 limit for annuity purchase as part of the review of personal pension income withdrawal being undertaken by the Inland Revenue.

 We are committed to maintaining Disability Living Allowance, the main disability benefit for children, as a national, universal benefit. We are making specific improvements to help children with severe disabilities: a clause within the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill, which is currently before Parliament, extends entitlement to the higher rate mobility component of Disability Living Allowance to 3 and 4 year olds. This will help an additional 8,000 children from April 2001.
<P>

<a name="91025w22.htm_para1">From April 2001 the new Disability Income Guarantee will provide extra help within Income Support premiums for families with severely disabled children getting the highest rate of the care component of Disability Living Allowance.

Estimates by age band comparable with the aggregate estimates published in September could be provided only at disproportionate costs. The table provides a breakdown, by age band, of raw estimates with no attempt to correct for data imperfections.

<P>

<a name="91025w22.htm_para6">It improves the comitology system in three ways. Firstly, it increases democratic control over the process by giving an enhanced scrutiny role to the European Parliament. Secondly, it simplifies the system by reducing the number of committee types from five to three.
<P>

<a name="91025w22.htm_para7">Thirdly, it takes an important step towards making the comitology system more transparent. For example, the Commission will for the first time be required to publish a complete list of comitology committees.

 The Rambouillet Agreements on Kosovo were presented to the FRY/Serbian delegation and the Kosovo Albanian delegation on 22 February, after two and a half weeks of intensive negotiation. Both sides agreed to attend a second round of talks to discuss implementation of the agreements. However, on the first day of the second round of talks, in Paris on 15 March, the FRY/Serbian delegation presented their own proposals for a Kosovo agreement. The Contact Group (the Governments of the UK, US, France, Germany, Italy and Russia) took the unanimous view that only technical adjustments to the draft agreements presented at Rambouillet could be considered. The proposals presented by Belgrade amounted to an extensive and unacceptable revision of the draft agreements presented at Rambouillet.

<a name="91025w22.htm_para10">On 3 June, President Milosevic and the Serbian Parliament accepted an agreement, presented by the EU and Russian special envoys, which specified the principles for a resolution of the crisis in Kosovo, notably: the end of violence and repression; withdrawal of all FRY/Serbian forces; deployment of international civil and security presences in Kosovo; and return of refugees and displaced persons. The agreement also called for a political process, taking full account of the Rambouillet accords, to provide substantial self-government for Kosovo.

 Article 60 (2) [ex Article 73g (2)] of the EC Treaty is not a power to implement sanctions but an exception to the rule that all restrictions on movement of capital and on payments between member states and member states and third countries (Article 56) should be prohibited: Article 60 (2) permits such measures in certain circumstances. There is limited power to implement unilateral sanctions under domestic legislation. There is an application for Judicial Review relating to the scope and meaning of Article 60 pending before the High Court. We are considering its position with regard to that application.

 The Foreign Policy Centre is an independent organisation and has received no money from the Foreign Office. The Foreign Office welcomes ideas from outside organisations on all areas of its work. It is established practice for Foreign Office Officials and Ministers to have contact with policy institutes and NGOs, to consider their views when developing policy and to contribute to the debates initiated by them. Policy institutes and NGOs can also influence policy through their contributions to a wider public debate. The nature of these contacts means that it is not possible to assess the influence of one particular policy institute in isolation from other institutes and NGOs.

 The EU Code of Conduct establishes criteria which are to be applied to export licence applications covering all goods on the UK Military List, and dual-use goods where there are grounds for believing that the end-user will be the armed forces or internal security forces. Licences to export arms and other goods whose export is controlled for strategic reasons are issued by the Trade and Industry Secretary acting through the Export Control Organisation of the Department of Trade and Industry, which circulates all relevant applications to other Departments with an interest, as determined by those Departments in line with their policy responsibilities, including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Ministry of Defence and the Department of International Development. All of the above Departments therefore have a role in implementing the Code of Conduct.

<a name="91025w24.htm_para7">The meeting of the CFSP Working Group on Conventional Arms Exports (COARM) on 21 September agreed the text of the first annual report on the operation of the Code of Conduct since its adoption on 8 June 1998. The report summarises member states' experiences of the Code, and gives a detailed account of practical steps taken to support the operation of the Code and priorities for future action. A meeting of the Council of Ministers on 11 October took note of the report and decided to publish it in the Official Journal of the European Communities.

 <i>[holding answer 19 October 1999]:</i> New Deal exists to get long-term unemployed people off benefit and into work. New Deal for Young People has been successful in doing this for 135,000 young people. In those cases where a young person reaches the end of their New Deal option and has still not obtained a job, they will enter a follow-through period and start a new claim to Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) whilst engaging in intensive job search activity with the assistance of their personal adviser.

 The qualifying marks for Level 4 of the Key Stage 2 English SATs in the last three years were 1999--48 marks, 1998--51 marks and 1997--52 marks.
<P>

<a name="91025w26.htm_para2">The level thresholds are the number of marks needed to achieve a specific level in the National Curriculum tests at Key Stages 2 and 3. The level setting procedures are the final stage of the test development process. The level-setting exercise is in two stages and draws on statistical data, from pre-testing and from a sample of live tests, and expert judgments made by test developers, teachers and markers concerning the difficulty of the test and the quality of pupils answers.
<P>

<a name="91025w26.htm_para3">The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) is responsible for setting and maintaining the standards in the tests, and the level thresholds are designed to ensure that standards remain constant from year to year. For this reason the thresholds do not normally remain the same each year but change in response to the relative difficulty of the tests. They have changed in every year since the tests started in 1995.
<P>

<a name="91025w26.htm_para4">In view of debate over the level thresholds this year, the Secretary of State for Education and Employment established an independent panel, with cross-party representation nominated by the shadow Secretary of State for Education and Employment and the Liberal Democrats' education spokesman.
<P>

<a name="91025w26.htm_para5">The independent panel reported their findings in July. The panel was convinced that the concerns about the arrangements for setting, and maintaining the standards of the tests were without foundation. It was their view that the current method of setting standards for the National

<P><I>25 Oct 1999 : Column: 745</I><P>

<a name="91025w26.htm_para6">Ranges are given because the introduction of a new data source in 1994-95 made it difficult to measure non-completion, under existing definitions, accurately.

"Non-completion" covers those who leave full-time and sandwich first degree courses for various reasons, including exam failure, but students who failed their final examinations are not separately identified.The Department is currently working with the higher education funding bodies in the UK to calculate sector-level non-completion rates which will be extended to cover all UK higher education institutions, and which take into account the wider variety of patterns of attendance of students, including changing courses or institutions, repeating years or leaving higher education for a year or more before continuing their studies.

 As we announced in the White Paper "Modernising Social Services", independent fostering agencies (IFAs) will be brought into the regulatory framework and will have to be registered and inspected by the new Commissions for Care Standards (CCSs). This will of course be subject to the introduction of appropriate legislation. The National Standards for Foster Care will be used as a basis for developing new regulatory standards for the CCSs. As an interim measure the Department is planning to introduce a voluntary accreditation scheme for IFAs.

 Guidance on standards of business conduct for National Health Service staff including when to declare an interest when recommending products is set out in Health Service Guidance (93)5.

 When I visited Cornwall in August, the dualling of the A30 between Bodmin and India Queens was raised with me on a number of occasions.

 The European Commission has yet to approve the Single Programme Documents, the framework by which EU Structural Funds are delivered, for each of the country's nine regions. Consequently, it is too early to estimate a breakdown of EU Agenda 2000 funding on the arts. In terms of EU Structural Funds, sport is an ineligible activity.

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 19 October 1999]:</i> I am advised by the British Museum that the stone is an oolitic limestone and therefore meets the original contract specification.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w30.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 I am advised by the British Museum that in line with European procurement regulations, the contract called for an oolitic limestone (Portland Stone from the basebed or similar). The rebuilding of the south portico is an exceptional example of architectural reconstruction, demanding some 60 massive blocks for the columns and pilasters. The contractor advised the Museum that stone of the required 



<P>
<P><I>25 Oct 1999 : Column: 758</I><P>
quality and size could not be procured in sufficient quantity from Portland. Another oolitic limestone, Anstrude Roche Claire, was therefore selected.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what assessment was made of the visual properties and resistance to weathering and atmospheric pollution of alternative stone to Portland stone; prior to varying the specifications of the restoration of the south portico of the British Museum; and if he will make a statement.  [94444]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w30.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 October 1999]:</i>I am advised by the British Museum that there has been no variation to the specification, and the stone is fully compliant with the contract. The visual properties of the stone were assessed and approved by the Museum, its professional team and project monitors. The technical characteristics have been assessed by an independent body, and the Museum commissioned its own report. The courtyard will be under a new roof, so none of the new stone, neither the 900 tonnes of Portland Stone that is being used on the project, nor the Anstrude Roche Claire, will be subject to the same weathering as the original.

<P>
<a name="91025w30.htm_wqn11"><B> Mr. Mackinlay: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w30.htm_spnew11"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 October 1999]:</i> I am advised by the British Museum that there are minor differences in the visual properties and resistance to weathering and atmospheric pollution of the French Limestone. However, English Heritage has accepted that the stone is adequate. The stone will be in a covered courtyard, and therefore protected against the weathering effects of wind, rain and atmospheric pollution.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w30.htm_spnew12"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 October 1999]:</i> The stonework in question is being carried out on the South Portico of the Museum's inner courtyard. This portico was demolished in the 1870s and is being completely rebuilt. I am advised by the British Museum that the specification was for "oolitic limestone" (Portland Stone from the basebed or similar). The stone that is being used for the main body of the portico is Anstrude Roche Claire. This is an oolitic limestone of the Jurassic period, as is Portland Stone. It therefore complies fully with the specification and is not an alternative. The Museum has been working closely with the Heritage bodies throughout and notified them about the selection of Anstrude Roche Claire in June. English Heritage has accepted that the Anstrude Roche Claire is adequate. We inquired about the choice of stone in August.

<P>

<a name="91025w31.htm_para0">The Chairs are now considering the appointment of members to the Consortiums. We expect that all the Consortiums will have held their first meetings before the end of the year. In London, under the GLA Bill currently before Parliament, instead of a Consortium, the Mayor will be responsible for appointing a Cultural Strategy Group for London to advise him or her.

 The Sports Cabinet met on 10 March and 6 October. Officials from this Department maintain regular contact with their colleagues in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on those issues of most strategic priority for UK Sport.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what discussions he had with representatives of Sheffield City Council about the decision to remove the headquarters site of the UK Sports Institute to London.  [95207]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w31.htm_spnew2"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 No specific discussions have been held with representatives of Sheffield City Council, though representatives of Phoenix Sports Limited (the company formed by members of the Sheffield Consortium) have met with Ministers from time to time to discuss general developments related to the proposals for the UK Sports Institute Network Centre Sheffield. Officers of the United Kingdom Sports Council (UK Sport) and the English Sports Council (Sport England) attended the Board Meeting of Phoenix Sports Limited on 7 October 1999. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has since agreed to meet representatives of Sheffield at a suitable time soon.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w31.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Spring: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what criteria were used to determine that the headquarters of the UK Sports Institute should be in London; and <i>(a)</i> by whom and <i>(b)</i> when this decision was made.  [95206]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w31.htm_spnew3"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 It was originally envisaged that the UK Sports Institute headquarters would consist of around 200 staff providing a range of sports medicine and physiological services. In the light of discussions with the world of sport, and other developments both nationally and internationally, this view has been revised. With the 



<P>
<P><I>25 Oct 1999 : Column: 760</I><P>
new focus on a decentralisation of services to the network centres to better meet the requirements of athletes and coaches--and the need for a much smaller team at the centre--the UK Sports Council (UK Sport) considered it sensible to review how the central service functions could now best be delivered.
<P>

<a name="91025w31.htm_para1">A full options analysis has been undertaken by PMP Consultancy on behalf of UK Sport. The criteria and relative weighting used to evaluate the qualitative aspects of the various options have been developed from the work undertaken by Dr. Roger Jackson, an internationally recognised expert in his field from the University of Calgary commissioned by UK Sport earlier this year to review and verify the role and functions of the UK Sports Institute headquarters/central services, and from the factors that will enable the Institute to do its job effectively. Seventeen different criteria were used covering (i) the impact on partnerships with key stakeholders; (ii) accessibility; (iii) resources; (iv) links with network centres; and (v) strategic role. The preferred option provided the greatest value for money in terms of qualitative benefit per &#163;1 million of expenditure.
<P>

<a name="91025w31.htm_para2">A summary of the options analysis was included in a paper about the UK Sports Institute prepared by my Department for consideration by the Sports Cabinet on 6 October. It was announced in a press statement on 7 October 1999 that the Sports Cabinet had agreed UK Sports' proposal that a headquarters is no longer required and what is now needed is co-ordination, support and administration from a body with a dedicated UK wide sports performance focus and responsibility. The preferred option meets these objects.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w31.htm_spnew4"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 My Department recently published a report by Policy Action Team 10 (PAT 10), on how to maximise the impact on poor neighbourhoods of Government spending and policies on arts, sport and leisure. Other Government Departments including DfEE were represented on PAT 10. The report included a recommendation that
<P>

<a name="91025w31.htm_para3"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'the DfEE and DSS should work together to ensure that the benefits system does not penalise those who volunteer to help community-building activities or who want to take up training or work opportunities offered by small community organisations, and that it operates to meet the flexibility for developing artistic and sporting talent'.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91025w31.htm_para4">My Department consulted with both DfEE and DSS regarding this recommendation prior to publication of the report and will be entering into further discussions with them in order to take the recommendation forward.

However, given the responsibilities of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the horse industry and my own Department's interests in both racing and equestrianism, I intend to discuss with ministerial colleagues whether the current arrangements are satisfactory.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w31.htm_spnew6"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 We have no plans at present to review the functions of the Broadcasting Standards Commission. As "Regulating Communications: The Way Ahead" made clear, the Government believe the current system of broadcasting regulation, of which the BSC forms part, is broadly sustainable for the time being. However, I envisage that developments in broadcasting and communications will require a fundamental reassessment of broadcasting regulation, with the possibility of major new legislation early in the next Parliament.

<a name="91025w31.htm_spnew8"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend and I are in regular contact with Ministerial colleagues in the Treasury and Home Office on a wide range of issues of mutual interest. Most recently we have been in contact with the Home Office and Charity Commission in relation to issues arising from the Commission's review of the Recreational Charities Act 1958 and the planned consultation dealing specifically with charitable status and community based sports organisations. My officials, together with those of Sport England, recently met representatives of the Charity Commission to discuss a range of issues relating to the charitable status for voluntary sports clubs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91025w31.htm_spnew9"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 I have received representations in favour of granting charitable status to voluntary sports organisations from: Sport England, The Central Council of Physical Recreation, The National Playing Fields Association, and Lord Phillips and Lord Cowdray. Parliamentary Questions on this subject have recently been tabled for answer by my Department by my hon. Friend the Member for Loughborough (Mr. Reed) and the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Mr. Jones).

<a name="91025w32.htm_spnew1"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has had a number of discussions with colleagues in the DTI about promoting partnerships between business and arts and sports organisations. The vital contribution made to arts and sport by business is recognised across Government. In the arts, for example, my hon. Friend the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs participates in hosting receptions to recognise the contribution made by business sponsors through the Government's Pairing Scheme, managed by Arts and Business.
<P>

<a name="91025w32.htm_para1">DTI Ministers have also responded positively to the report of the Policy Action Team on Arts and Sport which recommended that DTI should encourage the business links network to forge partnerships between businesses and art/sport organisations.

 <i>[holding answer 19 October 1999]:</i> The then Minister for Sport's letter of 10 June to Roland Smith was the only such communication.
<P>

<a name="91025w32.htm_para2">I very much hope that a solution can be found and that Manchester United do compete in this season's FA Cup. Manchester United's exemption from the competition is ultimately something which only the FA could offer and only the Manchester United Board could decide to accept. Clearly any solution has to be acceptable to both these parties.
