To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office whether commissions for focus group research by Government Departments are subject to competitive tender.  [78415]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21105w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 Overall procurement policy is a matter for the Office of Government Commerce . I can answer for the practice only in the Cabinet Office, the Government Car and Despatch Agency (GCDA) and the Central Office of Information (COI).
<P>

<a name="21105w01.html_para1">The rules for procuring focus group research are the same as for procuring other types of service. In the Cabinet Office, commissions estimated to cost #10,000 or more are normally subject to formal competitive tendering. Commissions estimated to cost less than #10,000 are normally awarded following receipt of competitive quotations.
<P>

<a name="21105w01.html_para2">The GCDA does not commission focus group research. However the COI does, not on its own behalf but on behalf of its government clients. In such cases COI asks three of its roster of suppliers (appointed competitively under EC procurement rules) to submit proposals and costs; the supplier providing the best value for money proposal is appointed. On occasion, the client requires urgent research and COI appoints the roster supplier that it considers to be the appropriate agency for the work.

 As my right hon. Friend the Minister for Transport said previously, we will introduce a draft Bill to secure the necessary powers to impose a levy when a suitable legislative opportunity arises.

<P>
<a name="21105w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 We are taking active and immediate steps to tackle this difficult problem. The Vehicles (Crime) Act 2001 contains measures to require all number plates suppliers in England and Wales to register with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). This requirement will come into force on 1 January 2003 and will ensure that in future number plates are only sold by registered suppliers to a purchaser who can show proof of entitlement to that

<P>
<a name="21105w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In August my Department published and disseminated to all local authorities and other major employers in England a guide on XMaking travel plans work: lessons from UK case studies" which highlighted successful car-sharing schemes set up by employers as part of their travel plans. A copy of the guide is in the Library of the House. The Government will shortly be responding to the report commissioned by the Motorists' Forum on car sharing and car clubs in which we will set out our plans for further work to encourage car sharing.

<P>
<a name="21105w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Although the Strategic Rail Authority undertakes, from time to time, project development work including feasibility studies, it is not possible to identify readily those elements that relate specifically to the re-opening of railway lines. Feasibility studies are also undertaken by other stakeholders, including local authorities.

 Unsolicited direct marketing by telephone has been subject to regulation in the UK since 1999, and there are also consumer protections if individuals enter into contracts during this kind of call.
<P>

<a name="21105w04.html_para3">The current regulations are the Telecommunications (Data Protection and Privacy) Regulations 19995 which provide that individual subscribers who do not wish to receive this type of call can register with a central list&#151;the Telephone Preference Service (TPS).

Direct marketers are also obliged to take account of any requests not to call again that they receive direct from individual subscribers.

 Newly independent East Timor faces a number of challenges. The Government have prepared an excellent National Development Plan (NDP), which describes how these challenges will be addressed. The new nation, however, lacks the financial and technical resources to implement the Plan. Until revenues from offshore oil and gas exploitation come on stream, expected to be in 2006&#150;07, it will be reliant upon financial and technical support from the international community.

 My Department has received a copy of UNEP's Global Environment Outlook 3. It is a very useful reference document which we will take into account in our own monitoring of global environmental trends and their impact on developing countries. In this context we were pleased by the successful conclusion of the negotiations of the third replenishment of the Global Environment Facility last August. The UK has increased its share in the GEF, and will provide #118 million over the next four years, including a voluntary contribution of #15 million.

 Recorded crime statistics do not normally identify the location of offences, or the occupation of victims. The one recorded crime which can be identified as retail crime is theft from a shop, and figures for each police force area for the last three years are given in the table. The figures may have been affected in comparison to the previous year as a result of changes to recording practices. Some police forces implemented the principles of the National Crime Recording

More than 3,000 premises will be surveyed in each of these sectors. The survey will collect detailed information on the circumstances of crime against business, levels of concern about crime, the overall social and economic impact of crime on businesses and levels of satisfaction with police response and advice on crime.

 Our objectives for the campaign against international terrorism, and for our forces in Afghanistan, were set out in the paper entitled XDefeating International Terrorism: Campaign Objectives", a copy of which was placed in the Library of the House of Commons on 16 October 2001. We continue to work towards achieving all these aims. As part of this, we are considering with our coalition partners who we might aid the Islamic Transitional Authority of Afghanistan to stabilize further Afghanistan's regions. No decisions on what that might involve have been taken.

<P>
<a name="21105w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 October 2002]:</i> The general consensus among practitioners in England is that the teaching of English as an additional language (EAL) is most effective where it is firmly embedded in classroom practice across all national curriculum subject areas. This ensures that pupils have the opportunity to learn English in a meaningful subject specific context. That approach is reflected in the guidance issued by the Department on teaching EAL as part of the national strategies on literacy, numeracy and Key Stage 3. Many schools use the resources provided through the Department's #154 million Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant (EMAG) programme to provide additional tailored support for bilingual learners.

 Since the launch of digital terrestrial television it has been possible to offer only an audio service for BBC Parliament. In its bid to the Independent Television Commission for the former ITV digital multiplex B, and in its subsequent application for a digital programme service licence, the BBC proposed to enhance this service by offering BBC Parliament in video on quarter screen. This arrangement allows the BBC to offer explanatory text simultaneously on screen in addition to the video service and to provide more services on the digital terrestrial platform. With the launch of Freeview this service will now be widely available.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many recipients of severe disablement allowance aged under 20 years on 16 April 2001 have been automatically transferred to incapacity benefit; and how many of these are estimated to have previously claimed <i>(a)</i> free prescriptions, <i>(b)</i> free dental treatment, <i>(c)</i> free eye tests, <i>(d)</i> other healthcare benefits and <i>(e)</i> other passported benefits.

 We reformed Severe Disablement Allowance (SDA) in order to provide more support to young people disabled early in life who have never had the opportunity to work. 20,800 <sup>1</sup>  SDA recipients aged under 20 years on 6 April 2001 were automatically transferred to long-term Incapacity Benefit (IB) in April 2002, making them up to #28.10 per week better off.
<P>

<a name="21105w12.html_para0">Depending on their circumstances, young disabled people receiving IB will still be able to qualify for help with NHS charges (for example, prescriptions, dental treatment, sight tests, money-off vouchers for glasses, wigs, fabric supports and help with the cost of travel to hospital for NHS treatment) on the grounds of low income. We recognise that some will no longer have automatic entitlement to this help but many in this group will already be considerably better off as a result of the changes we have introduced and it would be unfair to treat these people differently to other IB recipients.

 The overall aim of the Department's anti-fraud strategy is to have a benefit system which is secure from first claim to final payment. The implementation of this strategy means than an anti-fraud focus is integral to the work of all staff in the Department, as is dealing with the wider agenda of error and incorrectness in benefit payments.
<P>

<a name="21105w12.html_para2">The information currently available suggests that, throughout the period, around 5,000 staff have been employed by the Department and its agencies in work to investigate suspicions of fraud. However, taking account of changes in data collection measures over time and the integration of investigators more fully with front-line staff, it is clear to me we need to improve the validity and reliability of year-on-year comparisons, and I have asked the Department to undertake further work on this.

This will help ensure that benefit and pension customers, who wish to do so, can continue to access their benefits in cash at the Post Office.

This means that those people who want to open an account should be able to do so, including those in rural areas who might not previously have had access to banking facilities.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The information is based on data held by the Pension Schemes Registry (PSR). It includes all types of pension schemes. The figures are for calendar years.<P>

2. The figures are the sum of those live schemes that have reported they are winding up and those schemes accepted by the PSR as winding up. The latter are schemes where the principal employer has gone into liquidation and they were the sole trustees. The figures do not include schemes that may not have reported to the PSR.<P>

3. The PSR system holds information on the most recent change in scheme status, so schemes which were frozen or closed in earlier years may figure in the wind up figures for a later year. Trustees are required to report changes within 12 months so there is likely to be a lag before the data reflects what is happening currently.<P>

4. Before 1997 figures for starting the wind up of schemes were not categorised:they were subsumed within figures for live scheme. The category of schemes in the process of wind up was introduced gradually. The category for schemes notifying that they were winding up was introduced before the category for schemes accepted by the PSR as winding up. Where an actual date was unavailable the current date was used.<P>

5. The information related to schemes, not employers. Some employers operate several schemes.<P>

6. The numbers of members shown include active, deferred and pensioner members. PSR does not hold data broken down by type of member, as this is not required for their purposes.<P>

 The distributional impact of policies is assessed by the Department, when it is appropriate and robust to do so, by using simulation modelling based on the Family Resources Survey.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions whether he plans to adopt the recommendation in his Department's Research Report 172, Social Fund use amongst older people, to establish a separate Social Fund for minimum income guarantee claimants as part of the new Pension Service.  [74731]<P>

<P>
<a name="21105w14.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The Government are committed to improving the service currently provided to today's and future pensioners. The Pension Service has replaced the Benefits Agency services for pensioners from 1 April 2002, and is working to introduce an improved service tailored to the needs of pensioners. The Pension Service has been developed as a customer-focused organisation after researching what customers need and expect from the Government in relation to pensions business.
<P>

<a name="21105w14.html_para6">The Pension Service will play a crucial role in both tackling pensioner poverty and encouraging saving by providing a dedicated service for today's pensioners, using modern technology whether they deal with us by telephone or through the internet, by post or face-to-face. It will also improve the service to future pensioners, by providing accurate information to help them make decisions about saving for their retirement. The Pension Service is committed to making access to benefits and services for pensioners, including the Social Fund, as simple and straightforward as possible.

We do not record the details of the senders of campaign letters as a matter of course. For this reason, and since very many of them are multiple copies of the same letter sent by the same people to different Ministers, a more detailed answer could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on the Cherry report on probable health effects associated with mobile phone base stations.  [78032]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21105w16.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="21105w16.html_para4">The report by Dr. Neil Cherry on XTogether Against Masts" is concerned with an assessment of possible health effects that might arise from exposure to radio frequency (RF) radiation from mobile phone base stations (masts). It was to address such concerns that in 1999 the Government asked the chairman of the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) to set up an Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones (IEGMP). The group was chaired by Sir William Stewart FRS, FRSE and reported to Government in May 2000.
<P>

<a name="21105w16.html_para5">A particular issue for the group was the exposures that might be received by members of the public from local base stations and the potential for effects on health. This is the issue addressed by Dr. Cherry. The conclusions in the IEGMP report were that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> The balance of evidence indicates that there is no general risk to the health of people living near to base stations on the basis that exposures are expected to be small fractions of guidelines</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="21105w16.html_para6">Measurements undertaken by the NRPB and the Radiocommunications Agency have confirmed that public exposures are very much lower than the international guidelines. Network operators have 



<P>
<P><I>5 Nov 2002 : Column 212W</I><P>
undertaken to ensure that all base stations will be designed and sited, so that members of the public will not be exposed in excess of the recommended basic restriction.
<P>

<a name="21105w16.html_para7">The group were aware, however, that if people are unduly concerned about potential exposures then that in itself may affect their well-being. A number of recommendations of the group were, therefore, designed to provide more information to people about local base stations.
<P>

<a name="21105w16.html_para8">The group also made recommendations for further research work. These proposals for research were principally directed as providing more information on exposures from mobile phones but also have relevance to exposures from base stations. It additionally recommended that there should be a further review of relevant research in three years time, or earlier if circumstances demand it.
<P>

<a name="21105w16.html_para9">The Government welcome the report as an authoritative review of the scientific information available. It also accepted the recommendations and these have been taken forward by Government and by other bodies. A research programme funded by Government and industry on a 50:50 basis is taking forward the research recommendations.
<P>

<a name="21105w16.html_para10">In coming to its conclusions, the IEGMP undertook an extensive review of the relevant scientific literature and heard evidence from 28 witnesses during the course of its work. It also organised five open meetings to hear the views of the public. Many of the references cited by Dr. Cherry were reviewed by the expert group. Professor G. J. Hyland, then of the University of Warwick, whose work is referred to by Dr. Cherry gave evidence to the group. The IEGMP also drew upon evidence provided by the NRPB and other organisations on exposures to RF from base stations.
<P>

<a name="21105w16.html_para11">The further review of research findings is being carried out by NRPB's independent advisory group on non-ionising radiation. It is expected that this will be completed in 2003.

One of these campaigns was based in Cheshire, and we estimate that around 200 responses were received as part of that. Cheshire is also one of the constituent

authorities of the F40 education funding campaign, and a proportion of the approximately 53,000 responses received as part of that originated from within the country.
<P>

<a name="21105w17.html_para4">We do not record the details of the senders of campaign letters as a matter of course. For this reason, and since very many from the F40 campaign are multiple copies of the same letter sent by the same people to different Ministers, it is not possible to provide a more precise answer, or one for the constituency of Macclesfield, except at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="21105w17.html_para5">We are currently taking decisions on the new system to replace SSAs. As we do so we are carefully considering the full range of evidence, pressures and points that have been put to us. We will announce our proposals for the new system to Parliament at the time of the next provisional local government finance settlement, which we expect to be around the beginning of December.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister, pursuant to the answer of 21 October 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 61W, when a street count for under 16s living rough last took place in <i>(a)</i> London and <i>(b)</i> West Sussex; what criteria is used to count under 16s in the street count; and when the Social Exclusion Unit will publish its report into young runaways.  [78194]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21105w17.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Street counts were last carried out in London and West Sussex during March 2002. These found no one sleeping rough aged under 16. Anyone who is bedded down in the open air, people in buildings or other places not designed for habitation, including those under 16, is included in the figures.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21105w17.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The police and the Home Office have been key members of the Young Runaways Advisory Group, advising on issues for runaways when they are away from home. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is also a member of the Missing Persons Cross-Departmental Group led by the Home Office. In addition, the police work with outreach teams across the country. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has not had discussions with the Home Office regarding police involvement with under 16s living rough.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how many 16 to 18-year-olds are living rough in <i>(a)</i> London and <i>(b)</i> West Sussex following the last street count.  [78196]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21105w17.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The street count carried out in London in March 2002 identified one person aged 18 sleeping rough. A full analysis of count information showing breakdown by age is not currently held centrally for West Sussex. When informed of results of street counts we would expect to be notified if a person under 16 is found sleeping rough.

That statement, which will be made around the turn of the year, will set out how the additional funding announced in the spending review will be used, and what it will buy over the three years up to 2005&#150;06.

We said then that we would review this guidance in the light of experience of its implementation and effectiveness and the developing scientific knowledge on climate change three years after publication. In the meantime we are continuing to monitor how it is being applied through the Environment Agency's high-level target 12. The report for 2001&#150;02 was recently published on the DEFRA website. It indicates that PPG 25 is already beginning to have an effect and that less than 0.5 per cent. of all new homes were subject to sustained objections on flood risk grounds. In the remaining cases, local planning authorities had considered the matter carefully before allowing development to proceed.
<P>

<a name="21105w18.html_para1">To complement the new, stronger planning guidance, DTLR published XPreparing for floods" in February 2002. This contains interim guidance for improving the flood resistance of domestic and small business properties. It provides practical advice for existing property owners whose properties are at risk of flooding and for all those involved with construction of new properties or renovation of existing buildings in areas of flood risk. The Environment Agency, together with the Construction Industry Research and Information Association, has also produced guidance on temporary measures to protect against flooding (such as flood boards) and on what to do after a flood.
<P>

<a name="21105w18.html_para2">In addition, we are working with the Environment Agency, local government, the water industry and others to produce an agreed guidance framework for the development of sustainable drainage systems. Such systems, which are encouraged in PPG 25, aim to control water as near its source as possible and thus reduce the downstream risk of flooding. They will help to reduce the potential impact on existing properties of flooding due to uncontrolled run-off from newly developed areas.

 The Inland Revenue reviews its record management regularly to seek improvements. The latest exercise, internally called CR74, ran for around six months from the start of this financial year. It involved a check of national insurance numbers (NINOs) held on the existing records. Checking NINOs is part of the Inland Revenue's day-to-day work, but this was a systematic updating exercise conducted over a relatively short period of time. The Department has kept the updated records separate. It has also introduced better processes to trace and match the existing and updated records.

 The Inland Revenue regards human resource and personnel issues as an important element in the evaluation of any bid for the IT contract.

The right to trade union recognition&#151;along with any collective agreements&#151;is one of the transferable rights of any employee affected by a TUPE transfer. Therefore any incoming supplier will be required to provide trade union recognition, where this exists already, for employees working on the Inland Revenue's current IT contracts. The Inland Revenue will oblige the incoming supplier to comply with all UK laws and regulations relating to employment and non-discrimination.

The proportion of Landfill Tax receipts attributable to local authority activity is not available, as revenue information on Landfill Tax is obtained via the return declarations made by registered bodies, and Landfill Tax is therefore declared by local authorities under their own registration and by private contractors who collect waste on behalf of local authorities and declare the landfill tax on their own returns.

The aim is to achieve, by 31 March 2004, an increase of 7.7 per cent. (cumulative) equivalent to 2.5 per cent. year on year. Initiatives are in place to achieve the step changes in productivity necessary to meet this target. The productivity index for tax processing is calculated by comparing a basket of outputs representative of this work with the staff time spent carrying out the tasks. These include Self Assessment and Corporation Tax returns captured, PAYE end of year returns reconciled and closed and repayment claims processed.

<a name="21105w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Defra and HM Treasury have carried out a joint consultation on economic instruments to improve household energy efficiency. The results of thisconsultation will be jointly considered, in the context of the wider process of preparing the Energy White Paper, which the Government aims to publish around the turn of the year. Any decisions on possible tax changes would be a matter for the Chancellor to consider as part of the Budget process.

<i>[holding answer 4 November 2002]:</i> Public expenditure on agriculture in the United Kingdom in the 2000&#150;01 financial year was #3,042million. The UK received #2,720million from the EU under the Common Agricultural Policy in its 2000&#150;01 budget year. These figures include payments of market support, which may not have gone directly to farmers, as traders are also eligible.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21105w20.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Negotiations on the EU biofuels targets Directive are still taking place and are being led by the Department for Transport. It is anticipated that the outcome of the discussions will be a requirement for member states to set indicative targets for the use of biofuels as a transport fuel by July 2005. The Government recognise that liquid biofuels and non-food crops in general have potential for UK agriculture and regular discussions are held with farmers and industry representatives on a wide range of non-food crops issues. The Government-Industry Forum on Non-Food Uses of Crops, which includes representatives from the farming sector, was set up in 2001 to review market opportunities for non-food crops and make recommendations to Government on policy affecting their use. The Forum is looking at several non-food crop applications, including biodiesel and bioethanol.

<P>
<a name="21105w20.html_wqn8"><B> Andrew George: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what targets her Department set for the testing of cattle for bovine TB during this year's summer months.  [77392]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21105w20.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 TB testing is an important element in the control of bovine TB. Reducing the number of overdue TB tests to an acceptable level following the testing backlog built up during the foot and mouth disease outbreak is one of the Department's priorities and an additional #3 million has been made available to the State Veterinary Service in England and Wales this year to help with this.
<P>

<a name="21105w20.html_para4">The uptake of testing is traditionally slower in summer months as cattle are out to pasture. While no specific targets were set for the testing of cattle for bovine TB over the summer Defra issued a press notice encouraging farmers to organise their tests. At the end of September the number of outstanding herd tests stood at just over 14,900 tests (down from 27,000 at the end of last year).
<P>

<a name="21105w20.html_para5">On 9 October Defra announced a package of measures for the control of bovine TB in cattle in England. Part of the package is the imposition of movement restrictions on herds with overdue tests. Movement restrictions are being introduced in stages to reflect the risk of disease attached to overdue tests and taking account of the resources available to test herds.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many new cases have been reported of TB on farms in Gloucestershire in the last 12 months; and if she will make a statement.  [79315]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21105w20.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 November 2002]:</i> In the 12-month period 1 October 2001 to 30 September 2002, 216 new TB incidents were reported on cattle premises in Gloucestershire.
<P>

<a name="21105w20.html_para6">The number of TB incidents reported depends on the number of tests carried out and the nature of the testing regime as well as the underlying prevalence of the disease. Testing resources over the 12 month period October 2001 to September 2002 were concentrated on herds with overdue tests following the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak. These would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Those currently tested also contain a higher than usual proportion of high risk herds than were being tested prior to the FMD outbreak. As a consequence it is very difficult to assess whether there has been a greater increase in bovine TB than anticipated and it will remain difficult to interpret the numbers of incidents reported until the backlog of tests following the FMD outbreak has been cleared.

 <i>[holding answer 4 November 2002]:</i> Bovine TB in cattle is caused by the organism <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i>. Defra is funding a wide-ranging programme of research into how bovine TB is spread. It includes research into the nature of the disease in cattle; what factors in the environment increase the risk to cattle; the spread of the disease between cattle, and between cattle and wildlife; and the role of the badger and other wildlife in disease transmission. Research is still on-going. It is too early to draw conclusions at this stage.

 The cost of X-ray machines varies with size and specification. Trained operators and associated personnel are also required, all of which add to the costs. Defra is investigating the potential for using X-ray machines to detect illegal imports of meat, meat products and bushmeat in passenger baggage and commercial freight entering the UK. Until these investigations are complete, we cannot calculate costings.

 Circular 2/96 indicated that the Secretary of State expected energy conservation authorities' reports to show a strategy for making at least substantial progress towards a 30 per cent. improvement over a 10-year period. Improvement in the first six years is just over 8 per cent.. It is therefore clear that authorities are not going to make the improvements they originally hoped for.

 The Home Energy Efficiency Scheme is now marketed as The Warm Front Team, and is the Government's main programme for tackling fuel poverty in the private sector in England. The Scheme was launched in June 2000 and by June 2002 over 400,000 households had received assistance and some #200 million had been spent on installing measures. Warm Front provides insulation and heating measures depending upon the needs of the householder and the property type.
<P>

<a name="21105w22.html_para0">The Scheme Managers provide, on an annual basis, information on the number, location and measures installed under the scheme to local authorities. However, socio-economic information is not colleted. I refer the hon. Member to the answer given to the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) on 15 January 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 275W. Updated information is not available and could not be provided without incurring disproportionate cost.

 Heading 1 of the annual EC budget sets out expenditure appropriations for spending on the Common Agricultural Policy by budget line. In cases where expenditure for any line looked likely to exceed the appropriation the European Commission would be able to propose an in year transfer from another line within the heading. In the event of unavoidable, exceptional or unforeseen circumstances, the Commission may propose during the year that the budget be amended and submit a preliminary draft amending budget to the Council and the European Parliament. The Commission, Council and European Parliament would remain bound by the expenditure ceilings set down in the Financial Perspective and inter-institutional agreement on budget discipline.

<sup>(20)</sup> The figures for June 2000 and 2001 are not directly comparable. Between 2000 and 2001 a review of temporary holdings took place, which resulted in the addition of holdings not previously included in the census. If these holdings had not been included in June 2001 the total agricultural labour force would have been recorded as 368.3 (thousands).<P>

<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Includes estimates for minor holdings.<P>

2. The total labour force is that employed on registered agricultural holdings.<P>

3. The estimates include employees, farmers, partners, directors and their spouses where the spouse works on the holding.<P>

4. Estimates have been made for non-respondents<P>

5. Figures exclude school children but include trainees employed under an official youth training scheme and paid at Agricultural Wages Board rates or above.<P>

6. In 1998, fundamental changes were introduced to the labour questions on the June Agricultural and Horticultural Census in England. It appears that this change in questions may have led to the recording of additional Labour who were not previously included in the returns. We therefore advise caution when comparing the 1998 results with previous years.<P>

These are plans which the UK supports and will be looking to drive forward when they come up for substantive discussion in the CFP review process. I have written to Commissioner Fischler and to the French Minister pressing the need for action in relation to cetacean bycatch, particularly in the bass fishery: the researchers contracted by Defra to trial measures to reduce cetacean bycatch have been meeting contacts from France and elsewhere to secure wider commitment to this work.

<UL>(2) if she will make it her policy to fund fully the costs to local authorities of meeting the targets that they have set in their strategies under the Home Energy Conservation Act 1995; and if she will make a statement on any other policies and incentives which she intends to use to ensure that these targets are met.  [77438]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21105w23.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government have no plans to provide local authorities with the full funding necessary to meet the targets they have set in their HECA strategies. Non-local authority programmes, such as the Government's Warm Front programme and gas and electricity suppliers' Energy Efficiency Commitment, will deliver the majority of the improvements needed to meet these non-statutory targets. The full cost will therefore not fall to local authorities. Any new obligations the Government placed on authorities would, of course, be funded in full.

<P>

<a name="21105w23.html_para4">A residential shelter will normally be regarded as a house in multiple occupation for the purpose of the Housing Act 1985 and a traditional bedsit will normally also form part of a house in multiple occupation.
<P>

<a name="21105w23.html_para5">Section 604 (1) of the Housing Act 1985 provides that a dwelling (including a house in multiple occupation) is fit for human habitation unless the local housing authority is of the opinion it is not reasonably suitable for occupation because it fails to meet one or more basic standards. These include that the dwelling is to be structurally stable, free from damp and serious disrepair; have adequate provisions for lighting, heating, ventilation and supply of water; have adequate facilities for the preparation and cooking of food; have suitably located toilet, bathing and washing facilities and an effective drainage system.
<P>

<a name="21105w23.html_para6">In addition section 352 (1A) of the Housing Act 1985 sets out further standards which may be applied in relation to a house in multiple occupation by a local housing authority in its determination of whether the property is fit for the number of persons or households occupying it. These standards include that the property has satisfactory facilities for preparing and cooking food; an adequate number of toilet, bathing and washing facilities and an adequate means of escape from fire and other fire precautions.

<a name="21105w23.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Searches for illegal imports of meat and meat products form part of the normal duties of port health authorities and local authorities.

<a name="21105w24.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The EC Surplus Food Scheme was introduced in 1988 to reduce intervention stocks and benefit the most deprived persons in the Community (those receiving income support, family credit, disability working allowance, together with those living in welfare hostels, and the homeless and destitute). The UK withdrew from the scheme from 1996 because of the reduction of EC food mountains.

<a name="21105w24.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement about <i>(a)</i> the areas included and <i>(b)</i> the exclusion of river water in the nitrate vulnerable zone scheme; how it will be policed; and how many extra forms will be generated by it.  [79243]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21105w24.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 November 2002]:</i> The Nitrates Directive requires the identification of polluted waters using the following criteria: <i>(a)</i> surface and groundwaters which contain or could contain, if preventative action is not taken, nitrate concentrations greater than 50 mg/l; <i>(b)</i> surface waters which are or could become, if preventative action is not taken, eutrophic.
<P>

<a name="21105w24.html_para2">The Nitrates Directive then requires all known land draining into these waters, from which agriculture could contribute to the pollution, to be designated as Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZs). Around 55 per cent. of England has been designated as NVZs on the basis that it drains into these waters.
<P>

<a name="21105w24.html_para3">The Environment Agency (EA) are adopting a risk based approach to the enforcement of action programme measures which farmers located in the NVZs will be required to apply from 19 December 2002. The EA will prioritise farms that have the greatest potential for nitrate loss rather than visiting all farms, and will aim to work with farmers to help achieve compliance over a period of time.
<P>

<a name="21105w24.html_para4">There is no requirement for farmers to fill in any new forms to comply with this legislation. Farmers in Nitrate Vulnerable Zones are expected to keep records of their application of manures and fertilisers. However, there is complete flexibility for farmers to do this in whatever way is most convenient for them, including using existing field records.

<P>
<a name="21105w24.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In negotiations on the EU Animal By-Products Regulation, the UK opposed any delay in introducing an EU-wide ban on swill feeding. However, to secure adoption of the regulation, the UK accepted that a transition period might be appropriate for two member states, Austria and Germany, providing suitable controls were in place during that period.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21105w25.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government published a consultation paper on July 31; XExtending Opportunities for Competition in the Water Industry in England and Wales". This proposed competition only in the non-household sector, with an eligibility threshold 



<P>
<P><I>5 Nov 2002 : Column 242W</I><P>
of a minimum of 50 megalitres (Ml) a year. The consultation period closed on 1 October and we are now considering responses.
<P>

<a name="21105w25.html_para2">In preparing the proposals, assessment was made of the broad cost breakdown between the main elements of the supply chain, the likely scope for making savings on these, and the ranges of charges paid by users. Experience shows that the market will determine financial viability in a competitive environment.
<P>

<a name="21105w25.html_para3">These issues will be taken into consideration as we balance the need to create opportunities for competition while continuing to secure the Government's wider objectives for the water industry, which include protecting public health, the environment, social and economic goals, and safeguarding services for household customers.

However, the campaign has improved understanding of the environmental safeguards in wood supplied from the member countries. The demand for construction timber from the member countries has increased and is attributed in part to the campaign.

We supported the recent EU decision to establish a formal dialogue on human rights with Iran with the hope that this will bring about improvements in Iran's respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. We have made clear that we expect to see concrete results and will assess progress before taking a decision on whether to sponsor a resolution at the Commission on Human Rights.

 As stated by my hon.

A risk assessment was made at the licensing stage of this export, including careful examination of information about the proposed end-use and end-user of the goods. We continue to believe that the export of less than half an ounce of beryllium to the University of Science and Technology in Tehran is not of concern with respect to use in weapons of mass destruction and that the end-use stated in the original export licence application was legitimate. In these circumstances we have considered end-use monitoring not to be necessary for this export.

<a name="21105w28.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 Relations between the United Kingdom and Zimbabwe are poorer than at any time since Zimbabwe's independence in 1980. The ZANU (PF) regime has undermined the democratic principles on which an independent Zimbabwe was founded. It has manipulated the democratic process to retain power, as clearly seen during the presidential election in March and in elections since. It has used violence, intimidation and the withholding of food aid to cow the opposition and gain political advantage. It has seriously undermined the independence of the judiciary and subverted the rule of law. It has systematically attacked Zimbabwe's free and independent media. Its record on human rights abuses is appalling. Its economic and land policies are major contributors to the current humanitarian crisis. Relations between the UK and Zimbabwe will not improve until a government in Harare makes a genuine attempt to address these concerns.

<P>
<a name="21105w29.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 There are no plans to submit blood and blood components to the Medicines Control Agency for licensing. We do not believe that doing so would confer any additional public health benefit. The Medicines Control Agency already ensures that the United Kingdom blood services meet European good manufacturing practice standards. In addition, the new European Blood Directive will, when adopted, require the accreditation of all blood establishments to ensure common standards of safety and quality in blood and blood components across all Members States. We have no plans to refer the use of all plasma products to NICE for evaluation. Safety issues relating to plasma products fall within the remit of the United Kingdom expert advisory committee on the microbiological safety of blood and tissues for transplantation (MSBT). MSBT seeks specialist advice where necessary or includes the relevant specialists among its members.

<P>
<a name="21105w29.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Government's advisory committee on the microbiological safety of blood and tissues for transplantation (MSBT) is continuing to consider the relative efficacy and risks of the different types of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) available. United Kingdom FFP is already a very safe product. To minimise the risk from viruses, it is made only from previously tested blood donors. The current high levels of safety are achieved by screening out potential high risk donors and then further testing every unit of donated blood for the presence of infections such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C. FFP produced by the national blood service (NBS), using UK donors, has also been leucodepleted to remove white cells, which evidence suggests may carry the greatest risk of transmitting vOD. Over 300,000 units of FFP are issued annually and it is only given in life-threatening situations to prevent or stop haemorrhage associated with abnormal blood clotting. MSBT has recommended importing single unit FFP from the United States. On 15 August 2002 the Government announced that imported FFP will be used for new-born babies and young children born after 1 January 1996, as an added precaution against the theoretical risk of vCJD transmission. On the advice of MSBT, US sourced FFP will be virally inactivated using methylene blue (MB) treatment. MB has been administered in medical practice since 1900, and in much larger doses (many thousand-fold) than the NBS will be using. NBS will be removing more than 90 per cent, of MB before the FFP is issued to National Health Service hospitals. MB is a registered medical device under the Medical Devices Directive and has a European safety (CE) marking.

 The parallel developments at Hammersmith Hospital and the Paddington Basin will see the creation of two specialist centres for heart surgery in north west London in modern facilities to replace the existing centres. The two centres will provide benefits of greater service concentration, including integration with a wider range of services, and a strengthened teaching and research capacity. Whilst the developments are underway investment is being made to improve existing services. This includes creating more surgical capacity where possible and replacing worn out equipment, including operating theatres and catheter laboratories to ensure that services continue to improve in line with patient and Government expectations.

<i>[holding answer 21 October 2002]:</i> A lookback programme conducted by the national blood service from 1995 identified 669 people who contracted the hepatitis C virus from blood transfusions before screening for thevirus was introduced in September 1991. However, it has been impossible to trace the majority of those likely to have been infected. Work has been undertaken to estimate the numbers involved and we expect the results to be published later this year.

 The maximum penalties for an offence under the Jams and Similar Products Regulations 1981 are: on summary conviction, a fine not exceeding 5,000; on conviction or indictment, a unlimited fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or both.

<a name="21105w30.html_para7">New domestic regulations are being prepared to implement Directive 2001/113. It is intended, subject to the outcome of a full public consultation, that the maximum penalty for an offence under the forthcoming Regulations will be a fine not exceeding #5,000. This is in line with the penalties provided by comparable compositional legislation for other foodstuffs.

 Guidance issued to the national health service relating to latex and latex-free equipment is based on the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974, and is intended to remind NHS managers of their duty to comply with that legislation in assessing risks to their staff.
<P>

<a name="21105w30.html_para8">A wide range of latex-free equipment is now being manufactured and many companies are now moving away from using latex in their products altogether. There are no cost implications associated with using latex-free equipment, and the latest data from NHS Logistics suggest that NHS employers are increasingly moving to latex-free equipment.

 The total expenditure of the local provider organisations serving the former Portsmouth and South East Hampshire health authority area in 1997&#150;98 was #242.9 million. This included Portsmouth Hospitals National Health Service Trust and Portsmouth Healthcare NHS Trust. The total forecast out-turn expenditure in 2002&#150;03 for Portsmouth Hospitals Trust and the provider functions of the East Hampshire, Fareham and Gosport and Portsmouth City Primary Care Trusts is #383.6 million. It is not possible to provide information for the Portsmouth South constituency.
<P>

<a name="21105w31.html_para3">The total expenditure by health authorities in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight in 1997&#150;98 was #971.7 million and the forecast outturn expenditure in 2002&#150;03 for the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Strategic Health Authority and the 10 constituent primary care trusts which have commissioning functions is #1,501.4 million.
<P>

<a name="21105w31.html_para4">In both cases it is difficult to make direct comparisons between 1997&#150;98 expenditure and 2002&#150;03 forecast out-turn expenditure because of the various organisational changes which have taken place in the intervening years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans there are to maintain standards in the public health laboratories after their privatisation. [78740]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21105w32.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 All the laboratories of the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) are Clinical Pathology Accreditation UK Ltd, accredited. It is envisaged that those PHLS laboratories that will transfer to the National Health Service in the coming months will maintain this accreditation. There is no plan to privatise PHLS laboratories.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21105w32.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 None of the laboratories will be privatised. From 1 April 2003, approximately 35 will transfer from the Public Health Laboratory Service to the management of National Health Service trusts. The remainder, approximately ten, will transfer to the Health Protection Agency when it is established.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what co-ordination there will be between public health laboratories; and who will be responsible for checks on them after they are privatised.  [78744]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21105w32.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 None of the laboratories will be privatised. The Health Protection Agency will be responsible for monitoring the specialist services across the National Health Service laboratories transferring from the Public Health Laboratory Service, as well as their own laboratories. NHS trusts will be responsible for the routine microbiology services in their own trusts. They will be subject to the same performance monitoring as well by primary care trusts. External accreditation programmes will also remain in place. In time, the laboratories will form part of local pathology managed clinical networks. It is hoped that, until then, informal links will be maintained and strengthened between individual laboratories.

<P>

 Under the change management protocol which has been agreed with the current employers and the unions concerned, all staff transferring to the Health Protection Agency on its establishment or to a National Health Service trust will have guaranteed continuity of employment until April 2004.

 XHealth Protection: A Consultation Document on creating a health protection agency", published in June 2002, proposed that the agency would take on responsibilities in relation to the control and prevention of infectious disease, including most of the functions of the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS), radiological protection, protection against chemical and poisonous hazards and health emergency planning. All PHLS staff would transfer to the agency, other than those in the laboratories which will transfer to the national health service by 31 March 2003, under separate decisions announced on 3 September. We are currently considering responses to the consultation document and will announce our decisions as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="21105w32.html_para3">The consultation document also proposed that staff would transfer on their existing terms and conditions of service. Future changes would be a matter for the board of the proposed agency to agree with the recognised trades unions.

 Seroxat (paroxetine) is a member of a group of drugs known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Before a product is granted a licence for use in the UK, it must meet appropriate standards of safety, quality and efficacy. After licensing, the safety of all medicines, including SSRIs, is continually monitored by the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the independent expert advisory body, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM), and any new evidence that emerges is carefully reviewed.
<P>

<a name="21105w33.html_para1">The MCA/CSM carried out a major review of all side effects associated with SSRIs, which was completed in 2000 and resulted in product information for all SSRIs, including Seroxat, being updated and harmonised to reflect the common safety profiles of these medicines. An article in XCurrent Problems in Pharmacovigilance" in 2000 informed presenters about this review and reminded them about the risk of withdrawal reactions.

No data are collected centrally on the proportion of virally inactivated fresh frozen plasma (FFP) received by patients. In April 2002, the national blood service (NBS) introduced methylene blue treatment of FFP for neonates and children born after 1 January 1996. United Kingdom FFP is already a very safe product. To minimise the risk from viruses, it is made only from previously tested blood donors. The current high levels of safety are achieved by screening out potential high risk donors and then further testing every unit of donated blood for the presence of infections, such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C. FFP produced by the NBS, using UK donors, has also been leucodepleted to remove white cells, which evidence suggests may carry the greatest risk of transmitting vdD. A commercially produced, pooled solvent detergent treated FFP is licensed in the UK and available to the National Health Service.

 Provision of methylene blue (MB) treated fresh frozen plasma for children born after 1 January 1996 is part of a larger strategy to provide single unit, virus inactivated non-United Kingdom plasma for this group. Steps are actively being taken to find a safe, reliable source of plasma from the United States, an area free of BSE. The use of a non-pooled product minimises the risk of spread of pathogens, which may not be susceptible to the pathogen inactivation process. Currently, MB is the only available product for virally inactivating single unit plasma.

 The government is committed to encouraging expressions of interest from successful international organisations to partner Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in developing and testing models of integrated care in the national health service. In line with this commitment, the Department is in discussion with United Healthcare Group with a view to entering into a contractual relationship with them to provide hands-on support to a number of PCTs to test elements of United Healthcare Group's Evercare model in this country and tailor it to the needs of the NHS. Under the Evercare model, doctors and nurses in primary care work together with care staff to identify vulnerable individuals at highest risk of hospitalisation. This allows for early intervention and treatment, thus avoiding inappropriate hospital admission, and facilitating safe, early discharge where a stay in hospital is necessary. The work will be carried out under the national primary and care trust development programme to promote significant transformational change.

 A national survey of national health service child care provision, undertaken early in 2001, found that 114 NHS trusts provided nursery facilities for their staff. Since April 2001, a further 117 schemes for new or extensions to existing nurseries have had capital funding agreed as part of the NHS child care strategy. As a criterion of funding these nurseries should, wherever possible, provide places for the use of all health care workers, including those at other NHS organisations.

<a name="21105w35.html_para9">Further capital funding will be made available in 2003&#150;04 to meet the NHS plan target of 150 new nursery schemes by March 2004. All new build hospitals must also include a nursery in their plans.

 The National Audit Office report, XTackling Obesity in England, published February 2001", estimated that in 1998 overweight and obesity contributed to 18 million sick days. The Government are committed to tackling the rising trend in obesity. The National Health Service priorities and planning framework for 2003&#150;2006 includes targets on reducing coronary heart disease (CHD). One of these targets requires practice-based registers and systematic treatment regimes, including appropriate advice on diet, physical activity and smoking; it also covers the majority of patients at high risk of CHD, particularly those with hypertension, diabetes and a body mass index greater than 30. The Department is working with a range of partners at national, regional and local levels, on programmes to improve diet and increase physical activity levels. Action to improve diet includes a Five-a-day programme, including initiatives with the food industry, including manufacturers and caterers, improving the overall balance of diet&#151;working with the Food Standards Agency&#151;and a food in schools and healthy schools programme. Plans were recently

 The database of weight management services was completed in 1997 and made available at National Health Service regional offices for local dissemination on request. The project had two aims, one of which was to identify existing projects on weight management in the regions and to compile a directory of services. The database is a directory of weight management services in England, but does not claim to be comprehensive. Entries are arranged by region and, within each region, alphabetically by town. Each entry has details of project name, funding organisation, contact name and details and information on the services the project offers and if the project has been evaluated. The information has not been updated since publication.
