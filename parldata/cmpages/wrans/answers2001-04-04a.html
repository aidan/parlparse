To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he has carried out an assessment to determine whether the PFI contract for the disposal of waste entered into between Herefordshire and Worcestershire councils and Fosca plc in 1998 complies with guidance issued by his Department on 22 December 2000.

<a name="10404w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Herefordshire and Worcestershire waste PFI scheme was endorsed by the Interdepartmental Project Review Group in February 1998, following an assessment in line with the criteria published on 9 December 1997. General criteria for all PFI projects were

<P><I>4 Apr 2001 : Column: 178W</I><P>
revised on 21 December 1998 and 23 December 1999. Revised specific criteria for PFI waste schemes in England were published on 22 September 2000. Officials will be writing to authorities with endorsed proposals for waste schemes, including Herefordshire and Worcestershire, to explore with them whether their existing schemes might be brought more closely in to line with the subsequent changes to the PFI criteria.

<P>
<a name="10404w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what representations he has received concerning the impact on a company's ability to plan and invest for the long term of his proposal relating to a time limit on water abstraction licences;  [156344]
<P>
<UL>(2) what representations he has received concerning the environmental effects of his proposed time limit on water abstraction licences.  [156345]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10404w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 My Department received a number of representations in response to the 1998 consultation document "The Review of the Water Abstraction Licensing System in England and Wales". These were summarised in "Taking Water Responsibly", published in 1999. There was widespread support among respondents for time limited licences on environmental grounds. About a sixth of the respondents were opposed to time limiting. This was mainly because of concerns about the possible impact on business planning and investment. A number of respondents to the draft Water Bill published last year have commented on time limiting licences. Similar comments have been made as were made previously. Many of those expressing concern accept the need for time limits in principle, but want licences to have a duration longer than the standard period in order to allow companies to plan and invest for the long term.
<P>

<a name="10404w01.html_para24">There will be a presumption of renewal with all time limited licences. Also, it will be open to abstractors to apply for licences with time limits of more than 12 years. Each application will be considered by the Environment Agency on a case-by-case basis and will need to demonstrate need and that an assessment has been made of the environmental impact.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions on what grounds he based his proposal for a time limit on water abstraction licences.  [156346]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10404w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Government's policy on time limiting abstraction licences was set out in "Taking Water Responsibly", published in 1999. There are long-term uncertainties which could lead to some currently acceptable abstractions becoming unsustainable. The principal concern is uncertainty about climate change impact upon water resources replenishment and hence the availability of water for abstraction in future decades.
<P>

<a name="10404w01.html_para25">Another significant concern is the extent to which changing technological or economic patterns will continue to affect the use or non-use of licensed abstractions in the future. Just as there have been changes in past decades in those patterns, so there have been changes in awareness and expectations of the social dimension to the water environment and the activities and values which it supports through "in situ" or abstractive use.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how much of Great Britain's waste has been recycled in each of the last five years.  [156348]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10404w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 Total annual data for GB are not available for each of the five years requested. The latest available data are for 1998 and show an estimate of between 170-210 m. tonnes of waste produced by households, commerce and industry, including construction and demolition in the UK, of which 26 per cent. were recycled. Information on the amount of municipal waste collected and recycled in England and Wales is obtained on an annual basis through the Department's annual Municipal Waste Management Survey. Municipal waste makes up about a sixth of total waste produced. The municipal waste recycling rates for 1995-96, 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99 were 7.1, 7.2, 8.0 and 9.7 per cent. respectively. 1999-2000 data are expected to be available in the summer. Waste recycling in Scotland is a matter for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland.

<a name="10404w02.html_para6">These schemes are already providing considerable assistance. Nevertheless, I also appreciate that fishing communities have suffered particularly badly in recent times, due to declining fish stocks and other pressures, and that they have a strong case for further assistance.
<P>

<a name="10404w02.html_para7">I have therefore asked the Regional Development Agencies to set aside &#163;5.5 million from their budget to go towards a new programme of assistance for fishing communities. The programme will aim to help local partnerships to devise strategies for regenerating affected areas. It will be designed specifically to help fishing communities develop plans for their areas and make their case to Regional Development Agencies and other sources of funding, and more effectively access assistance from existing programmes.
<P>

<a name="10404w02.html_para8">It will be possible for some of this money to be used to help tourism, including re-opening coastal paths.
<P>

<a name="10404w02.html_para9">This new initiative forms part of a wider Government package of assistance to fishing communities. Earlier this week, MAFF announced that they are making available &#163;6 million for additional assistance in England to assist restructuring in the fishing industry. They will be consulting with the industry about the precise form the assistance should take. MAFF also announced that they are launching a fisheries structural fund grants scheme (FIFG) for England; they have already committed &#163;6 million to this EU scheme over the coming three years. This is in addition to a separate &#163;5 million fund for fisheries in Cornwall.
<P>

<a name="10404w02.html_para10">The total value of the MAFF and DETR packages is &#163;22.5 million.
<P>

<a name="10404w02.html_para11">I am also pleased to say that colleagues in the DfEE are today announcing a package of support for fishing communities. The Employment Service will use every opportunity to assist those made unemployed to return to work as quickly as possible. This will be a flexible service, tailored to the needs of the particular community. The type of service will depend on what is appropriate in each instance. All aspects of jobsearch, training, access to vacancies, help with job applications and a fast track benefit service, maybe through On-site Jobshops, can be used. Open days and Job Fairs may also be an option.
<P>

<a name="10404w02.html_para12">ES staff will be available to offer intelligence on the local labour market and to match people to current vacancies. There is also access to over 350,000 vacancies on the website www.employmentservice.gov.uk and to a national telephone job hunting service Employment Service Direct (0845 60 60 234).
<P>

<a name="10404w02.html_para13">Additional help through the Job Transition Service will be offered in areas where large scale redundancies occur and where unemployment is already high. It will not only help those people directly affected but also people from communities which are dependent upon the fishing industry.




<P>
<P><I>4 Apr 2001 : Column: 184W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10404w02.html_para14">The Job Transition Service is a new programme and key to the way in which this Government are tackling large scale redundancies. The Job Transition Service builds on existing ES support to provide the extra help needed to move people rapidly back into work. In particular, it works with employers to identify skills shortages and match people without jobs to jobs without people.
<P>

<a name="10404w02.html_para15">The DfEE and the Employment Service will work closely with other departments and agencies to tackle the issue of job losses in the fisheries industry and the community as a whole. The approach will be practical and efficient, responding to local needs.

 My Department makes available funding to LEAs for schools and to colleges for students of 16 and over to help with transport and other course related costs. These funds are part of a &#163;115 million package of discretionary support available from September 2001-02 onwards, which is an increase of &#163;16 million over the 2000-01 allocation. We also provide up to &#163;150 million for Education Maintenance Allowances to provide students of 16 and over in 56 LEAs with funding to support their costs and provide incentives.

<a name="10404w03.html_para0">We have given guidance to LEAs, who have a duty to assess and respond to local transport needs, on how best to work in partnership with colleges in providing local transport and local policies.

<P>
<a name="10404w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 ONS announced on 19 July 2000 that they would be introducing a new annual survey of employee jobs--the Annual Business Inquiry (ABI)--to 



<P>
<P><I>4 Apr 2001 : Column: 193W</I><P>
replace the Annual Employment Survey. The new statistics will be published in the Labour Market First Release on 11 April. These data are used in national regional and local estimates of employee jobs and the national and regional Workforce Jobs series. In addition the estimates are used in the calculation of claimant count rates nationally, regionally and locally and in national and regional productivity estimates.
<P>

<a name="10404w04.html_para0">Work carried out by ONS established that the ABI was the better estimate of employee jobs in the economy and that the errors in the previous estimate had occurred back over time. ONS have indicated the following on the likely effects.
<P>

<a name="10404w04.html_para1"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Early indications, from mid-2000, were that the revisions will show 500,000 to 750,000 more jobs for 1998 than previously estimated. If these indications of the scale are applied to the claimant unemployment rate, then the 1998 UK rate would be revised down by 0.2 percentage points.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10404w04.html_para2"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The UK claimant count level is unaffected.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10404w04.html_para3"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Productivity levels will be revised down, but growth rates will only be slightly affected by the introduction of the ABI. An improved methodology is being introduced from 1997 onwards.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10404w04.html_para4"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Revisions will take place over the history of the series.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10404w04.html_para5">Locally, employee job estimates and claimant unemployment rates for regions, local authorities and parliamentary constituencies will also be revised. DfEE like all users have no indication of the scale of these revisions for each local area. The claimant count rates will be revised downwards nationally. Past experience suggests that although the local rates will in general be revised down some local claimant rates may be revised up.
<P>

<a name="10404w04.html_para6">As the revisions will be over the history of the series, changes over time in these series will be relatively unaffected.
<P>

<a name="10404w04.html_para7">There will also be annual seasonal adjustment reviews to the Labour Force Survey, claimant count and vacancies series. These do not usually lead to significant revisions.
<P>

<a name="10404w04.html_para8">The information available from ONS only gives some indication of the likely scale of the revisions. DfEE will fully assess any impact on our policies once we have the exact information available to us. However, the indication that changes over time will be relatively unaffected suggests that the impact on our policies will not be major.
<P>

<a name="10404w04.html_para9">Full details on the new statistics will be available on 11 April from the House of Commons Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10404w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Manual of Military Law Part III (MML Pt III) was first published in 1958. MML Pt III is an academic legal text, a reference document for lawyers, and a detailed, if dated, commentary on the rules of war. In practice, the incorporation of legal requirement in 



<P>
<P><I>4 Apr 2001 : Column: 197W</I><P>
Rules of Engagement, courses on international law at all levels at appropriate times, and cards setting out main war crimes issued to servicemen going into combat are all more relevant to servicemen than MML Pt III. As such, MML Pt III is only one way in which the Law of Armed Conflict is disseminated in the Army.
<P>

<a name="10404w05.html_para0">There are no plans to reprint MML Pt III in its current form but it has not been withdrawn from circulation. Copies are still held at unit and formation level and further copies may be requested from the Central Services Establishment, Llangennech.
<P>

<a name="10404w05.html_para1">MML Pt III is being completely rewritten as a Joint Service Publication (JSP 383) and will therefore cover the law of armed conflict applicable to land, sea and air operations. A timetable for publication and distribution has not yet been fixed as draft texts are still being considered.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) if he will make a statement on his plans to make greater use of the Commonwealth as a source of potential army recruits; which <i>(a)</i> countries and <i>(b)</i> specialities will be targeted; and what the budget of the recruitment exercise will be;  [156793]
<P>

<P>
(3) if the plans to make greater use of the Commonwealth as a source of potential army recruits include recruitment from Commonwealth countries whose head of state is not Her Majesty the Queen; and if he will make a statement;  [156795]
<P>
(4) what oath of allegiance will be taken by non-British recruits from Commonwealth countries when they are enlisted into the British Army under the plans in the Strategy for the Army.  [156797]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10404w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Army has no plans to recruit actively from the Commonwealth and there is, therefore, no specific budget allocated to this area of recruitment. Applications are welcomed from Commonwealth citizens, subject to their meeting the normal entry criteria, irrespective of whether the Queen is head of state or not. Successful applicants are placed wherever vacancies exist according to their qualifications, performance at selection and preferences, where possible; there are no plans to institute "Commonwealth" regiments. Individuals enlist under the same terms and conditions of service as UK applicants and are required to swear an oath of allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen as head of the Commonwealth. The visits made to Fiji and St. Vincent and the Grenadines by army selection teams in 1999 and 2000 took place in order to process the large backlog of applications from these countries; no new recruitment was undertaken during these visits. The British Army has traditionally welcomed members of the Commonwealth as soldiers and officers. It is perhaps the spread of information via the world wide web and similar mediums that has increased the level of interest from overseas areas in recent months.

<P>
<a name="10404w07.html_spnew0"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 The Government's policy is to ensure that free to air broadcasters, with a reach of at least 95 per cent. of the population, are given a fair and reasonable opportunity to acquire the rights to broadcast live coverage of "crown jewel" events. As paragraph 9 of the ITC code--last revised in January 2000--explains, it does not guarantee that the event will be broadcast live. Rights holders are not obliged to sell live rights and broadcasters are not obliged to purchase them or to show the events. However, any UK broadcaster that obtains the rights to live coverage of the whole or part of a listed event cannot broadcast exclusively live in the UK without first seeking the consent of the ITC.

<a name="10404w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 April 2001]:</i> We cannot join the Credit Industry Fraud Avoidance System (CIFAS) because it would entail DSS making data about claimants available to the private sector. Members of CIFAS seek their customers' consent to this. In the case of social security benefits, I am advised that making entitlement to benefits conditional upon claimants' giving consent to release of their personal data to organisations such as CIFAS would not constitute real consent, as the claimants often have no choice but to claim benefits from DSS. The alternative of releasing information only for those claimants that gave their consent would be valueless, as fraudsters would hardly be likely to give such consent.
<P>

<a name="10404w07.html_para1">However, we have set up a working party with the private sector to examine what information held by the DSS could be made available within existing legal constraints.

As we procure new IT we will build in the capability we require. The Department is specifying requirements and it is the suppliers' job to decide what form the solutions should take.

<a name="10404w07.html_para3">The Commissioner confirms the approach taken by decision makers in relation to the operation of the Social Security Act 1998 and the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999. That is, decision makers can make the decision to 'supersede at the same rate' where there is a change of circumstances but it does not change the existing award, and can refuse to supersede a decision where the application cannot possibly affect the existing award.
<P>

<a name="10404w07.html_para4">The Commissioner also held that it is necessary for a new claim for benefit to be made, in all cases, before there can be a supersession for change of circumstances. It is our view that this was a ruling on a point of law which was incidental to the decisions reached, rather than a necessary part of the legal reasoning. Accordingly, the Commissioner's decisions on this point do not constitute binding rulings. For that reason we have decided not to appeal these decisions and we have not asked for existing guidance to decision makers to be altered.

 The importation of meat is permitted from a limited number of third countries where foot and mouth disease is present and where the veterinary authorities have contained the disease in specified regions. EC rules permit imports from those regions of the relevant countries that are not considered to pose a risk to human or animal health. Fully matured boneless beef, which does not pose an FMD risk, may in some cases be imported from other regions subject to veterinary certification. Countries to which these controls currently apply are Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Uruguay. Because of their FMD situation, prohibitions are currently in place on imports from South Africa, Swaziland and Argentina; countries from which imports were previously permitted. All meat imported from third countries is subject to veterinary checks at Border Inspection Posts to ensure that import requirements are met.

 <i>[holding answer 26 March 2001]:</i> Road mats treated with disinfectant provide a limited measure of protection against the spread of the FMD virus as they only apply disinfectant to the tyre treads of vehicles passing over them.

 <i>[holding answer 30 March 2001]:</i> A range of options is available to farmers whose stock are short of food, or facing other welfare threats, as a result of FMD movement restrictions. We have produced advisory material on how to safeguard animal welfare in such circumstances; and we have introduced a scheme to license movements both locally, and over longer distances, for welfare reasons. Finally, the livestock welfare (disposal) scheme provides an outlet for those animals that are prevented from moving as normal and are consequently at risk of suffering.

 <i>[holding answer 29 March 2001]:</i> The added costs involved in the livestock slaughter scheme currently being absorbed by the abattoir sector are substantial and these have to be taken into account. These costs include the reduction in throughput due to cleaning and disinfection procedures in the lairage, more thorough ante and post mortem inspections for foot and mouth disease and reduced supplies of available livestock. MAFF is now aware that abattoirs are operating as a monopoly but any evidence of this should be reported to the Office of Fair Trading.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10404w11.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 In deciding to increase the minimum area requirement from 3 ha to 10 ha we took account of comments received during public consultation and of an independent evaluation of the previous hill livestock compensatory allowance scheme. This suggested that very small farms are less in need of aid than farms in higher size categories.

<a name="10404w14.html_para0">Dr. Donnelly's research showed that, if the United Kingdom's ban on the sale for human consumption of beef from animals aged over 30 months at time of slaughter is enforced, and if the French Government's controls on cattle feed have eliminated the feed-borne transmission of BSE to French cattle born after mid-1996, there is virtually no risk from French beef consumed in the UK.
<P>

<a name="10404w14.html_para1">The research found that even if enforcement was only 75 per cent., the risk from French beef would be comparable to that from UK beef.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health, pursuant to the statement by the Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food, the right hon. Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West (Ms Quin) of 21 December 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 558, if he will

<P>
<P>
<a name="10404w14.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 January 2001]:</i> My right hon. Friend did not claim that, but referred to signs from manufacturers and retailers that they were using beef from cattle that were not over 30-months-old at slaughter. This information had been obtained by the Food Standards Agency and by local authorities in connection with increased enforcement checks on compliance with the generally applicable ban on the sale for human consumption of beef from cattle aged over-30-months at slaughter (the OTM rule). The Meat Hygiene Service and local authorities were required to carry out those checks by the FSA from last November. High levels of compliance were found and some companies changed their procurement arrangements to ensure that appropriate supplier documentation confirmed compliance with the OTM rule.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many broiler chickens slaughtered in the United Kingdom were rejected as unfit for human consumption in 1999.  [150184]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10404w14.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 I am informed by the Food Standards Agency that responsibility for the enforcement of meat hygiene legislation in licensed poultry slaughterhouses in Great Britain rests with the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS), and in Northern Ireland with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.
<P>

<a name="10404w14.html_para2">Information relating to Great Britain is not available in the form requested as MHS data are based on cause of condemnation rather than whether the carcase was partially or fully condemned. However, it is estimated that in 1999, approximately 6.6 million whole carcases from poultry weighing under 2kg (a category that includes broiler chickens, cast hens and other poultry) were condemned as unfit for human consumption post-slaughter. This represents approximately 1 per cent. of the total throughput of poultry weighing under 2kg slaughtered in Great Britain during that period.
<P>

<a name="10404w14.html_para3">In Northern Ireland, 62.3 million broiler chickens were slaughtered during 1999, of which 0.6 million were subsequently rejected as unfit for human consumption.

 We accept there is a need for European Union rules on food supplements to tackle trade problems. This is because member states have a range of regulatory systems, with differing requirements. Generally these are more restrictive than the United Kingdom's safety based approach. We are pressing for a safety based approach to regulation of these products at EU level, in the interests of maintaining consumer choice.

<P>

<a name="10404w15.html_para0">The Food Standards Agency (FSA), which is representing the Government in negotiations for harmonised EU legislation on food supplements, has consulted interested parties on the effects of the Commission's proposal. Representations have been received from consumer organisations, individuals, nutrition therapists and professional public health groups, food supplement manufacturers and their trade associations, retailers and enforcement bodies. All these groups support our view that the market should be open to products which are safe and properly labelled. A number of consultees have pointed out that the proposed legislation could significantly restrict the range of vitamin and mineral substances which could be used in food supplements, and the availability of high dose supplements. We are pressing for amendments to the draft directive to take into account the wide range of safe products available in the UK.
<P>

<a name="10404w15.html_para1">Clear, accurate labelling is essential to help consumers make informed choices. The FSA is pressing for a number of improvements to EU food labelling rules. These include mandatory, easy to use nutrition labelling and an effective and practical system for the verification and approval of health claims at EU level. The agency is also calling for the arrangements for health claims to allow the use of disease risk reduction claims where they are valid and presented in an appropriate context.

Copies of both documents have been placed in the Library. Representations on the directive have been received mainly during the regular dialogue the MCA holds with representatives of herbal interest groups. These constructive discussions have covered most aspects of the directive, including the possible criteria for assessing traditional use, the position of non European herbal traditions, and aspects of safety, quality and information to the consumer.
