 English Heritage has made every effort to minimise the effects of the reduction in its budget for 2011-12 on its support for archaeology and associated activities. It has done this by protecting, so far as possible, its advisory services to local authorities, and its listing, scheduling and other designation activities. In addition, it has carried out a root and branch re-organisation of its processes for prioritising resources to understand and protect heritage, and has maintained the National Heritage Commissions Programme, through which it supports the work of others, at the highest possible level.</p>

 As of April 2011 the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) had directly awarded contracts to seven suppliers registered in the London borough of Bexley. These figures only account for the contracts awarded by the ODA to its own top tier of contractors (tier one contractors). The figures do not include the contracts further down the supply chain, in tiers two, three and so on, which are awarded by the tier one contractors and not by the ODA. The ODA estimates that tens of thousands more contracts will be generated throughout its supply chains.

This has helped fly home over 12,700 migrant workers from the borders, provided emergency shelter for up to 12,000 people driven out of their homes by the fighting, funded the emergency evacuation of 5,000 people from Misrata, and supplied urgently needed food, medical supplies and medical personnel. DFID has also contributed around £5.25 million through the European Commission (EC). In addition, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has contributed £500,000 to the United Nations Department for Political Affairs for activity to encourage a positive political and stabilisation process in Libya.</p>

 The table shows how much aid the UK has provided to the Palestinian people over the last three years through our imputed share of European Union (EU) aid spending in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs); through UN agencies such as the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), World Food Programme and UN Mines Action Services; and through bilateral programming which includes both financial assistance to the Palestinian Authority (PA) and various projects across the OPTs,</p>

For example, our financial assistance to the Palestinian Authority (PA), via a World Bank Trust Fund, helps pay for basic services and salaries of public sector workers in both Gaza and the West Bank. The table disaggregates Gaza-specific assistance (such as support for humanitarian and early recovery activity) where it is possible to do so. EU assistance to the OPTs is similarly provided via a variety of instruments, and from the information available it is not possible to disaggregate between Gaza and the West Bank.</p>

<sup>(1)</sup> In 2006 ambulance staff were collected under new, more detailed, occupation codes. As a result, qualified totals and support to ambulance staff totals are not directly comparable with previous years.
<sup>(2)</sup> The new headcount methodology for 2010 data is not fully comparable with previous years data due to improvements that make it a more stringent count of absolute staff numbers. Further information on the headcount methodology is available in the Census publication here:
www.ic.nhs.uk/webfiles/publications/010_Workforce/nhsstaff0010/Census_Bulletin_March_2011_Final.pdf
<i>Notes:</i>
It is impossible to separately identify those staff who were 'employed to provide services direct to the public' from the census data. It is assumed that all staff who are not in the 'NHS Infrastructure Support' staff group have some contact with patients or the public.
<i>Data Quality:</i>
The NHS Information Centre for health and social care seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data but responsibility for data accuracy lies with the organisations providing the data. Methods are continually being updated to improve data quality where changes impact on figures already published. This is assessed but unless it is significant at national level figures are not changed. Impact at detailed or local level is footnoted in relevant analyses.

               <b>Mr Simon Burns:</b>
 In 2009-10, the latest year for which figures are available, the national health service spent approximately £37 billion with external suppliers on the procurement of goods and services, of which £16.5 billion is spent by NHS providers (NHS trusts and NHS foundation trusts). This £16.5 billion comprises a number of different expenditure categories such as drugs, non-clinical supplies and services, transport and establishment, all of which may include elements of medical supplies and equipment, but the category “clinical supplies and services” will cover most of the purely medical supplies and associated equipment purchased by NHS providers. Expenditure in this particular category for 2009-10 was £4.5 billion.</p>

               <a name="11051253000611"> In future years NHS providers will continue to be free to make their own procurement decisions from within their own budgets. However, efficiencies across the NHS in the region of £15-20 billion by the end of 2013-14 are required under the Quality, Innovation, Productivity and Prevention initiative which includes projected efficiency savings of £1.2 billion from procurement by the end of 2013-14. To achieve this the Department has a comprehensive procurement strategy in place based around three key work strands of greater transparency on pricing; promoting and improving the national collaborative bodies such as NHS Supply Chain; and product standardisation and rationalisation.</p>

These include analysing data about children's homes, working with areas which have high concentrations of children's homes to identify features of good and poor practice and commissioning research about the characteristics and needs of the workforce in children's homes. The Department for Education is working closely with partners in the sector to make sure that the learning from this work is shared as widely as possible to support service improvement.</p>

 We will not require local authorities to provide data to further education and sixth form colleges in respect of young people’s eligibility for the new 16-19 bursary fund. We will provide guidance to schools, colleges and training providers regarding the kind of evidence they might wish to seek from young people claiming a guaranteed £1,200 bursary. Beyond that, schools, colleges and training providers will be able to exercise their discretion to award bursaries to young people—including those who were in receipt of free school meals in year 11—in ways that best fit their needs and circumstances.</p>

 We have had no discussions with banks on the provision of bank accounts for 16-year-olds who are to receive bursaries. Arrangements for young people to open bank accounts were discussed at the time of the introduction of the education maintenance allowance and are unchanged by the announcement of the 16-19 bursary fund. Young people aged 16 are able to open a basic bank account, which is offered by 16 members of the British Bankers Association. This account will allow for receipt of the bursary, including by cashless means, and will allow funds to be withdrawn via ATMs as well as via standing orders and direct debits where necessary.  <br/>

 The power proposed in clause 41 of the Education Bill exists across a number of inspection remits. There is a similar power in respect of school inspections, boarding welfare inspections and education inspections of independent schools. The power has been used extremely rarely in relation to schools and we envisage that it will only be used in exceptional circumstances for colleges. We expect this to be in cases where, for example, the Secretary of State has significant concerns about an institution.</p>

Other disabled young people will be able to apply for a bursary from their school or college.

1. The information provided is Management Information. Our preference is to answer all parliamentary questions using Official/National Statistics but in this case we only have Management Information available. It is not quality assured to the same extent as Official/National statistics and there are some issues with the data, for example, it does not include applications which were processed clerically and have not yet been entered on to the Social Fund Computer System.
2. The number of initial awards does not include awards made on review.
3. The question has been interpreted as asking for the volumes of crisis loan awards for alignment purposes as interim payments are different and do not come under the Social Fund remit.
4. The proportion of all crisis loan funding which was for alignment purposes is different to the proportion of awards because of the different award amounts given for different crisis loan applications. Awards for alignment purposes tend to be lower than those for other crisis loan awards.
5. Crisis loans for alignment purposes can be awarded prior to a new benefit claim or to the applicants first wage. Awards for alignment to first wage are small (less than 5% of all alignment awards).

                     <i>Notes</i>:
1. The preferred statistics on benefits are now derived from 100% data sources. However, the 5% sample data still provide some detail not yet available from the 100% data sources, in particular, more complete information on the disabling condition of DLA claimants. DWP recommends that, where the detail is only available on the 5% sample data, or disabling condition (DLA) is required, the proportions derived should be scaled up to the overall 100% total for the benefit. This has been done here.
2. Caseload figures are rounded to the nearest 100.
3. Caseload totals show the number of people in receipt of an allowance and exclude those with entitlement where the payment has been suspended, for example if they are in hospital.
4. Learning difficulties includes the following disabling conditions:
‘F86’—‘Down's Syndrome’
‘F87’—‘Fragile X syndrome’
‘F90’—‘Other Learning Disability’
‘F91’—‘Autism’
‘F92’—‘Asperger Syndrome’
‘F94’—‘Retts Disorder’

 There has been no recent assessment of the effectiveness of the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002—known as COSHH. However COSHH implements, among others, Directive 98/24/EC, the chemical agents directive, and the UK was obliged to assess the impact of the first five years of practical implementation of chemical agents directive in 2007.</p>

 We continue to support the principle that tenants in the private rented sector should be responsible for managing their rental payments. There are safeguards in place so that housing benefit can be paid to the landlord if the tenant is unable or unlikely to pay their rent. Benefit is also paid direct to the landlord if the tenant is in arrears by eight weeks’ rent.</p>

 We continue to support the principle that tenants in the private rented sector should be responsible for managing their rental payments. There are safeguards in place so that housing benefit can be paid to the landlord if the tenant is unable or unlikely to pay their rent. Benefit is also paid direct to the landlord if the tenant is in arrears by eight weeks’ rent.</p>

 Representations have been received from both Shelter and Crisis on the direct payment of housing benefit for tenants in the private rented sector.

Shelter based their recommendation on a survey of claimants and a poll of landlords and they made these points in their response to the housing benefit reforms announced in the June 2010 Budget.</p>

This work concluded that the existing legislative framework, established under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974, is sufficient to manage the hazards associated with emerging energy technologies and did not identify a current need to extend the permissioning regime adopted in the offshore oil and gas sector to offshore wind development. HSE is supplementing this approach by working with industry to encourage the spread of relevant good practice developed by existing offshore industries into new energy sectors. The Government will continue to monitor the application of health and safety legislation to all areas of emerging energy to ensure that hazards are managed and controlled effectively.</p>

 A measurement exercise to estimate the level of official error in the basic state pension is carried out each year. However, measurement of customer error and fraud is only carried out occasionally. The last time customer error and fraud were measured was in 2005-06. Therefore, each time the Department issues updated fraud and error data, the 2005-06 rates for customer error and fraud in the basic state pension are used, multiplied by current expenditure to give a cash figure.</p>

That's why it is being designed to consider an individual's personal circumstances and the support they need, rather than basing eligibility on a specific medical condition.</p>

               <a name="11051253001104"> The new assessment better reflects our understanding of disability in the 21st century and will take account of physical, sensory, mental, intellectual and cognitive impairments. This will ensure that support is targeted on those disabled people whose impairments have the greatest impact on their ability to live independent lives. We will continue to work with disabled people and their organisations as the detail of the assessment criteria and its operation is developed and tested. We had many helpful responses to our public consultation from individuals with fibromyalgia and fibromyalgia support groups in Tonbridge, Eastbourne and Surrey and Sussex, and hope to continue to work with a broad range of groups going forwards.</p>

 The bonus scheme for the 2009-10 performance year and the previous five years was agreed between Remploy and the previous Administration. This Government believe all Departments, including non-departmental public bodies, need to show restraint in the current economic climate and that bonus payments need to better reflect the financial situation, the Government and the NDPB concerned. The Department, therefore, requested that Remploy apply the Government's bonus cap. A recent employment tribunal found that the previous administration's remuneration settlement in respect of commission payments had to be paid for contractual reasons.</p>

 The bonus scheme for the 2009-10 performance year and the previous five years was agreed between Remploy and the previous Administration. This Government believe all Departments, including non-departmental public bodies, need to show restraint in the current economic climate and that bonus payments need to better reflect the financial situation, the Government and the NDPB concerned. The Department, therefore, requested that Remploy apply the Government's bonus cap. A recent employment tribunal found that the previous administration's remuneration settlement in respect of commission payments had to be paid for contractual reasons.</p>

 By April 2016, women's state pension age will have risen to 63 under the timetable legislated in 1995. The UK, like all other EU member states, is under an obligation to remove gender inequalities currently present in state pension ages.</p>

               <a name="11051253001173"> Directive 79/7 prohibits gender discrimination in social security, including state pensions. The directive allows the setting of state pension age to be a limited exception but this should be done in accordance with the principle that member states may only temporarily allow women to retire earlier than men, in order to allow member states to change gradually their pension systems so that equalisation is achieved.</p>

               <a name="11051253001174"> It has therefore been decided to equalise women's state pension age with men's state pension age before the increase to 66 can take place. This is why our proposed changes begin earlier for women than men.</p>
