To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many people fell out of fuel poverty because of reduced energy prices during the financial year which ended on 31st March 2002.  [90807]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30120w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 It is estimated that in England the number of households in fuel poverty fell by around 1- million between 1996 and 2000. This fall is largely a 



<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 2003 : Column 2W</I><P>
consequence of increased incomes and reduced fuel prices in roughly equal degrees. The impacts of energy efficiency schemes since 1998 are not included in this estimate. Information is not available specifically for the year ending 31 March 2002.
<P>

<a name="30120w01.html_para2">Further analyses of fuel poverty and explanations of the methods used to produce these, are given at <i>www.dti.gov.uk/energy/consumers/fuel&#95;poverty/.</i>

 Pechiney Aviatube have received an offer of a &pound;240,000 Regional Selective Assistance grant support towards the &pound;2 million first stage of a project intended to upgrade facilities at the plant. The North West Development Agency is also working with the company to identify other forms of support that may be available to them.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how much producing her Department's latest Annual Report cost; how many copies were printed; how many copies of it were sold at its cover price; to whom copies of the report have been provided free of charge; and how many copies were provided free of charge.  [90890]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30120w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The cost incurred by the Department for design and artwork of the latest Expenditure Plans report (June 2002) was &pound;32,161. This figure includes the costs incurred in placing an electronic version of the report on the departmental website. Other costs of printing and publication were met directly by the publisher, The Stationery Office Ltd. (TSO), and did not fall to the Government. TSO recoups these costs through sales and uses its commercial judgment as to the number of copies printed. Some 420 copies of the latest Expenditure Plans report were sold at the cover price (&pound;25) by TSO or through its accredited agents and other booksellers.
<P>

<a name="30120w01.html_para3">In addition, the Department circulated some 540 complimentary copies to Ministers, Opposition Front Bench spokesmen, Select Committee Members and staff, other Peers and MPs, the Parliamentary Libraries, DTI officials and external Board Members (including in agencies and NDPBs), officials in other Government Departments and journalists.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what the total energy requirement of the United Kingdom's cement kilns <i>(a)</i> is and <i>(b)</i> is expected to be over the next 20 years; and if she will forecast the maximum quantity and types of waste these cement kilns can digest over this time period.  [88568]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30120w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Government do not have information on the total current and future energy requirement of cement kilns. However, estimates from the British Cement Association suggest that in the short term (3&#150;5 years) the potential use of waste in cement kilns, by a range of products, could be around 1&#150;1&#189; million tonnes per year.

 <i>[holding answer 16 January 2003]:</i> The Energy Review published in February 2002 by the Performance and Innovation Unit indicated that the Government would set out its detailed response in an Energy White Paper later in the year. The Consultation document for the White Paper issued in May 2002 said the Government intended to issue a White Paper around the turn of the year. In a reply to a Parliamentary Question in October 2002 Ministers said that they planned to publish the White Paper in the new Year.

 The number of jobs in the defence sector that are created, secured or sustained as a result of export credit guarantees is difficult to estimate as the amount of ECGD support for particular industry sectors can vary widely from year to year. In UK Defence Statistics 2002 the Defence Analytical Services Agency estimates that total UK defence exports, only some of which have ECGD support&#151;have on average supported around 100,000 jobs in the defence industry over the last five years.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what proportion of pledged assistance for the reconstruction of Afghanistan has been received by the Afghan Government; and how much of the financial assistance so far received by the interim Government of Afghanistan has been spent on projects other than humanitarian aid.

 At the conference in Tokyo in 2001 the international community pledged over US$4 billion to the reconstruction of Afghanistan over periods of 1&#150;5 years. In the current financial year close to the $1.8 billion pledged at Tokyo for the current financial year has been disbursed to Afghanistan. This has been through a number of avenues, including the UN system, NGOs and the Afghan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF). The money directed through the ARTF is available for the Afghan Transitional Administration to utilise as it chooses. To date the ARTF has received over US$200 million from donors.
<P>

<a name="30120w04.html_para3">The international community is committed to the reconstruction of Afghanistan but at the same time it is important to continue to address the needs of the returning and returned refugees, the internally displaced people and those who continue to struggle to survive, particularly during the winter months. To this end many donors continue to provide both humanitarian and reconstruction assistance. The distinction between humanitarian and reconstruction projects is often undefined, with many humanitarian activities having longer-term reconstruction outcomes. In the current financial year DFID has provided &pound;55 million to Afghanistan, &pound;24 million of which has been for reconstruction purposes. The international community as a whole provided $1.067 billion of support to the UN Immediate and Transitional Assistance Programme.

 Zabul province is one of the poorest of Afghanistan's 32 provinces and is suffering from a prolonged drought. Several NGOs are delivering humanitarian relief in the province and have been doing so for some time.

 In 2002 nearly 1.8 million Afghan refugees returned home under the UNHCR assistance programme. In addition more than 250,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) went home with assistance and another 200,000 Afghans returned on their own. The return rate has declined during the winter months, with weekly returns of about 2,000 during December. This compares to a peak of over 100,000 a week in May.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what action was taken by the UK in 2002 to contribute to the prevention of water shortages for the world's population by 2025.  [90460]<P>

 DFID recognises the key role that water plays in the reduction of poverty and is committed to assisting those in the developing world to assess and manage their water resources in a sustainable manner. Nearly two-thirds of the world's population will be living in countries of significant water stress by the year 2025. 1.2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water and 2.4 billion people lack access to basic sanitation. Strong commitments were made at the 2002 Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development for Better Management of Water Resources and Improved Access to Drinking Water and Sanitation, and these must now be implemented.
<P>

<a name="30120w05.html_para0">In 2002, my Department has continued to support a substantial number of on-going activities, which seek to contribute to the prevention of water shortages. Such shortages may be caused because insufficient water is available or because of a lack of infrastructure, poverty or pollution which mean that people cannot access the resource.
<P>

<a name="30120w05.html_para1">The sustainability of the quality and quantity of water resources depends on the balance of agricultural, industrial and domestic uses and environmental needs against the prevailing hydrological conditions. DFID, with most other bilateral and multilateral organisations, is promoting integrated water resource management, which is the coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources.




<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 2003 : Column 17W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30120w05.html_para2">My Department is supporting a number of global initiatives, including the Global Water Partnership; the International Hydrological Programme; the Dams for Development Unit of the World Commission on Dams; Water for Food and Nature Dialogue and the International Programme for Technology and Research in Irrigation and Drainage. My Department also supports initiatives for assessment and monitoring of the status of the world's water through the UNESCO-led World Water Assessment Programme and the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme. Our Knowledge and Research Programme also supports a number of projects that aim to improve meteorological and hydrological assessment, collection, analysis and modelling for improved water resource assessments, as well as projects that investigate improvements in the efficiency of irrigation water use.
<P>

<a name="30120w05.html_para3">There is an increasing possibility of conflicts over water becoming more common in regions of water stress. Equitable sharing of water between users at national and at local level has a significant contribution to make towards reducing conflict and promoting peace and security. The Nile Basin Initiative is a current example of an initiative being supported by the World bank, my Department and other donors, to manage competition for water equitably.

WFP's logistical arrangements have been modified and adjusted as appropriate during the first six months of this emergency operation. The graph shows that the actual corridor use and the estimated use of corridors in the period July-December 2002. The shift, which can be attributed to the GMO and milling issues, has in particular affected the Beira corridor which was expected to supply Zambia and Zimbabwe in much higher quantities. The GMO issue demanded that an increased tonnage of non-GM cereals was purchased in Tanzania and the Republic of South Africa (RSA) whereas as a result of the need for milling of GM cereals, more cargo was routed through the RSA for milling prior to dispatch to Zimbabwe.

<P>

<a name="30120w05.html_para4">It is not realistic simply to extrapolate the actual use of the various corridors during the past six months in order to determine the logistics plan for the next six months. Due to the fact that the availability of non-GM cereals in the region is now limited, WFP will need to make future purchases on the international market and therefore cargo is expected to arrive through the originally planned points of entry. It should be noted that this shift to international purchases will negatively impact on the lead time for arrivals of cereals at the points of entry.
<P>

<a name="30120w05.html_para5">As a result of the increased tonnages of non-GM cereals being purchased on a FCA basis in the RSA, the logistical set-up in Johannesburg had to be revamped when WFP became a major exporter of food commodities rather than an importer.

 Access to Cabinda is difficult and the UK government has been unable to assess the situation on the ground. However as part of its emergency response mandate in Angola, the UN is planning an inter-agency mission to the region at the end of this month.

 The UN has been able to provide food aid to an additional 1 million vulnerable Angolans since the ceasefire agreement last April.

 Around 4 per cent. of DFID's budget for Brazil was spent on water and sanitation projects in the financial years 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01.

<a name="30120w06.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Before a country can qualify for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, it must produce an interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) at Decision Point, setting out what action it will take to develop a full PRSP. To reach Completion Point, the full PRSP must be in place, and under implementation for at least one year. The PRSP sets out the policy action governments are taking to reduce poverty and provide a budgetary framework not only for spending the savings from debt relief but also for allocating all other aid and government revenues that they have the greatest impact on poverty reduction. We believe strongly in the value of the PRSP process, which is leading to improved economic management and social reform. The additional bilateral debt relief provided by the UK goes towards these poverty reduction programmes. The UK is also aligning its development assistance programmes with the PRSPs.

 The main aim of the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative is to ensure that countries exit the HIPC process with sustainable levels of debt. The current framework of the initiative has the flexibility to provide, when appropriate, additional debt relief at completion point, so called &quot;topping up", to countries whose debt sustainability outlook has changed due to exogenous factors since reaching their decision point. The UK is pressing the World bank and the IMF to widen their approach to topping up, so that any HIPC country facing unsustainable debts, that has demonstrated its commitment to poverty reduction and economic reform, should qualify for this additional relief. Debt relief alone, however, cannot guarantee future sustainability. This requires sound macroeconomic policies, strong growth and export bases, including access to markets of developed countries, access to adequate financing on highly concessional loan and grant terms, and prudent policies on new borrowing. The UK is co-financing a debt strategy project aimed at helping HIPC Governments to strengthen their debt management capacity.

Burkina Faso reached its completion point in April 2002&#151;one year late. The reason for this was the delay in completing its PRSP, and the decision by the World bank and IMF to defer consideration of the completion

point until spring 2002, in order to reassess the country's external debt position and to update the debt sustainability analysis.

<a name="30120w07.html_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The UK continues to play a leading role in the implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative, to ensure that as many countries as possible benefit from the enhanced framework. Following UK pressure, it was agreed that the World bank and the IMF would provide additional relief to countries that risk exiting the HIPC process with debts above the 150 per cent. debt/exports ratio. This was reconfirmed at the spring meetings in 2002, when Burkina Faso became the first country to benefit from &quot;topping up". Although we welcome this change, it does not go far enough. The UK has proposed that, in calculating topping up, additional bilateral relief should be excluded from the calculations. We also want to see a more flexible interpretation of the rules, so that any HIPC country facing unsustainable debts, that has demonstrated its commitment to poverty reduction and economic reform, should qualify for this additional relief. The UK has also asked the bank and fund to come forward with proposals to promote the full participation of all creditors in the initiative, including technical assistance to HIPC countries facing legal challenges from non-participating creditors.

 DfID's new draft Country Assistance Plan for Peru is currently being finalised after extensive consultation (the consultation draft is available on the DfID website). The overall objective of the Plan is to contribute to reducing poverty in Peru by 50 per cent. by 2015. We aim to do this by promoting the development of an inclusive society, which is responsive to the rights of the poor and excluded. The Plan focuses on three outcomes: promoting social inclusion, Government working for the poor and economic opportunities for the poor. To achieve these outcomes, we work closely with Peruvian organisations&#151;both the Government and broader society&#151;and the major multilateral development agencies, to improve the effectiveness of national policies, programmes and international assistance.
<P>

<a name="30120w08.html_para7">DfID has a &pound;3.7 million programme in Peru for 2002&#150;03. The UK also funds about 19 per cent. of the EC development programme, and is a 5 per cent. shareholder in the World bank and 1 per cent. shareholder in the IDB.

 The proposed 'Improving Health of the Poor: A Rights Based Approach' programme in Peru has been designed to promote poor and excluded peoples rights to access health care, strengthen the relationships between health service providers and Peruvian citizens and to facilitate greater responsiveness to the needs of the poor within the health sector. The project would support the work of the Ministry of Health, the Ombudsman's office and civil society and has a number of components. The objectives are to: (i) improve public health service policies and institutions to protect and promote the right to health of poor and excluded communities in Peru; (ii) facilitate, with citizens and health care providers, the implementation of participatory mechanisms for the planning, provision and evaluation of health services and (iii) promote the uptake of lessons learned in the programme by the multilateral development organisations working in Peru.

<P>
<a name="30120w08.html_spnew9"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We have made no such assessment. The Rwandan national budget is regularly assessed by the IMF which has reported positively on improvements in the effectiveness and transparency of budget management by the Rwandan Government, and has confirmed it has found no evidence of significant off-budget receipts or expenditure. There is no evidence in the national budget of receipts from the Congo Desk of the RPA. Development aid remains vital to support efforts to eradicate poverty and establish long-term stability in Rwanda following the 1994 genocide. We will continue to support the Government in implementing their poverty reduction strategy within a framework of good governance and respect for human rights.

 Official figures for agricultural production are not issued in Zimbabwe until late February following the national assessment. Preliminary figures indicate that the area planted to maize, the staple crop this year is larger than last. However widespread shortages of tillage, seed and fertilisers will suppress yields. Early planted crops in some areas wilted and had to be replanted. The condition of the maize in the main growing areas is reported to be average. Providing the rains continue then Zimbabwe is expected to produce between 850 000 to 1.0 million tonnes, an improvement over 2002 but only 60 per cent. of its annual maize requirement.

might do to improve the chances of successful prosecutions for the death or serious injury of children where it is clear that the injuries inflicted were caused by one or other parent, but there is no evidence as to which was responsible. Although some measures already contained in the current Criminal Justice Bill, such as those about admissibility of hearsay and evidence of previous misconduct, will help in this respect. We are considering a number of other possibilities with a view to legislation at the earliest possible opportunity.

 At the point where The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) expresses an interest in a particular property or location, and where there is no change of use, local authorities are given two weeks to provide NASS with any concerns they have regarding the potential use of the accommodation as some form of housing for asylum seekers. Where a change in use is required, as in the case of accommodation centres, local authorities have been given eight weeks to respond. However, it is clear that, in those instances when NASS intends to proceed with a contract, consultation and dialogue should continue beyond these minimum periods, and I have ensured that in future this will be the case.

<a name="30120w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In January 2000, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) published the &quot;National Contingency Plan for Marine Pollution from Shipping and Offshore Installations" (NCP), which set out revised command and control procedures for the response to shipping incidents in the UK counter pollution zone following the experiences gained during SEA EMPRESS incident and from the recommendations in Lord Donaldson's review of salvage and intervention and their command and control. The MCA uses regular exercises to test the NCP.

<P>
<a name="30120w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Counter pollution operations at sea are best dealt with through the aerial spraying of dispersants. However, ships with a counter pollution capability to support the recovery of spillages can be resourced from commercial shipping companies, oil spill response organisations and ports. The numbers and locations will vary depending on the primary role of these ships. In Lyme Bay, for instance, craft with a counter pollution capability may be available in the ports of Plymouth, Poole, Weymouth or Portland, but there are no ships solely dedicated for that purpose. The Government has substantial counter pollution stockpiles with mechanical recovery resources to assist in the collection of marine pollution from the sea.

<a name="30120w10.html_para0">Companies and shippers involved in the carriage of hazardous chemicals have plans and equipment for dealing with emergencies whilst the substances are in transit. If an incident escalates expertise and facilities from relevant industries and the MCA are available. The MCA's main response would utilise the specialist chemical equipment in the UK's 'at sea' stockpile and its contracted chemical strike team, who provide both manpower and advice. The UK's National Contingency Plan and the Secretary of States Representative's (SOSREP) powers extend to chemical incidents.

<a name="30120w10.html_para1">The MCA annually commissions a report on the different types of marine pollution in the waters around the British Isles from the Advisory Committee on Protection of the Sea (ACOPS). In the ACOPS Report the type of pollutant has been classified since 2000 into mineral oils, chemicals, garbage, vegetable/animal oils and other substances. Oil and diesel are categorised into the same group. Before 2000 the ACOPS report did not include this level of detail.

<P>
<a name="30120w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 My Department does not make any specific funding available to coastal local authorities for counter-pollution measures. However, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) provides accredited training courses for the maritime local authorities to prepare them for such operations. These courses are primarily based on a response to oil pollution, but the response issues covered are also pertinent to chemical spills. The MCA runs two specific areas of training for local authorities:


<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
<i>Oil Pollution, Contingency Planning and Response</i>
<BR>
A residential training course (five days) for local authority management staff involved in contingency planning and oil spill response. This is run four times a year at locations around the UK, including the MCA's Training Centre in Dorset.
<BR>
<i>Oil Pollution Response</i>
<BR>
A two day hands-on training course in counter pollution response for local authority staff, who would expect to be involved in supervising beach clean-up operations and protective booming operations. These are run eight times a year at locations hosted by maritime local authorities.

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30120w10.html_para3">In the last 24 months the MCA have trained over 150 people on the oil pollution, contingency planning and response courses. The MCA have also run two day hands- on training courses for councils in the following areas since the summer of 2000: Suffolk, Lincolnshire, Merseyside, Hampshire, West Sussex, Cumbria, Somerset, Argyll and Bute, Fife, Kent, Pembrokeshire, Cornwall, Essex, Teeside, Highland and South Wales. Before April 2002 courses will also be run in Inverclyde, North East Scotland, North Devon, Humberside, the Isle of Wight and Dorset.

<a name="30120w10.html_para4">Additionally, the MCA runs a series of decision making in oil spill response courses for the statutory nature conservation bodies, the environmental regulators, the Government Fisheries Departments and the public health authorities in the UK. These are designed to brief, train and prepare the staff of these agencies for their role in the multi-agency response to a pollution incident from shipping. The MCA have run nine of these courses since the beginning of 2000. The MCA also offer 24 hour incident response advice and support to local authorities and maintain a large stockpile of shoreline clean-up equipment at Southampton and Inverness that can be mobilised to an incident if required. The MCA has published a large range of scientific, technical and operational notices to provide guidance for local authorities on a wide range of response issues.

The review concluded that it would not be appropriate to privatise the Mint at the time because of Mint's large change programme; the Treasury's customer relationship with Mint; and uncertainties in the market place, particularly relating to euro coinage.

<P>

 There are no income tax receipts forgone but the cost to the Exchequer of the reduced rate of VAT on energy saving materials introduced in 1998 and extended in 2000 can be found in the relevant Financial Statement and Budget Reports. The cost is estimated at &pound;5 million in 1998&#150;99, &pound;10 million in 1999&#150;2000 and &pound;45 million in subsequent years. The increased cost from 2000&#150;01 results from to the extension of the reduced rates to installations in all homes.

 Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) at Farnborough are scheduled to move to Portsdown in late 2006. At this stage it is not possible to predict whether any particular member of staff will leave Dstl rather than move to the new site.
<P>

<a name="30120w18.html_para0">Dstl currently has a low annual turnover of staff and has an effective recruitment and training strategy. Dstl always looks to develop the talents and capabilities of existing staff and would look to existing staff to fill any vacancies at a more senior level, at the same time continuing to recruit and train staff to fill in behind them. Dstl does not therefore envisage a significant increase in such costs attributable to their relocation plans.

 The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) has been and remains keen to work with staff and trade unions to reduce the impact on staff of their relocation plans. Discussions with TUs have been open and constructive.
<P>

<a name="30120w18.html_para2">Dstl has completed a formal consultation with TUs together with a series of seminars for staff where the relocation plans were explained and staff feedback requested. These responses were used to inform the series of decisions needed on how best to structure the laboratory in the future.

<P>
<P>

 Approximately 19,000 military personnel are available for duties associated with the firefighters' strike. Of these, approximately 3,000 are drawn from the Royal Navy and are employed in both the firefighting and support roles.
<P>

<a name="30120w18.html_para4">The armed forces role during strike periods has been and will continue to be to provide emergency cover, thus seeking to save lives and ensuring that essential services are maintained.

 I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave on 15 January, <i>Official Report</i>, column 638W. The final nuclear safety justification is planned for February 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30120w18.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The damage to HMS Trafalgar, following her grounding on 6 November 2002, is centred around her forward sonar.
<P>

<a name="30120w18.html_para6">Surveys to fully scope the damage and assess the necessary repairs are currently being undertaken in Devonport dockyard. These include survey of the forward sonar (the damaged area), a full structural assessment of the forward main ballast tanks, foreplane operating gear, anchor operating gear and associated faired coverings.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30120w18.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 HMS Trafalgar was due to enter a period of extended maintenance in April 2003. Her withdrawal from service in November 2002 has therefore not had a significant effect on the overall capability of the submarine fleet.

 The current system of recording complaints about low flying does not include the constituency within which the complainant resides.

 There are no &quot;training run routes" for low level jet fighters across the Taunton constituency; as part of their training, aircrew are instructed and encouraged to constantly vary their routes in order to maintain the training value. In common with the rest of the United Kingdom, the whole of the Taunton constituency is open to low flying training by military aircraft in order to spread the disturbance as thinly as possible. However, a number of areas are excluded, such as restricted airspace around civil aerodromes, glider sites, certain industrial sites and the larger centres of population (generally towns with over 10,000 inhabitants).

 The Royal Navy does not allocate units specifically for the protection of British oilfields.

<a name="30120w19.html_para4">Replacement forces began a rolling programme of training on 15 January. They will receive the same training package as those personnel being withdrawn from Operation Fresco duties. All units will have completed their training by 25 January but only those that have completed their training prior to 21 January will be able to assume Operation Fresco duties for a strike that day. Consequently, elements of 16 Air Assault Brigade will remain committed until the full complement of replacements are available to provide emergency cover. This ensures that there will be no diminution of the level of commitment to provide emergency fire and rescue cover nor a reduction in the quality of that cover.
<P>

<a name="30120w19.html_para5">A direct correlation between the locations of those being withdrawn and the replacements cannot be made. This is because adjustments are being made to the deployment locations of a number of units in addition to those listed above and some of the units will only be deployed on Operation Fresco for a strike on 21 January. There will not, however, be any change in capability at any of the temporary fire stations.

 As part of the Ministry of Defence Estate London (MODEL) project, it is proposed that the United States Navy (USN) should be offered the opportunity to consolidate its London operations at Uxbridge, in place of the seven sites in the London area it currently occupies. The site would remain the property of Her Majesty's Government. The changes are subject to formal MOD approval procedures, discussions with the USN and the United States approval procedures. Should the USN not participate in the project, the site will be considered for alternative Government use, and if none is found, it is likely that the site will be disposed of.

<i>[holding answer 15 January 2003]:</i> The Ministry of Defence, like other Government Departments, has recently completed a thorough review of its retirement policy for civilian staff in light of the Government's policy. Some two-thirds of the work force already have the option to work up to the age of 65. The review concluded that our current policy was consistent with departmental needs and that any change, including extending this option to those who currently have to retire at age 60, should be made through the implementation of the legislation on age discrimination that the Government are committed to introduce by 2006. We shall also have regard for the outcome of the consultation on greater flexibility for individuals to work beyond the present retirement age which the Government have initiated in the recently published Green Paper on Pensions.

<P>
<a name="30120w20.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The threat from terrorist attack is kept under constant review and the Ministry of Defence works closely with other Government Departments on the protection of merchant shipping. The Royal Navy's worldwide Maritime Trade Operations&#151;known as UK MTO arrangements&#151;enable a number of options to be offered in support of merchant shipping, graduated to the prevailing threat. These range from the provision of routine advice and guidance through to naval supervision. The appropriate level of MTO support required in a given area remains under constant assessment. For example, UK MTO arrangements in the Gulf have been enhanced since October 2001 by the establishment of a UK MTO liaison cell in the region. If necessary, higher level Maritime Trade Operations can be implemented very quickly. Information on specific measures to protect naval shipping were provided in my answer to the hon. Member on 15 January, <i>Official Report</i>, column 640W.

 The Watchkeeper programme seeks to acquire an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) capability which will provide United Kingdom commanders with accurate, timely and high quality imagery. It is a key element of the Government's efforts to develop a truly network enabled capability, so critical to enhancing the ability of our forces to bring military effect to bear in a timely manner. Bids were received from the companies competing for the remainder of the Watchkeeper programme assessment phase in mid 2002, and additional points of clarification were sought from each bidder in December 2002. Any additional costs incurred by the bidders in addressing these outstanding issues are matter for the respective bidders. We plan to announce a decision on down-select as soon as possible.

However, the interpretation of this definition does vary amongst EU member states.

In the interim, the UK continues to provide assistance to former Soviet Union countries in a number of areas, including safe storage of nuclear submarine fuel and site characterisation work in NW Russia, nuclear safety assistance to Kazakhstan, and measures to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons expertise from closed nuclear cities in Russia.

It would be wrong to conclude without such further analysis that companies whose names appear may have acted wrongfully. The premature publication of the names of individuals or companies that may appear in the declaration could therefore unjustifiably damage the reputations of such individuals or companies. Any evidence of wrongdoing disclosed by the Iraqi declaration will be vigorously investigated by the relevant authority and, where appropriate, further announcements may be made.

Nor, of course, can the Attorney General shift his responsibility for making the decision on to the shoulders of his colleagues. If political considerations which in the broad sense that I have indicated affect Government in the abstract arise it is the Attorney General, applying his judicial mind, who has to be the sole judge of those considerations".

 In accordance with Action Point 14 of the Revitalising Health and Safety Strategy, a High Level Forum (HLF), comprising representatives from all main Government Departments to provide leadership on health and safety management issues within the civil service was established in January 2001.

In August 2002, HLF issued a Good Practice Guide to all Departments and their agencies reminding them of the current legal requirements that they should meet and setting out a number of basic aims which they should look to have in place. These included having in place a Health and Safety Policy Statement, a nominated Board member with responsibility for Health and Safety, a report on health and safety performance in annual reports (Action Point 13) and a properly structured health and safety management system linked to adoption of the ministerial checklist (Action Point 12) and the Health and Safety Executive's guidance Successful Health and Safety Management (HSG 65).

Total membership has of the harmonized schemes has risen, with benefits in occupancy levels for members, but not as much as had been hoped. Therefore, a two-stage review of NQAS is being planned.

 The Government consider not just regeneration of traditional tourism but also the generation of new activity, in line with developing consumer tastes, to be hugely important. Building on Government strategy in Tomorrow's Tourism, the English Tourism Council published 'Sea Changes', which outlines recommendations for successful regeneration of England's traditional resorts. A key point is that tourism may well play an important role in resort regeneration, but will rarely be the sole source of a sustainable local economy. Local government recognises the importance of tourism and its document 'A Change of Scene', which this Department supported, sets out many useful ideas for dealing with tourism-related regeneration. The Government's view is that local government has a key role in improving and supporting the regeneration of resorts, amenities and services, as do the regions, the private sector and its

trade associations, and many central government departments. In line with Tomorrow's Tourism, much progress has been made, including, for instance, initiatives on accommodation quality (including the lower end of the market) and programmes to improve bathing water standards and beach amenities (now better than ever before). Local Authorities are well aware that other services they provide, such as visitor information or the provision of litter services, contribute significantly towards the creation of attractive environments and lead to improvements in visitor experience. Our recently announced new emphasis on domestic marketing and the regional dimension to tourism strategy, will help stimulate focus on the importance of maintaining high quality amenities and services for tourism across the country, including our traditional resorts.

 Recent BTA campaigns have been themed around Britain's key strengths of great heritage, great countryside, great sport and great cities. The BTA evaluates the impact of its campaigns in the overseas markets in which they run. A new overseas strategy will advance this approach further by introducing market-specific campaign themes and marketing tools.

The purpose of the leadership review is to: (i) develop and introduce a 'leadership profile' for Defra staff from top down to G7; (ii) implement a programme of Development Centres and supporting coaching based on the leadership profile and which also builds on earlier leadership development; (iii) focus future learning on supporting the change in culture and performance identified by the Joint Strategic Review; (iv) help individuals reduce any gaps between current and desired skills and competencies; and (v) generate a culture of learning within Defra so that staff outside the target group are properly supported in their own learning and development.

Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) on 18 December 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 801W, if she will make a statement on the reason underlying the number of copies of the document <i>(a)</i> printed and <i>(b)</i> distributed; and what the cost of its production and distribution was.  [89765]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30120w27.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 We arranged for 5,000 copies of the consultation document to be printed because we believed this would be a sufficient number to allow distribution to all stakeholders with an interest in the issues set out in the document. The 5,000 figure also allowed for the Department to retain sufficient copies which could be distributed to members of the public who made direct requests for copies.
<P>

<a name="30120w27.html_para0">1,400 copies were handed out at the Urban Summit, where the consultation was launched. Over 2,000 copies were initially sent out to local authorities, police, businesses, trade associations, Government Departments

<P>
<a name="30120w27.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 A list of drainage boards wholly or partly in England, together with income and expenditure figures for the years 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02, have today been placed in the Libraries of the House. Information for later years is not yet available, as this is submitted on an annual basis. Flood defence is a fully devolved responsibility and the information related to boards in Wales should be sought from the National Assembly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30120w27.html_spnew3"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 The current institutional arrangements for flood and coastal defence are currently being considered in the Flood and Coastal Defence Funding Review. While, along with ministerial colleagues, I am currently considering the conclusions of the review, I would expect to see a continuing role for internal drainage boards as, whatever future arrangements evolve, the Environment Agency could not take on all the essentially local work done by the Boards. It will, however, be necessary to ensure that, under future arrangements, the Boards are structured in such a way that they can deliver their responsibilities and duties effectively.

<a name="30120w27.html_spnew4"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 January 2003]:</i> &pound;7 million has been allocated over the next three years for the leadership development programme. &pound;429 thousand has been set aside for the current financial year. The profile of expenditure for individual years has yet to be agreed within the Department. The leadership review will combine development and some assessment. Most people who go through the Development Centres will continue to work in Defra, making use of a leadership development programme which will follow up training 



<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 2003 : Column 101W</I><P>
and development needs identified at the centres. For some, it is expected that the results will encourage them to seek early retirement. To meet that eventuality, &pound;3 million, &pound;7 million and &pound;7 million have been earmarked over the next three financial years respectively. There are no staff reduction targets or estimates of the numbers likely to leave Defra following participation in the leadership development programme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30120w27.html_spnew5"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 The Environment Agency's website suffered problems in its service between 1&#150;6 January. This was primarily because of the excessive load during that period and in spite of previous testing to ensure that flood incident loads could be met. A number of technical changes have now been carried out to improve the site's performance.
<P>

<a name="30120w27.html_para2">While this reduction in service was regrettable, the agency's website is not the primary means of providing flood warning.

 <i>[holding answer 14 January 2003]:</i> The two sources of public funding to support the Environment Agency's work in England in managing the risk of flooding from main rivers and the sea are levies on local authorities as agreed by Flood Defence Committees and grant for specific capital projects and contributions to national initiatives provided by Defra. The former are reimbursed to a large extent by funding to local authorities from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM).

 This Department, as an aid for planning by all flood and coastal operating authorities, commissioned research to produce a national appraisal of the assets at risk from flooding and coastal erosion in 1999. The results were published in July 2000 and an update version was published in September 2001. Further research on large scale risk assessment has since been carried out under the joint Environment Agency/Defra research programme in flood management and results of the first phase of this work have been applied to the latest information collated for input to the national flood and coastal defence database. The results of this research application which take account of updated estimates of property flood damage from other research are currently being compiled and reviewed. They will be made available once the necessary quality checks have been completed. It should be stressed that the new research methodology is at the leading edge of developments in risk analysis at this scale so the results will have to be interpreted with some caution.

 DEFRA is the lead Government Department with responsibility for the co-ordination of the UK response to overseas nuclear accidents. RIMNET3 will replace the existing RIMNET (Radioactive Incident Monitoring Network) system which was developed and put in place in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. DEFRA is responsible for ensuring the operation and maintenance of the RIMNET system but all Government Departments and Agencies with responsibilities to respond to an overseas nuclear accident have access to the system and each is individually responsible for negotiating support and maintenance contracts with the prime support contractor (Siemens).
<P>

<a name="30120w28.html_para5">The RIMNET3 supply, support and maintenance contract was let to Logica plc in 1992 following an international competitive tender exercise. As RIMNET3 is not yet operational, the support and maintenance provisions have not yet been implemented and no research has been undertaken on its effectiveness in use. However, the RIMNET Co-ordinating Committee brings together representatives from the appropriate Government Departments and Agencies and all their requirements have been reflected in the design and development process. RIMNET3 will deliver all the functionality of the existing RIMNET system on more up-to-date technology and using commercially available software. There is a planned &quot;technology refresh" during the 10-year life of RIMNET3 and any required improvements identified through regular testing of the system and through the extensive programme of domestic and international emergency exercises, will be implemented as appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30120w29.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 January 2003]:</i> Power plants are currently regulated under the Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) regime. IPC is established by the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and regulates industrial pollution through a system of 



<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 2003 : Column 108W</I><P>
permits. Operators are required to demonstrate that they would be carrying out the Best Available Techniques not Entailing Excessive Cost (BATNEEC) for their activities before being issued an authorisation to operate. BATNEEC is applied to prevent, and where that is not practicable, to minimise releases of substances to air, water and land.
<P>

<a name="30120w29.html_para2">Authorisations set strict limits for sulphur dioxide emissions for the given power plant. In demonstrating the use of BATNEEC the operator would be required to consider techniques that would reduce emissions (including the application of flue gas desulphurisation). Each application is considered on a case by case basis, but all applicants must demonstrate BATNEEC.
<P>

<a name="30120w29.html_para3">IPC is being superseded by the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) regime, established by a Directive of the same name (EC/96/61). Existing power plants will be regulated by IPPC from 2006; new plants or those undergoing substantial change will be required to apply for an IPPC permit with immediate effect. Operators are required to demonstrate that they use the Best Available Techniques (BAT) for their activities prior to a permit being issued. Again, permits will include limits on sulphur dioxide emissions.

 We are committed to raising awareness among UK citizens of the global consequences of their actions.

DEFRA also directly supports a range of bodies that promote sustainable living, production and consumption. These include the Energy Saving Trust which works on energy efficiency, the Carbon Trust which supports technological innovation and encourages more efficient business working practices, and Environmental Campaigns (ENCAMS), an umbrella organisation which encompasses all the activities undertaken by the Tidy Britain Group and Going for Green. ENCAMS works with community groups, local authorities, businesses and other partners to promote sustainable development at the local level, with a particular focus on local environmental quality and anti-social behaviour.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what the percentage change in rates will be for each district council during 2003&#150;04 compared to 2002&#150;03 as a result of changes to the general grant formulae; and what transitional arrangements will be made to moderate the effect of the changes in the local government general grant formulae to those councils for which funding has been reduced.

 The level of district rates fixed each year is a matter entirely for individual councils. While the general grant contribution is a significant factor in the calculation of the rates, councils determine estimated expenditure and corresponding income. It would not be possible, therefore, for the Department to anticipate percentage change in rates year on year.

<P>
<a name="30120w31.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 The future of rail services on the Lisburn to Antrim line has been uncertain since the Railways Task Force produced its report in September 2000. The Consolidation Option in this report included the mothballing of the Lisburn to Antrim line when the line from Antrim to Belfast via Bleach Green junction reopened. Subsequently the Northern Ireland Assembly, in its budget of December 2000, agreed to provide funding for railways on the basis of the Consolidation Option. Since taking office I have been giving careful consideration to the future services on this line. On the basis of the data available the case for the continuance of regular services on this line is not compelling. I am awaiting receipt of a further economic appraisal on an option for the line. It is my intention to make a written statement on this matter in the near future. Clearly, that statement will be informed by the additional economic appraisal and made against the backdrop of competing transportation priorities in Northern Ireland.

 The Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) undertakes microbiological and epidemiological surveillance of E. coli 0157 infections and has given a high priority to work on Vero cytotoxin-producing E. coli 0157.
<P>

<a name="30120w33.html_para12">Research by the PHLS has led to significant improvements in laboratory methods for the detection of E. coli 0157 from clinical specimens as well as animals and foods. They produced guidelines on the testing of samples for E. coli 0157 in 2000. These guidelines include advice from the advisory committee on microbiological safety of food that all diarrhoeal stool samples submitted to public health laboratories for testing should be examined for E. coli 0157. Shared protocols for testing E. coli 0157 are being developed with the veterinary laboratories agency to ensure consistency in both animal and human diagnostics. In addition to providing full identification and typing for all E. coli, the PHLS reference laboratory also subtypes E. coli 0157 using a range of methods, and is currently evaluating a simple non-invasive test for antibodies to E. coli 0157 in saliva. Molecular methods for the detection of E. coli 0157 are now used routinely.

<a name="30120w33.html_para13">The Food Standards Agency has set itself a target of reducing foodborne disease by 20 per cent., by April 2006. This includes foodborne cases of E. coli 0157. The strategy for achieving this target, which was published on the Agency website (www.food.gov.uk) in July 2001, involves a range of measures to reduce microbial contamination of foods and to improve food handling and preparation. Laboratory reports of E. coli 0157 in the UK fell from 1,139 cases in 2000 to a provisional figure of 1,049 in 2001.

<a name="30120w33.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 There are a number of research projects in progress that are directed at both providing a better understanding of the virulence mechanisms of E coli-0157 and leading to improved typing methods for application in epidemiological investigations. A number of case-control studies have already been conducted in the UK and have helped to define the risk factors for E coli-0157infection.
<P>

<a name="30120w33.html_para15">Enhanced surveillance of E coli-0157 infections has been co-ordinated by the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS). A study of childhood haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) is also being conducted by the PHLS in association with the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit, the British Association of Paediatric Nephrologists, the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health and the Royal Hospitals Aberdeen national health service trust.
<P>

<a name="30120w33.html_para16">The use of antibiotics for the treatment of uncomplicated diarrhoea is discouraged. The Department has issued specific advice to medical personnel to ensure that they are aware that the use of antibiotics for the treatment of E coli-0157 may increase the risk of severe kidney disease.
<P>

<a name="30120w33.html_para17">The task force on E coli-0157 consulted widely with relevant charities and voluntary organisations. Officials representing both the Department and the Food Standards Agency (FSA) regularly meet representatives of HUS charities to discuss matters including research, diagnosis and treatment. The FSA has regular meetings with stakeholders to discuss its policies and their implementation.

 Overseas treatment is one of the options open to national health service commissioners seeking to increase the number of patients treated and reduce waiting times. Any NHS body can commission treatment abroad for its patients and a relatively small-scale pilot was undertaken to establish good practice. It is up to local commissioners to decide, in the light of capacity constraints across their local health economies, and taking into account the different commissioning options available to them, whether or not to refer patients overseas for treatment.

Phase two of the London Agency Project was launched in April 2002 for the procurement of all other nurses and midwives and health care assistants. As a result, 72 commercial agencies have been awarded a place on the phase two framework agreement that comes into effect on 1 April 2003.

Member states must implement these Directives into their domestic legislation.

 It is desirable that a doctor should have to satisfy the General Medical Council that he or she has the necessary knowledge of English before he or she can be registered.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the extra resources required to support the growth and development of new communities in the Thames Gateway area; what discussions he has had with other Government Departments in relation to supporting the growth and development of new communities in the Thames Gateway; and what resources he has allocated to support the growth and development of new communities in the Thames Gateway.

<P>
<a name="30120w40.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 National health service organisations covering the Thames Gateway area, in North East London, South East London, South Essex and North Kent, are actively working with a range of partners on developing plans for the Thames Gateway. The aims are to ensure new communities are sustainable, and both enjoy good health and have access to high quality health services.
<P>

<a name="30120w40.html_para0">The Department is ensuring that there is a strategic overview and will analyse the outcome of this local planning in the form of a 'Health Scenario' for the Thames Gateway as a whole. This work will detail the additional health and social service provision needed to support the development of new sustainable communities. It is anticipated that this work will be finalised in the spring.
<P>

<a name="30120w40.html_para1">Planning for the Thames Gateway is led by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and co-ordinated by the Thames Gateway Strategic Partnership. I represent the Department on this partnership.
<P>

<a name="30120w40.html_para2">Funding for services in the Thames Gateway will be allocated in the normal way through primary care trusts. Those PCTs covering the Thames Gateway area will see an overall increase of 34 per cent., or nearly &pound;705 million, in monies available to them over the next three financial years. Some PCTs will see a much bigger

<P><I>20 Jan 2003 : Column 148W</I><P>
increase, including Barking and Dagenham PCT, whose resources will increase by 42.5 per cent. This increased level of resource, along with additional capital building programmes in the Gateway, including a new &pound;230 million, 860 bed hospital at Romford, will result in an expansion in the services available to the residents of the Thames Gateway.
<P>

<a name="30120w40.html_para3">The increased growth in population resulting from promoting the Thames Gateway as an area of population growth is expected to take place beyond 2006&#150;07. The resources needed to support additional health and social care provision in the Thames Gateway will therefore need to be identified in future Spending Reviews.

<a name="30120w40.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Detailed information over the last ten years in the form requested is not held centrally. It would be very unusual for a hospital to be completely closed to admissions. However, partial restrictions on some admissions may be applied for a range of reasons including winter vomiting virus. These restrictions usually apply for very short periods until operational pressures have eased.

<P>
<a name="30120w41.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 Education/business links have an important role to play in providing experiences of the world of work for young people. We are providing &pound;25 million in 2002&#150;03 to promote closer links between schools and business. Education/business links organisations work with many small and medium sized enterprises to provide opportunities for work-related learning for young people, including work experience placements undertaken by 95 per cent. of pupils at Key Stage 4.




<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 2003 : Column 154W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30120w41.html_para0">In addition, through our &quot;Increased Flexibility for 14&#150;16 Year Olds" programme, we are making available &pound;38 million which will create over 30,000 part-time placements per annum in 2002&#150;04. This programme will give many young people at Key Stage 4 the chance to pursue vocational courses in colleges, with training providers and with employers. Early indications are that education/business links organisations and small and medium sized enterprises are involved in the local delivery of the programme.

<a name="30120w41.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 The Government believe it is important for consumers to have choice in financial products, including the availability of 'ethical' products. However, it would not be appropriate for the Government to exclusively support the development of one specific group of financial service providers. It is for individual consumers to decide the attributes they most value from their financial services and for financial services firms to be transparent about their use of funds and investments.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
&quot;There is no Government-wide approach to the procurement of Fair trade products. Each Government Department is responsible for making its own decisions on such products, against the background of the Government's value for money policy, the EC procurement rules and the Department's objectives. However, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development has made clear, the Government are committed to supporting ethical trading wherever possible and provide significant support to the Fair trade Foundation's efforts in promoting the supply and marketing of Fair trade products".

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30120w41.html_para1">In line with Government procurement policy the evaluation of tenders is based on value for money considerations having due regard to propriety and regularity. The use of fair trade products was given due consideration alongside other requirements during the recent catering service procurement with a subsequent clause included within the contract requiring that, wherever possible, fair trade beverages are offered for sale in all DfES Head Office restaurants.

<P>
<P>

 The Department promotes and supports the use of a range of flexible working patterns including job sharing, to enable staff to balance home and work responsibilities. Flexible working options for staff include part-time work, a flexi-time system, compressed hours, part-year working and home working. Internal vacancies in the Department are open to all staff, irrespective of their working arrangements or pattern of work. Applicants for external vacancies are also invited to apply on a full time, part time or job share basis.
<P>

<a name="30120w41.html_para2">The Department does not keep a record of the number of people specifically employed on job share contracts. 12.5 per cent. (569) of staff are employed under a range of part-time work patterns.

<P>
<a name="30120w42.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 If a fire should happen in a school, the Department's primary concern is for the safety of pupils, teachers and other users. Regulation 17 of the Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 requires that every part of a school building, and of the land provided for a school, shall be such that the safe escape of the occupants in case of fire is reasonably assured. Schools are also covered by the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and by subsequent related regulations. These include aspects of fire safety.
<P>

<a name="30120w42.html_para0">To help schools manage fire safety, the Department published Managing School Facilities Guide 6, &quot;Fire Safety", in 2000. This offers guidance on how to minimise the risk of fire, including identifying hazards and carrying out risk assessments. It also gives advice on training and on fire detection and alarm systems.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30120w42.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Since April 2001, all new construction work at schools has been subject to approval under the Building Regulations. Projects will not be approved unless they are designed in accordance with the 2000 edition of Approved Document B (Fire Safety), which accompanies the regulations. The Building Regulations do not require the installation of fire sprinkler systems in new school accommodation and the Department does not intend to seek such a change.
<P>

<a name="30120w42.html_para1">The Department's guide &quot;Fire Safety" includes information on fire sprinklers. It states that, though expensive to install, their use may be worthwhile in schools where the risk of arson is high. In these circumstances sprinkler systems can help minimise the loss of valuable course work and teaching materials through fire, and prevent major disruption to the life of a school.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30120w42.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The condition data that have been collected from local education authorities in connection with their asset management plans do not separately identify the condition of science laboratories or the equipment they contain. To have asked for spaces to be separately identified would have placed an undue burden on authorities.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30120w42.html_wqn5"><B> Dr. Iddon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what plans he has to ask OFSTED to monitor spending on schools' laboratories and equipment supplies in more detail than at present.  [90956]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30120w42.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 OFSTED as part of its general remit assesses the suitability of school buildings for delivery of the National Curriculum, including the sciences. There are at present no plans to ask OFSTED separately to monitor the spending on schools' laboratories and equipment supplies. Generally, we do not monitor details of capital investment at LEA level because of the bureaucratic burden that this would impose. An evaluation report of &pound;60 million capital funding that was allocated to LEAs for the School Laboratories for 21st Century scheme in 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02, covering a sample of 149 participating LEAs will be prepared over the next 12 months.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what provisions will be made for schools with unsatisfactory or worse science accommodation that did not benefit from the funding made available through the School Laboratories for the 21st Century scheme.  [90957]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30120w42.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The central Government funding available for investment in school buildings will rise from &pound;3 billion this year, to &pound;3.8 billion for 2003&#150;04, and will rise further to over &pound;5 billion by 2005&#150;06. The bulk of this funding is allocated by formula to schools and to local education authorities (LEAs) to support investment in their priority needs. LEAs have Asset Management Plans (AMPs) to prioritise these needs locally in a rigorous, open and consultative process, based on a full survey of the building needs of all their schools, including for science teaching and learning, and reflecting government priorities such as our aim to improve the provision of laboratories. Schools now receive substantial direct capital funding, to give them a direct stake in investment in their buildings, including in laboratories. A secondary school of 1,000 pupils will in 2003&#150;04 receive about &pound;75,000 of direct capital, and this funding can be rolled over for up to three years to allow major projects to be addressed.

The bulk of this money will go to schools and local education authorities, with additional funds targeted on Excellence in Cities areas, and in support of our national Key Stage 3 strategy to raise standards in the early secondary years. We will also provide extra funding to expand the Playing for Success scheme with more study support centres; and funding for national organisations which provide advice, training and project support to those delivering study support activities. We will announce further details in due course.

 The term &quot;higher-level teaching assistant" has been used in my Department's recent consultation document &quot;Developing the role of support staff" to describe individuals without Qualified Teacher Status who could assist classroom teachers with higher-level tasks directly associated with teaching and learning. Details of their training and qualifications will be developed following the end of the consultation period on 22 January 2003, but the consultation document proposes that they should be trained to a level between that of the existing NVQ level 3 qualification for teaching assistants and the level of Qualified Teacher Status. Decisions about pay for all school support staff are made at a local level by schools and LEAs but the consultation document also indicates that my officials will work with local government employers and support staff unions to ensure that greater responsibilities are reflected in pay.

 Pupils learn about the penalties of crime as part of Citizenship education&#151;now a statutory subject in secondary schools&#151;and as part of the national framework for Personal, Social and Health Education and Citizenship in primary schools. Detailed guidance sent to all schools by the QCA includes specific units to help teachers to develop pupils' understanding of issues of crime, including the role and operation of the criminal and civil justice system. For example, the unit 'Respect for property' helps pupils in KS 1 and 2 (age 5&#150;10) to discuss and learn about the consequences of crime and the concept of taking responsibility for property in the community. In another unit 'Crime' pupils in KS3 (age 11&#150;14) build on what they have learned in primary schools to explore how crime affects young people, victims of crime and their communities.

However, between the dates of 9 May 2002, when the White Paper was published, and 30 November 2002, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister recorded 18 respondents from the south-east who were in favour of an elected regional assembly in the region, of whom two were from Hampshire.

Questions were last asked about purchasing alcohol in the 2000 survey. The results are shown in the table. All information relates to England. Estimates for Lancashire are not available.

<a name="30120w45.html_para4">The Government welcome the Select Committee's report and notes in particular, and endorses, its finding that animal experiments are currently necessary to develop human and veterinary medicines and to protect humans and the environment. We have reaffirmed our commitment to the fullest possible application of the 3Rs&#151;the refinement of scientific procedures, the reduction in numbers of animals used and their replacement wherever possible&#151;and to greater openness regarding the use of animals in scientific procedures, subject to safeguards for personal and confidential information. We have also accepted that the administrative burden imposed by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 must be kept to a minimum without compromising the welfare of the animals used. We will pursue these issues and a number of other actions arising from our response to the Select Committee's report over the coming months.

 It has long been policy to assess and satisfy the welfare needs of animals bred and used under the licensing controls of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. All such animals have to be housed and cared for according to standards set out in published codes of practice. There is not at present a practical and universally accepted assessment system as regards genetically modified animals, but discussions are progressing with funding bodies to try to develop one that can be widely applied.

 From the outset of work on the development of the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB), we have been anxious to involve the voluntary sector in the process in order to ensure that the arrangements were appropriate to the needs and circumstances of those within the sector. In order to take this further, now that the CRB is operational, we have established a Voluntary and Community Sector Working Group to provide a specific forum for discussion between the sector and the CRB. The Group has already begun to address issues identified by the sector, including ensuring that there are appropriate and cost-effective arrangements to access the Disclosure service.
<P>

<a name="30120w46.html_para6">The Criminal Records Bureau has a settled policy on the payment of compensation, and, where appropriate, claims for compensation are resolved by an ex gratia payment.

 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary appointed Patrick Carter to lead a team of three to conduct an independent review of the Criminal Records Bureau so as to identify the longer-term measures needed to ensure that the Bureau is able to meet the demand for Disclosures. The team provided some initial oral feedback to Ministers in September and reported their final conclusions and recommendations at the end of the year. These took the form of advice to Ministers, including advice on matters that are commercially confidential; as such they are not in a form suitable for publication. We shall be considering the review team's findings and recommendations very carefully and are minded to publish a summary document, together with the Government's response, in due course.

 The Criminal Records Bureau maintains a record of umbrella registered bodies by geographical area which shows that there are good numbers of such bodies in each, with the exception of mid and north Wales where numbers are lower. Up to 10 January, a total of 1,199 bodies had so registered, included 520

who are prepared to act as &quot;open" umbrella&#151;i.e., countersign applications at the request of others outside their own circle or sector (but, in some cases, subject to a geographical restriction stated by the umbrella body on registration). Organisations seeking the services of an umbrella body are not restricted to using those in their own area. Any organisation needing to find an umbrella body should access the Bureau's website www.disclosure.gov.uk which has a search facility, or contact the CRB direct on 0870 90 90 90 811.

 I refer the hon. Member to the reply my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary gave my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) on 4 November 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 99W, in the light of a review of the projected likely capacity of the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) against projected demand for its service, it has been necessary to take temporary measures not to increase the level of demand by postponing certain requirements for mandatory checks.
<P>

<a name="30120w47.html_para0">In care homes for adults, only providers and managers were subject to checks prior to 1 April 2002. An estimated 100,000 new staff per year will continue to be subject to CRB checks, as will providers and managers. But an estimated 300,000 staff who were already in post on 1 April and who have not already applied for checks will not need to be checked for the time being. These checks will now be required during the course of 2004.
<P>

<a name="30120w47.html_para1">Both new and existing nurses supplied by nurses agencies, and staff supplied by domiciliary care agencies, will also not need to be checked for the time being. A requirement for all such personnel to be checked in the current financial year would have entailed up to an estimated 200,000 in each group.




<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 2003 : Column 179W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30120w47.html_para2">Thereafter, it is estimated that some 50,000 staff supplied by nurses agencies and 60,000 staff supplied by domiciliary care agencies would have needed to be checked each year. Nurses supplied as new staff to establishments where requirements for mandatory checks are in force (including adult care homes and children's homes) will continue to be subject to checks. So will providers and managers of nurses agencies and domiciliary care agencies.
<P>

<a name="30120w47.html_para3">Finally, school governors will also not be required to have CRB checks for the time being. Such checks would have generated an estimated 70,000&#151;90,000 applications per year.
<P>

<a name="30120w47.html_para4">We remain firmly committed to introducing requirements for CRB checks, and to the implementation of the protection of vulnerable adults list, at the earliest opportunity.
<P>

<a name="30120w47.html_para5">The CRB issued guidance to all registered bodies detailing these changes on 4 November 2002; the guidance is available on the CRB's disclosure website at 222.disclosure.gov.uk. The Department for Education and Skills also issued guidance to Local Education Authorities on 29 November (available on www. teachernet.gov.uk).

<P>
<P>
<a name="30120w47.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Prison Service has arrangements in place instructing governors to undertake a check on all those who have regular contact with children under 18 years of age using the Criminal Records Bureau.
<P>

<a name="30120w47.html_para6">The arrangements apply to all staff, fee-paid, contractors, agency staff, researchers/research students, volunteers and project workers who will come into regular contact with children and those who supervise or manage such staff.

 <i>[holding answer 17 December 2002]:</i> I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="30120w47.html_para7">The diagnostic criteria for entry into different types of drug treatment are not directly comparable. The needs of individuals and the background to their substance misuse will have an effect on the type of treatment most appropriate for them. Comparisons between the relative effectiveness of the two types of treatment are therefore complex and potentially misleading. The National Treatment Outcome Research Study, funded by the Department, reported that around half, or 47 per cent., of drug users who have gone through residential programmes and more than a third, or 35 per cent., of those from methadone programmes are still abstinent from opiates at four to five years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30120w47.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 10,070 Drug Treatment and Testing Orders were made during the period 1 October 2000 to 30 November 2002. Of these, 4,330 were revoked, including 226 for good progress. Figures on breach are currently available only for the period 1 November 2001 to 30 April 2002. During this time, 2;175 breach proceedings were instigated; and in about 40 per cent. of these cases, the order was revoked. Information as to re-sentencing in respect of revoked orders is not available.

<P>

<a name="30120w47.html_para8">At the end of October 2002, the female sentenced population for drugs offences was 1,314 (39 per cent. of the total sentenced female population), and the female remand population for drugs offences was 179 (18 per cent. of the total remand female population).

 There is no routinely collected data on the proportion of female prisoners who have dependent children, irrespective of age group. However, a Home Office study of a large sample of imprisoned women and mothers, published in 1997, found that 60 per cent. of female prisoners, sentenced and unsentenced, had dependent children under the age of 18. (There were no research findings relating specifically to children under 10). Another smaller, but more recent, study of women prisoners and their work in custody, published in 2000, found broadly similar results (out of a sample of 567 sentenced women, 66 per cent. had dependent children under the age of 18).

 There is no routinely collected data on the number or proportion of female prisoners who have dependent children (nor are there any projections of such numbers for future years). However, a Home Office study of a large sample of imprisoned women and mothers, published in 1997, found that 60 per cent. of female prisoners had dependent children under the age of 18.

<P>
<a name="30120w47.html_spnew7"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The increase in the female prison population, and the wider consequences of this in terms of disrupting families and the lives of children, supports the need to respond specifically to the particular needs and characteristics of women offenders if there is to be a reduction in offending by women and the numbers ending up in custody with child-care responsibilities.
<P>

<a name="30120w47.html_para10">We are taking forward the 'Women's Offending Reduction Programme' over the next three years to respond to the range of factors that have an impact on why women offend, and encourages joint working between departments, agencies and other organisations to tackle those factors. A primary focus will be on improving community-based interventions that are better tailored to the needs of women. Childcare facilities in the community, is one of the issues being looked at. Greater use of such interventions will be encouraged to ensure that custody is only used for women offenders who really need to be there.

 There is no routinely collected data on the proportion of female prisoners who were addicts of heroin or cocaine and who continued their habit after their sentences. However, the Home Office has commissioned the Office for National Statistics to examine the extent and causes of drug-related mortality among prisoners recently released from prison in England and Wales. The findings, which are due to be published later this quarter, will examine mortality rates among a sample of the general ex-prisoner population (though mainly not differentiating between males and females).

<P>
<P>
<a name="30120w47.html_spnew10"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Helping women leaving prison to find appropriate accommodation is one of the key factors in effective resettlement, and we are continuing to improve the range of housing advice available in women's prisons, including prisoner-led schemes. Alongside employment, improving accommodation outcomes for released prisoners forms part of the Prison Service's Custody to Work initiative, in which we are investing &pound;14.5 million a year from April 2003. A proportion of this will be allocated shortly to the women's estate and will be available to support the further development of housing advice services. We have no plans to allow courts generally to defer commencement of sentences, but the new sentence of intermittent custody planned in the Criminal Justice Bill will enable offenders to maintain activities, such as child care, while serving their prison time during certain parts of the week. Additionally, although intermittent custody begins immediately it is imposed by the court, the court can defer the first custodial period. This would enable the offender to make child care arrangements.

 This information is not available in the form requested. A survey of mental ill health in the prison population of England and Wales, undertaken in 1997 by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), showed that 26 per cent. of women prisoners were taking painkillers, 16 per cent. hypnotic and anxiolytic medication and 10 per cent. anti-psychotic medication.

<a name="30120w48.html_para0">It is not possible to determine the number of these applications which remain outstanding as this information is unavailable and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost by examination of individual case records. At the end of September 2002, there were a total of 37,200 asylum cases awaiting an initial decision, including work in progress. This figure relates to the number of cases ie the number of principal applicants. On the same date, there were an estimated 47,000 appeals lodged with the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) that had not yet been sent to the Immigration Appellate Authority. This figure includes non-asylum appeals.
<P>

<a name="30120w48.html_para1">Of those persons who have been refused over this period, it is not possible to determine how many have subsequently been removed as this information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost by examination of individual case records. Asylum applicants do not always inform the Immigration Service prior to leaving the United Kingdom, so information is not available on how many refused persons have left the country or have disappeared.

<P>

<a name="30120w48.html_para2">Information on asylum applications, initial decisions, appeals and removals is published quarterly. The next publication will cover the period October to December 2002 and will be available from 28 February 2003 on the Home Office Research Development and Statistics Directorate website at http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration1.html.

 The Red Cross centre at Sangatte was emptied by 14 December 2002. by 14 December 2002, 1,018 individuals had been admitted to the UK. Four further individuals were brought to the UK having previously been in hospital. One further individual is still currently in hospital and will be brought to the UK when discharged. This will bring the total number of individuals to be admitted to the UK from Sangatte to 1,023.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many nationals of <i>(a)</i> Canada, <i>(b)</i> Australia and <i>(c)</i> New Zealand have failed to leave the UK in each of the past five years (i) on the expiry of a limited leave to enter the UK and (ii) after having been granted temporary admission at a port of entry to the UK.  [91340]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30120w48.html_spnew3"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 I regret that information on the number of people who fail to leave the UK upon expiry of their limited leave to enter or temporary admission is not routinely available. However, I can confirm that very few nationals of these countries abscond having been given temporary admission. For each of these nationalities there were less than five individuals who absconded during the first six months of 2002.

<P>
<a name="30120w48.html_spnew4"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The evaluation was completed by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate Intelligence Section (INDIS) on 20 September 2002 and submitted to the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) senior managers for consideration. Recommendations were put to Home Office Ministers on 23 December 2002 following a review by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate Board.
<P>

<a name="30120w48.html_para7">The consultation process for the preparation of the evaluation report included INDIS, the Immigration National Enquiry Bureau (INEB) who were responsible for handling all incoming calls, and enforcement officers who assessed the allegations received for local action.
<P>

<a name="30120w48.html_para8">I have remitted the recommendations of the evaluation back to officials for further details on cost and application. I will write again to the hon. Member once these details have been considered.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many telephone calls were made by the public to the Immigration and Nationality Telephone Enquiry Bureau in each year since 1997; and what the average response time was for each year.  [90850]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30120w49.html_spnew0"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Immigration and Nationality Enquiry Bureau answered 959,812 calls from members of the public during 2002. Data are not available prior to 2002 because the telephone equipment in use at that time was not able to provide data that differentiated between calls received from members of the public and those from Members of Parliament or other Government Departments and agencies.

<P>

<a name="30120w49.html_para0">The average response time during 2002 for those held in the queue was four minutes and 44 seconds for callers on the General Enquiry line, 25 seconds for callers on the Application Forms line and five minutes and nine seconds for those on the National Asylum Support Service line.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30120w49.html_spnew1"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Records are available for the years from 2000. The number of full-time equivalent staff employed in the Immigration and Nationality Telephone Enquiry Bureau was 127 in April 2000, 101 in April 2001 and 110 in April 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many asylum applicants are resident at the Immigration Reception Centre at Oakington.  [89798]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30120w49.html_spnew2"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 In order to maximise the impact of the non- suspensive appeal provisions, Oakington has since 7 November 2002 taken only claimants from the 10 EU accession states (Cryprus, the Czech Republic, Eatonia, Hungary, Lativa, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia) listed as 'safe in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002'. Claims from these countries will be refused and certified as clearly unfounded, generating a non-suspensive appeal (NSA) right, unless the Home Secretary is satisfied they are not.
<P>

<a name="30120w49.html_para2">In these cases, applicants are detained at Oakington for their decision and until removal, unless it is judged necessary to transfer them to secure detention. The daily intake at Oakington has so far been dependent on claims from persons entitled to reside in these 10 countries. Numbers dropped significantly in December 2002 and have so far remained low in January 2003.
<P>

<a name="30120w49.html_para3">As a result, from 12 January 2003 Oakington has resumed a level of intake from the list of 40 previous nationalities from the Oakington suitable list. This will enable us to make best use of Oakington while retaining the flexibility to give absolute priority to the 10 nationalities at present covered by the NSA process and to wider use of that process at present under consideration.
<P>

<a name="30120w49.html_para4">On 10 January 2003 32 people were detained at the centre.

<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 2003 : Column 189W</I><P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many over-staying visa-holders have been given exceptional or other leave to remain in each of the last five years; whether such leave implies a right for dependants to join them; and what call on public funds such persons are entitled to make.  [91251]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30120w49.html_spnew4"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 There are no data available on how many over-staying visa-holders have been given exceptional or other leave to remain. The requested information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost by examination of individual case records.
<P>

<a name="30120w49.html_para5">Where a person is granted exceptional leave to remain, family members would normally qualify to join them only after that person has been in the United Kingdom for four years. Applications may be considered before that point, but entry clearance for dependants will only be granted where there are compelling compassionate circumstances.

<a name="30120w49.html_spnew5"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Information is not available on the number of persons unlawfully present in particular counties in England (nor is there any information available about the total number in the UK as a whole).
<P>

<a name="30120w49.html_para6">However, the Home Office has commissioned a study which considers methods of estimating the size of the illegal population. At present, there is no defined method for estimating the size of the illegally resident population in the UK.

 <i>[holding answer 16 January 2003]:</i> The overall provision for policing that will be supported by grants in 2003&#150;04 is &pound;9,683 million. This is an increase of 6.2 per cent. or &pound;566 million over the provision for 2002&#150;03. The proportion of funding from the police precept, Government grants and other income is not yet available. Police authorities have until 1 March 2003 to set precept levels for 2003&#150;04.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what use his Department and its agencies make of postcode areas for <i>(a)</i> the collection and publication of data, <i>(b)</i> devising formulae for the distribution of grants and awards and <i>(c)</i> the delivery of services; and when such usages were last reviewed.  [87744]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30120w49.html_spnew8"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The available information held centrally is set out as follows:
<P>

<a name="30120w49.html_para7"><i>(i) Collection and publication of data</i>
<P>

<a name="30120w49.html_para8">The Home Department uses a postal address file in major surveys conducted by the Home Office such as the British Crime Survey, Home Office Citizenship Survey and Crime and Justice survey. This involves sampling at postcode sector level (or sometimes in segments of postcode sectors). Sampling is undertaken by independent survey companies and the Home Office is not informed of which areas/addresses have been selected to ensure that the anonymity of respondents is preserved but they do attach other data to the survey datasets using the postcode link (eg indices of local deprivation).
<P>

<a name="30120w49.html_para9">Also, statistics showing the area of residence of asylum seekers supported by the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) are currently published for NASS-defined administrative regions and cluster areas. Recent analysis of postcode information recorded on the Asylum Seekers Support System (ASYS), the administrative system maintained by NASS, has allowed provisional statistics to be compiled for standard administrative areas (Government Office Regions and Local Authorities). In the case of those asylum seekers in receipt of subsistence only support, this provides much greater geographical detail than is currently available. These statistics are currently being quality assured and are intended for publication once this process is complete.
<P>

<a name="30120w49.html_para10"><i>(ii) Formulae for the distribution of grants and awards</i>
<P>

<a name="30120w49.html_para11">The Home Department is responsible for devising formulae to allow for the effective distribution of police grant and geographic information (such as postcodes) are used. These data form part of an annual assessment of population within Force and Basic Command Unit (BCU) boundaries (based on estimates of population movement and of changing boundaries within or between Forces).
<P>

<a name="30120w49.html_para12">The information is based on the most current estimates of population and demography available, and is updated at least every year. In addition the forthcoming analysis of the Census will lead to a more substantive revision than is normally the case, as these figures will be used to re-normalise estimates. In addition to the Police Funding Formula, these population changes within Basic Command Units contribute to the crime rates for certain offences. For example Robbery is commonly quoted as a rate per 



<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 2003 : Column 191W</I><P>
1,000 (resident) population, as boundaries change and populations change this is therefore reflected in the rates calculated.
<P>

<a name="30120w49.html_para13">Each year based (in some part) upon the demography within a BCU, the home department also revise the so-called BCU families. These families group BCU's in clusters, this grouping uses many variables, and again as boundaries change the characteristics of each BCU changes and this can be reflected in a change of grouping. These groups are currently used for comparison of performance and identifying exceptional performers such that this 'good practice' can be shared.
<P>

<a name="30120w49.html_para14"><i>(iii) Use of postcodes in the delivery of services</i>
<P>

<a name="30120w49.html_para15">In certain instances the Home Department and its agencies work with police and Criminal Justice System (CJS) agencies on special operations which have a specific geographic location such as a specific crime 'hot spot'. Special Home Office funding is often used to support these operations. In these cases the postcodes are more incidental than proactively driving the delivery of services.
<P>

<a name="30120w49.html_para16">The Home Department used postcode data for the locks for pensioners scheme. To be eligible for the scheme the house had to be in a BCU with an above average burglary rate; the Home Department had to translate BCU areas into postcodes so that the scheme managers could tell whether applicants were eligible.
<P>

<a name="30120w49.html_para17">The scheme officially ended in June 2002&#151;ie that was the last day that applications were accepted&#151;but surveying and installation work continued after that date. Most, if not all, should be completed this month.
<P>

<a name="30120w49.html_para18">We also used postcode data on the Crime Reduction Website (www.crimereduction.gov.uk) to provide a facility for people to check if they were eligible for the scheme. Now that the scheme has finished, the facility has been removed.

 A prison is overcrowded when the number of prisoners held at the prison exceeds its total in use certified normal accommodation (CNA).

<a name="30120w50.html_para7">The Prison Service has &quot;safer cells" that can complement a regime providing care of at risk prisoners. The design of these cells has several features which can assist staff in the task of managing those at risk from suicide, such as specially designed furniture and fixtures which are manufactured and installed to make the attachment of ligatures very difficult, and access to window bars prevented via non-opening windows with integral ventilation grills.
<P>

<a name="30120w50.html_para8">The Prison Service is half way through a three-year programme to develop policies and practices to reduce prisoner suicide and self-harm in prisons. This work includes increasing the numbers of safer cells and making safer cell furniture more easily available to establishments. To date installations have been carried out to provide 2,100 adult male and 610 juvenile and young offender safer cells. In addition a further 880 adult male safer cells are planned to come on line in 2003&#150;04. Prototypes for large-scale production of safer cell furniture aim to reduce the current cost of safer cell furniture installations by approximately one third.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30120w51.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Harold Wilson's letter to HRH Prince Philip dated 15 July 1967 discusses details of an audience with HRH Queen Elizabeth II, unlike the letter of 11 July 1967 from Prince Philip to which Mr. Wilson was responding. In accordance with recently approved guidelines on the release of records relating to the Sovereign and the Royal Household's records relating to Ministerial audiences with the Sovereign should be closed for 40 years or until the death of the Sovereign whichever is later.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30120w51.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton:  </B> 
Most records relating to mutiny are held in two PRO series: WO 213 Judge Advocate General's Office: Field General Courts Martial and Military Courts, Registers (1909&#150;1963) and WO 71 Judge Advocate General's Office: Courts Martial Proceedings and Board of General Officers' Minutes (1668&#150;1992).
<P>

<a name="30120w51.html_para8">Details of the charges made against individual members of the 7/8 Royal Enniskillen Fusiliers, and subsequent sentences, are contained in the register WO 213/21(folios 94&#150;98). Individual Court Martial papers, if they have survived or have been selected for preservation, are found in WO 71. This series does not contain all Court Martial papers. Of the files for the period since 1914, only those relating to more serious offences, resulting in the imposition of a custodial sentence of five or more years for mutiny and insubordination, have been selected for permanent preservation. Given that members of the 7/8 Royal Enniskillen Fusiliers were handed down the lesser sentence of five years penal servitude suspended, it is unlikely that individual Court Martial papers have survived and are held by the Public Record Office.

<P>
<a name="30120w52.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 In 2001 there were 55,030 contact orders granted in England and Wales. Deliberate refusal to obey a contact order is a contempt of court and may be punishable by a fine or imprisonment. In cases that involve the care of children those remedies might not be in the interests of the children at the centre of the parents' dispute. In recognition of this my Department asked the Children Act Sub-Committee on Family Law (CASC) to consult on the issue. Their report, &quot;Making Contact Work", was published on 8 February 2002 to which the Government responded on 6 August 2002. As part of that response, a stakeholder group has been established to look at the facilitation and enforcement of contact. The group comprises members from the judiciary, legal professionals, CAFCASS, other Government Departments and the voluntary sector. As well as considering how parents may be assisted to reach workable solutions, the group will be looking at alternative enforcement mechanisms. It is due to report in the summer.

 2,407 staff currently work reduced hours in my Department, a large proportion of whom are engaged on a job-share or job-split arrangement (which are available to all grades, including the Senior Civil Service).
<P>

<a name="30120w52.html_para0">A number of other flexible working patterns are available under my Department's successful work-life balance package, launched in 2001, including flexi-time, homeworking and compressed and reduced hours options. The flexibility of the pattern is decided in conjunction with local management to suit an individual's need and the needs of their work.

<a name="30120w52.html_para1">When advertising vacancies, business areas are encouraged to welcome applications from people working different patterns. However, there are some instances where this is not possible due to the nature of the work.
