 The Secretary of State for Scotland, the right hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Michael Moore), and I are in contact with Scottish Ministers on this matter. Social security is a reserved matter, however a Legislative Consent Motion is required from the Scottish Parliament to cover some delivery aspects of the reforms in Scotland. I hope that through our ongoing dialogue Scottish Ministers will see the benefits of supporting a Legislative Consent Motion now.</p>

 The Government recently announced that they were providing an additional £150 million to improve mobile phone coverage in the UK. The principal consideration when considering the optimal use of the £150 million for mobile masts will be to fill in not-spots in the national 2G mobile coverage and raise the coverage level to 99% and we will be working with Ofcom and other stakeholders to determine where best to site these new masts.</p>

The Greater London Authority's London Ambassador scheme will recruit up to 8,000 volunteers. There are also volunteer schemes in place in games venue cities at Cardiff, Coventry, Essex, Eton Dorney, Glasgow, Kent, Newcastle, Manchester, Surrey, and Weymouth and Portland. In addition the British Airports Authority, British Airways, Network Rail, the British Olympic Association and a number of local authorities are intending to run their own volunteer schemes connected to the games, either recruiting externally or redeploying existing staff. We are also aware that other local authorities are intending to use existing volunteer schemes to support games-related activity such as the Olympic and Paralympic Torch Relays. The publication of figures relating to the regional distribution of the volunteers recruited are a matter for each individual scheme, but it is clear that a number of opportunities exist for those across the entire UK to volunteer to support the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p>

 The Government inherited a situation where, as a result of a failure of IT systems, two child maintenance schemes are running in parallel. Also, weaknesses in the IT systems mean around 100,000 cases have to be managed off the system. More than three million children live in separated families, but only around 50% of those benefit from an effective maintenance arrangement. In addition the annual running costs of the statutory maintenance scheme are approximately £450 million, on average a cost of around 40p for each £1 of child maintenance collected or arranged. This represents neither efficiency nor cost-effectiveness.</p>

For those families who cannot make a family-based arrangement, the Government are continuing to invest in a new streamlined child maintenance scheme to replace the existing CSA schemes in order to deliver a significantly improved service.</p>

1. These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data sourced from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). This uses disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD equivalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.
2. Net disposable incomes have been used to answer the question. This includes earnings from employment and self-employment, state support, income from occupational and private pensions, investment income and other sources. Income tax, payments, national insurance contributions, council tax/domestic rates and some other payments are deducted from incomes.
3. Figures have been presented on a before housing cost and an after housing cost basis. For before housing costs, housing costs are not deducted from income, while for after housing costs they are.
4. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to a degree of uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.
5. The reference period for HBAI figures is the financial year. For countries and regions within the UK, three survey years have been combined because single year estimates are not considered to be sufficiently reliable.
6. Weekly incomes are presented in 2009-10 prices and have been rounded to the nearest pound.
7. Analysis has been carried out at the household level.
8. The estimates for all households include those households who are owner occupiers, as well as those in the social and privately rented sector.

 I am the Minister for Fire and Resilience in the Department. Following the closure of the Government offices for the regions on 31 March 2011, the functions of the former regional resilience teams transferred to the Resilience and Emergencies Division in my Department. The division comprises 53 FTE staff (which can be augmented by volunteers from elsewhere in the Department when necessary). This is approximately 20% fewer staff than employed in the former regional resilience teams, but provides the same Government support to local responders in emergency preparedness and response (the ‘regional response capability’), as well as continuing to discharge the Department's lead Government Department responsibilities. This includes the site clearance workstream. It is not possible to apportion staff time to individual workstreams as at any one time resilience advisers will be contributing to the full range of workstreams in the Capabilities programme according to the risks faced in a given locality. There is no budgetary provision for specific workstreams.</p>

 There were serious deficiencies with the rough sleeping counts undertaken by the last Administration, under-estimating the true level of rough sleeping. In September 2010 the Government overhauled the way local areas assess the number of people sleeping rough with the introduction of a more accurate assessment that provides a snap shot of the number of rough sleepers on a given night made up of improved street counts and robust estimates. This provides a national picture of rough sleeping with information from every local authority.</p>

We have maintained the level of Homelessness Grant, with £400 million for local authorities and the voluntary sector over the next four years. A cross-departmental Ministerial Working Group has been set up to address the complex causes of homelessness and improve support for homeless people. We also recently announced £42.5 million for the Homelessness Change Programme which will provide in excess of 1,500 new and improved bed spaces to improve hostels for rough sleepers and ensure that those coming off the streets get the support they need.</p>

 Following the 21 July 2011 agreement by euro area member states to reduce the interest rates applied to loans from the euro area-only European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the Chancellor of the Exchequer, my right hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr Osborne), on 22 July telephoned the Irish Finance Minister, Michael Noonan, to notify him of the Chancellor's decision in principle to lower the interest rate on the UK's bilateral loan. As Parliament was in recess, the Chancellor wrote to the Chairs of the Public Accounts Committee and the Treasury Select Committee the same day, to notify them of his decision in principle. In view of the bipartisan support for the loan to Ireland, the letters were copied to the Shadow Chancellor.</p>

Changing the rate now ensures that all of the benefit goes to Ireland and not to higher interest rates paid to euro area governments.</p>

 The Government are working to ensure that the UK is a good place to do business. But being open for business does not mean being open to tax avoidance, and we have set out a strategic approach to address avoidance. This is supported by HMRC's anti-avoidance strategy which puts the emphasis on prevention of avoidance through robust legislation and deterrence, backed up by accurate detection and robust action where avoidance does occur.</p>

Most of these grants were made paid through the low carbon buildings programme which was scaled back in 2010-11 and closed on 31 March 2011. This reflects a policy decision to promote energy efficiency  <br/>

 Sunsmart is the national skin cancer prevention run by Cancer Research UK. Confirmed funding for Sunsmart from the Department of Health, England, for the period 2004-05 onwards is provided in the following table (along with information regarding an Innovation, Excellence and Strategic Development Grant which also aims to influence young people to take action to prevent melanoma skin cancer). Prior to that time there are no central records of grant payments made for skin cancer prevention programmes among young people, and this information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>

 Subject to the passage of the Health and Social Care Bill, general practitioners (GPs) will be given real responsibility through clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) to ensure that commissioning decisions are underpinned by clinical insight and knowledge of local health care needs.

 The 2000-01 National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) of 19 to 64-year-olds found that around 15% of the adult population overall, and a quarter of the 19 to 24 age group, had a blood concentration of vitamin D which indicated that they were at risk of vitamin D deficiency.</p>

It is not possible to extrapolate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency from this data due to small numbers covered in the survey to date.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 7 November 2011]:</i> The Ministry of Justice has responsibility for coronial matters, including the proposal to include the office of the Chief Coroner in Schedule 5 of the Public Bodies Bill, which will allow the majority of the Chief Coroner's key functions to be transferred to either the Lord Chief Justice, in respect of judicial functions, or the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr Clarke), for administrative functions. This will allow coroner services to be improved across the country, including for bereaved relatives of members of the armed forces. It will also allow the Lord Chief Justice to set mandatory training requirements for coroners and their officers, including training in respect of inquests involving members of the armed forces.</p>

That is why we are ensuring that coroners conducting inquests involving members of the armed forces can access proper, specialist military training, and that inquests can be transferred to locations close to the homes of bereaved families. We are also introducing a new Charter to set out the clear, enforceable standards which everyone should expect at an inquest, and we are appointing a Minister, supported by representatives of bereaved families, to be in charge of driving and monitoring these much needed changes.</p>

 UK Trade and Investment (UKTI), acting through its regional directors, has always worked with local businesses and other organisations with an interest in economic development, in developing international strategies, and this will continue. UKTI will be working with each local enterprise partnership to develop (where the local enterprise partnership wants to) an international strategy for the wider area, taking account of local conditions and local business base. This approach implements the Government's commitment in the Local Growth White Paper that UKTI will ensure an interface with local enterprise partnerships in relation to local delivery and priorities for international trade support.</p>

 We believe it is right to give schools greater freedom and flexibility to make decisions that are in the best interests of their pupils, including in relation to careers guidance. We do not agree with the view that to trust schools in this way will have damaging effects. We must retain a focus on outcomes that show the extent to which young people are achieving and progressing to higher levels of education or training, or into employment, rather than on specific inputs such as the amount or type of careers guidance.</p>

As part of the Government's commitment to provide greater transparency, to enable the public to hold services to account and assess whether they are receiving value for money from the services we provide, NOMS will publish, in autumn 2012, three probation level input indicators one of which is the cost per community order. This will be the average, fully-apportioned cost to probation of delivering a community order or suspended sentence order sentence to the service definition as detailed in the NOMS service specification.

 The National Offender Management Service aims to hold prisoners in establishments that provide the degree of security they require; are suitable to their gender, age and legal status; provide special facilities appropriate to prisoner needs; and are near to their homes or the courts dealing with their cases. With respect to holding prisoners close to their homes, where appropriate, maintaining family ties and constructive links to local communities are important protective factors that increase the likelihood of successful, law abiding rehabilitation on eventual release.</p>

 Prison costs are produced on the basis of expenditure met by the National Offender Management Service (NOMS). It is not possible to identify expenditure met by all Government Departments, as it would incur disproportionate cost and expenditure related to prisoners is not always separately identified. The following table provides average annual cost of a prison place in England and Wales at Establishment and Head Office level for financial year 2010-11. It also shows the allocation of expenditure for education services only in 2010-11.</p>

                        <i>Notes:</i> 1. Displayed figures are subject to rounding. 2. Cost per place is expressed in terms of the baseline certified normal accommodation.  3. Establishment cost includes costs met locally by the public sector prison establishments and private sector prisons' costs. 4. Head office (central) costs include prison related costs met regionally and nationally by NOMS; for example, property costs including depreciation, major maintenance, prisoner escort and custody service (relates to transporting prisoners) and central HQ overheads. This involves some estimation. 5. Impairment charges, including the revaluation of land and buildings (£6.9 million) are not included. 6. Expenditure recharged to the Youth Justice Board in respect of young people is included. 7. The figures for 2010-11 are not directly comparable with previous years' published figures due to the change in accounting treatment arising from the Government's Clear Line of Sight initiative. This is mainly due to the exclusion of cost of capital charges in expenditure reported from 1 April 2010. 8. The education costs are funds allocated in 2010-11 by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), the Welsh Government and the Youth Justice Board.

 Prisoners who commit offences against the prison or young offender institution rules are dealt with through an internal disciplinary system known as adjudications, and if found guilty they may receive any of the punishments allowed under the rules. Adjudications are governed by formal procedures published in Prison Service Instruction 47/2011 (which is available on the Ministry of Justice website) and there is no authority for any form of informal punishment either following adjudication or in any other circumstances.</p>

 To date no such comparative assessment has been made, although the MOJ is currently looking at the feasibility of conducting an evaluation of the IAC pilots which should compare reoffending rates for IAC offenders with reoffending rates for similar offenders receiving custodial sentences of less than 12 months. In July 2011, the MOJ published a short report with the main findings from a range of research exploring the learning from the Intensive Alternatives to Custody (IAC) pilot schemes. Further process evaluations of the IAC pilot sites are currently being concluded and will be published in due course.</p>

 Details of how many prisoners are participating in and who have declined to participate in the sex offender treatment programmes in England and Wales since it was first introduced are not held centrally. These figures could be obtained only at a disproportionate cost by collecting information held on offender files or on local data systems, validating it, and then collating it in a common format in order to provide a response.</p>

 An outcome study (Friendship, Mann and Beech, 2003) compared the two-year reconviction rates of 647 adult male offenders who had taken part in the core sex offender treatment programme (SOTP) between 1992 and 1994, with 1,910 adult male offenders who had not taken part in the core SOTP. The two samples were matched on year of discharge and shared the same broad characteristics. The treated offenders had statistically significantly lower sexual and/or violent reconviction rates at two years than the untreated offenders (4.6% compared to 8.1%). The biggest impact on reconviction occurred with medium risk offenders. Low risk offenders were very unlikely to reconvict whether treated or not, and the core SOTP did not seem to be sufficient treatment for high risk sex offenders. Following this research, an additional treatment programme has been developed to increase the intensity of treatment with high and very high risk sexual offenders.</p>

 The National Offender Management Services central accounting system does not separately record costs of providing translation services to foreign offenders either in prison or on probation. It would incur disproportionate cost to examine and collate such costs from each respective establishments and probation trusts.</p>
