<a name="71112w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Campbell-Savours: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make a statement on the progress in establishing a computerised cattle traceability system for Great Britain. [15849]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71112w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 We are continuing to make good progress towards getting this system in place. I announced to the House on 30 July, <i>Official Report</i>, column 310, that the organisation responsible for administering the system, the British Cattle Movement Service, (BCMS) will be based in Workington, Cumbria. I also announced subsequently that BCMS will take over responsibility for cattle passports. There are now two further developments to report.
<P>

<a name="71112w01.html_para0">First, the Government consider it very important for there to be as much reporting of cattle movements to the new cattle traceability database by electronic mail as possible. This should reduce the paperwork burden on businesses which move large numbers of cattle, such as livestock markets and abattoirs. To help such businesses, we are issuing a protocol today for them to follow in order to communicate with the database by e-mail. Copies are being sent to all livestock markets and abattoirs in Great Britain. I very much hope that markets and abattoirs will invest in the relatively small changes needed to their IT systems over the next few months. This work needs to start now if it is to be completed by the time the new computerised system goes live in 1998.
<P>

<a name="71112w01.html_para1">Secondly, the Government have decided to charge for the cattle traceability system via cattle passports. Farmers applying for cattle passports will pay a fee which will cover the costs of the new computerised system. This follows consideration of a wide range of alternatives, including charging on the basis of the number of movements for which a business is responsible, charging via ear tags, charging at slaughter and charging via an annual registration fee for cattle producers. Charging via passports was chosen because it should be easy to enforce, since cattle without passports cannot go for human consumption. Because it is simple, administrative costs will be kept down so benefiting industry directly. The fee is expected to be in the range &#163;5 to &#163;10 per animal. The livestock industry will be involved in how this method of charging will be implemented, for example through its representatives on the Project Board which is managing the introduction of the computerised system.

 Since work began in 1993, my Department (including the former Department of Transport and the Highways Agency) have received 174 complaints about the construction of the scheme. There have also been about 1,200 complaints to the Link Road Offices, which were set up specifically to provide a point of contract for local people during construction.

<P>
<a name="71112w01.html_wqn5"><B> Ms Buck: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what was the total number of households <i>(a)</i> nationally and <i>(b)</i> in each London local authority area in respect of which local authorities accepted a duty in each of the last three years where the cause of homelessness was (i) the termination of a private sector assured shorthold tenancy and (ii) housing benefit restrictions. [14819]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71112w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The table below provides the available data on the numbers of households accepted as homeless and in priority need under the homelessness provisions of the 1985 and 1996 Housing Acts for the calendar years 1994, 1995, 1996 and the first 6 months of 1997. The table also shows the numbers of household where the main reason for the loss of their last settled home was the ending of an assured shorthold tenancy. The data collected on the reasons for homelessness do not separately identify where the loss of previous accommodation was attributed to housing benefit restrictions.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions with whom the responsibility lies for the repairing of private properties damaged by sewage flooding; and if he will take steps to ensure that there is no undue delay in long-term repair works where flooding is taking place on a regular basis. [15169]

<P>
<a name="71112w02.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Responsibility for repairs to properties following an incident of sewage flooding rests with the property owners but they may be able to recover the cost from sewerage undertakers who can be shown to be at fault. In other cases, the cost of repairs can sometimes be recovered under normal building insurance.
<P>

<a name="71112w02.html_para0">In the periodic review of price limits in 1994, the Director General of Water Services allowed for sewerage undertakers to invest &#163;590 million (at 1993-94 prices) over the following ten-year period to address sewer flooding problems. The Director General's 1996-97 report on levels of service recorded a reduction of 9 per cent. in the number of properties flooded by sewers in that year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71112w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The land uses proposed in development projects being appealed are recorded by the Planning Inspectorate. It has not been considered necessary to record details of existing and previous land uses in planning appeals cases, but a current review will indicate whether full records, including the existing and previous land uses, would be beneficial in future.

 Under section 19A of the Race Relations Act 1976, it is unlawful for a planning authority to discriminate against a person in carrying out their planning functions. Under the 1976 Act, complainants have a right to take their case to the county court as in instances of discrimination in the fields of education, in the provision of goods and services and the disposal and management of premises.

 Of the 288 applications referred to the Sports Council for England between 5 August 1996 and 31 July 1997, the Council has been notified of 110 local planning authority decisions. Eighty-seven applications were approved including 20 to which they had objected; 16 were refused including nine with Sports Council for England objections; three were withdrawn; and four were called in.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71112w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Under the Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) Order, the Sports Council for England is now a statutory consultee in relation to applications for development which affect the use of playing fields. Most playing fields are used for a range of team sports. The Council does not, therefore, have a detailed breakdown of the particular sports affected by the applications referred to them.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71112w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 In 1991, the Department issued a consultation paper on proposed controls over the demolition of dwellinghouses. This was circulated to a wide range of organisations including the local authority associations, individual local planning authorities, the main planning bodies, builders' organisations and conservation bodies. Two hundred and one responses were received including one from the Sports Council. This 



<P>
<P><I>12 Nov 1997 : Column: 552</I><P>
resulted in the Town and Country Planning (Demolition--Description of Buildings) Direction 1992 contained in Circular 16/92. Some amendments were introduced in the 1995 Direction following a 1994 consultation exercise with a similar range of bodies on the demolition of walls, fences and gates in conservation areas.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what procedures exist to monitor the processing of planning applications by local authorities to prevent discrimination on racial grounds. [15284]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71112w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Government recognises the value of ethnic monitoring and we encourage its use where appropriate. Local planning authorities may wish to request information relating to ethnic origin so that they can monitor the handling of applications. The ethnic origin of an applicant is not a relevant planning consideration and there is no obligation for an applicant to provide this information in order to have a planning application decided.

<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will introduce interest free bridging finance for road hauliers affected by the dispute in France, pending receipt of compensation from the French Government. [15204]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71112w02.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Government was pleased to note the promise made by M. Jospin, the French Prime Minister, last week that claimants affected by the blockades in France a year ago will know within three months whether their claims will be met. The Government will be pressing the French Government to ensure that all claims arising from the recent blockades are dealt with sympathetically and promptly.
<P>

<a name="71112w02.html_para3">Compensation claims against the French Government must be made under French Law and by those affected; the UK Government is not directly involved. Unfortunately, many of those adversely affected by the dispute are unlikely to be eligible under French law for compensation. In the circumstances the approach suggested by the hon. Member would not be appropriate.

 I refer the hon. Member to the United Kingdom's Second Report under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change which was published in February 1997. It reports the UK's progress in implementing its programme for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and gives a projection of what the programme is expected to deliver by 2000. The report projects forward what the current programme is expected to achieve to 2020.

Not all the Department's Agencies hold the information in a way that enables the elements requested to be identified separately. We have, therefore, been able to provide information only where it is available. It should also be noted that because of changes in Departmental structure and accountancy practice over the years the year to year costs are not readily comparable.<P>

 <i>[holding answer 11 November 1997]:</i> Regional Planning Guidance for the South East (RPG9) was issued by the Secretary of State for the Environment in 1994. It was based on advice provided by the regional conference of local authorities (SERPLAN). The Guidance sets out the additional dwellings required in Essex for the period 1991-2006 as 80,000. Guidance does not give a distribution between districts--this is decided in the Essex structure plan, prepared and adopted by the county council. In accordance with the 1994 Guidance, the pre-deposit consultation draft of the replacement Essex County Structure Plan provides for 84,600 new dwellings in Essex in the period 1995-2011, of which 12,650 would be in the borough of Colchester and 6,500 in the District of Tendring.
<P>

<a name="71112w03.html_para0">SERPLAN is currently preparing advice on the revision of RPG9, including the updating of housing requirements to take into account the latest household projections, economic and environmental factors.

 The Use Classes Order 1987 groups together various types of land use because, in planning terms, they have a similar impact on a neighbourhood. As public houses, wine bars, restaurants and hot food takeaway premises tend to raise the same land use issues, they are all included within Use Class A3. There are no plans to amend or to issue new guidance on this Class, although we keep the arrangements under review.

 Our aim under the UK Presidency is to complete, in co-operation with other Member States, the draft European Spatial Development Perspective (ESDP). The intention is for this to be agreed by EU Ministers at their informal meeting to be held during our Presidency, in June 1998.
<P>

<a name="71112w03.html_para1">The ESDP is the result of collaboration between Member States and the European Commission to promote an integrated approach to spatial development through partnership, co-operation and sharing expertise. A partially completed draft was agreed by Ministers at Noordwijk in June 1997 as a basis for consultations now taking place within each country. This is now on the Internet. In the UK we have invited interested bodies to take part in a series of seminars to discuss the draft document with others and to send us their written views by 31 December.
<P>

<a name="71112w03.html_para2">During December and January, I will undertake a series of bilateral meetings with other European planning ministers and with the Commission and other European institutions, to discuss with them the results of their national consultations. These meetings will seek to ensure that Member States will be in a position to agree the draft ESDP at their meeting in June. Some of these bilateral meetings will be handled by my hon.

<P>

<a name="71112w03.html_para3">The UK is also planning a European initiative on urban issues based on good practice experience. We will prepare the initial phase of a possible guidance framework on selected aspects of urban policy in consultation with other Member States.

 The privileges and immunities of Europol staff are set out in a Protocol to the Europol Convention, which was signed on 19 June 1997. The Protocol needs to be ratified in each member state before Europol can take up its activities. For the United Kingdom to ratify the Protocol, an Order in Council under the International Organisations Act 1968 will need to be made. We hope to present a draft Order to the House shortly.
<P>

<a name="71112w04.html_para2">The terms of the legal immunity for Europol staff are outlined in Article 8 of the Protocol, which states that members of the organs of Europol and staff members of Europol shall enjoy "immunity form the legal process of any kind in respect of words spoken or written, or of acts performed by them, in the exercise of their official functions". Article 12 of the Protocol states that the Director of Europol shall be required to waive the immunity "in cases where the immunity would impede the course of justice".

 We welcomed the resumption of talks between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Army on 29 October under the sponsorship of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD). The UK has supported and will continue to support the IGAD peace process through the Friends of IGAD and latterly through the IGAD Partners Forum (IPF). Both the EU and the IPF have offered material assistance to the IGAD process. We are in regular contact with all parties to the conflict and will continue to stress the need to resolve the civil war through a comprehensive negotiated settlement.

We are disappointed that the 1997 Group of Experts reviewing the operation and development of the UN Arms Register was unable to agree any substantive measures to expand or strengthen the Register. Our aims remain clear: to encourage increased participation by UN member states; to broaden the scope of the Register by including military holdings and procurement from national production on the same basis as imports and exports; to expand current categories of equipment to include weapons of lesser capability; and to encourage the provision of details of the type of equipment transferred. We shall continue to use both bilateral and multilateral contacts to encourage States to work towards these goals. We welcome the Group of Experts' agreement on recommendations for several technical adjustments. We fully endorse these recommendations and urge other States to do the same.

 I have no plans at present to bring forward legislation to amend copyright law in the light of this report. Copyright law allows limited use of material without permission for education, private study and research. Moreover, the draft regulations, which have recently been laid before the House, to implement the UK and EC legislation on databases, also contain exceptions for the purposes of teaching and non-commercial research with regard to databases protected by copyright and/or the new database right. Where copyright clearance is needed for uses of any material, digital or otherwise, I believe that copyright owners are entitled to obtain a suitable reward on their investment. However, I understand that there are discussions between the Publishers Association and the Joint Information Systems Committee on a licensing scheme covering digital material and specifically designed to meet the needs of teachers and researchers. I very much hope that a successful scheme can be devised.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade if the Government will ensure that full consultation on the EC directive on legal protection of biotechnological inventions takes place before it agrees to a decision at the Council of Ministers meeting on 27 November. [15340]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71112w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The Commission's proposals for a Directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions was circulated for comment in February 1996 to some 50 organisations and interests groups representing the professions, industry, consumers, the research community, groups concerned with the social and environmental impact of biotechnology, and including members organisations of the Standing Advisory Committee on Industrial Property, a body set up to advise Ministers on all aspects of industrial property.
<P>

<a name="71112w08.html_para1">Interest in the Commission's proposals has increased since the European Parliament adopted its first Opinion in July of this year. To date, more that 150 organisations have received copies of the Commission's revised draft of the proposal which was produced in September in response to the Parliament's first Opinion. Comments have been received from these organisations, and we will take them all into account in determining the United Kingdom's position when this proposal is considered at the Internal Market Council on 27 November.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade what research she has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> evaluated to determine the impact of the Bio-technology Patent directive on (i) research in the medical field, (ii) world food supplies, (iii) conservation of biological diversity and (iv) agriculture in the developing world. [15343]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71112w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 No specific research has been done to determine the impact of the Directive since the European Commission's proposal for legal protection of bio-technological inventions, apart from certain exclusions from patentability for ethical reasons, is substantially consistent with current United Kingdom legislation (the Patents Act 1997).
<P>

<a name="71112w08.html_para2">Moreover, United Kingdom legislation provides for exceptions to patent rights to permit research in all technical areas, including the medical field. The Commission's proposal will permit individual member States, including the United Kingdom, to retain provisions which address the needs of those wishing to carry out research relating to patented inventions.
<P>

<a name="71112w08.html_para3">Patent rights are created under national legislation. The proposed Directive will harmonise certain aspects of the national laws of the member States of the European Union, but rights will continue to be available only on a national basis. It is for other countries, including those in the developing world, and subject to minimum standards required from members of the World Trade Organisation, to provide patent regimes which meet their own needs and objectives. There is, therefore, no direct relationship between the Commission's proposal and matters outside Europe.
<P>

<a name="71112w08.html_para4">The Commission's proposal makes it clear that the Directive is without prejudice to member States' obligations under the Convention on Biological Diversity.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what steps he is taking to implement the recommendations contained in the second report of Session 1996-97 (HC 35) of the Scottish Affairs Committee relating to community care. [13967]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71112w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 We welcomed the Scottish Affairs Committee report on community care and our response to the recommendations was published in July. The Government is setting up a Royal Commission on the funding of long-term care for the elderly. We are reviewing the various elements of community care funding and preparing improved guidance on procedures for assessment of older people's needs. We will consult later this year on how best to promote and improve joint working. These measures should maximise quality, choice and value for money in the delivery of community care services.

 <i>[holding answer 11 November1997]:</i> The preparation and consideration of the report by the Accounts Commission for Scotland fall within the statutory duties of the Controller of Audit and have not involved any additional expenditure. It would be inappropriate to comment on the matter under consideration as my right hon. Friend may have to consider the matter if it is referred to him by the Commission.

 Requests for training are considered in the light of the Government's ethical foreign policy. Training would not be provided where we considered that it would risk contributing to human rights violations or aggression. Other criteria used to determine which requests for military training by overseas security forces should be granted include: the availability of resources to carry out the training; security considerations; and the defence and foreign policy benefits of providing the training. The defence policy benefits taken into account include in particular whether the provision of military assistance would:

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when the 826 Squadron of the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm was established; what has been its role since it was established; with what aircraft it has been equipped since it was established; what is its current role and strength; and where it has been based. [15616]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71112w09.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 Number 826 Squadron was originally to have formed at Lee-on-Solent on 1 January 1940 as a spare squadron, but instead came into existence at Ford on 15 March 1940. The role of the squadron was originally torpedo spotter reconnaissance but became strike and anti-submarine in 1951 and finally anti-submarine in 1955.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71112w09.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Prosser: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the importance his Department attaches to the role of British merchant vessels and merchant seafarers during <i>(a)</i> peacetime exercises, <i>(b)</i> support and re-supply operations and <i>(c)</i> times of crisis and war. [15434]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71112w09.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The Government fully recognise the importance of British merchant shipping and seafarers in the defence context. Indeed, the Department maintains one of the largest civilian fleets in Europe in the form of the specialist ships and civilian crews of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Service.
<P>

<a name="71112w09.html_para1">We must acknowledge, however, that in today's security environment, a substantial element of any logistic shipping requirement can be satisfied through the international market, where vessels need not necessarily have to be British flagged or crewed as demonstrated during the Gulf War, and in subsequent operations and exercises. The Ministry of Defence is always eager to charter British flagged and crewed ships where they offer best value for money, but we have found that, in general, they are normally fully committed to regular trading activities. Nevertheless, so far during 1997, 24 British registered merchant ships have been on charter to the Ministry of Defence.
<P>

<a name="71112w09.html_para2">While we would plan in any serious crisis or war to charter shipping on the worldwide market, we are very conscious that a core of suitable British flagged or owned ships, which could be used under compulsory measures and manned by UK seafarers, is important.
<P>

<a name="71112w09.html_para3">My Department's future requirements for merchant shipping will, of course, follow on from the conclusions of the Strategic Defence Review.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71112w09.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Prosser: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list the name of each merchant vessel, and its country of registration, chartered by his Department for <i>(a)</i> exercises and <i>(b)</i> military support and re-supply operations since 1 January. [15435]

 The availability of militarily useful British merchant ships which might be used for defence purposes is kept under regular review as part of our normal planning process. Current figures indicate there are generally enough militarily useful ships for perceived defence needs. My Department, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, regularly monitors the position. The hon. Member will understand that our future requirements for merchant shipping will, of course, follow on from the conclusions of the Strategic Defence Review.

<a name="71112w10.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Keith Simpson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what measures he is taking to compensate those Territorial Army personnel deployed in Bosnia to whom backpay is still owed. [15332]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71112w10.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 Contrary to recent media reports, there is no endemic or general problem affecting the pay of mobilised TA personnel serving in Bosnia. Mobilised TA personnel are treated as Regular Army for pay purposes and as such were not affected by the separate problems unfortunately experienced by their non-mobilised TA colleagues, which arose from an unforeseen backlog caused by the transfer of work to the Army Personnel Centre (APC) in Glasgow.
<P>

<a name="71112w10.html_para0">I regret that isolated problems have, however, affected the pay and allowances of a limited number of mobilised TA personnel. These stemmed mainly from incomplete or incorrect mobilisation documentation, particularly during early mobilisation exercises. Individual cases have been dealt with as they have arisen, and the Army very much regrets any difficulty caused to affected personnel or their families. I can assure the hon. Gentlemen that affected individuals have had access, as a temporary measure, to financial assistance from their Units until the underlying problems could be resolved.
<P>

<a name="71112w10.html_para1">Because such problems affect individuals in different ways, there can be no automatic mechanisms or all-embracing compensation package. But any individual who has incurred additional expense, such as bank overdraft charges, as a result of pay problems not of their making may apply for reimbursement, subject to the provision of supporting documentary evidence. Claims should be sent to the Pay Division of the APC through the appropriate Regimental Administrative Office.
<P>

<a name="71112w10.html_para2">As a result of the experience gained and lessons learned from these cases, such problems have been largely overcome. Also in the light of this experience, active consideration is being given by the APC--in conjunction with other parties involved in the mobilisation process--to the formation of a permanent mobilisation centre manned with staff experienced in such procedures. The aim is to ensure that there is a more focused approach in order to minimise the occurrence of initial errors which can have serious implications for pay and other matters.

 The Strategic Defence Review (SDR) is looking at all aspects of defence capability. Whilst I have no plans to outresource any of the duties of the Ministry of Defence Police, it is too early to assess the potential impact of the SDR on the Force.

 The future size, shape and role of the Territorial Army will be determined by the Strategic Defence Review. We are consulting very widely in the course of this work. In particular I expect to have discussions shortly with Brigadier Holmes, who took up his responsibilities as Director of Reserve Forces and Cadets this month. Other members of the TA, like all Service personnel, are welcome to make submissions direct to the Review Team.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71112w10.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The aim of Exercise Senator 97 was to test procedures in the event of an accident involving nuclear weapons on British territory. The scenario postulated an accident involving a nuclear weapons convoy in transit through Lincolnshire. There has been unanimous agreement from participants that the exercise was a success, and a number of observations are being followed up with appropriate agencies. A copy of the summary report from all participating agencies will be placed in the Library of the House in due course.

 My Department continues to examine options, under the Public-Private Partnership scheme, for the long overdue modernisation of the Main Building and its subsequent support.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71112w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 The present EU bananas regime represents a serious attempt to meet our obligations to developing countries, in particular the African, Pacific and Caribbean (ACP) countries. It is disappointing that some parts of the regime have now been found incompatible with World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. The UK supported the EU in its appeal against the ruling of the Dispute Settlement Panel but the WTO Appellate Body upheld most of the Panel findings. There are no further avenues of appeal left open to the EU. As firm adherents of the WTO process, we naturally accept therefore that the Community's arrangements will need to be brought into conformity with the WTO's rules.
<P>

<a name="71112w13.html_para0">The Government are considering the WTO findings on the EU banana regime in liaison with the Commission in Brussels, who have the principal responsibility for proposing revised arrangements which conform to our WTO obligations. As leading advocates of the legitimate interests of those developing countries in the Caribbean who have traditionally supplied the UK market, we intend to play a major role in developing a solution to the problem and are examining a number of proposals. Caribbean banana producers can rest assured that we have their interest high in our agenda.

 In discussion with the President of the World Bank, I welcomed this report and, in particular, its recognition of the enabling role of the state in promoting pro-poor growth and providing services for poor people. My Department also participated in, and part-financed, a meeting of the European Policy Forum which brought together European donors, academics and the World Bank to assess the report's main messages. My officials have also discussed the report with the World Bank with a view to assessing the relevance of its conclusions for our own work.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if it is the policy of Her Majesty's Government that the state pension alone should provide pensioners with an adequate income. [14571]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71112w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The key objective of our review of pensions is to ensure that pensioners should have an adequate income in retirement; that they should share fairly in rising national prosperity and that public finances should be both sustainable and affordable. For most people, security in retirement will come from a combination of the basic State Pension and a second pension. One of the fundamental challenges of the review is to agree where the responsibility for funding pensions should lie and to establish the right balance between the public and private sectors.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71112w14.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71112w14.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 A wide-ranging review of pensions was announced on 17 July. One of the Government's fundamental challenges in pensions is to narrow the pensions gap between men and women so as to give women more security in retirement. Many private pensions are simply not flexible enough to cope with working patterns of women. Women still earn less on average than men and are more likely to have caring responsibilities.
<P>

<a name="71112w14.html_para0">The Government recognise that carers--many of whom are women--who cannot contribute to second pensions because of caring responsibilities, make a valuable contribution to society but lack the opportunity to provide for their own future. That is why the Government are looking at ways to develop the administrative structure of SERPS so as to provide a citizenship pension for those who care for others.
<P>

<a name="71112w14.html_para1">We are also committed to developing secure, flexible and value for money stakeholder pensions. These will be aimed at those on modest incomes, working part time or with intermittent work patterns, who often do not have 



<P>
<P><I>12 Nov 1997 : Column: 595</I><P>
the opportunity to join a good occupational pension scheme, or for whom a personal pension is unsuitable. Stakeholder pensions should therefore be of particular help to women. The Government's National Childcare Strategy will also provide greater opportunities for women to participate in the wider economy so that they are able to contribute to their own pensions.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71112w14.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We are modernising the welfare state to take account of social changes, such as a higher divorce rate, and to enable pensioners to have an adequate income in retirement. As a step towards this the Government is committed to introducing pension sharing for divorcing couples. We aim to do so from April 2000.

 Improving education and awareness of pensions is a key focus of the Pensions Review process. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced on 23 July the setting up of a Pensions Education Working Group to consider how pensions education and awareness issues might be co-ordinated, well targeted and effective. The Group has also been asked to advise the Secretary of State by the end of January 1998 what other actions are needed to improve knowledge of pensions.

 There are currently no plans to commission any such research. It is known that mortality rises steeply in winter and that the increase in deaths is chiefly among people 60 or older. The Department, in partnership with the Benefits Agency and the voluntary sector, runs an annual campaign--Keep Warm, Keep Well--which aims to provide information on health, benefits and home improvement during the winter.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) if he will list by National Health Service trust in <i>(a)</i> Cornwall and <i>(b)</i> Devon the number of delayed discharges in each year since 1992 for which figures are available; [15385]
<P>
<UL>(2) what was the average number of delayed discharges in English National Health Service trusts in each year since 1992 for which figures are available. [15386]

<a name="71112w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Information on delayed discharge is collected by the Department of Health on a health authority basis and not by National Health Service trust. The available information is in the table. The information is collected on a survey basis and shows the number of patients aged 75 and over, who are ready for discharge, but still occupy a hospital bed on a given day in the quarter. It is not the total number of delayed discharges in that quarter.

 We have not issued any detailed guidance on models of health care in remote rural communities. However, we are currently reviewing issues relating to effective service configurations, including access to services for patients.
<P>

<a name="71112w16.html_para0">It is the responsibility of individual health authorities to determine the most appropriate balance of health services for their populations, and they are accountable to the National Health Service Executive for doing so.
