<P>
<a name="40315w01.html_wqn0"><B> Bob Spink: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many passenger journeys were delivered in a typical month for each of the Community Transport Fund's projects in Essex  [160105]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w01.html_spnew0"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The purpose of these projects is to test out a variety of approaches to improving access to transport in rural areas. Passenger journeys per month from the four schemes able to provide information are as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Family Support Clacton&#151;average 200 passenger journeys per month</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Chelmsford Dial A Ride&#151;average 209 passenger journeys per month</FONT></UL>
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Family Support Brightlingsea&#151;average 460 passenger journeys per month</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Epping Forest CVS Project&#151;average of 470 passenger journeys per month.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="40315w01.html_para0">The other projects are a mixture of research work, driver and volunteer recruitment and lift sharing schemes, or have not yet made any passenger journey figures available to the Countryside Agency.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w01.html_wqn1"><B> Bob Spink: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what options are open to <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;Essex County Council and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;Castle Point Borough Council for the provision of community and welfare transport for (i) disabled and (ii) elderly people in Castle Point when the current funding scheme expires in April 2005.  [160106]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w01.html_spnew1"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Following changes to the regulations which will be complete by 1&nbsp;April 2004, local authorities will be able to support the full range of community and other transport schemes for the disabled and elderly from their own resources, for example, revenue support grant, rural bus subsidy grants and Local Transport Plan funding.
<P>

<a name="40315w01.html_para1">The Countryside Agency's Rural Transport Partnership scheme has proved very successful in showing what can be achieved through local engagement. In the short space of three years it has raised the profile of rural transport issues and shown how much can be achieved by taking an innovative and flexible approach. We look to local authorities to build on this from their mainstream resources.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w01.html_wqn2"><B> Bob Spink: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many bids under the Community Transport Fund in Essex have been <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;granted and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;rejected; and if she will make a statement.  [160107]

<a name="40315w01.html_spnew2"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The Rural Transport Partnership grant scheme is run by the Countryside Agency on behalf of Defra. In Essex 10 bids were awarded grants and one bid was rejected between April 2001 to February 2004.

<a name="40315w01.html_sbhd1"><H3 align=center>Unsurfaced Roads</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Laxton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what discussions she has had with Her Majesty's Royal Engineers on the maintenance of unsurfaced roads when drafting the consultation paper Use of Mechanically Propelled Vehicles on Rights of Way; and what plans she has to do so during the consultation; [159714]
<P>
<UL>(2) on what basis her Department decided to reduce the time for the classification of highways to one year; [159715]
<P>
(3) how much the Highways Agency has spent on the maintenance of unsurfaced byways <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;in 2003&#150;04 and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;over the last decade; [159716]
<P>
(4) how much recreational traffic on unsurfaced roads has changed in the last decade;  [159717]
<P>
(5) what <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;evidence her Department has collated and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;investigations it has carried out, on (i) the level of motorcycle use of unsealed roads and (ii) the extent of the damage this has caused;  [159718]
<P>
(6) whether her Department examined the Hierarchy of Trail Routes in the Lake District National Park and how the scheme could apply to the maintenance of unsurfaced roads when drafting the consultation paper Use of Mechanically Propelled Vehicles on Rights of Way.  [159719]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w01.html_spnew3"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 As set out in the recent consultation paper "The use of mechanically propelled vehicles on rights of way," I consider it inappropriate and unsustainable that historic evidence of use by horse-drawn vehicles or dedications for vehicular use at a time before the internal combustion engine existed can give rise to rights to use modern mechanically propelled vehicles. I have proposed that this should no longer be the case, but that a period of one year might be allowed for the recording of byways open to all traffic based on such evidence. I will consider carefully the responses to these proposals.
<P>

<a name="40315w01.html_para2">As explained in the consultation paper, we intend to revise the advice andguidance on managing the different sorts of traffic on vehicular rights of way in the publication "Making the Best of Byways (1997)". In doing so, we will examine the Hierarchy of Trail Routes in the Lake District National Park and how a similar approach might improve the management of unsurfaced roads elsewhere. We will also look at various techniques for maintaining unsurfaced roads, including those used by Her Majesty's Royal Engineers, which have been applied with some success on the Ridgeway National Trail. The consultation paper invites views on any other ways in which "Making the Best of Byways" might be revised.
<P>

<a name="40315w01.html_para3">Local highway authorities are responsible for maintaining rights of way, not the Highways Agency. Information on how much these authorities have spent on the maintenance of unsurfaced byways could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.




<P>
<P><I>15 Mar 2004 : Column 3W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40315w01.html_para4">We are currently conducting a year-long study of a representative sample of byways open to all traffic, to collect evidence of the level of use of these ways by mechanically propelled vehicles and their surface condition. What is important and what we want to establish, is not how much the volume of traffic has changed, but what it is now and whether it is sustainable.

<a name="40315w01.html_sbhd2"><H3 align=center>Batteries</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what percentage of used batteries was recycled in the UK in 2003.  [159097]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 9&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> Latest figures (2002) show that 87&nbsp;per cent. of automotive lead acid batteries in the UK were sent for recycling. The UK has one recycling plant for automotive lead acid batteries. Around 1&nbsp;per cent. of portable batteries collected in UK are sent to France for recycling.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how her Department is working to ensure that the UK fulfils its obligation under EU law to recycle 45&nbsp;per cent.of batteries each year.  [159098]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> Proposals for a new Batteries Directive have only recently been seen and are yet to be negotiated in Europe. As a result, there is currently no EU law that stipulates a target for the collection of batteries. The proposals outline targets for collection of portable batteries of 160 grams per inhabitant per annum. For the UK, this equates to around 45&nbsp;per cent. of batteries put on the market.
<P>

<a name="40315w01.html_para5">At present, the UK is collecting less than 1&nbsp;per cent. of household batteries. In anticipation of a collection target, both Defra and the DTI are in talks with those stakeholders affected by the proposal and are looking at ways to secure early participation. This will enable the UK to successfully meet a target for collection within a given timeframe. In addition, both Departments are fully involved in discussions with the European Commission and the European Parliament, to ensure that targets for the collection and recycling of household batteries are challenging but achievable.

<P>
<a name="40315w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what provision she has made to ensure that Chardon LL maize will not be added to the National Seed List before arrangements have been made to restrict herbicide use 



<P>
<P><I>15 Mar 2004 : Column 4W</I><P>
on this crop in accordance with the advice of the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment and English Nature.  [160226]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> I refer the hon. Member to the statement made to the House by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on Tuesday 9&nbsp;March 2004.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether Chardon LL fodder maize has a greater value for cultivation and use than the conventional varieties from which it was bred.  [160571]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The value for cultivation and use of Chardon LL has not been compared with that of its parental lines or the equivalent non-GM variety. The criterion for addition to the UK National List is that it should, taking its qualities as a whole, represent a clear improvement compared with other forage maize varieties already on the UK List. Chardon has been assessed on this basis and found to meet the performance standards set to indicate a clear improvement.

<a name="40315w01.html_sbhd4"><H3 align=center>Nappies</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how her Department is working with the <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;Department of Trade and Industry and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;retail industry in order to promote the stocking of cotton nappies in order to give parents the choice of types.  [159095]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> It is for individual retailers to decide on the products that they stock.
<P>

<a name="40315w01.html_para6">I believe there is a wide range of re-usable nappies available both from local suppliers and through the internet. National retailers also stock re-usable nappies.

Table 2 also shows the number of cases in which a prosecution proceeded. These comprise cases in which the defendant was convicted after trial or guilty plea; and cases which resulted in an acquittal by the jury, or on the judge's direction.
<P>

<a name="40315w02.html_para5">Table 2 also shows the number and proportion of cases resulting in a conviction at the crown court and those cases which resulted in an unsuccessful outcome, including cases that did not proceed and those which resulted in an acquittal.
<P>

<a name="40315w02.html_para6">The Crown Prosecution Service holds no historical records showing why cases did not proceed: the information is held on individual case files, and could be retrieved only by examining every relevant file in each Crown Prosecution Service office.
<P>

<a name="40315w02.html_para7">The decision whether to proceed with a case is taken in accordance with the criteria set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. The code states that a case should only start or continue if there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction and, if there is sufficient evidence, where it is in the public interest to proceed. Where there is sufficient evidence, a prosecution will usually take place unless public interest considerations against prosecution clearly outweigh those in favour. The code is applied in every case. Where

the criteria are not met, then the decision to discontinue is in the interests of justice.
<P>

<a name="40315w02.html_para8">Together with its criminal justice partners, the Crown Prosecution Service is subject to a Public Service Agreement target of increasing the number of offences for which an offender is brought to justice. The service, therefore, seeks to reduce both cases which do not proceed and those which result in an unsuccessful outcome.
<P>

<a name="40315w02.html_para9">A number of initiatives contribute towards this aim. The Crown Prosecution Service has re-structured its front line operations by establishing co-located units in which prosecutors and caseworkers work in partnership with the police to prepare and strengthen cases, focusing resources on more serious cases and providing better support to victims and witnesses. In addition, the service is implementing the recommendations of Sir Robin Auld that they should assume responsibility for determining charges from the outset of the case. The implementation of the Compass Case Management system will provide the Crown Prosecution Service with better information on the progress and outcome of proceedings, allowing managers to identify areas of excellence and areas in which performance requires remedial action. Over time this will include information about the reasons underlying case failures.

<a name="40315w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) has published a Capacity Utilisation Policy and has also developed a new planning framework. A key aspect of this includes Regional Planning Assessments (RPA) which will form a basis for planning rail services over the medium to long term at a more detailed level. The SRA will produce the RPA for Yorkshire and Humberside in 2005, at which time specific capacity issues for the lines in question will be taken into account. I am not aware of any representations specifically on increasing rail capacity in West Yorkshire.

 Closures of the first Severn crossing bridge during high winds are done to ensure the safety of the road user. No specific assessment has been made of the economic effect of closing the first Severn bridge. 



<P>

The second Severn crossing provides an alternative route and this reduces the impact on the local economy of any closures of the first bridge.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 When the first Severn bridge is closed for reasons of safety, the Highways Agency makes no differentiation between high-sided vehicles and saloon cars. There is no infrastructure at present to filter vehicles. The agency has commissioned a report on the viability of 'filtering out' high-sided vehicles, using enforcement cameras in conjunction with traffic signing. This report is expected to be completed this spring.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how the Highways Agency informs the public of the instances of closure of the first Severn crossing bridge; and if he will review the adequacy of this process.  [160783]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Highways Agency informs the public of bridge closures using advance traffic signing on the approaches to the M48 at Magor in the west and Almondsbury in the east. The agency's information line is also notified, together with other media sources. The effectiveness of this process is monitored regularly by the agency and other interested organisations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport for what reasons responsibility for decisions on when to close the first Severn crossing bridge was transferred from the police to the Highways Agency.  [160786]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w04.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The police were concerned that individual police officers were required to be accountable for making the decision to close the first Severn bridge. They were unwilling to continue to be the primary decision maker in the closure process. The agency has taken responsibility for this role and ownership of the operating protocol.

The TFPI has had some success, but not all agreements reached have been implemented in practice.

 DFID works increasingly with other donors to help mobilise resources in support of agreed Palestinian Authority priorities. We have contributed to a number of multi-donor World Bank led initiatives, and have formed alliances with other bilateral donors and Palestinian partners to ensure that funding is better harmonised.

 The Palestinian Authority's capacity to lead on strategic planning and donor co-ordination has been constrained during the "intifada". With support from international partners it is now starting to play a more proactive role. DFID's proposed support to the Participatory Poverty Planning initiative would focus on the Ministry of Planning and could advance this process. When the time is right, we plan to support the Palestinian Authority in its desire to develop a priority-based, transparent national development framework which sets out the Authority's priorities.

 The UK has committed &#163;9.2&nbsp;million for support to the Palestinian Negotiations Support Unit (NSU). This covers funding from 1998 until 2006. &#163;5.6&nbsp;million has been disbursed to date. Our support is delivered through a contract with ASI Ltd, who are accountable to us for the use of our funding. There are no specific conditions attached to the funding. We monitor the assistance NSU provides against an agreed budget and objectives. The governments of Norway, Sweden, Netherlands and Denmark provide complementary funding, and we are integrating our monitoring with theirs. Project monitoring reports are not normally published unless there is a reason to do so. UK funds have supported the NSU's advice to the Palestinian Authority in presenting their case on the Israeli separation barrier at the International Court of Justice. It is not unusual for the UK to give funding to developing countries to help them negotiate more effectively in international fora, for example the WTO, where they make take positions that run counter to those of the EU and individual member states.

<P>
<a name="40315w07.html_spnew2"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The agreement in November 2003 between Rwanda and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) was part of a follow-up process to the Pretoria Agreement signed between the two countries on 30&nbsp;July 2002. That agreement provided for the Government of Rwanda to withdraw all its forces from the DRC. It did this by October 2002 and the withdrawal was verified by MONUC (the UN Mission to the DRC). It also provided for the Government of DRC to cease all support for ex-FAR/Interhamwe and to encourage the voluntary repatriation of Rwandans from DRC, particularly combatants. The Government of DRC issued a declaration stating that the FDLR (Forces Democratiques de Liberation du Rwanda) were unwelcome in its territory and arrested two senior genocidaires in 2002. The UK Government fully supports this process as an important means of ending conflict in the region and achieving greater stability.
<P>

<a name="40315w07.html_para3">The UN Security Council has tasked MONUC with the voluntary repatriation of non-Congolese combatants. It has established bases in eastern DRC to effect this.

 Since 2002, DFID has supported the Rwanda Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme (RDRP) with a grant of &#163;5.5&nbsp;million. The RDRP's mission statement is

This will be achieved through demobilizing ex-combatants and supporting their social and economic reintegration into communities of their own choice for a fresh start, thereby saving economic resources for investment in social and economic development."</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="40315w07.html_para4">DFID judge that the RDRP has been well managed by the Government of Rwanda's Demobilisation and Reintegration Commission (RDRC).
<P>

<a name="40315w07.html_para5">The DFID office in Rwanda has been engaged in working with the RDRC to ensure successful reintegration of ex-combatants. DFID has been particularly active in working to ensure that the RDRP addresses practical social and economic issues; including the perception and acceptance by communities of ex-combatants, the opportunities for skills training and employment of ex-combatants, access to counselling and medical services, and the particular needs of female and child ex-combatants in the reintegration process.
<P>

<a name="40315w07.html_para6">The re-integration sessions that ex-Force Arm&#233;es Rwandaise (ex-FAR) attend last up to two weeks. These sessions are voluntary and are the same as those attended by those demobilised from the Rwandan Defence Forces (RDF). The sessions are focused on explaining the benefits available to the ex-FAR and ex-RDF under the RDRP, such as the recognition of service allowance, available medical services and counselling as well as whether they are eligible for extra funds if they are assessed as being particularly vulnerable. They are also given advice on how they can best utilise the allowances they receive, for example in how to establish income generating co-operatives and how to prepare project proposals to access loans and grants.
<P>

<a name="40315w07.html_para7">It should be noted that the majority of ex-FAR soldiers have already settled in communities before they attend the RDRP sessions, sometimes for a number of years. Accordingly, their reintegration needs are often not as acute as other ex-combatants and the two week sessions are felt to be sufficient to help them access and utilise their benefits. When back in their communities, ex-FAR, like other demobilised ex-combatants, are able to use the services of the RDRP's Provincial Programme Officers to follow-up on advice and information on the benefits and services available under the RDRP and through other community-wide programmes of support.

<a name="40315w07.html_para8">The UK supports the Uganda Government's Plan for Modernisation of Agriculture (PMA). The PMA is a framework for Government action in support of smallholder farming households. It directs public resources to ensure that markets operate effectively and provides farmers with access to both agricultural inputs and markets for agricultural produce. Government institutions charged with agricultural service provision have been restructured to ensure they respond effectively to the demands of farmers. PMA priorities include the provision of better information through agricultural research and advice from Government extension workers; the provision of financial services; and physical investment, for example on rural feeder roads, to improve access to markets. Smallholders are supported in accessing regional and international markets. DFID has been closely involved in the design and implementation of the PMA.

 The humanitarian and economic situation in Zimbabwe continues to deteriorate, fuelled by the Government of Zimbabwe's poorly implemented fast track land programme and economic policies, as well as the effects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and erratic rainfall.
<P>

<a name="40315w07.html_para10">World Food Programme (WFP) emergency operations in Zimbabwe since 2002 have focused principally on rural areas, where food security is most closely related to agricultural production.

 DFID recently committed &#163;200,000 to United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for the procurement of water purification chemicals for use by the Harare and Bulawayo city councils. This emergency intervention responds to the lack of foreign currency available to the local authorities in the current economic crisis, preventing them from procuring the necessary chemicals and resulting in the high risk of water-borne disease outbreaks, particularly in the overcrowded suburbs and public institutions, such as hospitals and schools. Technical assistance is being provided by other agencies, notably UNICEF.

<P>
<a name="40315w07.html_spnew8"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Concerns about the exchange rate used by the European Commission were raised in a report of the European Court of Auditors. Our understanding is that those concerns were limited to part of the spending of the European Development Fund (EDF) that was converted into Zimbabwe dollars during 2002. Humanitarian aid, which is largely funded from the EU budget rather than the EDF, was therefore not affected. Humanitarian aid is in any case very largely used to procure food and other goods outside Zimbabwe and would not be converted into Zimbabwe dollars.

 Along with the humanitarian programme, Health and HIV/AIDS is a priority for DFID support in Zimbabwe.

DFID has just granted &#163;590,000 to the National Blood Transfusion Services (NBTS) in Zimbabwe for import of test kits and reagents to allow continued provision of safe blood in hospitals, with particular reference to specialised testing for HIV and hepatitis.

 Our assessment is that the work of the Legal Resources Foundation is excellent and makes an important contribution to civil society in Zimbabwe.

 British aid to Zimbabwe is channelled through UN agencies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to provide humanitarian assistance to vulnerable sections of society. In collaboration with our development partners, we operate a policy of zero tolerance towards political interference&#151;including claiming credit for donor food distribution&#151;in humanitarian operations. Procedures in place to reduce the risk of political interference have proved generally effective to date. Any such incidents are quickly identified, reported and followed up, including suspending food distribution where appropriate. We and other donors and agencies also use the media when appropriate to publicise our activities and to explain the extent of donor support to Zimbabwe during the present crisis. Looking ahead to the parliamentary elections anticipated early next year, monitoring of any political interference will be given even higher attention in coming months.

 The Ministry of Defence complies fully with the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulation 2002, but there is no central register of surveyed buildings in which asbestos is known to be present belonging to the department or its agencies. Such a register or list could be compiled only at disproportionate cost. Once surveys have been undertaken, however, a management plan is produced by each establishment to ensure appropriate action is taken.

 <i>[holding answer 29&nbsp;January 2004]:</i> A full report on Operation TELIC entitled "Operations in Iraq: Lessons for the Future" can be found on the MOD's website (www.mod.uk in the "Publications and Reports" section). The report identifies several factors as being responsible for delivery problems that occurred in theatre. These include the asset tracking systems in place and the short period of time available for preparation and planning of deployment. Specific items that suffered from delivery problems in theatre include some vehicle spares and personal kit such as, desert combat clothing and Enhanced Combat Body Armour plates. Where there was a lack of equipment, priority was given to those personnel on the ground whom commanders judged to have the greatest need. We have drawn lessons from this and other recent operations, such as improving our asset tracking capability, and are always looking for ways in which to enhance our logistics performance.

 <i>[holding answer 4&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> The overall capability offered by the Type 45 destroyer's gun is not related simply to the calibre of the barrel, but to the ammunition which could be used.
<P>

<a name="40315w11.html_para1">The standard 115 mm (4.5) gun is capable of delivering conventional munitions to a range of up to 27 km. 127 mm and 155 mm guns would be capable of firing munitions to a range of 75&#150;80 km. They would also be capable of firing modern guided munitions and, in the case of the 155 mm gun, these would be considerably heavier than the 115 mm gun's conventional munitions.
<P>

<a name="40315w11.html_para2">The design of the Type 45 includes space and weight margins which would allow for the fitting of an improved Medium Range Gun, should such a requirement emerge.

<P>
<a name="40315w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The presence of wind farms in most areas of the UK presents no difficulty to low flying training providing pilots are aware of the existence and position of the developments. They are treated the same as any other obstruction; displayed on military low flying charts and published in the Military Aeronautical Planning Document Volume 3 Part 1. They are then taken into account during route planning and avoided by standard separation criteria, these vary according to the type of aircraft.
<P>

<a name="40315w12.html_para0">The Tactical Training Areas and the Electronic Warfare Training Range at Spadeadam in the English/Scottish border region are critical to low flying training because aircraft are allowed to fly at much lower levels. Within these areas an accumulation of wind turbines, particularly if combined with other obstacles, could give rise to concerns and could affect our ability to conduct operational flying training effectively. We are therefore more likely to raise objections to proposals for developments in these areas.

In England, where the problem is estimated to be greatest, and in Northern Ireland, that has meant every home with a greater than 5&nbsp;per cent. probability of having radon concentrations at or above the National Radiological Protection Board recommended level of 200 becquerels per cubic metre of air, has been offered a free radon test. The Government's current programme continues to

<a name="40315w14.html_para8">Under the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's proposals for home information packs, the pack is likely to include information on whether the property is located within a radon affected area.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The information given in the attached tables on employment and Gross Value Added (GVA) in the manufacturing sector is taken from the Annual Business Inquiry (ABI). Data on GVA are provided from 1998 to 2001, the most recent year for which estimates are available. Data on employment are provided from 1998 to 2002, although estimates for 2002 are provisional. Data have not been supplied prior to 1998 since this was the first year in which the ABI was carried out; 1997 data would be from a different data collection exercise and would therefore not be comparable.The Annual Business Inquiry samples businesses on a national level stratified by country (England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) as well as by industrial classification and size

Outputs are primarily produced at national level, with sub-national outputs (as shown in the tables) produced subsequently using a regression model to apportion the data to local units. All sub-national data should therefore be treated with caution. This particularly applies to borough-level data since small area estimates have greater sampling and modelling uncertainty.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Approximate Gross Value Added represents the income generated by businesses, encompassing wages and salaries, the cost of capital investment and financial charges, and profit. It includes taxes on production (e.g. business rates) net of subsidies but excludes subsidies and taxes on products (e.g. VAT and excise duty). The estimates shown are at current prices and hence are not adjusted for inflation The estimates for the number of employees by area are based on the location of the employing company, but it must be emphasised that they are derived from a regression model and are not actual counts of employees.</FONT></UL>

However, figures for the take-up of SMP are not available on a regional basis.

 I attended the Telecoms Council held on 8&nbsp;March 2004 in Brussels. There was a round-table debate on the state of the telecoms sector, in particular on two areas for action by governments; the transposition of the new regulatory framework and implementing national broadband strategies. There was broad consensus that the sector was recovering, that compelling content would be key in driving take-up of broadband and that e-Government was important as driver and exemplar in services. The rollout of broadband in under served areas was also discussed, including the importance of applying structural funding in a technology-neutral, market-led and competition-based way.
<P>

<a name="40315w17.html_para5">I pointed out that in the face of increasingly stiffer international competition it was vital for the EU to make the most of its competitive edge from creating the largest single coherent telecoms market by implementing the new regulatory package in a timely, consistent and effective way. I emphasised the need for a vision and specific planning beyond 2005 to meet the Lisbon goal by 2010 of Europe becoming the world's knowledge-based leader. To achieve this, I stressed the importance of intensifying dialogue with industry across the whole value chain. The Presidency will submit the Conclusions of this Council discussion to the Spring European Council on 25&#150;26&nbsp;March.

<P>

<a name="40315w18.html_para1">Once a child, who is or who may be a child in need, has been referred to social services, the responsible local authority is expected to assess the child using the "Framework for the Assessment of Children in Need and Their Families" (2000). Following that assessment, the local authority should then determine what services or support are needed, including those that may be provided by the local authority. For children with behavioural problems, the local Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) team may be identified as an appropriate way to assist the child.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills whether it is his Department's policy to make local authorities act as lead bodies for the receipt of Connexions partnerships grants; and if he will make a statement.  [161069]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w18.html_spnew13"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 It is not our policy to compel Connexions partnerships to adopt any particular arrangements for the receipt of Connexions grant. However we are encouraging partnerships to improve their tax efficiency. Connexions partnerships which have a local authority acting as a lead body are more tax efficient than other structural models. Where local authorities act as the lead body for receipt of the grant they do so voluntarily and with the agreement of the Board of the Connexions Partnership.

<P>
<a name="40315w20.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The Department for Education and Skills has not conducted an assessment of special school outreach programmes which support pupils with moderate learning difficulties based in mainstream schools. Ofsted has responsibility for school inspections, including an assessment of any support that schools offer to other schools. In his annual report for 2002&#150;03, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools noted that 'good support is provided by the special schools for pupils attending mainstream schools and colleges and this contributes significantly to the quality of the programmes. A small number of schools also provide outreach support and advice to staff in mainstream schools. However, the role of special schools in this respect is weak and developing slowly.'
<P>

<a name="40315w20.html_para0">The Government's new SEN Strategy&#151;Removing Barriers to Achievement&#151;launched in February 2004, encourages special schools to do more to share their expertise with mainstream schools in support of greater inclusion. While there is clearly scope for them to develop this aspect of their role, it is important that the quality of advice and support they offer is of a high standard. Some special schools already achieve this, but it is clear from HMCI's report that the quality overall is variable. The SEN strategy therefore includes the development of generic minimum standards for SEN support services which would extend to outreach offered by special schools. It is envisaged that these will be used for self-evaluation by local authorities and schools and in Ofsted inspections and will be a form of quality assurance for schools obtaining support from external sources.

[161622]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w22.html_spnew1"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The original cost of &#163;340&nbsp;million to &#163;375&nbsp;million is the difference between the assets and the liabilities of the schemes taken over by the PPF in a year. We used the following assumptions to arrive at that cost:
<P>

<a name="40315w22.html_para1">(i) Data on the MFR funding levels of just over 1,000 schemes that had an MFR valuation with an effective date between April 1997 and April 2000 were used. Adjustments were made for each scheme in the sample in order to estimate the up-to-date funding position. The results were scaled up to the total for all private sector occupational pension schemes.




<P>
<P><I>15 Mar 2004 : Column 93W</I><P>

(ii) The value of the liabilities if such schemes were to fall within the responsibility of the pensions protection fund were estimated on a basis equivalent to midway between the current MFR basis and the full insurance buyout costs for the liabilities.
<P>

<a name="40315w22.html_para2">(iii) The cost will obviously depend on the number of firms going insolvent. Allowance was made for the possibility of normal, poor and extreme years as far as bankruptcies are concerned, but on average over a 20-year period, the probabilities of a scheme becoming a liability of the PPF were assumed to be between about 0.3&nbsp;per cent. a year for large schemes and 1&nbsp;per cent. a year for small schemes. This assumed level of bankruptcy is cautious, especially given that it is very rare for large companies to go bankrupt.
<P>

<a name="40315w22.html_para3">(iv) Allowance was made for the impact of the suggested salary cap using data on the earnings of occupational schemes members from the Family Resources Survey.
<P>

<a name="40315w22.html_para4">These costs were recently recalculated at &#163;300&nbsp;million using the same methodology, but updated to take account of current market conditions and the decisions taken on the precise nature of the PPF compensation payable.

It is assumed likely that most of these deaths at ages over 13 are cases where the harm is self-inflicted but there was insufficient evidence to prove that the deceased deliberately intended to kill themselves. As there were no intentional self harm deaths in children under the age of 13, data for undetermined whether accidentally or purposely inflicted have not been included.<P>

 The effects of bladder and bowel conditions and other causes of continence problems in children can be of serious concern in schools. All schools in England were made aware of the Department's "Good Practice in Continence Services" guidance (2000), which addresses measures for effective management. I understand the Department for Education and Skills requires schools to have toilet and medical facilities in accordance with the Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999. It is for local assessment of need, on a case by case basis, to determine what additional facilities may be needed in schools. Individual provision in schools is not assessed centrally.
<P>

<a name="40315w26.html_para2">"Good Practice in Continence Services" indicates cost-effectiveness associated with specialist continence services and advises that each national health service primary care trust (PCT) should have specialist continence services in place which provide an individual assessment of needs.

<P>
<a name="40315w28.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 People with learning disabilities have the same right of access to medical treatment as everyone else. The NHS Plan emphasised the Government's commitment to a person-centred health service that challenges discrimination on all grounds.
<P>

<a name="40315w28.html_para3">"Valuing People&#151;A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century", includes an important chapter on improving health for people with learning disabilities. In July 2002, the Department issued good practice guidance on health action plans and health facilitation, two key elements of the "Valuing People" strategy for improving the health of people with learning disabilities. A health action plan is a personal plan detailing the actions needed to maintain and improve the health of an individual and any help needed to achieve this. The plan will usually be co-produced with them. Health facilitation involves casework to help people with learning disabilities access mainstream services. It also involves helping mainstream national health service services to respond to the needs of people with learning disabilities.
<P>

<a name="40315w28.html_para4">The "Valuing People" support team produced "All Means All" in 2003. This explains how "Improvement Expansion and Reform", the Department's planning and performance framework, relates to people with learning disabilities.

 When the findings from the recently terminated oestrogen-only hormone replacement therapy (HRT) arm of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial are published, they will be carefully considered by the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) and its expert working group on HRT. When its review is complete, any necessary action, including updating the current product information will be taken and women and doctors will be clearly informed of the advice. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has copied in the Scottish Executive in all their communications.

<a name="40315w29.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Dean: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) if his Department will introduce a monitoring system to assess whether <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;intensive care and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;accident and emergency staff routinely (i) check the Organ Donor Register whenever a new patient is admitted and (ii) approach patients and relatives about organ donation;  [159599]

(3) what measures his Department is taking to introduce training so that intensive care and accident and emergency staff <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;routinely check the Organ Donor Register whenever a new patient is admitted and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;approach patients and relatives about organ donations.  [159601]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w29.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 An audit of potential donors has been undertaken by UK Transplant since April 2003. It captures information about every death in every intensive care unit in the United Kingdom and records whether the organ donor register was contacted to check the wishes of the deceased.
<P>

<a name="40315w29.html_para0">A recent analysis of the audit data carried out by UK Transplant shows that 250 out of 545, suitable for donation became donors, 25 were contraindicated for medical reasons, 206 relatives refused and for 64 families there was no record of any discussion about donation. In total there were 270 suitable donors who for different reasons did not donate. For physiological reasons not all donors can donate all organs.
<P>

<a name="40315w29.html_para1">UK Transplant will employ an education and training manager to follow up the best practice guidance issued in 2003. A national health service education programme will provide expert education advice on the training needs associated with organ donation and transplantation and produce an education strategy, including the development of an education pack for pre and post graduate use, to deliver raised awareness and knowledge among all relevant NHS staff.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w29.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 The prevention, treatment, care and support of those at risk of osteoporosis are important components in the delivery of the integrated falls services that the national service framework for older people requires to be in place locally by April 2005. The Department will be monitoring formally the 2005 milestone as this is included as one of the key targets in "Improvement, Expansion and Reform", the priorities and planning framework for 2003&#150;2006. All strategic health authorities (SHAs) except one currently report that the April 2005 target will be achieved in their area. The Department has offered support to the SHA that may have difficulty meeting the target across the whole of its area.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what he assesses will be the effect of National Institute for Clinical Excellence guidance proposed in the osteoporosis appraisal consultation document on standard six of the National Service Framework for Older People.  [158869]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w29.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 Standard six of the national service framework for older people sets out clear milestones for the National Health Service, working in partnership with councils, to take action to prevent falls and reduce resultant fractures or other injuries in their populations of older people.
<P>

<a name="40315w29.html_para3">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence's technology appraisal will give doctors the latest evidence-based information on the most effective treatments for osteoporosis.

<a name="40315w29.html_para6">Information on the average waiting times and number of patients waiting for cancer treatment in London SHAs is not available centrally. The NHS Cancer Plan sets out our strategy to reduce waiting times for cancer patients. The ultimate goal is that no one should wait longer that one month from an urgent referral for suspected cancer to the beginning of treatment except for a good clinical reason or through patient choice; it is planned to achieve this by 2008.
<P>

<a name="40315w29.html_para7">There is a series of staged milestones towards this goal: from 2001 new targets of a maximum one month wait from diagnosis to treatment for breast cancer and a maximum one month wait from urgent general practitioner referral to treatment for acute leukaemia, children's cancer and testicular cancer were introduced. From 2002, the target of a maximum wait of two months from urgent referral to treatment for breast cancer was introduced. By 2005, there will be targets of a maximum one month wait from diagnosis to treatment and a maximum two month wait from urgent GP referral to treatment for all cancers. Data on current targets are published quarterly on the Department's website for SHAs and trusts, at: http://www.performance.doh. gov.uk/cancerwaits.

 <i>[holding answer 8&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> Measures in the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Bill are designed to reduce abuse of the United Kingdom asylum system. We would therefore expect implementation of its provisions to reduce costs for central and local government in the long-term. Concerns have been raised over the potential impact of clause 8 of the Bill which proposes to withdraw support from failed asylum-seeking families if they refuse to co-operate with efforts to return them home. If, by putting themselves in this position, parents put their children at risk, it would be for the local authority to decide how the interests of their children should be protected under existing child protection legislation. The Bill does not change the grounds on which children may be taken into care. We do not believe that many, if any, parents would put their children in this position. We have made clear 



<P>
<P><I>15 Mar 2004 : Column 125W</I><P>
that local authorities would be reimbursed for costs incurred if a child did require assistance from a local authority as a consequence of the withdrawal of support.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w33.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the effect that identity cards have had on the level of identity fraud in other European countries.  [155341]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w33.html_spnew0"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The incorporation of advanced biometric information into identity documents and the development of an electronic national identity register were announced by my right hon. Friend, the Home Secretary, in his statement on a national identity cards scheme. These measures would provide a unique link between the identity card and the person to whom it was issued and help to ensure that fraudsters could not set up multiple identities. This should have a significant impact in reducing identity fraud.
<P>

<a name="40315w33.html_para0">Home Office officials have had detailed discussions with colleagues involved in the operation of identity card schemes in Italy, Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands and comprehensive information has been supplied by each of the EU member states on the operation of their card schemes. Lessons have been learned and where appropriate they have informed the development of our policy for an identity cards scheme.
<P>

<a name="40315w33.html_para1">Many EU identity card schemes were developed with other specific aims and objectives in mind such as population registration and not specifically implemented for countering identity fraud. As such, many identity cards are issued locally after checking available information e.g. birth certificates, information relating to an applicant's parents. In most EU countries, it is not necessary to give biometric information when applying for an identity card or accessing services.
<P>

<a name="40315w33.html_para2">The 'Identity Cards: The Next Steps' document (CM 6020) states that applications for one of the family of identity cards will require checks against other databases. These checks would confirm that a person had been known by a certain identity and lived at known addresses for a number of years. This information is more difficult to forge than e.g. birth certificates and follows recommendations made in 'Identity Fraud: A Study' conducted by the Cabinet Office and published in July 2002.
<P>

<a name="40315w33.html_para3">Many card schemes in other countries have been in place for many years and use mainly paper cards, which do not hold biometric data. With the passage of time, there is an increasing risk that fraudsters could obtain access to modern printing technology and use it to produce forged paper cards for the purpose of committing identity fraud. The absence of a central electronic identity register in many EU countries, increases the risks as an identity card (or biometric data) cannot be checked against a centrally held record of that information. As such organisations checking a card are only able to make visual checks e.g. to check that the photograph on an identity card looks like the person presenting the card and to check for no obvious alterations to the card itself.
<P>

<a name="40315w33.html_para4">In 'Identity Cards: The Next Steps' the Government stated that the National Identity Register will link each individual record to a biometric. This will prevent multiple identities being established and allow organisations to check a card at a level appropriate for that service.




<P>
<P><I>15 Mar 2004 : Column 135W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40315w33.html_para5">The National Identity Register will be a single highly reliable record of a person's identity and will provide a secure means to verify identity where a registered person consents that their information can be verified by that held on the National Identity Register.
<P>

<a name="40315w33.html_para6">While a modern and effective card scheme would help to combat identity fraud, it does not mean that every card scheme, especially those that have been implemented some time ago, would have a similar or significant effect on countering this type of crime unless they have been regularly updated to stay one step ahead of fraudsters. It is therefore not possible to assess the effect that card schemes in other European countries have had on identity fraud.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w33.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what penalties or deterrents are proposed under the identity card scheme for employers who employ people illegally; and how this will differ from the current system.  [156093]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w33.html_spnew1"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 A common format identification card, able to verify identity to a high standard for all legal residents, would provide employers with a more reliable, quick and easy method of verifying identity and employment eligibility of potential employees. By so doing, it would ensure that employers are able to comply more easily with any requirements of legislation preventing illegal working. These requirements and the associated penalties are contained in immigration legislation, currently section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w33.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how an identity card will aid the police; and how this improves on tools and methods they already have in place.  [156094]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40315w33.html_spnew2"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Identity fraud costs the economy at least &#163;1.3 billion every year. Terrorists use false and multiple identities to help undertake and finance their activities in the United Kingdom and abroad. False and multiple identities are also essential "tools of the trade" for organised crime to facilitate money laundering and also other crimes such as people-trafficking and drug-trafficking. The development of unique identifiers linked to the National Identity Register will help tackle these problems allowing the police and other organisations greater certainty in the identification of individuals and helping prevent multiple identities being used for such purposes.

<a name="40315w33.html_para8">We would also expect that improvements in identity verification through the use of the card and central database will free up police time and resources.

 It is too early at present to specify the exact procedures that will need to be in place if an individual's biometric data is compromised. However, as with any database of personal information, there will be a legal obligation under the Data Protection Act 1998 for the controller of the National Identity Register to ensure that the information held is accurate and secure and an avenue of complaint to the Information Commissioner is open in cases where any complaint cannot be resolved by the controller. Biometric information is no different from other types of personal information with regard to this obligation.

 There will be no new power for the police to stop someone and demand them to produce their identity card.

As set out in "Identity Cards: the next steps" Cm 6020, production of a card to access public services will be in ways defined by those services. In the case of those services for which the devolved Administrations have responsibility, decisions on production of a card to access those services would be a matter for them. We are clear however that the use of the card for access to free public services would not prevent people without cards from accessing emergency services and a card would not be mandatory for verification of entitlement to other services until the appropriate further parliamentary decision on a move to compulsion.

 Copies of the Government's Consultation Paper on the proposals for what were then called entitlement cards were sent to all local authorities in England and Wales and to all 32 councils in Scotland.

A summary of their comments can be found in the document "Identity Cards: A Summary of Findings from the Consultation Exercise on Entitlement Cards and Identity Fraud" (CM 6019 of November 2003).

While we have no record of any problems connected with identity checks by local authorities being reported to the Home Office, many local authorities welcomed the more reliable identity checks which would be facilitated by our scheme. A national identity card would help all service providers, including local authorities, by providing a single, secure and verifiable identity for all citizens and for foreign nationals legally resident here for more than three months.

 The police have powers to take steps to identify a person who has been arrested including checking biometric information. There are also classes of criminal offences which are non-arrestable and are enforced by sending a summons. In these situations, the police have to be certain of a person's name and address. If a person refuses to identify themselves in these circumstances or the police are not satisfied with the information given, they have a power of arrest after which biometric checks can be made.

 The police and Her Majesty's Customs and Excise (HMCE) have a key role in combating organised crime at ports, including terrorism.

 Every Young Offender Institution has an education department which is required to offer mainstream qualifications as delivered in community settings. Most of these are divided into modules enabling short-term prisoners to work towards a full qualification, which can then be completed upon their release. Literacy and numeracy are assessed using a national test that is available weekly.

 The new adult Offender Assessment System, (OASys,) developed jointly by the Prison and Probation Services and currently being rolled-out, contains a question on budgeting that provides offenders with an opportunity to raise matters about financial difficulties related to gambling. In addition, OASys contains a self-assessment questionnaire for offenders that includes a question asking whether gambling is a problem for them and, if so, whether it is linked to their offending. Analysis of a sample of self-assessments in 2003 for 711 prisoners showed that 2&nbsp;per cent. said that gambling was a problem and 0.4&nbsp;per cent. said it was linked to their offending. A sample of about 2,200 offenders under probation showed that 2.3&nbsp;per cent. said that gambling was a problem and 0.7&nbsp;per cent. said it was linked to their offending.

<a name="40315w36.html_para20">Treatment for offenders with gambling problems, whether adults, young offenders or juveniles, is left to the discretion of individual prisons, young offender institutions, probation areas and youth offending teams. A number have established links with organisations such as Gamblers Anonymous and GamCare to provide assistance for offenders with gambling addiction problems, by individual referrals or through groups. Probation areas may also make referrals to Gordon House, a specialist hostel for gamblers.
