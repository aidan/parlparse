 The latest figures published by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) show that students from England applying for entry in 2007 are up by 6 per cent. compared to last year. They have also exceeded the large increase in 2005, meaning we are now seeing the largest ever numbers applying for higher education at this point in the application cycle. The small downturn we saw last year, which we always anticipated, has been strongly reversed this year. I am also pleased to see that there has been a slight increase in the proportion of applicants from the lower socio-economic groups. These highest ever figures show that tuition fees are not putting students off applying to university as many predicted. The critics of the new system are being proved emphatically wrong.</p>

 The National School Sport Strategy, jointly implemented by DCMS and DfES, is a key component of a multi-faceted, &#145;whole school&#146; programme of addressing obesity. The 2005/06 school sport survey found that overall 80 per cent. of pupils participate in at least two hours of high quality PE and school sport a week. This exceeded the target of 75 per cent. for 2006 and demonstrates a considerable increase from the estimated 25 per cent. in 2002. This target for 2008 rises to 85 per cent.

<i> [holding answer 26 June 2007]</i><i> :</i> The likelihood of teenage pregnancy is far higher among young women with poor educational attainment. 29 per cent. of girls leaving school at 16 without qualifications will have a birth under 18, and 12 per cent. an abortion under 18, compared with 1 per cent. and 4 per cent. respectively for girls leaving school at 17 or over. This association between teenage pregnancy and low attainment is evident even after accounting for the effects of deprivation. On average, among the 20 per cent. most deprived wards in England, those with poor levels of educational attainment (less than 40 per cent. of young women achieving 5 GCSE's A-C) have under 18 conception rates twice as high as similarly deprived wards with better levels of educational attainment (more than 60 per cent. of young women achieving 5 GCSE's A-C). Consequently, the teenage pregnancy strategy focuses on raising aspirations and attainment as well as on delaying first sex and better contraception use&#151;giving young people the motivation as well as the means to prevent early pregnancy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="70628w0003.htm_para7"><a name="07062934000381">However, while there is a strong association between absolute teenage pregnancy and educational attainment rates, the association between changes in rates over time is less strong and more difficult to interpret. In large part, this is because teenage pregnancy and educational attainment rates are independently influenced by a wide range of factors. Accounting for how these factors impact on the relationship between changing teenage pregnancy and educational attainment rates is problematic as many are not captured by routinely collected statistics.</p>

 Local authority funding for social services is derived from a variety of sources both from within central Government and also determined locally (via council tax, fees and charges).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"><a name="70628w0004.htm_para5"><a name="07062934000420">It is for individual local authorities to manage and direct their own resources in accordance with local priorities and the needs of the communities to which they are accountable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"><a name="70628w0004.htm_para6"><a name="07062934000421">Central funding for adult social care is via formula grant (via Department for Communities and Local Government) which is not hypothecated and specific grants from the Department.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="70628w0004.htm_para7"><a name="07062934000422">Formula grant is allocated using relative needs formula (RNF) which does include a factor for the number of older people. The RNF are mathematical formulae that include information on population, social structure and other characteristics of each authority. For social care, there are separate formulae for older people (aged 65 and over) and younger adults (aged 18 to 65). The older people&#146;s formula also includes an age top-up for those aged 90 and over (as a proportion of the older people population), which takes into account the higher needs of those of very advanced age This age top-up is calculated as part of the econometric analysis carried out in an academic research project in 2005. There is, however, no set proportion of older people which leads to &#145;additional funding&#146;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="70628w0004.htm_para8"><a name="07062934000423">The Government (in consultation with local government) have developed separate formulae to cover the major service areas, because there are different factors influencing each service area. The funding blocks for service areas are; children&#146;s services, adults&#146; personal services, police, fire, highway maintenance and environmental, protective and cultural services. These formulae apply to all local authorities providing particular services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="70628w0004.htm_para9"><a name="07062934000424">The formula for each specific service area is built on a basic amount per client, plus additional top ups to reflect local circumstances. The top ups take account of a number of local factors that affect service costs, but the biggest factors are deprivation and area costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="70628w0004.htm_para10"><a name="07062934000425">Relative needs are designed to reflect the relative needs of individual authorities in providing services. They are not intended to measure the actual amount needed by any authority to provide local services but simply to recognise the various factors which affect local authorities&#146; costs locally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"><a name="70628w0004.htm_para11"><a name="07062934000426">The arrangements for allocating specific grants vary, some schemes use formulae grant; others allocate funds on the basis of appraisal of bids.</p>

This is in addition to the European Community&#146;s contribution to UNRWA&#146;s core fund of &#8364;66 million this year. The UK contributes about 17 per cent. of EC assistance.</p>

 The Information Commissioner does not have the power to impose a penalty on a direct mailing company for breach of section 11 of the Data Protection Act 1998. Section 11 of the Act gives a right for an individual to give notice in writing for an organisation to cease processing their personal data for the purpose of marketing. If the organisation concerned fails to comply, the individual can seek enforcement at court. An individual can ask the Commissioner&#146;s Office to make an assessment of processing, but this does not result in punitive action. Failure to comply with an enforcement order is a criminal offence and could result in prosecution.</p>

 We consulted the Youth Justice Board and Directors of secure training centres about the proposed change. Wider consultation was not necessary or appropriate, as there is no change of the policy on the use of physical restraint. That policy is set out in section 10 of the Youth Justice Board&#146;s code of practice &#147;Managing Children and Young People's Behaviour in the Secure Estate&#148;.</p>

The Board also collects statistical data on the use of physical restraint across the under-18 secure estate. In April 2007, it introduced a new system of data collection, which will provide more detailed information and allow more accurate comparisons to be made about use of restraint in the three sectors of the estate (young offender institutions, secure training centres and secure children&#146;s homes).</p>

 The Bexhill to Hastings link road scheme was granted Programme Entry in December 2004 with an agreed departmental funding contribution of &#163;47.12 million. In July 2006, we accepted the South East region&#146;s advice that the scheme was a priority for the region at an increased cost of &#163;48.5 million. However, it has since been reported that the estimated total cost of the scheme has increased to around &#163;89 million. As a result, the South East region will need to decide whether it still wishes to prioritise funding for this scheme at its higher cost within its regional funding allocations. Should the region formally advise that the scheme continues to be a priority, it will then be subject to a re-appraisal and value for money assessment in accordance with the Department&#146;s guidance before a final decision is taken on whether to provide additional funding for the scheme.</p>
