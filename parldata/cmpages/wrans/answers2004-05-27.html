 The terms and method of reallocation of radio spectrum released by digital switchover are a matter for Ofcom. Additionally, the scope of future uses will be dependent on the result of international negotiations commencing in 2006. Hence, the Government are not currently in a position to make an estimate of the likely value of spectrum.

<a name="40527w01.html_para0">
However, the Government have produced an economic cost-benefit analysis of digital switchover. The positive result of this study informed the Government&#039;s decision to confirm their support for switchover in September 2003 as it will bring significant benefits to consumers and to broadcasters.

<p class="tabletext">The NES, carried out in April of each year, is the most comprehensive source of earnings information in Great Britain. It is a one per cent. sample of all employees who are members of pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) schemes but, because of its sampling frame,

<p><a name="40527w02.html_spnew5"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 The results of the Spending Review will be made public in due course. The OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) rules on the eligibility for official development assistance (oda), and it will be a matter for the DAC to decide what contribution IFF monies would make towards the UK oda/GNI level. The precise arrangements for the operation of the International Finance Facility (IFF) are still the subject of discussions between the UK and other interested governments.

<p>
<a name="40527w02.html_para4">
The IFF has been designed to front-load the aid to reach the $50 billion extra per year that it is estimated is needed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). On current trends few of the MDGs will be met by the target date of 2015, and many will remain off-track without increased investment by donor countries. By delivering aid now, when it will have the most impact, the IFF will be able to provide the world&#039;s poorest countries with the funds they desperately need.

<p><a name="40527w03.html_spnew1"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The Joint Initiative on Regulatory Reform was welcomed by the Spring European Council in March. Following on from this, the Competitiveness Council endorsed an initial work programme at its 17&#150;18&nbsp;May meeting, including improvements to impact assessment and review of existing legislation. The European Council has committed to return to the issue at its November meeting.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w03.html_para1">
The EU&#039;s impact assessment process was introduced as part of its Better Regulation Action Plan and covers both costs and benefits of potential action. The joint initiative contains a number of measures designed to strengthen this analysis, relating to both costs and benefits. In particular, the joint initiative called for better assessment of the impact of proposals on EU competitiveness.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w03.html_para2">
With regard to simplification of existing legislation, the joint initiative builds on the Commission&#039;s work under its Better Regulation Action Plan. The scope of this programme includes reform or removal of existing legislation which is in force, as well as of that which is obsolete or no longer in use.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the current status of the gamma interferon trials being conducted by her Department is; what the total cost so far expended on developing this test is; and what the estimated total cost fully to develop this test to the point where it can be used routinely is.  [158000]</p>








<p><a name="40527w04.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Desk studies have estimated that significant savings will need to accrue from the use of gamma interferon (g-IFN) before it becomes cost-effective in GB. The field trial of the g-IFN test taking place in Wales and the Midlands is sponsored by Defra and the Welsh Assembly Government. It aims to assess 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 May 2004 : Column 1735W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
the cost-effectiveness of using g-IFN in infected herds in conjunction with the single intradermal comparative cervical test.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w04.html_para1">
The field pilot began in November 2002, with the intention to recruit 660 herds. Recruitment to the trial has been slow, with 115 herds recruited by 19&nbsp;May 2004. Approximately one third of herds recruited so far are g-IFN tested, with the other herds subject to &quot;extra-severe&quot; interpretation of the skin test and a control group (status quo).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w04.html_para2">
From May 2004, newly recruited herds will have a 50&nbsp;per cent. chance of being allocated the g-IFN treatment, with 25&nbsp;per cent. allocated to &quot;extra-severe&quot; and 25&nbsp;per cent. to &quot;control&quot; groups. It is hoped this will encourage more eligible herd owners to participate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w04.html_para3">
Since 1999, the Government have spent more than &#163;900,000 on g-IFN research projects and &#163;8.5&nbsp;million on other research projects contributing to the development of g-IFN as a diagnostic test. This is in addition to the &#163;667,000 we expect to spend on the field pilot for the test.

<p>
<a name="40527w04.html_para5">
The number of reactors per incident is a proxy for the severity of a TB breakdown. Severity of a breakdown is in turn determined by the number of cattle in the herd infected at the initial exposure (index animals), the time elapsed between introduction of infection in the herd and the disclosing test (or slaughterhouse case), social interactions between infective and susceptible cattle, herd size, herd management system, susceptibility of the host, the portal of entry into the host and infective dose and, possibly, the strain of &quot;M. bovis&quot; causing the breakdown. Confirmed TB incidents tend to last longer and yield more reactors than unconfirmed incidents.

Also the proportion of high risk herds being tested post-FMD is greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result since 2002 the statistical data is not comparable to that of previous years.<br>

The main cost to farmers incurred for TB testing is labour use. The time spent on testing varies greatly from farm to farm, and will depend on such factors as the size of the herd, the age, breed and sex of the animals, the efficiency of the system employed, the way the cattle are handled, gathering times, preparation and cleaning times and subsequent post-test paperwork.

 The Competition Commission investigation in 2000 did not look at the retail industry generally. It was a specific investigation into the supply of groceries from multiple stores. The Commission&#039;s report found that the practice of below cost selling, when carried out by companies with market power, did operate against the public interest but that remedies would be disproportionate to the adverse effect.

 Separate figures are not available for past efficiency improvements. DFID has however sought to promote efficiency, for example through internal Service Level Agreements.

<i>[holding answer 25&nbsp;May 2004]:</i> Pursuant to the response given to UIN 175839 on Wednesday 26&nbsp;May.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w08.html_para14">
I remain deeply concerned about the grave situation in Darfur, western Sudan. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the Minister for Africa (Chris Mullin) and I all registered our serious concerns about the humanitarian and human rights situation with the Sudanese Foreign Minister, Dr. Mustafa Osman Ismail, when he visited London on 11&nbsp;May. The UK Special Representative and our Ambassador in Khartoum had further detailed discussions about Darfur with several Government Ministers and senior officials in Khartoum last week.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w08.html_para15">
I spoke to Mr. Ismail again on 20&nbsp;May and he told me he had announced new measures governing the issue of visas and travel permits to humanitarian workers wishing to travel to Darfur. These new measures came into effect on 24&nbsp;May and include the following: all visas for NGOs, donors, the ICRC, the UN and other humanitarian workers going to Darfur will be issued by Sudanese Embassies within 48 hours; visas will now last for three months rather than one; the requirement for permits to travel from Khartoum to Darfur has been cancelled&#151;notification of travel plans is now the sole requirement; unrestricted movement in Darfur is permitted, subject to UN security co-ordinating movements; a special customs officer will be appointed to facilitate the smooth movement of humanitarian freight.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w08.html_para16">
We welcomed this announcement, and have been monitoring its implementation closely. Initial indications are that these new procedures are working.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w08.html_para17">
Humanitarian needs in Darfur remain enormous. Over one million people are internally displaced and a further 120,000 have fled across the border into Chad. Their circumstances are precarious and are likely to worsen with the onset of rains in the region. The UK has committed over &#163;17.5&nbsp;million to humanitarian agencies 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 May 2004 : Column 1754W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
working in Darfur and eastern Chad (see table). We are the second largest donor in Darfur after the US. Our commitments include &#163;5&nbsp;million agreed on 11&nbsp;May to support WFP, WHO and UNICEF, as well as commitments in the last two weeks of &#163;670,000 to MSF-Belgium for emergency health care in North Darfur and &#163;250,000 for the UN Joint Logistics Centre (UNJLC). We have also seconded seven humanitarian experts, four of whom are supporting OCHA in Khartoum and in Darfur and three of whom are working in UNJLC to improve the co-ordination of relief. In addition we have provided 15,000 plastic sheets and 22,500 blankets for distribution by agencies. We also contribute 19&nbsp;per cent. of the cost of ECHO&#039;S commitment&#151;of &#163;4.5&nbsp;million&#151;to NGOs working in Darfur and Chad. Despite our efforts, we are concerned that the recent UN appeal remains significantly under funded, and we are urging other donors to increase their contributions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w08.html_para18">
The Sudanese Government can be in no doubt about the seriousness with which we view the situation. We have made it very clear that we expect the parties to implement fully the 8&nbsp;April ceasefire agreement, including by ensuring unimpeded humanitarian access. Both parties must to put an end to all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. The Sudanese Government must act now to rein in the Janjaweed militias who seem to be responsible for some of the worst atrocities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w08.html_para19">
In terms of improving the security situation in Darfur, our priority remains rapid deployment of the African Union-led Ceasefire Monitoring Commission (CFC). To this end we are in almost daily contact with the AU through our Embassy in Addis Ababa, and with other members of the international community. The AU mission has now returned from its reconnaissance visit, and they are currently putting together an operational plan and outline budget. These will be discussed today by the Sudanese Government and opposition groups in Addis Ababa. We then plan to make a swift and significant contribution to the CFC and are encouraging other donors to do the same.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w08.html_para20">
The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has now issued its report on Darfur and the Security Council has been briefed on its contents. It identifies disturbing patterns of human rights violations in Darfur, including forced displacement, arbitrary killing of civilians, and rape, perpetrated by the Sudanese Government and its proxy militia, many of which may constitute war crimes and/or crimes against humanity. Further urgent discussions are taking place on what action should now be taken in light of the report&#039;s recommendations. We, with our EU partners, have also made clear that all alleged attacks should be thoroughly investigated and the perpetrators brought to justice. We are also in close contact with the OHCHR about Darfur, and are working to ensure that the Independent Expert, mandated by the 23&nbsp;April Commission on Human Rights decision on Sudan, is appointed as soon as possible.

Legislation is required to comply fully with the convention&#039;s requirements in Article 52, on prevention and detection of transfers of the proceeds of crime; Article 53, on the confiscation and repatriation of assets; and Article 55, on the forfeiture of the instrumentalities of crime.

Secondary legislation will also be required to comply with Article 52. Measures dealing with the requirements of Article 52 are likely to be included in the EU Third Money Laundering Directive. Our current expectation is that negotiations on the directive will be completed by the first part of next year and we would seek to implement it in the UK through secondary legislation, as soon as we reasonably could thereafter.

However, the British Crime Survey (BCS) routinely collects data on the prevalence and number of incidents of domestic violence in England and Wales from the main &quot;face-to-face&quot; part of the survey.

We will be considering the best way in which to build on the success of the CLS in the light of the Review&#039;s recommendations and the comments we receive.

 The draft Mental Incapacity Bill will offer protection to any individual who lacks the capacity to make his or her own decisions.

The use of sedation will only be permitted if the person reasonably believes its use is necessary to prevent harm to the person lacking capacity, and proportionate to the likelihood and seriousness of that harm.

The cheque method of payment is only intended for those customers who genuinely cannot use Direct Payment. Customers who will require a cheque payment are likely to have had experience of, and be familiar with, cashing order books and giros at the post office. The cheque solution replicates this process. Cheques can be cashed at post office branches or paid into an account, and they will provide the facility for a third party to cash the cheque on a customer&#039;s behalf.

Figures are consistent with the historical outturn expenditure figures published in the DWP&#039;s benefit expenditure which can be found on the Department for Work and Pensions website at: http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd4/expenditure. asp.<br>

Figures are for IB and SDA recipients only and do not include &quot;credits only&quot; cases or income-related benefits.<br>

Figures do not include costs of administration.<br>

From 6&nbsp;April 2001, there are no new claims for SDA; from that date people disabled early in life can qualify for IB.<br>

Expenditure has been apportioned using data on conditions of IB and SDA recipients from the IB Quarterly Statistical Enquiry which is based on a 5&nbsp;per cent. sample and therefore subject to a degree of sampling variation.<br>

Figures are in 2004&#150;05 prices, calculated using the latest GDP deflator.<br>

Figures are rounded to the nearest million pounds.<br>

Totals may not sum due to rounding.<br>

Figures for 2003&#150;04 are estimated outturn.<br>

 The income of the partner of a non-resident parent is only taken into account when assessing child support in the old scheme. It is used to calculate the &quot;protected level of income&quot; within the formula. Without this information the Child Support Agency cannot make a final assessment. The non-resident parent might then be asked, in the interim, to pay a higher amount than his or her circumstances would otherwise demand.

<p><a name="40527w19.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Pond: </b> 
 The transfer of income support and jobseeker&#039;s allowance cases on to child tax credit began on 6&nbsp;April 2004 as planned. Families on income support and jobseeker&#039;s allowance who were already receiving child tax credit have started to receive support for their children solely through child tax credit. New claimants of income support and jobseeker&#039;s allowance are no longer awarded child allowances in those benefits, but receive child tax credit instead.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w19.html_para7">
The automatic phased transfer on to child tax credit of the remaining families with children within income support and jobseeker&#039;s allowance is planned to begin from October 2004. Meanwhile, families will continue to receive the same level of support through their benefits as they would from child tax credit.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w19.html_para8">
We have always recognised that it is important to ensure a successful and smooth migration for claimants of income support and income-based jobseeker&#039;s allowance on to child tax credit. We have therefore taken steps to ensure that those families will not lose the child element of jobseeker&#039;s allowance and income support until we have confirmation that child tax credit has been awarded. The technical design of the income support and jobseeker&#039;s allowance computer systems ensure this. The child and family elements will automatically continue to be paid until a confirmation that child tax credit has been awarded is received from Inland Revenue.

 The UK Government support the free movement of people and workers within the EU&#151;providing our citizens with the opportunity to work elsewhere, as well as allowing our economy to benefit from the productive potential of workers from the new member states.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w21.html_para5">
The UK has one of the most successful and flexible labour markets in the EU with unemployment at its lowest level for 30 years. The UK labour market has upwards of 550,000 vacancies, and around 15&nbsp;per cent. of UK trend economic growth depends on migration. Indeed studies show that migrants paid &#163;2.5 billion more in taxes in 1999&#150;2000 than they consumed in benefits and services. Hence the UK is well placed to absorb additional workers from accession states.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w21.html_para6">
But just as UK nationals have the responsibility not to abuse our benefit and social protection system, so we would expect our neighbours and partners in the EU not to abuse the system. That is why we have allowed free movement of labour but brought in regulations to prevent exploitation of our benefits.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w21.html_para7">
It costs &#163;50 to register for the first time under the worker registration scheme. The fee has been set at this level to cover some of the administrative costs of running the scheme, in accordance with other charged services. Registration enables those nationals from the eight accession states who were working in the UK without authorisation prior to 1&nbsp;May to regularise their status and move into the formal economy. We do not believe that a one-off fee of &#163;50 will act as a deterrent to registration by them or by others arriving in the UK. Similarly, we foresee the introduction of this fee having no impact on the services provided by Jobcentre Plus.

<p><a name="40527w22.html_wqn7"><b> Mr. Webb: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will estimate the annual cost of running the Pension Protection Fund, broken down by <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;direct costs of employing staff, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;costs paid to outside bodies including (i) investment managers and (ii) actuaries and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;the costs of collecting the levy by the New Pension Regulator.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 May 2004 : Column 1807W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>






<p><a name="40527w22.html_spnew7"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 Our initial estimates indicate that running costs for the early years of the PPF are between &#163;9&#150;15&nbsp;million per year. These are order of magnitude figures and are based on a number of assumptions made very early on about the way the PPF might operate. The operating model and the detailed processes underpinning that model are now being refined; this is enabling us to have a much clearer view about not only the potential supply routes, but also the number of people, and necessary skills set, the PPF will need to deliver its business. It is important to note that final decisions relating to operations are very much a matter for the in-coming board. Estimates will be revised once these decisions are firmed up.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w22.html_para2">
With those points in mind, the early numbers show that on the basis of PPF employing around 100 staff&#151;including professionals such as actuaries&#151;the staff costs represent approximately a third of the total. The charges relating to investment managers are not factored into the admin costs, as they are part and parcel of the on-going activity relating to the Fund itself. Assumptions relating to the charges in this area are, at this stage, commercially sensitive. We estimate costs relating to levy collection are in the order of less than half a million pounds.

 There are various procedures in place to enable pensioners who have been overpaid to repay sums to the Department.

The security situation remains a problem, particularly in the South and East. Sporadic attacks continue against both international and Afghan forces, as well as the UN and NGOs.

Central Afghanistan, in general, is reasonably secure, assisted by the presence of the New Zealand-led Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) based in Bamiyan and the new PRT in Oruzgan Province. Northern Afghanistan is generally stable but is subject to long-standing tensions between the two biggest factions in the region. The UK-led PRT based in Mazar-e Sharif has helped defuse tensions and a second UK-led PRT is now being established in Faryab Province. There tend to be fewer security incidents in the west. A flare-up of fighting in Herat followed the death of the Afghan Minister for Civil Aviation and Tourism in March but units of the Afghan National Army (ANA) calmed the situation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w24.html_para4">
Security in the south and east is worrying. There have been murders of international and Afghan aid workers. Seven PRTs have been established in the south and east to help improve the security environment. Coalition forces and units of the ANA continue to pursue terrorists, especially along the border with Pakistan. The Pakistani army is playing its part in ensuring that perpetrators of attacks in Afghanistan cannot easily find refuge in Pakistan.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w24.html_para5">
The international community, including the UK, is responding to the need for security with increased commitments of troops and resources. Additional PRTs are the key to expanding the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The UK has agreed to lead a second PRT and provide a Forward Support Base for all PRTs in the North. But ISAF expansion can only proceed once NATO&#039;s statement ofrequirements is fully met. We are pressing other nations to contribute the resources needed to meet remaining shortfalls.

 The Government set out their strategy for the 14&#150;19 phase of education in their policy document, 14&#150;19: &quot;Opportunity and Excellence&quot;. They have asked the Working Group on 14&#150;19 Reform to recommend how there might be greater coherence in vocational learning programmes for all young people in their 14&#150;19 education and on a unified framework of qualifications suitable for all learners. The Group&#039;s interim report was published in February and its final report is expected in the Autumn. The Government have already taken action to bring work related and vocational education into the mainstream of the secondary system to help address skills needs. Among other measures: work related learning will become a statutory requirement for all at KS4 from September 2004; qualifications such as the GCSEs in vocational subjects have been introduced to extend the curriculum offer; and programmes such as &quot;Increased Flexibility for 14&#150;16 Year Olds&quot; and &quot;Young Apprenticeships&quot; will provide off-site placements and experience of work for students wanting more applied learning.

The OECD report, &quot;Career Guidance and Public Policy: Bridging the Gap&quot; (published March 2004), highlighted some positive activity in the UK in relation to career guidance and good practice. We recognise that services such as the Connexions Service for young people, the work of Jobcentre Plus and the reform of IAG services for adults must take account of the demographic changes in the UK. I recognise that the demographic changes show that there will be an older workforce, and we must look to the integration of the skills and welfare agenda to both re-skill and up-skill older workers, and to support and encourage those people on benefits into work with appropriate training. That is why the New Deal for Skills agenda is so important.

<p><a name="40527w30.html_spnew4"><b> Margaret Hodge </b> 
<i>[holding answer 21&nbsp;May 2004]:</i> All teachers, irrespective of when they qualified, are expected to identify their developmental needs through performance management arrangements, and to address identified needs, including improving their teaching skills in the area of special educational needs, by undertaking appropriate professional development.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w30.html_para0">
SEN training needs can be identified by using the &#039;National SEN Specialist Standards&#039; published by the Teacher Training Agency (TTA) in December 1999, which covers the key outcomes, the professional knowledge and understanding, and skills and attributes required, and the key areas of their role and responsibilities.

 I understand from the chair of the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) that the information requested is not collected in the form requested. Care homes may close for a number of reasons, including as a result of enforcement action by CSCI or by the provider voluntarily deregistering the service. Complaints may only be one of a number of circumstances which lead to a home closing. It would not therefore be possible or accurate to ascribe reasons for home closure directly to complaints.

<a name="40527w30.html_sbhd8"><h3 align=center>Drug Labelling</h3>





<p><a name="40527w30.html_wqn8"><b> Mr. Burstow: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what progress has been made since the Drugs and Therapeutics Bulletin report of 2001 to ensure that all&nbsp;new drugs are labelled with a black triangle warning.  [174476]</p>








<p><a name="40527w30.html_spnew8"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The black triangle scheme is intended to facilitate the intensive monitoring of new medicines for which there is relatively limited safety data available. A black triangle symbol is used in the product information to identify the medicines for which the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) request health professionals to report all suspected adverse reactions rather than serious reactions alone. This is a voluntary scheme and, while 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 May 2004 : Column 1834W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
use of the symbol is not a legal requirement, it is expected that marketing authorisation holders (MAHs) will use the black triangle symbol where requested to do so by the MHRA.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w30.html_para3">
Following the publication of a survey in Drugs and Therapeutics Bulletin in 2001 entitled, &quot;Failings in treatment advice, SPCs and black triangles&quot;, the MHRA formally reviewed the use of the black triangle symbol on product information. Companies were requested to submit summaries of product characteristics (SPCs) and promotional material for their products under intensive monitoring and it was subsequently found that approximately 9&nbsp;per cent. did not display the symbol on their material. Importantly, the review found that all black triangle products had the symbol routinely displayed in the British National Formulary (BNF) and the monthly index of medical specialities (MIMS). These publications are widely used by health professionals when prescribing medicines. This was due to active liaison between the MHRA and MIMS and the BNF. During the review, the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry was also contacted and undertook to inform new companies of the scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w30.html_para4">
As a routine measure, the advertising unit at the MHRA reviews advertisements for new products in a selection of key published journals, and the assessment includes checking to see if the black triangle symbol is displayed. In accordance with published criteria, the unit may also ask a company to submit all promotional material to the MHRA for pre-vetting. Any omission of the black triangle symbol is brought to the immediate attention of the company, who would be asked to re-submit an amended advertisement. In general, companies are found to comply with the scheme for incorporating the black triangle symbol on their promotional material.

 Directive 2002/46/EC on food supplements came into force on 12&nbsp;July 2002. The Food Supplements Regulations England 2003, which implement the Directive in England, were laid before Parliament in June 2003 and the provisions are set to come into force on 1&nbsp;August 2005. There is parallel legislation in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w31.html_para0">
In October 2003, I had a useful meeting with representatives of the health food industry to discuss their concerns over the potential impact of the Directive, particularly relating to the submission of safety dossiers to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and to the future setting of European maximum levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w31.html_para1">

<p>
<a name="40527w31.html_para2">
In addition, I recently set out the Government&#039;s views on the setting of maximum limits to Commissioner David Byrne. The EFSA is continuing work on safe upper limits for intakes of vitamins and minerals begun by the Scientific Committee on Food. It is not expected to complete this work until Summer 2005 at the earliest. The Commission will not publish a proposal on European Union maximum limits until this work is complete. Commissioner Byrne and I agreed to talk again when the EFSA&#039;s advice has been published and, if appropriate, meet. In the meantime, officials continue to press the case for safety based maximum limits in all the relevant European forums. They are keeping in close contact with the Commission officials, who will in due course draft the proposal on EU maximum limits. I have asked for progress reports.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w31.html_para3">
I am willing to meet food supplement industry representatives again. However, I have suggested to them that, before such a meeting takes place, it would be useful for industry technical advisors to meet FSA officials to discuss detailed technical issues relating to dossiers and then for the industry to gain experience of submitting such dossiers to the EFSA.

<p><a name="40527w35.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Dodds: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland when consultation proposals on sexual offences in Northern Ireland will be issued, following the announcement of a review in October 2003.  [175726]</p>








<p><a name="40527w35.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Spellar: </b> 
 We have not yet completed our consideration of this issue.


</p>







<p><a name="40527w35.html_wqn6"><b> Mr. Dodds: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what steps are being taken to ensure that children in Northern Ireland are afforded the same protection as those in England and Wales under the Sexual Offences Act 2003.  [175693]</p>








<p><a name="40527w35.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Spellar: </b> 
 The Sexual Offences Act 2003 was implemented on 1&nbsp;May 2004. Of the 19 offences which extend directly to Northern Ireland in the Act, 9 of these relate specifically to offences against children. For example, the new offence of meeting a child following sexual grooming provides for a vital new level of protection for our children.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w35.html_para7">
We have also taken the opportunity to extend to Northern Ireland the strengthened provisions which protect children, often particularly vulnerable children, who are in relationships of trust with adults.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w35.html_para8">
The Act also creates new offences which specifically criminalise the abuse of children through prostitution and pornography.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w35.html_para9">
The new offence of sexual activity in a public toilet also extends to Northern Ireland, and is an indication that this sort of behaviour, which is clearly inappropriate in a public toilet, will not be tolerated, particularly where children can be present.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40527w35.html_para10">
These changes represent a significant improvement in the level of protection offered to children in Northern Ireland.
