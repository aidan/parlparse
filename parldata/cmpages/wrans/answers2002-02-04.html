To ask the Minister for Women what budgetary provision has been made for the cost of the Women's Unit in the first financial year of its existence.  [33057]<P>

 The Women's Unit was created in 1998. Its budget for the first financial year of its existence (1998&#150;99) was &#163;1,111,897. The unit was renamed the Women and Equality Unit following last year's general election in order to recognise its new policy responsibilities across the United Kingdom for gender equality, co-ordination of sexual orientation policy and its sponsorship of the Equal Opportunities commission.

To ask the Minister for Women if she will make a statement on how the responsibilities of the Women's Unit differ from the responsibilities of the departmental Ministers for Women.  [33122]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20204w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 In my role as Minister for Women and supported by the Women and Equality Unit, I work closely with Cabinet colleagues, other Government Departments and Number 10 in order to ensure that the Government can bring about practical improvements to women's lives that benefit society as a whole. There are no Ministers for Women assigned to individual Government Departments.

To ask the Minister for Women what plans she has to make representations to the Department for Work and Pensions to secure improved arrangements for carers.  [30870]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20204w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 In autumn 2000 the Government announced a package of measures to enhance the current social security provision for carers, worth more than &#163;500 million over a three year period. Two of the measures were implemented in April last year. The invalid care allowance (ICA) earnings limit was increased from &#163;50 to &#163;72 per week and the carer premium paid through the income related benefits was increased from &#163;14.15 to &#163;24.40.
<P>

<a name="20204w01.html_para0">On 17 December 2001, the Department for Work and Pensions laid a draft regulatory reform order before Parliament. If accepted, this will give those aged over 65 the right to claim invalid care allowance for the first time; will provide for the extension of entitlement to ICA for up to eight weeks after the death of the person being cared for; and will change the name of the benefit to carer's allowance.
<P>

<a name="20204w01.html_para1">I have no plans to make any representations for further change.

 The Women and Equality Unit supports the Ministers for Women in helping to deliver the Government's key priorities. Its aim is to bring about measurable improvements in the position of women which benefit society across the United Kingdom. It works on specific issues on a project basis alongside Number 10 and central Government Departments. Current priorities include helping women to balance their lives at home and work, closing the pay gap, developing policies which help women who want to return to work and the delivery of high quality health and education public services for women. It also has responsibility across the UK for policy and legislation on gender equality and sexual orientation and sponsors the Equal Opportunities Commission as well as ensuring the United Kingdom fulfils its international obligations and raises the profile of women's issues in the EU.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what recent representations she has received regarding her Department's work to encourage inward investment to the UK.  [30163]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20204w02.html_spnew0"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 Government Ministers take every opportunity to promote the UK as the place to do business.
<P>

<a name="20204w02.html_para0">Invest UK, as part of its overall promotional effort to attract inward investment to the UK, is in continuous dialogue, with the involvement of Ministers, with both prospective and existing investors to help them in all aspects of locating and doing business here. My noble Friend the Minister for Trade and Investment holds regular breakfast meetings with existing inward investors to discuss specific concerns that they may have.
<P>

<a name="20204w02.html_para1">Ministers are also regularly involved in inward investment events overseas. During a recent visit to Japan, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry hosted a dinner for investors and also met members of the automotive manufacturers and components suppliers in support of their efforts in retaining and making further investment in the UK. In January this year on a two-day visit to Toronto, my noble Friend the Minister for Trade and Investment called on existing major investors and multipliers and held media interviews to promote inward investment. On a visit this month, I shall be hosting an inward investment dinner during my attendance at the largest ICT (information and communications technologies) conference taking place in India this year.
<P>

<a name="20204w02.html_para2">These actions have contributed to the UK retaining its position as the top destination for inward investment in Europe as confirmed by the recently published UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) figures on foreign investment flows.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20204w02.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government are fully committed to the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) to phase out Multi Fibre Arrangement (MFA) import restrictions. We also fully support Commissioner Lamy's bilateral market access initiative offering liberalisation of textile and clothing trade with the EU over and above that required in the ATC in return for improved access to the textile and clothing markets of supplier countries.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many claims were made by those seeking part-time employee pension entitlements following a ruling in May 2000 by the European Court of Justice; how many have been settled; and when she expects all outstanding cases to be dealt with.  [32292]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20204w02.html_spnew4"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Employment Tribunals Service database (RITAS) does not identify these particular claims from any other claims brought under equal pay or sex discrimination legislation. It is therefore not possible to give exact figures for claims brought following the ECJ ruling in May 2000 or which claims brought since then have settled.
<P>

<a name="20204w02.html_para6">However, manual records indicate that since May 2000 approximately 19,000 claims have been made to an employment tribunal following the ECJ ruling. In the same period approximately 11,000 claims were disposed of prior to a hearing including those settled leaving over 51,000 outstanding claims.
<P>

<a name="20204w02.html_para7">The majority of claims are against public sector employers and are stayed awaiting the result of test cases which are scheduled to be heard between 24 June and 19 July 2002. The findings of these test cases will be applicable to those stayed cases.

<P>
<a name="20204w03.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 In recent months I have not attended any meetings with European colleagues at which space research and exploration was specifically discussed. However, my noble Friend the Minister for Science and Innovation attended the Ministerial Council of the European Space Agency on 14&#150;15 November 2001, which the United Kingdom hosted in Edinburgh. At this meeting it was agreed the UK would subscribe to the study phase of a potential European programme for exploration of the solar system, the Aurora programme. The Minister also attended the October Research Council which discussed the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security initiative, and the December Research Council where some conclusions on space policy were adopted. More recently he attended a bilateral with the Spanish Science Minister at which the subject of the European global satellite navigation system (Galileo) was raised.

 Existing mechanisms for dealing with complaints within Juvenile Justice Centres are operated by an independent Juvenile Justice Board, as required by the Secretary of State.

 DFID does not have extensive developmental links with Burundi. We are seeking to support international efforts to promote an end to conflict and achieve a secure and lasting peace. We are at the same time supporting humanitarian programmes largely through non-governmental channels. In the current financial year we have committed &#163;1 million for support for emergency health and nutrition programmes, and for the promotion of human rights and political dialogue. We envisage increasing this support during 2002. In addition the UK's share of ECHO's &#163;20 million humanitarian budget for Burundi in 2001 was some &#163;4 million. We have also committed &#163;5.175 million for the implementation of a three-year project tackling the pressing problem of HIV/AIDS in Burundi, and have provisionally allocated US$1 million to the proposed Multilateral Debt Trust Fund for this country.

<a name="20204w05.html_para2">The UK has been at the forefront of encouraging the IMF to reform their medium term programmes to ensure that these deliver growth and poverty reduction. A key element of the new design of IMF programmes is the undertaking to support pro-poor budgets, which includes protecting and expanding where possible education spending. In recent years the IMF programmes have supported the introduction of free education in several countries, including Uganda and Tanzania.

 The Government are taking urgent action to tackle antisocial behaviour and disorder. My right hon. Friend, the Home Secretary, has already outlined the measures we are taking to increase the effectiveness of antisocial behaviour order (ASBOs). These include proposals to:
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>extend the power to apply for ASBOs to the British Transport Police and registered Social Landlords

<P>

<a name="20204w05.html_para8">South Wales police have a six-step strategy for dealing with antisocial behaviour, the application for an ASBO is the final step in that strategy.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20204w06.html_spnew2"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 All juvenile establishments work with Youth Offending Teams to plan the transfer of the young person into the community phase of the Detention and Training Order. Juvenile establishments plan a young person's release from prison with the young person's community supervising officer and where applicable his/her parents or carers. Release is planned from the start of a sentence through a series of meetings and action plans. A final meeting takes place 10 days before release in order to finalise arrangements for on-going support in the community. The personal officer from the custody setting then attends the first training plan meeting in the community. This ensures that the two parts of the sentence are linked. Sentence planning forms part of this process and is, so far as is possible, tailored to individual needs.

 In the year ending March 2001, just under 1.25 million recorded crimes were detected. This amounted to 24 per cent. of all recorded crime in England and Wales in 2000&#150;01.
<P>

<a name="20204w06.html_para1">This figure is much higher for some crimes than for others&#151;for example, 62 per cent. of all crimes of violence against the person were detected. Of that figure, 90 per cent. of homicides and 81 per cent. of attempted murders were detected.

 Decisions to release prisoners on home detention curfew (HDC) are a matter for indiviual Governors, within the guidance set down by the Prison Service, including a requirement for a rigorous risk assessment. Research undertaken by the Home Office shows that home detention curfew helps prisoners to make the transition between prison and the community. (Home Office Research Study 222, Electronic monitoring of released prisoners and evaluation of the Home Detention Curfew scheme, March 2001). We have asked Governors to make full use of the scheme where they can do so without unacceptable risk to public safety.

<a name="20204w06.html_para11">We have turned around the decline in police numbers that started under the last Government. Police numbers rose by 2,645 officers in the 12 months to September 2001, taking national strength to 127,231, the highest since February 1995. This increase, of 2.1 per cent. is the largest single annual increase in police numbers for 20 years.
<P>

<a name="20204w06.html_para12">We have set the police service a target to reach record numbers of officers by this April, and 130,000 officers by spring 2003.

 The successful detection and prosecution of offenders are among the key factors in ensuring that victims of crime are satisfied with the criminal justice system. Others include the provision to victims of adequate information about their cases, personal support, and compensation.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on his policy to improve the retention of police officers.  [29878]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20204w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Police numbers rose by 2.1 per cent. in the 12 months to September 2001. Wastage from the police service, at around 5 per cent. of strength for the last four years, is low compared to other occupations.




<P>
<P><I>4 Feb 2002 : Column 664W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20204w07.html_para0">But we recognise the importance of retaining the skills and commitment of experienced officers.
<P>

<a name="20204w07.html_para1">An ambitious programme of work in police training has begun to raise professional standards for officers and support staff, and to achieve greater consistency nationally.
<P>

<a name="20204w07.html_para2">We are also addressing retention issues as part of the police reform process.




<P>
<P><I>4 Feb 2002 : Column 665W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20204w07.html_para3">The Police Negotiating Board (PNB) has agreed in principle to a package of reforms to police pay and conditions of service. The agreement is subject to ratification by all parties by the end of February. We believe that, taking the package as a whole, it will benefit the vast majority of officers.
<P>

<a name="20204w07.html_para4">The PNB package includes more flexible arrangements to retain officers who are entitled to retire with maximum pension benefits.
<P>

<a name="20204w07.html_para5">We also intend to remove the requirement for part-time officers to work a minimum of 16 hours a week. This will help improve retention of officers with parental or caring responsibilities.
<P>

<a name="20204w07.html_para6">We are also developing an Occupational Health strategy which will provide support of officers who are injured or ill and will help forces improve sickness management and reduce medical retirements.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the level of crime recorded by the British Crime Survey.  [29881]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20204w07.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The latest British Crime Survey shows that since 1997 overall crime has fallen by 21 per cent., violent crime by 23 per cent., domestic burglary by 35 per cent., and vehicle related theft by 24 per cent. The survey also showed that the chance of becoming a victim of crime is at its lowest since the survey began.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20204w07.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Denham: </B>

 A key focus of the government's anti-drug strategy is ensuring young people and their parents or carers are aware of the dangers of drugs and where to get help. Drugs education policies are in place in 93 per cent. of secondary and 75 per cent. of primary schools. Information about drugs is routinely sent to schools, GP surgeries and police stations. In December, we launched a campaign to raise the awareness of the risks of drugs and to encourage young people, their parents or carers to call the National Drugs Helpline on 0800 776600 for reliable and credible information about the harm drugs cause.

<a name="20204w08.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 It is a principle in public service pension schemes that members are required to contribute towards the cost of their benefits. Prior to 5 April 1978 the police scheme attracted a widow's pension of half the husband's pension. However, in line with other public service pension schemes, it did not provide survivor benefits for wives married to those who had already retired from the police service. Officers' pension contributions at the time reflected this. The greater current contribution rate of 11 per cent. partly reflects the additional benefit of the provision of pensions for post-retirement widows.

 <i>[holding answer 28 January 2002]:</i> No applications have been received to impose child curfew schemes under section 14 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. Sections 48 and 49 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, which took effect on 1 August 2001, extended the upper age limit to 15 and allowed the police, as well as local authorities, to initiate schemes. Local areas are assessing the implications of these changes and we know that local consultation is taking place in some of them. Applications to establish curfews are a discretionary matter for local authorities and the police, to be considered in the light of local needs and wider strategies to deal with disorder in their areas.

 Following a recommendation from the Police Negotiating Board (PNB) on 8 February 2001, the previous Home Secretary, my right hon.

<P>

<a name="20204w11.html_para1">Any case for increasing the allowance for officers in Hampshire would first have to be made in the PNB.

 The European Capabilities Action Plan working groups will not be fully established until the middle of February. Discussions are under way to determine the composition of each group.

<P>
<a name="20204w12.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B>

<P>
<a name="20204w12.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The UK/Netherlands Amphibious Force has been very successful. For some time we have been considering whether similar approaches elsewhere could bring benefits.

 The UK has identified a range of forces as a possible contribution towards the Helsinki Headline Goal. This includes a pool of 20,000 ground troops, from which a maximum of 12,500 could be deployed at any one time. Maritime and air forces have also been identified. The scale and type of forces committed to a particular operation would be decided by the Government according to the circumstances at the time.

 Offers from EU member states have so far met 104 of the 144 capability requirements that underpin the Headline Goal.

 The decision to undertake an operation would be based on an assessment of a number of factors, including the feasibility of delivering and sustaining the required scale of forces at the necessary range.

 As with previous Administrations, it is not normal practice to provide details of ministerial meetings. However on this occasion because unsubstantiated and unjustified allegations were made against the Government it was thought right to make clear, without setting a precedent, where there had been meetings with the DTI as that is the lead Department dealing with energy policy.

This does not mean that these firms would go out of business, as existing IFA firms who do not want to move to the defined payment system proposed by the FSA would be able to operate as they do now, expect that they would not be able to hold themselves out as independent. This outcome also needs to be seen in the context of the current market where 80 per cent. of mass market consumers buying packaged products use the non-IFA or tied sector. These consumers should benefit from increased choice under the FSA's proposals.

 There is no separate capital gains tax rate. Capital gains are taxed on individuals using the income tax savings rates: 10 per cent., 20 per cent. and 40 per cent. The rate depends on how far the individual's income has used up the starting and basic rate bands. A rate of 34 per cent. applies to trusts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20204w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 There have been two major changes in accounting practice since 1997 that have impacted on the accounting for taxes and public spending, one in respect of national accounts and one in respect of accounting by Government Departments.
<P>

<a name="20204w15.html_para2">In 1998, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) converted UK national accounts to the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95). This changed the accounting for some components of taxes and public spending. The ESA95 treatment was described in "National Accounts Concepts Sources and Methods" (ONS, 1998, ISBN 0&#150;11&#150;621062&#150;1), chapters 5 and 21. The impact of the changes on the main public finance aggregates was quantified in the 1998 pre-Budget report (Cm 4076), paragraphs B26 to B36.
<P>

<a name="20204w15.html_para3">The Government introduced resource accounting and budgeting (RAB) for Government Departments with effect from 2001&#150;02. This applies generally accepted accounting practices to the accounts and budgets of Government Departments, and replaced the previous system, which just recorded cash flows. The impact of the introduction of RAB on departmental expenditure limits was set out in Spending Review 2000 (Cm 4807), Table A7.

Community amateur sports clubs are able to apply immediately. The commission has received a significant number of inquiries from sports clubs interested in taking advantage of the new charitable purpose. As clubs will have to consider the implications of charitable status, seek agreement from their members if they wish to pursue this option and make any necessary changes to their constitutions before applying for charitable status, there will inevitably be some delay before clubs are in a position to formally apply for registration. No clubs in the Buckingham constituency have yet formally applied to register.

<a name="20204w19.html_para9">NATS have indicated that their intention is to transfer staff from the existing centre at Prestwick to the new centre when it is completed.

<a name="20204w19.html_para10">Although construction of the new air traffic control centre at Prestwick is being deferred, contracts for the design of the building and initial site works are in progress and will be completed. The value of these contracts is a commercial matter between NATS and the contractors. Construction of the building and the design and installation of equipment systems will be subject to a competitive procurement process, which will determine the total costs of the new centre.

 The Northern Ireland Court Service is the ministerial responsibility of the Lord Chancellor. The declaration of "God Save the Queen" on entry to and exit from the courts by the judiciary in Northern Ireland has been discontinued for some years. Court Service staff were reminded that there should be no declaration of "God Save the Queen" when the Criminal Justice Review Implementation Plan was published. A formal notice to that effect dated 25 January 2002 has now been issued and a copy has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

This represents our best estimate of the likely funding for school sixth- forms in that year, taking into account growth in pupil numbers and in funding per pupil. The LSC issued provisional allocations for 2002&#150;03 to LEAs and schools in December. These include funds for both mainstream sixth-forms and for post-16 pupils with special needs. The provisional allocation for Coventry was &#163;11.8 million, of which almost &#163;1 million was for provision for pupils with statements of SEN.

 Information is not available in the form requested. Allocations of most capital funding for schools are made at local education authority level, which will hold information about how allocations have been made at school level.
<P>

<a name="20204w22.html_para3">The new deal for schools (NDS) programme was introduced in 1997, particularly to focus on refurbishing schools and also to help address the backlog of urgent repairs in school buildings. The following table sets out the capital resources made available for schools in Essex under the NDS programme, including those already announced for future years. Total capital resources for schools allocated to Essex over the period 1997&#150;98 to 2003&#150;04 amount to &#163;210 million.

 Trade unions play a key role in promoting the development of learning and skills in the workplace. To help them do this my Department has provided financial support through the Union Learning Fund since 1998. This year (2001&#150;02) funding will total &#163;7 million, rising to &#163;9 million next year and &#163;11 million in 2003&#150;04.
<P>

<a name="20204w22.html_para4">When it was launched, the Union Learning Fund was a new and innovative experiment, but it has now become an established part of the lifelong learning agenda. It is helping trade unions use their influence with employers, employees and others to encourage greater take up of learning at work and boost their capacity as learning organisations. It has so far benefited over 25,000 people in the workplace through a wide variety of projects ranging from tackling basic skills needs to advanced professional development. It has also led to the development of a new breed of activist, the union learning representative, and helped to establish a network of over 3,000 learning representatives nationwide.
<P>

<a name="20204w22.html_para5">Union learning representatives are ideally placed to help and encourage workers to improve their skills, particularly among the very lowest skilled workers and those with literacy and numeracy problems. That is why we have included a clause in the new Employment Bill that will give statutory backing to union learning representatives. It will reinforce the invaluable role that union learning representatives are currently playing in the workplace to promote work force development and open up new training opportunities for their colleagues.

 The available data for 1999 and 2000 are given in the table. Corresponding data for 2001 will be available in April 2002. Latest figures from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS), covering full-time first degree and HND courses only, show that 63,700 home domiciled students aged 21 or over were accepted for entry in autumn 2001, an increase of 9.5 per cent. compared to the previous year. UCAS does not cover students applying for part-time undergraduate courses.
<P>

<a name="20204w23.html_para0">The Government have introduced additional financial help for student parents, the great majority of whom are mature, including a child care grant and a travel and equipment grant.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will make a statement on the Government's strategies to raise educational attainment in present and former coalfield areas.  [31470R]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20204w23.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 We have several strategies that are helping to raise educational attainment in coalfield and other areas. Standards of literacy and numeracy in primary schools are the highest they have ever been and evidence shows that the coalfields are benefiting from these strategies although we recognise that there is still work to be done.
<P>

<a name="20204w23.html_para1">We published the Schools White Paper "Achieving Success", last September, which sets out our vision for education for the years ahead. The Key Stage 3 strategy (11 to 14-year-olds) aims to build on the success at primary level but has been adapted to meet the more diverse and complex nature of the secondary curriculum.
<P>

<a name="20204w23.html_para2">We have introduced floor targets so that every school, wherever it is based, will be supported to secure at least 20 per cent. of students with five good GCSEs by 2004, rising to 25 per cent. by 2006.
<P>

<a name="20204w23.html_para3">Coalfield areas are also benefiting from more localised targeting with initiatives such as Excellence in Cities and Education Action Zones providing additional resources for schools serving disadvantaged areas. Coalfield areas already benefiting from these initiatives include Rotherham, St. Helens, Barnsley, Doncaster and Wigan.

 The report from the Migration Research Unit identified a number of groups of mobile pupils. In only one of these was an effect on attainment found. This was for those pupils who moved house frequently due to family break-up. The effects on schools included the need for flexible induction. Measures being introduced and that are planned for implementation include:

 Negotiations on UK/US air services, which were scheduled to resume in Washington on 28 January, were postponed when it became clear that the prospect of a large part of the UK's airline industry gaining effective access to the large US domestic market had been removed. However, we remain committed to achieving the full and genuine liberalisation of the UK/US aviation market. In pursuing this policy we shall continue to be guided by a consideration of the widest spectrum of UK consumer and economic interests.
<P>

<a name="20204w24.html_para0">In negotiating air services agreements we seek to make balanced exchanges of rights. A liberalisation deal would, by definition, include more liberal traffic rights for the carriers of each side so, if granted, fifth freedom rights in a new UK/US Agreement would be available to the carriers of both sides.
<P>

<a name="20204w24.html_para1">It remains Government policy to seek to persuade the US Government to open up their large domestic market to competition from UK carriers, both passenger and cargo.
<P>

<a name="20204w24.html_para2">The UK has no policy that air services agreements which it concludes with the US, or indeed with any other country, should be subject to review by the European Court or the European Commission.

<P>

<a name="20204w25.html_para0">At the same time the plans will deliver improved waiting times, journey times and crowding levels on all underground lines, which will result in increased passenger capacity.

 Although the holes in the inner lining of the roof of the dome did not affect the operation and effectiveness of the roof and the lining, the holes were repaired in late December 2001, while carrying out other work near the top of the dome, since this offered a cost-effective opportunity to undertake repair.

 This is a matter for London Underground, who advise that no business case could be made for this option. The cost was then estimated at around &#163;50 million. The benefits of a station for users in the Bishopsgate area were largely outweighed by the time penalty which would have resulted for users travelling through.

 British citizens returning to the UK from overseas have the same entitlement to local authority housing as citizens already resident provided they are habitually resident in the Common Travel Area (CTA), that is, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. Unless resuming a previous period of habitual residence within the CTA, they would need to demonstrate, among other things, that their future centre of interest lay in the UK in order to establish habitual residence. Some local housing authorities currently set additional qualifying criteria.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what measures have been introduced since 1997 to improve the safety of seamen involved in merchant shipping and fishing.  [31710]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20204w27.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The United Kingdom is a signatory to all international maritime Conventions, a number of which have been updated since 1997 to enhance the safety of seafarers. In particular we will have fully met our international obligations with respect to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978 as amended in 1995, by the date of its implementation on 1 February 2002. The Convention requirements will apply to all officers and crew serving on UK registered merchant ships and includes the introduction of mandatory safety and up- grade training for certificate of service holders and fishermen serving on certain categories of merchant ships.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what proposals he has to strengthen the rules on flags of convenience.  [31711]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20204w27.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Our primary concern is with the safety of those who crew and travel on ships, and with the protection of the marine environment. Analysis suggests that some open registers have a better safety and environmental performance than some of the more traditional maritime flags. We are working with like-minded states within the International Maritime Organisation, including the more reform-minded open registers, to raise the level of flag state performance. The wider shipping industry is also making a helpful contribution within the context of the international Quality Shipping Campaign.

<a name="20204w27.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Wray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will make a statement on the importance of the marine industry; and what support the Government have provided.  [31712]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20204w27.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Britain is a natural maritime nation, so shipping is vitally important to us. 95 per cent. of our trade by weight arrives or leaves by sea, and the UK shipping industry is one of our biggest service-sector exporters. The UK industry was, however, in decline until we introduced our new shipping policy. A central element of our new policy is the tonnage tax, which brings certainty and clarity about tax liabilities, which are related to the tonnage of the ship operated rather than to actual profits made. Shipping companies are not obliged to enter the tonnage tax regime or to register their ships in the UK, but the new climate created by the tonnage tax, together with reforms at the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, has helped to bring about significant increases in the UK registered fleet.
<P>

<a name="20204w27.html_para2">A key feature of the tonnage tax, unique to the UK, is a minimum training obligation. This requires each shipping company opting for the tonnage tax to recruit and train one officer trainee each year for every 15 officer posts in its fleet and also give consideration to employment and training opportunities for ratings. The Government provide financial support for seafarer training through the Support for Maritime Training (SMarT) scheme. Following a review of SMarT in autumn/winter 2000 and the receipt of EU State Aid clearance, additional courses will be included in the scheme and levels of funding will be increased.

 The Department monitors traffic speeds and traffic levels at about 130 sites on different types of road throughout Great Britain. The information comes from automatic traffic counters, which are generally situated away from junctions, hills or sharp bends, at locations where traffic is likely to be free flowing. Thus in principle they provide information on the speeds at which drivers choose to travel when their behaviour is not constrained by congestion or other road conditions.
<P>

<a name="20204w27.html_para3">Results are published annually. The latest available results relate to 2000 and were published in 'Vehicle Speeds in Great Britain: 2000', in July 2001. A copy is in the House of Commons Library. Results for 2001 will be published when they are ready later this year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20204w27.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Recruitment and retention are matters for the individual shipping companies themselves. There are Government measures, however, to assist and encourage the training and employment of British seafarers. We provide financial support for seafarer training through the Support for Maritime Training (SMarT) scheme. Following a review of SMarT in autumn/winter 2000 and the receipt of EU State Aid clearance, additional courses will be included in the scheme and levels of funding will be increased. We introduced the Tonnage Tax option as part of the Finance Act 2000, a key feature of which is a minimum training obligation. This feature is unique to the UK, and requires each shipping company opting for the tonnage tax to recruit and train one officer trainee each year for every 15 officer posts in its fleet and also give consideration to employment and training opportunities for ratings.

<P>
<a name="20204w27.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 A specific assessment has not been made of Ordnance Survey's progress in facilitating the work of government by collaboration with other data providers. However, it is clear that a number of initiatives by Ordnance Survey in recent years has increased other data providers' input to the national topographic database.
<P>

<a name="20204w27.html_para4">One initiative has been the CODES project, Collection of Data from External Sources, where data from architects, house builders and construction companies has been taken into the database. Commercial terms have been agreed for the use of these data such that Ordnance Survey costs have reduced and customers in both the public and private sectors have benefited from more up-to-date mapping being available sooner. The inclusion of this type of data will increase further in the coming months.
<P>

<a name="20204w27.html_para5">In addition, Ordnance Survey has developed its policies on working with data providers following responses to Information Paper 13/1999 'Joined-up geography for the new millennium' and Consultation paper 1/2000 'Digital

Some additional layers of OS MasterMap are already being taken forward in collaboration with other data providers.

 Ordnance Survey works with a range of private sector bodies in support of the delivery of its products and services. A wide range of activities are currently conducted in conjunction with the private sector including aerial photography, cyclical revision and the IT infrastructure.

<a name="20204w27.html_para8">Ordnance Survey is in the process of negotiating a new long-term strategic agreement, Contract 2002, with a small group of private sector organisations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20204w28.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Passenger Transport Authorities (PTAs) are formally composed of elected members from the relevant metropolitan district councils, as set out in primary legislation.

<a name="20204w28.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Passenger Transport Authorities are able to pay allowances to their members under the Local Government Act 1972 and the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. Regulations under these acts provide that it is for each local authority to decide its scheme and

 Totaljourney.com made a valuable contribution to integrated ticketing and transport information by offering both rail and air tickets. There are currently other websites offering similar services but none which exactly replicate Totaljourney.com. In the longer term, Transport Direct will be introduced and will offer information and the ability to buy a ticket on all modes of transport. We are working with operators and local authorities to deliver this. The demise of Totaljourney.com is not expected to delay Transport Direct.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20204w29.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Revised procedures were introduced on 1 August 2000 to improve the handling of planning appeals by inquiry, hearing, and written representations to streamline the process and make the arrangements fairer and more transparent. When launching the new arrangements we indicated that their operation would be monitored and reviewed after a year.
<P>

<a name="20204w29.html_para0">We have now completed the review in conjunction with the Planning Inspectorate and a wide range of stakeholders, including appellants, local planning authorities, planning agents, and third parties. Local planning authorities were surveyed and a series of stakeholder meetings was held.
<P>

<a name="20204w29.html_para1">Overall, the new rules are meeting the objectives of improved handling and greater fairness. The new arrangements represented a radical change of culture for all concerned. Strict enforcement of deadlines has had a big impact on parties' delivery of documents and has contributed to improved performance by the Planning Inspectorate in deciding planning appeals over the last year. There is now greater recognition and acceptance that all parties have a responsibility in making the appeals system work smoothly.
<P>

<a name="20204w29.html_para2">We have concluded that no further changes to the procedures should be made at this stage. Rather, we intend to allow more time for the new rules to bed in. In the meantime, it is essential that all parties adhere to deadlines and do not seek to gain advantage over others by failing to do so. We shall continue to reinforce this message and to keep the operation of the procedures closely under review. We do not rule out the possibility of further measures to improve the operation of the planning appeals procedures to tackle abuses and to improve the speed of decisions.
<P>

<a name="20204w29.html_para3">The Planning Green Paper which we published on 12 December 2001 notes the dramatic improvements made by the Planning Inspectorate in the timeliness of appeal decisions and that we are working with them to consider ways in which the targets we set for this work might be improved still further without compromising quality.

<a name="20204w29.html_para6">All the days of moderate, high and very high pollution recorded at Lullington Heath were due to ozone pollution. There were no recorded days of moderate, high or very high pollution for nitrogen dioxide or sulphur dioxide in any of the five years. High air pollution episodes due to ozone are recorded only in the summer months. The pollution is linked to hot sunny weather when industrial and motor vehicle emissions react under these conditions to form ground-level ozone. Light easterly winds sometimes bring this pollution across to the UK from central Europe. If conditions are very still for several days then high pollution can be generated by pollution emissions from UK sources too.

 There are certainly no arrangements to conceal disposals of radioactive waste for which the UK Government are responsible.

This Act does not apply to the Ministry of Defence, but its policy is that where practicable it will apply standards at least as stringent as those required by the Act. At present the main UK disposal site is at Drigg in Cumbria; this is authorised to accept only low level waste.

If a local authority's environmental health officer is satisfied that the smell or odour complained about amounts to a statutory nuisance then the local authority must serve an abatement notice on the owner or occupier of the premises. However, in coming to a decision an environmental health officer would need to determine whether "best practicable means" are being used to prevent the nuisance or counteract its effect. Generally local authorities will try to work closely with the water undertakings to investigate and monitor odour problems from sewage treatment works without having to resort to abatement measures or legal action.

 The Countryside and Rights of Way Act was the first major piece of wildlife legislation for 20 years and introduced new rights of access to the open countryside, amended the law in relation to rights of way and improved protection and management of sites of special scientific interest, wildlife and areas of outstanding natural beauty. We believe the Act has

significant benefits, both for the wildlife which, through the provisions in Parts III and IV of the Bill, it aims directly to protect and conserve, and for people better to appreciate the wildlife in our countryside.
<P>

<a name="20204w30.html_para7">The wildlife and access advisory group has collated known research and guidance on the sensitivities of wildlife to access. The group comprises English Nature, the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, the Countryside Agency, the Countryside Council for Wales, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and others. In addition the Access Scientific Research and Monitoring Group, whose members also include EN, the agency and CCW, is advising on a range of project proposals arising from the report "Access and bird conservation: priorities for research", produced in 2001.
<P>

<a name="20204w30.html_para8">No studies about the implications of Part II for wildlife have been carried out or are planned: however the provisions include amendments to the circumstances in which traffic authorities may make traffic regulation orders, so as to include the purpose of protecting SSSIs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20204w31.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Existing possibilities for competition in the water industry have led to significant improvements in the efficiency of statutory undertakers and benefits for customers. Undertakers already contract out a number of their services and activities on a competitive basis. They compete with one another to offer large industrial users water management services and customers using more than 100 mega litres of water per year are also able to take advantage of inset appointments. The regulatory regime also provides for a system of comparative competition which enables the Director General of Water Services to compare the efficiency of statutory undertakers when setting price limits. The Department has been examining the possibilities for extending the scope for competition in the water industry, including consideration of the impact this would have on different customer groups. DEFRA will be publishing a consultation paper, setting out the issues and proposals later this year.

<P>
<a name="20204w31.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 February 2002]:</i> Climate change agreements set eligible operators challenging targets to reduce their energy use in return for an 80 per cent. reduction in the level of climate change levy on that energy use. A move to use more energy efficient combined heat and power (CHP) installations is one way in which operators can meet their targets. The targets for most facilities have taken into account any contribution that CHP installations can make. However, in some sectors not enough was known about the technical and economic feasibility of combined heat and power in their processes. In these cases the agreements provided for an assessment of the feasibility over the first 18 months of 



<P>
<P><I>4 Feb 2002 : Column 748W</I><P>
the agreements, with a view to revising targets for those installations in which CHP could make a significant, cost effective contribution, by the third milestone ie 2007.
<P>

<a name="20204w31.html_para2">The first stage in the assessment was completed in November 2001 and the second was due to be completed by 4 January. However, current conditions in the energy markets have not helped the economic case for CHP and there have also been delays in obtaining data with which to set the tests. Consequently, stage 2 has been deferred. This will also allow the procedure's design to take account of developments resulting from the Government's draft CHP Strategy and DTI's consultation on the Impact of NETA on Smaller Generators, both of which will be published shortly.
<P>

<a name="20204w31.html_para3">A decision on the revised timetable for the assessment will be made over the coming months but it will not delay the re-negotiation of targets for the third milestone as originally intended.

Council reached political agreement on four common positions: the UK voted in favour of each. Four sets of Council conclusions were agreed. There were two orientation debates: one, in public, on a proposed regulation concerning traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and products derived from them, and a second on the Commission's review of the Pesticides Authorisation Directive (91/414/EEC).

<a name="20204w31.html_para8">Political agreement was also reached on an amendment to Directive 94/25/EC laying down limit values for exhaust and noise emissions from new recreational craft placed on the Community market. The Council agreed limit values at the levels proposed by the European Commission in COM(2000)639 dated 12 October 2000. Particularly in relation to noise emissions, agreement was reached on less costly methods of demonstrating compliance. Overall the agreement represents a reasonable balance between achieving challenging environmental objectives while minimising the cost to small and medium-sized business and individuals.

<P>

<a name="20204w31.html_para11">During a public orientation debate on a proposed regulation on traceability and labelling of GMOs, Council discussed the scope of the proposed system. While welcoming the intention of the proposal to improve safety and consumer choice in GM food and crops, the UK's current judgment was that the requirement to label and trace the source of products which contain no detectable GM material would be unworkable. The UK expressed concern about whether the information given to consumers would be reliable and whether developing countries would be able to provide the information expected from importers. The UK took the view that the Commission's proposals for allowing certain imports of crops containing GMOs that are not approved in the EU were unsatisfactory as they stood and that further urgent work was needed, particularly on agreeing an international system for identifying individual GMOs. Member states were still divided on when the EU decision-making process for GM products could be

The latest information on the levels of fraud and error is in "The Results of the Area Benefit Review and Quality Support Team from April 1999 to March 2000: Fraud and Error in Claims for Income Support and Jobseeker's Allowance", a copy of which is available in the Library. However, it is not possible to disaggregate the number of cases in which fraud and error are attributable solely to incorrect claims for dependent children.

<P>
<a name="20204w32.html_spnew6"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The security and control programme has been replaced by our comprehensive strategy to reduce fraud and error. This strategy is set out in our paper: A New Contract for Welfare: Safeguarding Social Security (Cm 4276; March 1999). We are tightening up the system to make sure that the right amount goes to the right person from the outset of a claim.
<P>

<a name="20204w32.html_para7">We have set firm targets to reduce the amount of fraud and error in income support and jobseeker's allowance by 25 per cent. by 2004 and 50 per cent. by 2006. Latest results show that from our baseline period in 1998 to March 2001 we have achieved an 18 per cent. reduction and we expect this good progress to continue.

 Tackling fuel poverty is one of this Government's key priorities. A number of measures have been put in place to ensure that by 2010, no vulnerable household will have to struggle to heat their home when it is cold. These measures include the &#163;200 winter fuel payment for households that qualify, cold weather payments, a cut in the level of VAT on fuel and radical improvements to the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme.

 At the Brussels process ministerial meeting today the Secretary of State and Spanish Foreign Minister, Josep Pique, continued to make good progress in our discussions about Gibraltar in the atmosphere of friendship and understanding which links the UK and Spain, reaffirming the full range of commitments that we assumed at our previous meetings in London and Barcelona.
<P>

<a name="20204w36.html_para0">Our common aim remains to conclude a comprehensive agreement before the summer, covering all outstanding issues, including co-operation and sovereignty.
<P>

<a name="20204w36.html_para1">Both Governments confirmed that their shared objective is to overcome their differences over Gibraltar and to ensure a secure future for Gibraltar in which Gibraltar can preserve its way of life and traditions, enjoy greater internal self-government, sustain and enhance its prosperity, and reap the full benefits of a harmonious and mutually beneficial co-operation in all fields together with the wider region.
<P>

<a name="20204w36.html_para2">We reiterate our invitation to the Chief Minister of Gibraltar to attend future Brussels process meetings so that he, and through him the Gibraltarians, can join the current dialogue and contribute to it to the benefit of Gibraltar. We confirmed that the Chief Minister is warmly invited to participate on the basis of the two flags, three voices formula, having his own and distinct voice as part of the British delegation.
<P>

<a name="20204w36.html_para3">Our intention is that the comprehensive agreement we seek will offer the best framework for a secure, stable and prosperous future for Gibraltar. In that framework, our objective is that Gibraltar can enjoy enhanced powers of internal self-government allowing its Government and population to have a greater say in their lives. We will invite the Government of Gibraltar to develop together with us the relevant ideas on this objective.
<P>

<a name="20204w36.html_para4">We also took forward our work on all possible ways of enhancing co-operation to improve the quality of the daily lives of people in Gibraltar and the Campo region. The UK and Spain reaffirmed that the aim of the arrangements they seek is to promote the highest level of fruitful co-operation within the wider region, favouring better standards of living and working conditions in Gibraltar and the Campo, and fluid communications with the region.
<P>

<a name="20204w36.html_para5">The Spanish Government recalled the arrangements it had made to allocate a further 70,000 telephone numbers for Gibraltar and reaffirmed that, as regards the technical responsibilities of the Spanish side, they are operational. It expressed its commitment to ensure that no obstacles prevent their immediate use for the benefit of all Gibraltarians. To that end, the UK and Spain agreed to

 With the full support of Her Majesty's Government, on 16 January the United Nations Security Council ("UNSC") adopted resolution 1390 (2002). Taking into account the changing situation in Afghanistan, the resolution extended or amended some of the existing measures and introduced new measures targeting Usama bin Laden, members of the al-Qaeda organisation and the Taliban and other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with them designated by the UN Sanctions Committee on Afghanistan. Other UNSC sanctions targeting Afghanistan were terminated or allowed to lapse.
<P>

<a name="20204w36.html_para7">UNSC resolution 1390 (2002) continues the asset freeze imposed by resolutions 1267 (1999) and 1333 (2000) on senior members of the Taliban, Usama bin Laden and individuals and entities (including members of al-Qaeda) designated by the Security Council as associated with him, and extends it to all designated members of the Taliban and their associates. The resolution also places an embargo on the supply of arms and military assistance to, and imposes a world-wide travel ban on, Usama bin Laden and persons designated by the Security Council as members of the al-Qaeda organisation or the Taliban or their associates.

<a name="20204w36.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 In 2001 there were three occasions when unauthorised access to FCO systems was identified. On the first occasion successful access was gained to the FCO's website, and the internet service provider has subsequently put stronger firewalls in place. The second and third occasions both involved access to FCO computer systems through weaknesses which have now been resolved. In common with other Departments, no facility exists to alert FCO to unsuccessful attempts to gain unauthorised access.

Official Spanish figures therefore provide the best guide as to the number of British nationals resident in Spain.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on recent allegations made by Britain in the United Nations Sanctions Committee that Syria has violated UN sanctions on Iraqi oil.  [32860]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20204w37.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Regular media and oil industry reports have shown that in 2001 Syria suddenly began exporting an average of over 100,000 barrels of oil per day more than the previous year, without increasing its own domestic production. These reports have consistently attributed this to Syria's illegal import of large quantities of Iraqi oil through the Kirkuk-Banias pipeline connecting the two countries. 100,000 barrels per day is a significant amount of oil, worth at current prices about $260 million of humanitarian funding every six months. This is more than Iraq plans to spend on medicine or education under the current six-month phase of the humanitarian programme. The export of Iraqi oil, without seeking UN approval, would be a serious breach of UN resolutions 661 and 986. We have therefore sought Syrian assurances in the UN Sanctions Committee that they will make transparent the operation of this pipeline, bring it within the UN system and allow the revenue raised from it to benefit the Iraqi people rather than the Baghdad regime.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of health authorities.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. Expenditure on health is taken from health authority and primary care trust summarisation forms which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total spent on the commission of health care by the health authority and by the primary care trusts within each health authority area. The majority of general dental services expenditure is not included in the health authority or primary care trust accounts and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>3. Health authorities and primary care trusts should account for their expenditure on a gross basis.

 The first step for most people will be to discuss the problem with their general medical practitioner. We have set out clear national standards in the National Service Framework for mental health. It describes how people should be able to get quicker access to more effective treatments in and through primary care, with support from specialised services where necessary. Some people may also seek help through other routes, including specialised services in the charitable and voluntary sector. We support a selection of such services each year.
<P>

<a name="20204w38.html_para0">People who have been raped need access to a variety of services including forensic examination, counselling and treatment to prevent sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy. These services are provided by a number of agencies including general medical practitioners and genito-urinary medicine clinics. Counselling provision will be strengthened by the clear national standards in the National Service Framework for Mental Health.

<P>
<a name="20204w38.html_spnew2"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 We take very seriously our responsibility to protect infant health in the United Kingdom, and support the promotion of breast-feeding. It is important that women and their partners are able to make a fully informed choice on how to feed their babies based on accurate and consistent information. This means that women should have access to information about all infant feeding practices through the relevant health care professional.
<P>

<a name="20204w38.html_para1">The Infant Feeding Initiative was established in May 1999 with the aim to increase the incidence and duration of breast-feeding among those groups of the population where breast-feeding rates are the lowest, as well as to 



<P>
<P><I>4 Feb 2002 : Column 772W</I><P>
help all women to make informed choices about how they feed their infant. Breast-feeding rates are low in lower socio- economic groups. A total budget of nearly &#163;3 million over three years from Public Health Development Fund has been allocated for this initiative and reflects our commitment to tackle health inequalities that was highlighted by the Acheson report.
<P>

<a name="20204w38.html_para2">It included the appointment of two part-time National Infant Feeding Advisers and funding of 79 "best practice" projects to date to enable effective communication and evaluation of current good practice, to address the barriers to breast-feeding, and thereby lead to improved breast- feeding rates among those least likely to breast-feed. This has resulted in joint working efforts between health professionals and voluntary organisations. Sure start initiatives also support local projects on breast-feeding.
<P>

<a name="20204w38.html_para3">Other departmental activity includes support for an annual National Breastfeeding Awareness Week, support to four main voluntary organisations involved in the promotion of breast-feeding, research into breast-feeding through quinquennial surveys of infant feeding practices, and maintaining close links with UNICEF's Baby Friendly Initiative.
<P>

<a name="20204w38.html_para4">The forthcoming Children's National Service Framework will address maternity services that can help to give all children a good start in life to grow into healthy adults.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Waiting time statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and waiting times for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment at a given point in time and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the waiting time as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<P>

2. Figures in this table have not yet been adjusted for shortfalls in data.<P>

features of depression, including suicidal behaviour, can worsen after introduction of any antidepressant prior to its beneficial effect being apparent.
<P>

<a name="20204w39.html_para0">As with all medicines the safety of TCAs and selective SSRIs is continually monitored by the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the independent expert advisory body, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). The safety profiles of TCAs and SSRIs are well established and are reflected in the product information for prescribers and patients.
<P>

<a name="20204w39.html_para1">Reports of adverse effects, including suicidal behaviour, suspected to be associated with SSRIs and TCAs are collated by MCA/CSM through the spontaneous reporting scheme, the yellow card scheme. These data are reviewed on a regular basis.
<P>

<a name="20204w39.html_para2">A possible causal association between SSRIs and suicidal behaviour has been reviewed by the CSM on a number of occasions, most recently in 2001. The CSM concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to confirm a causal association between SSRIs and suicidal behaviour and advised that the issue should be kept under review.

<P>

<a name="20204w39.html_para3">The product information and the British National Formulary warn that patients should be closely monitored for suicidal impulses, particularly in the early stages of treatment. An article emphasising this advice was published in the MCA/CSM drug safety bulletin "Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance" in September 2000.

<P>

 The national health service performance ratings for acute trusts were published in September 2001. The ratings show that hospitals of a similar size perform

differently. Variations in performance are largely down to hospital management teams. The direct effect of funding levels on performance has not been used in deciding the ratings, although maintaining financial balance is a key target.
<P>

<a name="20204w39.html_para5">The poorest performing, zero star trusts, have submitted performance improvement plans to the Department. These are being reviewed and will subsequently be monitored.

<P>
<P>

 The national health service performance ratings for acute trusts, published in September 2001, were based on areas of performance that are under the influence of hospital managers. Where appropriate, the performance indicators used in the assessment are standardised to take into account the age and sex of patients to make meaningful comparisons between hospital trusts.

 From 1 April this year the National Care Standards Commission (NCSC) will take over from health authorities the regulation of independent health care providers under the Care Standards Act 2000. For the first time, owners and managers of independent drop-in medical services and exclusively private general practitioners offering primary care or diagnostic services to the public will be obliged to register with the NCSC, comply with regulations and meet core and service- specific national minimum standards.

<a name="20204w39.html_para6">Treatment and diagnostic services provided solely by registered nurses or other non-medical health professionals will not be required to register with the NCSC. However, under the Care Standards Act my right hon.

 The Medical Devices Agency, (MDA), maintains a database of all incidents reported to them concerning safety or quality problems with wheelchairs. MDA regularly carry out trend analysis on the content of reports received from United Kingdom, Europe and United States of America and also on the outcomes of any subsequent investigations. If these trends reveal the need for individual manufacturers to re-design their products or improve their usage instructions, labelling, repair instructions or quality control etc manufacturers are informed and MDA monitor the situation until appropriate improvements are made. Also, if any of these trends reveal a shortcoming in an issued British standard concerning wheelchairs or a need for a new standard, the MDA work with the British Standards Institution, (BSI), to make any necessary revisions or assist with the drafting of any new standard.

 The Medical Devices Agency, (MDA), has specific responsibility on behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to safeguard public health where medical devices are involved. MDA has an established wide ranging reporting system, which is open to users, carers and health care staff etc who wish to report safety or quality problems concerning medical devices.

<a name="20204w40.html_para4">An FCE is defined as a period of patient care under one consultant in one health care provider. The figures do not represent the number of patients, as one person may have several episodes within the year. The main diagnosis is the first of seven diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics data set, and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital. Figures in this table have not yet been adjusted for shortfalls in data.

<P>
<a name="20204w40.html_spnew9"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The Glasgow Coma Scale is the most widely used system for classifying the severity of head injuries. This scale assigns points to each patient based upon three categories: verbal function, eye opening, and best motor (movement) response. Additional information on severity is provided by X-ray and from CT and MR scans.

 Rehabilitation for brain injuries is already defined as a specialised service, ie it has a planning population larger than the total population of several primary care teams and sometimes larger than the population of a strategic health authority. It was included in the National Specialised Services Definitions Set published by the Department on its website in December 2001.

[30839]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20204w40.html_spnew13"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 We are aware of the concerns expressed by Headway, Rehab UK and others about our response to the Health Committee's report. We do not, however, intend to change our response as there are a number of initiatives under way that will help improve services for people with head injury. These include the National Service Framework on long term conditions and the clinical guideline for the initial assessment, management and first referral of patients with head injury that the National Institute for Clinical Excellence has been asked to produce.
<P>

<a name="20204w40.html_para5">We think that it is better to invest time to appraise the existing service configuration of head injury services across the national health service, so that we can get it right for the future.

Currently local authorities are taking the lead on joint investment plans on the Welfare to Work for disabled people initiative. The idea of these plans is to provide effective and joined up services for disabled people who want to work, to stay in work, or to move closer to the world of work.

 The final stages of the process of rehabilitation for people who have acquired brain injury may be an individualised programme of employment rehabilitation delivered through the employment service's work preparation programme. The employment service has worked with the organisations delivering work preparation for people with brain injuries to produce a national framework. This will result in greater coherence within regions and countries in terms of the scope and duration of its individualised programmes.

 Diagnosis of autism and early interventions are being considered by an independent group chaired by Professor Ann Le Couteur which is expected to report in 2002. The Royal Colleges of Psychiatrists and Paediatrics and Child Health, the National Autistic Society and the British Psychological Society are all represented. The Department and the Department for Education and Skills both have observers on the group. We will consider what further discussions may be required in the light of the group's report.
<P>

<a name="20204w41.html_para2">As we develop the National Service Framework (NSF) for children we will consider the needs of disabled children, including those with autism. The NSF will set out to tackle inequalities, raise standards and reduce unacceptable variations in NHS and social services. We have recently announced that one of the exemplars we will use to show how services should be provided will be around services for children with autism.
<P>

<a name="20204w41.html_para3">The data requested on numbers of psychiatrists and waiting times for assessments are not collected centrally. We recognise that assessment of communication skills plays an important part in the diagnosis of autism. This requires a multi-disciplinary, multi-agency assessment and may be led by a consultant community paediatrician or a child and adolescent psychiatrist. In some places specialist learning disability psychiatrists offer a service to children as well as adults and they, rather than child and adolescent psychiatrists, will be involved in diagnosis and management of children with autism. All these professionals have a broad range of responsibilities. The proportion of their time devoted to diagnosis and treatment of autism will vary. In the three years ending 31 March 2002 we will have invested some &#163;85 million in children and adolescent mental health services across the national health service and local authorities.

<a name="20204w41.html_para4">We have no objection in principle to involving the private sector in assessment processes at whatever stage may be appropriate. Local statutory authorities have a duty to ensure that the particular health and social care needs of each person with autism are met with genuine choices for both clients and families, through the most appropriate community based services, in a cost-effective way. They should determine the pattern of services in their areas in the light of their knowledge of local needs.

<a name="20204w41.html_spnew3"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The Department obtains advice on the possible health implications of exposure to electromagnetic fields, including the extremely low frequency fields (ELF) associated with overhead power cables, from the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB).
<P>

<a name="20204w41.html_para5">In March last year, the NRPB's Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation (AGNIR) issued a report on "ELF Electromagnetic Fields and the Risk of Cancer". This was issued following a wide-ranging and thorough review of scientific research related to this issue. The group concluded that the power frequency electromagnetic fields that exist in the vast majority of homes are not a cause of cancer in general. However, some epidemiological studies do indicate a possible doubling of the risk of childhood leukaemia associated with exposure to unusually high levels of power frequency magnetic fields. The AGNIR found no clear evidence of a carcinogenic effect in adults or of a plausible explanation from experiments on animals or isolated cells. Their view was that the epidemiological evidence is currently not strong enough to justify a firm conclusion that such fields cause leukaemia in children.
<P>

<a name="20204w41.html_para6">The board of NRPB issued a statement following publication of the AGNIR report. This indicated that if the doubling of the risk of leukaemia in children with exposures to magnetic fields above 0.4 T (400 nanotesla) was causal then an additional two cases of childhood leukaemia might be caused each year in the UK in addition to the 500 cases that would arise from other causes. Possibly one case every two years would be due to proximity to powerlines. There is no clear evidence of effects of magnetic fields on other cancers in children or of any cancers in adults. The AGNIR is, however, examining the possible effects on health of corona ions generated by powerlines. A number of concerns have been raised by members of the academic community in the United Kingdom that corona ions may have an influence on the behaviour of pollutant aerosols and cause an increase in exposure which could cause increases in risk of cancer or other diseases.

 <i>[holding answer 31 January 2002]:</i> All imports of products of animal origin, such as meat and dairy products, to the United Kingdom from countries outside of the European Union are subject to harmonised EU import controls. All such imports must enter the UK through designated border inspection posts where they undergo documentary and identity checks and a proportion are subject to physical checks. Food which is not of animal origin, such as fruit and vegetables, from countries outside of the EU is subject to import controls under UK national legislation and is subject to checks on the basis of risk assessment by local port health authorities and local food authorities at the point of entry to the UK.
<P>

<a name="20204w42.html_para0">Food coming to the UK from other EU member states is in free circulation within the EU and is not subject to routine checks at UK ports. Such food can be subject to import checks where there is information to support such action.

<P>
<a name="20204w42.html_spnew2"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 31 January 2002]:</i> The mobile telephone health research (MTHR) programme that has recently been announced follows from the publication of a report in May 2000 by the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones under the chairmanship of Sir William Stewart FRS, FRSE on "Mobile Phones and Health". Radio signals from handsets were identified as a research priority because local exposures of people using phones are in general appreciably higher than exposures to the whole body from base stations. In both cases, however, exposures need to comply with exposure guidelines.
<P>

<a name="20204w42.html_para5">The first group of proposals agreed for funding by the programme management committee has generally related to the areas of research identified in the Stewart report. Although the main focus of much of the funded research relates to the use of mobile phones, in practice many of the experimental studies will also be valuable in providing evidence on any possible effects on people of exposures to radiofrequency (RF) radiation from base stations. The agreed programme includes a study on exposures from the newer types of base station that are being introduced in urban areas. Details of research now approved for funding are given on the MTHR website at www.mthr.org.uk.
<P>

<a name="20204w42.html_para6">A second call for proposals was issued last year with a deadline for submission of outline proposals of Friday 25 January 2002. The aim of this call was to extend the range of research being carried out in the MTHR programme. One aim of this call was to seek further proposals for volunteer studies that will examine possible effects of RF exposure of people. The proposals have yet to be considered but it is expected that some of the proposals will be of direct relevance to exposures to RF radiation from base stations.

 Children's hospices are a relatively new concept in the overall provision of services for children with life threatening illnesses.
