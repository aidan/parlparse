<P>
<a name="20723w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 I last met the High Commissioner on 30 June.
<P>

<a name="20723w01.html_para0">I visited India and Pakistan on 18&#150;20 July. After my meetings I said that we welcomed the steps taken by Pakistan to stop cross-border infiltration and Indian de-escalatory measures, but we remained deeply concerned about the military mobilisation on both sides of the border. I stressed the need for a permanent end to cross-border infiltration and the importance of the forthcoming Jammu & Kashmir elections being free, fair and inclusive. We will continue to work with our international partners to encourage India and Pakistan to find ways to return to productive dialogue on all the outstanding issues between them, including Kashmir.
<P>

<a name="20723w01.html_para1">The House should also know that I published revised travel advice yesterday which, because of the reduced tension between India and Pakistan, no longer advises British citizens to avoid travelling to India or those already in India to consider leaving. I have modified the travel advice for Pakistan, but this has to take account of the continuing internal terrorist threat.

 Her Majesty's Government remains closely engaged in efforts to end the violence and resume a political process leading to a final settlement. We are supervising the detention of six Palestinian detainees in Jericho, and stand ready to assist with Palestinian reform in whatever way we can. I discussed the issue with Palestinian and Israeli leaders when I visited the region between 1 and 3 July.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Government are committed to a negotiated and comprehensive settlement between Israel and her Arab neighbours along the lines set out in the declaration made by European leaders at Seville on 21 June. We welcome the Statement of the Quartet (US, EU, UN and Russia), which reaffirmed the goal of a final Israeli-Palestinian settlement within three years. It stated 



<P>
<P><I>23 Jul 2002 : Column 880W</I><P>
that progress in the political, security, economic, humanitarian, and institution-building fields must proceed together. All parties have a role to play. The Palestinians must conduct security, political and economic reform, with an action plan agreed by the Quartet leading to a Palestinian state committed to combating terror. Israel must take immediate and concrete steps to support the emergence of a viable Palestinian state, including easing restrictions, releasing tax revenues, and freezing settlement activity consistent with the Mitchell Committee's recommendations. The UK will continue to offer political and practical assistance wherever possible.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 We welcomed the Arab peace initiative, adopted by Arab states in Beirut on 28 March. We welcome the role played by key Arab states in supporting the Quartet's Action Plan for Reform of the Palestinian Authority and Resumption of a Political Process. We regularly discuss the way forward with Arab leaders. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister recently met President Mubarak, King Abdullah, Prime Minister Hariri and Foreign Minister Maher. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary is also in frequent contact with Arab leaders. We met Palestinian Minister for Planning and International Cooperation, Nabil Sha'ath, on 25 June. I met President Arafat and other Palestinian leaders when I visited the Palestinian Authority between 2 and 3 July.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 The UN's involvement in peacekeeping and crisis management continues to be significant. There are 15 peacekeeping operations world wide, involving 45,145 troops, military observers and civilian police from 83 countries. Many of these operations are now in support of solutions to complex intra-state conflicts and tensions; many involve countries close to, or at risk of, collapse.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The UK and the US administration have discussed over time issues relating to missile defence.
<P>

<a name="20723w01.html_para5">These include the threats posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles, and the role that missile defence could play in countering these threats. However, it remains the case that the US has not yet decided how it wishes to proceed with missile defence and has made no request for the use of facilities in the UK.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 What is happening in Zimbabwe is a man-made tragedy. The country is running out of food and its economy is imploding. Ultimately, Zimbabwe's only way back to sustainable development is through respect for the rule of law, a return to democratic principles and sensible economic policies.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 Humanitarian access is difficult to many areas of Sudan where conflict exists. The Government of Sudan and the SPLM have committed themselves to facilitating humanitarian access to all regions of Sudan and there is no formal ban on access to any area.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 We are in regular contact with the US Administration in respect of this issue. Officials have made several approaches, both bilaterally and in conjunction with EU partners, encouraging the US to ratify the Rome Statute. And we have repeatedly made clear that, while we understand US concerns that the Court might bring malicious or politically-motivated charges against US personnel, we do not share them. The Statute of the Court contains safeguards against this. Most recently, and in connection with the renewal of the UN Security Council mandate in respect of peacekeepers in Bosnia (UNMIBH), my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs has had a number of conversations with his US counterpart. The outcome was Resolution 1422, unanimously adopted on 12 July 2002, which respects the Statute of the Court and allows the US to continue to participate in UN peacekeeping operations.

 As my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary said in the House on 12 July 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1166, we are in broad agreement with Spain on many of the principles that should underpin a lasting settlement to the Gibraltar dispute, including that Gibraltarians should retain the right to British nationality and gain in addition the right to Spanish nationality as well if they so choose.

 The conflict in the Great Lakes region must be resolved through negotiations between the parties. We therefore welcome the recent talks in Durban between the Presidents of Rwanda and the DRC. We are encouraged by the decision to hold follow-up talks between senior officials on 18 July in South Africa. We welcome the role that the Government of South Africa, and in particular, President Mbeki, continue to play in trying to help resolve this long-standing conflict.

<a name="20723w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 UNAMSIL and the Government of Sierra Leone have taken measures to minimise the impact of the conflict in Liberia on the emerging peace in Sierra Leone. The UK supports regional and international efforts to bring the conflict in Liberia to an end to halt the worsening humanitarian situation in the sub-region. A considerable number of innocent civilians have been displaced in Liberia, and others have sought refuge in Sierra Leone. We continue to monitor the situation closely.

The figure for information literature includes expenditure on consular publicity campaigns, such as "Know Before You Go", which is run jointly with the travel industry to help ensure that travellers are well prepared for conditions abroad. Expenditure on advertising for recruitment is excluded, as identifying this expenditure would entail disproportionate effort and cost.

[72877]
<P>
<P>

<a name="20723w03.html_para3">The Foundation has continued its crucial work in building and developing democracy overseas during the last 12 months. The Foundation received a grant-in-aid of &#163;4.156 million from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and further &#163;390,056 of funds earmarked for specific purposes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of the compatibility of legislation passed in the Cayman Islands with the UK Human Rights Act 1998 and with the European convention on human rights 1972; and what decisions he has made as to whether such legislation is ultra vires with Orders in Council made by the Secretary of State under UK Acts of Parliament.  [72161]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w03.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Cayman Islands' legislation is scrutinised by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to ensure its constitutionality and its compatibility with the Islands' obligations arising under the European convention on human rights and other international agreements. The UK Human Rights Act 1998 does not extend to the Cayman Islands and is therefore not directly considered.
<P>

<a name="20723w03.html_para5">No Cayman Islands' legislation has been disallowed in recent years because it was found to be ultra vires with an Order in Council made under a UK Act of Parliament.

<a name="20723w05.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Prisk: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what steps the UK Government have taken in support of the World Bank's Action Plan to Accelerate Progress Towards Education for All; what input the UK delegation had in the discussions on the Education for All initiative at the recent G8 summit in Kananaskis; and how much financial assistance the UK Government plan to provide to the World bank's proposed fast-tracked countries within the Education for All initiative.  [68121]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w05.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The Government are strongly committed to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) on education and are working to mobilise the international community in support of them. The World Bank has a critical role in supporting countries as they seek to give priority to education, and primary education in particular, within the overall context of their poverty reduction strategies. We have been working with the bank to develop its new Action Plan for Accelerating Progress Towards Education for All.




<P>
<P><I>23 Jul 2002 : Column 896W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20723w05.html_para0">We believe the World Bank action plan's fast-track initiative provides an opportunity to try to ensure that no country genuinely committed to economic development, poverty reduction and good governance is denied the chance to achieve universal primary education through lack of resources. The Government were successful in calling for the fast-track initiative to include Nigeria and Ethiopia, where over 14 million children are out of school. If offers 18 poor countries the chance to qualify for additional financing for primary education if they can demonstrate that their Government is fully committed and has effective policies in place. A further five countries can apply for assistance in building capacity, filling gaps in data and developing effective policies for primary education.
<P>

<a name="20723w05.html_para1">At the Kananaskis summit, where G8 leaders considered the education needs of developing countries, the UK endorsed the action plan as an important opportunity to fast-track progress towards Education for All. G8 leaders approved the G8 Education Task Force report, which makes clear the need for increased support for basic education from the G8 countries and the importance of the bank's fast-track initiative in mobilising financial resources. Under its Africa Action Plan, the G8 agreed to increase significantly the support provided bilaterally to basic education for countries in Africa with a strong policy and financial commitment to the sector.
<P>

<a name="20723w05.html_para2">The Government are committed to further increasing our support for basic education, particularly in Africa. We will continue to work with the World bank to support their fast track proposals. Further discussions will be held in Washington on 17 July. This meeting, together with the outcome of the spending review to be announced shortly by the Chancellor, will help determine the level of the Government's additional financial support for basic education in the proposed fast-track countries.

 I have now allocated &#163;32 million to help meet food and health needs in Zimbabwe in the current humanitarian situation.
<P>

<a name="20723w05.html_para3">DFID has provided &#163;4 million since September 2001 for a supplementary feeding programme implemented by NGOs, targeting 400,000 people (mainly children) in the worst hit areas of Zimbabwe. At the beginning of January 2002, we made a contribution of &#163;6 million to the UN's Humanitarian Assistance and Recovery Programme; &#163;3.5 million for WFP feeding programmes and &#163;2.5 million for essential drugs and health supplies through the WHO.
<P>

<a name="20723w05.html_para4">In response to the recent reassessment of needs by the World Food Programme and their new regional appeal, I have allocated a further &#163;22 million for Zimbabwe, of which &#163;7 million will be provided through the WFP appeal; &#163;10 million will be channelled through non- governmental organisations to extend direct feeding programmes; and &#163;5 million will be spent again through NGOs on agricultural recovery. We are monitoring NGO and WFP feeding programmes closely to ensure that they are targeted on a needs basis, and that complaints about political bias are tackled effectively.

<a name="20723w06.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 I have decided that the UK will contribute &#163;900 million to the three-year, 13th Replenishment of IDA (IDA-13)&#151;the concessional lending arm of the World bank. This represents a 10.1 per cent. share of IDA-13 donor resources, up from &#163;511 million (7.3 per cent. share) at the last replenishment. The increase reflects the high importance the British Government attaches to IDA, which is one of the most effective channels for reducing poverty in the poorest countries.
<P>

<a name="20723w06.html_para0">The UK will also contribute up to an additional &#163;100 million during the course of IDA-13 towards the cost of compensating IDA for the future loss in loan re-flows resulting from the provision of 18&#150;21 per cent. of IDA-13 resources on grant terms. This contribution is conditional on donors agreeing an appropriate system for funding the enlarged grant provision at the IDA-13 Mid-Term Review in 2003.

<a name="20723w06.html_para2">We are very concerned at the escalation in fighting in Liberia and have called on all warring parties to declare a ceasefire and enter meaningful dialogue. We are also concerned that President Taylor has used the fighting to justify increased repression, including the imposition of a state of emergency. United National sanctions against Liberia have been effective in disrupting President Taylor's links with the RUF and made it harder for him to obtain weapons. We have urged all countries in the region to implement the sanctions vigorously.
<P>

<a name="20723w06.html_para3">There is no permanent British representation in Liberia. We monitor the situation closely from our embassy in Abidjan, and hope shortly to have an officer based in the American embassy in Monrovia, reporting to our embassy in Abidjan.

 <i>[holding answer 17 July 2002]:</i> The European technology acquisition programme (ETAP) is a collaborative technology development programme related to combat air systems. Its aim is to sustain and develop generic European capabilities over the next two decades. Although United Kingdom decisions on which technologies to pursue under ETAP will take account of our Future Offensive Air System project, it is not aimed at a specific equipment, nor is it intended as a means of procuring equipment.

 <i>[holding answer 17 July 2002]:</i> The study report was produced on time and presented to the European technology acquisition programme (ETAP) steering committee on 3 July 2002. The report will provide a focus for future ETAP research and technology programmes.

<P>
<a name="20723w07.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 July 2002]:</i> The European technology acquisition programme (ETAP) is about collaborative technology development related to combat air systems rather than procurement of specific equipments. United Kingdom decisions on technology development within ETAP will reflect the key capabilities required of the UK's future offensive air system. If one or more of our ETAP partners identify the same technology area as a priority, we will jointly decide whether a collaborative ETAP technology demonstration programme with European industry represents best value for money.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what mechanisms are in place to ensure that in its procurement of systems technology the UK does not become beholden to one company with the intellectual property.  [70766]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w07.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 When the Ministry of Defence funds development of equipment, it does so using intellectual property conditions which will allow for competition for further supplies of that equipment or its spare parts. Apart from an undertaking that the original developer will be invited to tender for such further supplies or its spare parts, there is no obligation on MOD to limit further contracts to the original developer.

<a name="20723w07.html_para0">Most systems coming into defence service now, however, comprise an amalgam of commercially developed items and items for which the MOD has funded both the development costs and integration into the final system. Where commercial items are to be incorporated into a defence system, it is MOD's practice to ensure appropriate arrangements are in place to ensure continued availability of vital items on a fair and reasonable basis.
<P>

<a name="20723w07.html_para1">In addition to the arrangements made through individual contracts, statutory arrangements exist under the Patent Act 1977 to enable Government use of patents for defence purposes in some circumstances on payment of compensation.

The QDG

<a name="20723w08.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence does not currently collect data on the cost of programmes designed to reduce waste and encourage re-use and recycling. However, data collection on all environmental issues, including waste, should be greatly enhanced once implementation of the Department's corporate environmental management system has been completed in 2003&#150;04.

 While it is Ministry of Defence policy to divert waste away from landfill by encouraging recycling and minimisation schemes, waste management is handled in practice at a local level by a number of different professional waste contractors.
<P>

<a name="20723w08.html_para0">As these contractors are employed on an individual basis by various budget holders across the Department, information on the quantities of waste diverted from landfill is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

 The Strategic Defence Review (SDR) set in hand a programme of equipment modernisation to ensure that our forces are fully able to meet future challenges. Those conclusions remain valid. But operations in Afghanistan, and work on the SDR New Chapter, have recently demonstrated that our forces will require the controlled, precise and rapid delivery of military effect&#151;particularly through what is called 'network-centric capability', bringing together sensors and strike assets. The increase in the defence budget as a result of SR2002 will enable us to make investment necessary to acquire these sorts of capabilities.

<a name="20723w08.html_para3">

<BR>
Key Target 1
<BR>
To house at least 72 per cent. of families in accommodation that matches their entitlement by posting date or on return to GB from overseas, and at least 93 per cent. within 28 days of their required date;
<BR>
and to give notice of address within 14 days of receipt of an application for accommodation. <sup>1</sup> 
<BR>
Key Target 2
<BR>
Less than 5 per cent. of occupants should experience significant defects within 14 days of moving in.
<BR>
Key Target 3
<BR>
To complete the upgrade of 1,200 properties by 31 March 2003 as part of the programme to upgrade all core stock required for the longer term.
<BR>
Key Target 4
<BR>
To complete:
<BR>
at least 95 per cent. of emergency repairs within 24 hours of notification;
<BR>
at least 90 per cent. of urgent repairs within five working days of notification;
<BR>
at least 95 per cent. of routine repairs within two months of notification.
<BR>
Key Target 5
<BR>
To reduce the management margin progressively towards 10 per cent. by November 2005, to better balance supply and demand while delivering other key targets. (The DHE's interim target for 31 March 2003 is to have a management margin of 12.1 per cent.).
<BR>
Key Target 6
<BR>
To develop a method for indexing the level of satisfaction of SFA occupants. <sup>2</sup> 
<BR>
 <sup>1</sup>  The revised notice of address procedure will be introduced in December 2002. Therefore, benchmarking will take place over the last half of FY 2002&#150;03 in order to determine the performance targets for subsequent years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the progress of the public-private partnership for the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency.  [72885]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w09.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 On 1 July 2001 the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency was successfully divided into QinetiQ plc, currently a wholly Government-owned company, and the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, which remains part of the Ministry of Defence.
<P>

<a name="20723w09.html_para0">On 6 March 2002, I informed the House that we had decided to sell a substantial stake in QinetiQ to a strategic partner who would help to develop the company in preparation for a future flotation on the stockmarket. Our decision followed a detailed analysis of market conditions, which led us to conclude that this approach offered best value for the taxpayer, and would meet our objectives for a successful public private partnership.
<P>

<a name="20723w09.html_para1">Immediately following this announcement we initiated an open competition and carried out a pre-qualification process to identify potential partners. Almost 40 expressions of interest were received, and at the end of April 2002 12 organisations were selected to receive an Information Memorandum describing the company. Following an evaluation in late May 2002 of indicative offers from bidders, several companies were then provided with access to more detailed information on QinetiQ and invited to submit final binding bids. In order to maximise competition we do not propose to reveal how many companies were selected to participate in this stage, or their identities.
<P>

<a name="20723w09.html_para2">We have received a number of responses within the last few days from the shortlisted bidders, and these are now being comprehensively evaluated by officials and specialist advisers. The results of the selection process are not yet available but we remain on track to identify the preferred bidder within the next few weeks, and complete the initial sale later this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if, in respect of his departmental minute concerning the Ministry of Defence's agreement with QinetiQ on the allocation of pre-vesting liabilities dated 8 July, he will withhold final approval of the proposed indemnity for inherited environmental liabilities to be provided for QinetiQ until such time as a detailed financial appraisal of the prospective size of the liabilities is provided to Parliament for debate.  [72296]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w09.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 No. It is important to understand that the vast majority of environmental liabilities on freehold sites have transferred to QinetiQ. The small number of liabilities inherited by QinetiQ to which the departmental 



<P>
<P><I>23 Jul 2002 : Column 913W</I><P>
minute refers is being retained in Government as detailed analysis has shown that this represents best value for money in the light of reasonable commercial insurance not being available. The very low level of past claims and specialist analysis suggest actual risk associated with these specific liabilities is extremely small.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w09.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Lancer integrated demonstrator vehicle was one of two developed under the assessment phase of the joint UK/US Tracer programme. This vehicle is undergoing a series of user trials to demonstrate the technical maturity and military utility of a number of key armoured vehicle technologies.
<P>

<a name="20723w09.html_para3">Although the participating nations decided, jointly, to terminate the Tracer programme at the end of the assessment phase, we expect to be able to apply some of the key technologies to future equipment programmes, in particular the Future Rapid Effects System (FRES) programme, which is due to enter service around the end of the decade.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The strategy is currently being printed and will be published very shortly. Copies will be placed in the Library. The document will also be available on the DEFRA website.
<P>

<a name="20723w09.html_para5">The strategy demonstrates how the UK will achieve substantial reductions in radioactive discharges in the period to 2020, to implement agreements reached at the 1998 ministerial meeting and subsequent meetings of the OSPAR Commission.
<P>

<a name="20723w09.html_para6">Radioactive discharges in the UK have already been reduced to around 1 per cent. of peak levels in the 1970s. This strategy represents the next chapter of what has been an increasingly effective policy to minimise such discharges and shows that the Government are determined to maintain the downward pressure and achieve the objective of the OSPAR radioactive substances strategy.

 <i>[holding answer 17 July 2002]:</i> In accordance with the Concordat on Co-ordination of European Policy Issues (Part IIB of Cm 4444) and a bilateral concordat, the role of Ministers and officials of the devolved Administrations in the CAP reform negotiations will be to support and advance the single UK negotiating line which they will have played a part in developing.

 The Government welcome publication of the European Commission's proposals for reform of the CAP which will form a good basis for discussion. We believe that the general thrust of the proposals for further market reform, decoupling of direct payments from production, and reinforcement of the rural development regulation is the right one, although in a number of key areas the Government consider that the proposals do not go far enough and do not adequately respond to the challenges ahead.

 One aim of the England Rural Development Programme is to encourage new business activity which benefits rural economies and communities. This may be helped through the expansion of existing business activity, new business activity within an existing business, or activity in a new and separate business in a rural area. There is no separate funding programme which solely targets new businesses only.

<a name="20723w13.html_para0">Within the ERDP, the Rural Enterprise Scheme supports both farmers diversifying via new and expanded business activity, and non-farmers with projects in the rural tourism and food marketing sectors. Similarly, the Processing and Marketing Grant supports both new and expanded business activity in the processing of primary foods. Equivalent measures also exist in objective one areas. We do not have separate figures for assistance to new business start-ups and it would depend how 'new businesses' were to be defined. For example, if a farm business diversifies into running a children's nursery or selling clothes over the internet, it might either still be a single diversified farm business or the nursery and clothing sales might be considered new businesses.

 <i>[holding answer 17 July 2002]:</i> None. The Government's policy is that radioactive waste should not be imported to (or exported from) the UK, except for the recovery of reusable materials, or, in certain circumstances, for treatment that will make its subsequent storage or disposal more manageable. In accordance with International Atomic Energy Agency and Euratom definitions, spent fuel is not categorised as waste while the option of reprocessing it remains open and a future use for the fuel can be foreseen.

<P>
<a name="20723w13.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 No test for the diagnosis of bovine TB is 100 per cent. specific.
<P>

<a name="20723w13.html_para11">In the UK, the diagnosis of bovine TB in live cattle relies on the single intradermal comparative test which involves the use of both avian and bovine tuberculins. This test is designed to exclude animals which react to other, often non-pathogenic bacteria, which would otherwise interfere with the test and produce 'false positive' reactions.




<P>

<P>

<a name="20723w13.html_para12">Reactors to the skin test, including animals which give an inconclusive reaction after two retests, are slaughtered and examined post-mortem. Infection is confirmed by either the presence of typical, visible lesions or by the laboratory culture of the organism. In the year 2000, of approximately 7,000 reactors slaughtered, post-mortem examination failed to confirm infection in about 45 per cent. of cases. Infection is confirmed in around 60 to 65 per cent. of herds with one or more reactors.
<P>

<a name="20723w13.html_para13">However, these post-mortem examinations are also less than 100 per cent. sensitive, so failure to detect visible lesions or failure to culture the organism does not confirm the absence of infection. It is not therefore possible to determine how many animals which reacted to the skin test are 'false positives'.

<a name="20723w13.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department has commissioned an extensive programme of research on the vaccination of animals against bovine TB following recommendations made in the Krebs report. Currently we have four projects which are directly related to generating and testing new vaccine candidates and these involve collaboration between Government agencies, institutes and universities both in the UK and internationally. There are also several allied projects to the vaccine programme which include using information from sequencing the M. bovis genome, studying the immune response and pathogenesis of TB, and developing improved diagnostic tests. However, success in developing a bovine TB vaccine that is better than 60 per cent. effective cannot be guaranteed.

 Responsibility for flood forecasting and warning falls to the Environment Agency (EA) who have well-established arrangements with the Meteorological Office for securing accurate and timely weather forecasts.

<P>
<P><I>23 Jul 2002 : Column 948W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20723w17.html_para1">I warmly welcome the Committee's report, which has made a valuable contribution to the ongoing debate about the future of UK manufacturing. There is much in the Committee's excellent analysis with which the Government agrees, not least the importance of manufacturing to the UK economy.
<P>

<a name="20723w17.html_para2">Manufacturing matters hugely. It produces a fifth of our national income, directly employs almost four million people and millions more in dependent businesses; and it supports many good jobs in some of the poorer regions of Britain. Manufacturing accounts for 60 per cent. of our exports and 80 per cent. of commercial research and development, so it is a driver of innovation and technology uptake. It is a key to future prosperity, our economy and the society in which we live.
<P>

<a name="20723w17.html_para3">There are great opportunities for British manufacturers. The UK has real strengths to build on. We have many world-class companies. We have a stable macro-economic environment, a first class science base and membership of the EU giving access to the world's largest single market. But we recognise that we also have significant weaknesses; lower levels of skills, investment, R&D and innovation. Companies that rely mainly on labour intensive products and processes will find it ever more difficult to compete unless they evolve to meet the challenges. Companies must increase the value they add through innovative management, products and processes to succeed in the longer term.
<P>

<a name="20723w17.html_para4">In particular, if UK manufacturers could match the productivity performance of France, Germany and the US, all else remaining equal, we would be &#163;70 billion better off. Returns on investments would be higher, jobs better paid and companies more competitive. That is why the Department of Trade and Industry has put manufacturing at the heart of its agenda&#151;a fact reflected in the Command Paper&#151;and we have set challenging targets on productivity and are taking significant action across a wide front to deliver on them in the longer term.
<P>

<a name="20723w17.html_para5">I welcome the Committee's call to give a greater focus across the DTI on the importance of the manufacturing industry and its needs, and to work with other Government departments in pushing forward the manufacturing agenda. Much progress has been made since the Committee began its inquiry and published its conclusions. A significant amount of what Government&#151;and particularly DTI&#151;does, supports manufacturing and has done for many years. But I have also instigated a step change by increasing both departmental and ministerial resources focused on manufacturing. The role of the Minister of State for Employment Relations, Industry and the Regions has been strengthened&#151;effectively creating a Minister with responsibility for manufacturing. The Department also has a strengthened structure with a new Manufacturing Policy Team and a new Director General for Innovation, when appointed, will play an important role as Chief Adviser on Manufacturing, reinforcing the importance of innovation as a key driver of manufacturing productivity. These changes are already meeting the Committee's recommendation that DTI should have a stronger and more strategic focus, commensurate with the importance of manufacturing.




<P>

<P>

<a name="20723w17.html_para6">The Government also published, on 16 May, its Manufacturing Strategy; the first comprehensive and cohesive framework for manufacturing set out by any UK Government for over 30 years.
<P>

<a name="20723w17.html_para7">A key role highlighted in the strategy will be to ensure that DTI champions more effectively the importance and needs of manufacturing and provides a vigorous lead on manufacturing issues. We are working to strengthen communication and co-operation between Whitehall departments and the regions to help UK manufacturers build on the opportunities of renewed world growth. Much progress is already being made here: at Ministerial level, a close working partnership with DTI, DfES, Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) and the Treasury has already been established on training and skills issues. This is already yielding benefits, including a better skills policy balance between the supply side&#151;what schools and colleges provide&#151;and the demand side&#151;what employers need from their work forces. We have also seen a joined-up UK approach to strengthening demand side leadership by employers through the creation of new Sector Skills Councils and better co-ordination of regional delivery through initiatives such as the DTI Manufacturing Advisory Service already being delivered in most regions by their designated regional centres for manufacturing excellence (RCMEs).
<P>

<a name="20723w17.html_para8">I am confident that, as outlined in the Command Paper, the combination of a clear and coherent manufacturing strategy with enhanced and better focused Departmental resources in DTI provides a fresh basis for a stronger, better co-ordinated approach and more effective action to contribute to a successful UK manufacturing sector.

 In support of the objective to promote productivity and competitiveness, the DTI part funds collaborative R&D in the Foresight Vehicle programme to help accelerate the transfer of technology from the science base and promote its subsequent exploitation by industry. Foresight Vehicle is open to all UK-based companies and universities to submit proposals which if successful may receive grant funding. The programme does not commission research and therefore does not invite tenders from any company either in the UK or elsewhere in Europe. No DTI contracts have been awarded to TNO, IAV, AVL, FEV or IKA. Foresight Vehicle, as the national automotive R&D programme, issues calls for proposals based on rigorous technology road mapping conducted in partnership with industry. The latest technology road map, which has a 20 year time horizon, is in preparation and takes account of various options for powering future vehicles, including hydrogen fuel cells. The road map, which we hope to publish in the autumn, identifies enabling technologies and stages in the development of hydrogen fuel cells that are seen as prerequisites for the successful introduction of fuel cell road vehicles. The DTI is also a partner in the "Powering Future Vehicles" strategy and I refer the hon. Member to the answer given by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport.
<P>

<a name="20723w18.html_para4">The Department of Trade and Industry has been supporting work on fuel cells and hydrogen under the DTI Advanced Fuel Cells Programme since 1992. The total DTI spend is &#163;12.2 million, and the current expenditure approximately &#163;2 million pa. The programme supports work related to both stationary power generation and transport applications for fuel cells. It is estimated that approximately &#163;6 million of the expenditure to date has been on transport-related fuel cell work.

<a name="20723w18.html_para5">The Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) also supports fundamental research in universities on topics that relate to fuel cell/hydrogen research. Funding in these areas amounts to &#163;15.7 million in the period 1992&#150;93 to 2002&#150;03.

I am responding on behalf of Companies House Executive Agency to your Parliamentary Question on the Department of Trade and Industry's policy on the use of 0870 telephone numbers for public enquiries.
<BR>
Companies House uses an 0870 telephone number for our national public enquiry call centre. The decision to employ this type of number is consistent with the guidance set down by the Office of e-Envoy, which states that the choice of a national rate, local rate, freefone or premium rate number should be determined by individual business requirements. As a Trading fund the Agency has to cover the cost of providing services and to avoid cross subsidy. These factors led to the decision to use an 0870 number.

The Patent Office does not use 0870 telephone numbers. It provides 0845 numbers to be used for enquiries by the general public, who are charged local call rates for their telephone calls.

 In response to a recommendation in the report "Recovering the Proceeds of Crime", the Government are today publishing a Consultation Document on the findings of a Regulatory Impact Assessment. This assessment examines ways in which greater disclosure of beneficial ownership of companies could assist law enforcement in tackling serious organised crime and funding of terrorism. The assessment identifies a range of benefits and gauges the potential additional burdens on companies; it concludes that advantages could be derived from enhanced disclosure while imposing limited additional costs on industry. The Government wish to consider the proposals further and welcome responses to the Consultation Document from those with interests in this area.

<a name="20723w21.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Lawrence: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how negotiations are progressing with industry on changes to the Pool Re scheme to take account of changes in the terrorism insurance and reinsurance markets since 1993 and in particular since 11 September 2001.  [73100]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w21.html_spnew0"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 Today I am announcing changes to the Pool Re scheme which will enable insurers to offer terrorism insurance across a wider range of risks. The outcome is part of a package of reforms which have been agreed by a government-industry working group set up to look at changes to Pool Re needed after 11 September.
<P>

<a name="20723w21.html_para0">The working group has reached agreement on the main changes to the scheme. The changes include extension of Pool Re cover from "fire and explosion" only, to an "all risks basis", to ensure that a terrorist attack involving, for example contamination, impact by aircraft, or flood damage could be covered by the scheme. This increased cover will be available in the next few weeks and will be reflected in higher premiums for the period covered. There will be an option to backdate to 1 January 2002. The existing exclusion for nuclear risks will also be removed as soon as practicable, and by 1 January 2003 at the latest.
<P>

<a name="20723w21.html_para1">Other changes to the scheme include changes to the financing of Pool Re to encourage competition, and changes to make governance arrangements more transparent in the public interest. These will take effect from 1 January 2003.
<P>

<a name="20723w21.html_para2">The details will need to be finalised over the coming months. Further information about these changes are published on the Treasury's website and in an explanatory statement in the House Library.

 The arrangement normally referred to as the Cranford Agreement is believed to date from 31 July 1952. It would appear that it was an undertaking given by a senior airport official during a local public meeting of the Cranford Residents and District Amenities Association, which was attended on that occasion by the Minister of Civil Aviation ("Mr. Lenox-Boyd"). If there was a written record, it appears not to have survived. The evidence given by the former DETR to the Terminal 5 Inquiry in July 1997 includes a fuller account and history of the undertaking, and I have placed an extract from that evidence in the Library. Our aim is to complete the technical review stage this year. I will then issue a consultation paper.

 It is not possible to provide figures in the form requested; traffic data collected by the Department for Transport (DfT) is collected according to vehicle type not propulsion type. Calculating the proportion of journeys for cars powered by alternative fuels such as biodiesel is extremely difficult as they are almost always capable of running on pure conventional fuels.

As table 1 shows, in 2001, of a total of 29,747,100 vehicles licensed in the UK, 46,700 were alternatively powered, representing 0.16 per cent. of total registrations.

 Following an internal departmental review, I intend to establish a new executive agency (name to be determined) on 1 April 2003 to bring together the work of the Traffic Area Network and the Vehicle Inspectorate. The new agency will play a key role in promoting safe, fair and environmentally responsible road haulage and bus industries.

The creation of this new agency within the DVO group will allow a more joined up and customer-focused approach to the services provided to road transport industry, and better targeted enforcement to the benefit of road safety.

 This Department is working in partnership with the Department for Education and Skills to improve access to and the quality of PE, school sport and club links for 5 to 16-year-olds. Gifted and talented sportspeople, specifically, will benefit from: a national support network based around specialist sports colleges; a programme of summer schools and performance camps; a much stronger emphasis on sporting talent within all parts of our national strategy for gifted and talented education; improved coaching; and stronger links between schools and sports clubs. As far as the last is concerned, we aim to increase the numbers of children and young people moving into sports specific junior clubs in seven major sports from 386,000 now to 1 million by 2006.

<P>
<a name="20723w25.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Interdepartmental Group on sport which includes my hon. Friend the Minister for Public Health, has discussed a wide range of issues related to sport policy, including the relationship of sport and health. It is agreed that the promotion of sport can play a valuable role in improving health across the population and we have been working closely with the Department of Health to ensure the co-ordination of sport and health policy.

<a name="20723w25.html_wqn5"><B> Dr. Richard Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if he will make a statement about progress achieved towards meeting the aim of significantly raising the time spent on sport and physical activity by five to 16-year-olds.  [72234]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w25.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 We have no data on overall progress as yet. The baseline was set by Sport England's Young People and Sport survey, last carried out in 1999. The survey will be repeated this year in June (with results available in December) and again in 2004. However, there are indicators of performance from individual programmes that suggest a positive trend overall. For example by September this year there will be 142 Specialist Sports Colleges supporting 742 SSCos and 3,576 Primary Link Teachers and 45 Sports Partnerships have been established to enable young people to participate in sport more frequently, improve their skills, and compete at various levels.

<a name="20723w25.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Greenway: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport whether she expects the number of staff positions at Sport England which have a remuneration package worth over &#163;50,000 per annum to increase by 2005&#150;06.  [72472]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w25.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Sport England expect that the number of staff receiving remuneration packages worth over &#163;50,000 will increase from 14 to 26 by 2005&#150;06. This is due mainly to the regrading of the Regional Director posts and the creation of a new post of Head of Placements and Alliances under the proposed restructuring of Sport England.

<a name="20723w25.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Greenway: </B>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w25.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Grant-in-aid provided to Sport England and UK Sport is as follows. Funding for sport in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales is a devolved matter and an issue for those administrations.

 At its meeting on 9 July 2002 the Commission examined the Comptroller and Auditor General and officials of the National Audit Office on the NAO's Corporate Plan for 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06. The plan envisages an increase in spending by the NAO for 2003&#150;04 of some 10 per cent. compared with the current financial year. The additional funding is required for four main purposes: to implement the wide-ranging recommendations of the Sharman report on public expenditure audit; to maintain service to Parliament at a time of rapid public expenditure growth and more complex service delivery mechanisms; to strengthen the audit of revenue departments; and to enable the NAO to increase from 50 to 60, over time, the number of Value for Money studies it carries out annually, as proposed by the Commission and agreed with the Public Accounts Committee.
<P>

<a name="20723w26.html_para0">After satisfying itself on a number of points, including the robustness of the NAO's expenditure plans and its response to comments contained in external evaluations of its Value for Money studies, the Commission approved the Corporate Plan.

 As a result of the spending review, the core unit of funding per full-time equivalent student for further education colleges will increase 1 per cent. in real terms in each of the next three years in return for improved outcomes from colleges.

We are now considering further the outcome of the spending review and other decisions on allocations, including to further education, will be announced in the autumn. We remain committed to bringing up the level of funding for colleges towards that of school sixth forms. This will take time and can be done only as resources allow.

 <i>[holding answer 22 July 2002]:</i> Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 was introduced on 1 October 1998 to stop the indiscriminate sale of school playing fields that occurred in the 1980s and early to mid 1990s. There are no central records of how many school playing fields were sold before October 1998.
<P>

<a name="20723w28.html_para4">A total of 115 applications to sell areas of school playing field larger than a small sports pitch for the under 10s&#151;that is, over 2,000m <sup>2</sup> , have been approved since October 1998. Some 50 of these approved applications involved sports pitches at closed schools, while a further 17 were at operating schools where the playing fields were no longer used by the schools and were not needed by other local schools. In a further 15 cases, alternative sports pitches have been provided to replace those that have been lost. In all cases, we have ensured that the remaining playing fields would meet the full needs of the schools involved and of other schools in the local area.
<P>

<a name="20723w28.html_para5">Applications to sell school playing fields are only approved where it is clear that any proceeds will be used to improve school sports provision or education facilities. Some of the proceeds from these approved applications have been earmarked to provide new sports halls and to improve other sports facilities at schools, such as new all-weather pitches and to bring other, poorly drained pitches back into use. The rest of the proceeds are being used to help lever up standards in our schools&#151;for example, by providing modern, up to date, teaching accommodation, such as science and technology classrooms. In a number of cases, the proceeds are to be used to help build new schools or to enable multi site schools to consolidate on to one site.

<a name="20723w30.html_spnew3"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 All children in the early years should be treated as individuals to ensure each has equal opportunity to develop their full potential. This message is reinforced throughout the joint DfES/Qualifications and Curriculum Authority publication, "Curriculum guidance for the foundation stage", which has been made available to all early years practitioners. The guidance stresses the importance of early intervention and the key role practitioners play in identifying learning needs, and in the planning required to support those needs.
<P>

<a name="20723w30.html_para6">The requirements of the Nursery Education Grant require all early years settings that receive it to have an SEN policy and have regard to the revised SEN Code of Practice. We included a new chapter in the revised SEN Code of Practice entitled, "Identification, Assessment and Provision in Early Education Settings", which expands significantly on SEN provision for children under five years of age. In addition, the SEN and Disability Act 2001 enables private, voluntary and independent sector settings to request statutory assessments for the four year olds in their care, and for three year olds by 2004 when we expect universal provision for this age group.

<P>
<a name="20723w30.html_spnew4"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 In March 2001, we announced a &#163;25 million three year programme to support children with disabilities or special educational needs in the early years. This funding supports a number of DfES SEN and disability initiatives all of which are focused on enabling children with SEN to participate in mainstream provision. These initiatives include &#163;9.5 million for local training over three years of identified Special Educational Needs Co-ordinators (SENCOs) in the private, voluntary and independent sector early years settings; &#163;11 million additional funding for LEAs and Early Years Development and Child care Partnerships (EYDCPs) this financial year and the next, to support and improve existing SEN support activities; &#163;3 million for support services such as Portage schemes, projects aimed at early identification and intervention for SEN, and better resources for children with low incidence disability; and &#163;1 million for the development of national training materials to support local SEN training activity. The funding has also resourced 4 Area SENCO pilot projects in 2001&#150;02. We are drafting guidance following the conclusion of the pilot projects on the role and objectives of Area SENCOs, and encouraging EYDCPs to start developing networks of "Area SENCOs" who will work with early years settings by the autumn of this year.

 I have already written to apologise to the hon. Member for the delay in replying to her questions of 11 March. At the time she asked similar questions of the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions. I regret that her separate questions to the Speaker's Committee were not noticed. Each of her questions sought information on the plans of the Electoral Commission for work in the areas listed. This answer deals with all five of them.
<P>

<a name="20723w30.html_para8">I understand that the Electoral Commission has no plans to carry out any reviews of existing or proposed electoral systems in the UK. However, the Commission will, in accordance with its statutory duties, report on the administration of elections to the European, United Kingdom and Scottish Parliaments, and elections to the Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies. No such duty exists in relation to other elections mentioned, although the Commission is required to keep under review, and from time-to-time submit reports to the Secretary of State on, a range of elections and referendums including local elections in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="20723w30.html_para9">It is expected that these statutory election reports from the Electoral Commission will examine a wide range of issues linked to the administration and conduct of the election in question, including levels of voter participation and public understanding of the voting system. However, the Commission has taken the view that it would not be appropriate for it to adopt any policy view in relation to the merits of current or alternative systems of voting while there is a prospect of the Government asking the Commission to conduct a referendum on the use of a form or proportional representation for voting in elections to the House of Commons.

 My noble Friend the then Minister for Housing, Planning and Regeneration met representatives of the five mobile phone network operators on 8 May 2002 to discuss their progress in meeting their commitments to best mast siting practice and the audit arrangements that they have put in place to assess continuing compliance with the commitments.
<P>

<a name="20723w32.html_para8">Work currently under way to revise the Code of Best Practice on Mobile Phone Masts is building on the commitments and on our guidance in Planning Policy Guidance Note 8 (Telecommunications) to improve consultation on mast proposals with local communities and local planning authorities. The Working Group established to take that work forward will monitor the operation of the revised code and effectiveness of the commitments themselves.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assessment he has made of the way in which proposals to reconcile provision for the retention by local authorities of tariffs for the granting of planning permission on major developments as set out in the document, "Reforming Planning Obligations", can be implemented alongside proposals for the reform of the local authority capital finance system as set out in the document, Local Government Finance Formula Grant Distribution-A Consultation Paper.  [70111]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w34.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 We do not consider that there is a significant relationship between proposals on the retention of receipts from planning tariffs and the options for reforming how revenue support for capital finance is distributed, as set out in the Formula Grant distribution consultation paper. Therefore no such assessment has been made.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w35.html_wqn0"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on the Quinquennial Review of Ordnance Survey.  [72983]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w35.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce today the outcome of the second and final stage of the Quinquennial Review of Ordnance Survey.




<P>
<P><I>23 Jul 2002 : Column 1013W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20723w35.html_para0">On 19 December 2001 it was announced that the Government were minded to accept the recommendation from stage 1 of the Review of Ordnance Survey, that it should move to become a Government-owned public limited company (GOplc). Ordnance Survey is a Government Department and Executive Agency operating within a trading fund regime. The stage 1 review considered that it needed additional freedoms and flexibilities to enable it to use its full potential to develop the geographic information and e-business marketplace, and concluded that a change in status could offer such freedoms.
<P>

<a name="20723w35.html_para1">Subsequently, a Steering Group chaired by this Department, including representatives from Ordnance Survey, HM Treasury, Cabinet Office and two external members from the Association for Geographic Information, and the London borough of Lewisham, undertook further work based on the stage 1 findings consulting external advisers. As with the stage 1 review, consultation took place with a wide range of stakeholders and customers in the geographic information business in Great Britain.
<P>

<a name="20723w35.html_para2">Following work on stage 2 of the Quinquennial Review, I am now of the opinion that there is no clear evidence to support the view that Ordnance Survey would benefit from a change of status to GOplc.
<P>

<a name="20723w35.html_para3">The stage 2 review has drawn attention to three issues:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>first, there is a need to reach agreement on enhanced financial freedoms and flexibilities that should be made available to Ordnance Survey;
<P>
<BR>
secondly, the provision and location of policy advice to Government on geographic information, currently provided by Ordnance Survey alongside its data supply role, will be reviewed;
<P>
<BR>
and thirdly, in the context of a review of Ordnance Survey's Framework Document, we will consider issues surrounding Ordnance Survey's relationship with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20723w35.html_para4">The importance of geographic data to Government has recently been underlined by the pilot agreement to make Ordnance Survey data widely available within central Government to help match the extensive benefit that local government already gains from using such data. Ordnance Survey's work in underpinning Great Britain with geographic information and its successful operation since becoming a Trading Fund in 1999, are clearly worth sustaining in the most appropriate way.
<P>

<a name="20723w35.html_para5">I am satisfied that sustaining Ordnance Survey as a trading fund with some extended freedoms will enable it to continue to develop&#151;and continue to progress its impressive programme of cultural change&#151;to the benefit of all who use its geographic data. Ordnance Survey must be given the right operating framework to enable it to respond to the demands of the geographic information marketplace, which is dependent on the quality, consistency and availability of Ordnance Survey geographic data.
<P>

<a name="20723w35.html_para6">Ordnance Survey must also, quite crucially, be able to play a full part in ensuring geographic information firmly underpins the e-government agenda, and informs policy formulation and delivery of information and services.
<P>

<a name="20723w35.html_para7">I have asked my officials to take forward work as a matter of urgency on the three issues I have referred to, and ensure that the decisions reached are reflected in a 



<P>
<P><I>23 Jul 2002 : Column 1014W</I><P>

 No reliable estimates exist of the costs incurred by local authorities in complying with their duty under the Local Government Act 1999. Any such costs would have to be set against the benefits of improved services.
<P>

<a name="20723w36.html_para0">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has commissioned Cardiff Business School to evaluate the long-term impact of best value in English local authorities from 2001 until 2005. Part of this involves an assessment of the impact of Best Value in delivering improved services, including an element of cost-effectiveness. However, this is reliant upon year-on-year Best Value performance indicator data, which is currently being collected to monitor improvements. In the meantime, we are aiming to publish the results arising from the first year's census of local authorities. The census provides the benchmark against which the implementation of Best Value and its impact on service delivery will be assessed.

 The Code of Practice, setting out an approach to work force matters in local government service contracts which involve a transfer of staff, is being published today as part of a draft Government circular for public consultation "Best Value and Performance Improvement".
<P>

<a name="20723w37.html_para0">The draft code will ensure that all contracting exercises and contracts are designed in a way that secures a high quality work force over the life of a contract. It meets our commitment to act to end the threat of a 'two-tier workforce' of transferees and new joiners in local government contracting. And it is consistent with the message in the draft circular that all local authorities must adopt a positive approach to work force matters if they are to achieve best value.
<P>

<a name="20723w37.html_para1">In publishing the draft circular, the Government are delivering on their commitment in the local government White Paper "Strong Local Leadership&#151;Quality Public Services", to streamline and reform best value.

<a name="20723w37.html_para5">Good regeneration schemes are developed by genuine and effective partnerships.

<a name="20723w37.html_para7">There is no single definition of community capacity building, and so the figures in the tables should not be used as a basis for comparison between partnerships. Community capacity building can involve a wide range of differing activities&#151;for example it may involve training community representatives, providing support workers to help the community develop skills, or providing access to administrative or office resources. Retaining the involvement and support of the community should be a priority throughout the life of any regeneration scheme.
<P>

<a name="20723w37.html_para8">Government guidance for NDC partnerships has made clear that we expect them to spend time and money in building the capacity of local people and agencies to participate. NDC partnerships were given considerably longer to prepare their Delivery Plans than in previous regeneration programmes. For the first time, the Government provided funding to help the partnership prepare its Delivery Plan, so that local people could be genuinely involved in the process of preparing the plan. The rules for NDC partnerships allow them to spend up to 10 per cent. of their funding on management and administration costs (that is double the amount allowed under previous programmes), to ensure that the partnership is properly resourced to deliver a programme with communities at its heart. We have asked each partnership to develop and implement a local learning plan, to equip all of the key players to play their full part in the process of neighbourhood renewal.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what proportion of waste produced in his Department was <i>(a)</i> recycled, <i>(b)</i> composted, and <i>(c)</i> re-used, broken down into (i) paper, (ii) plastics, (iii) aluminium cans and (iv) other in each year since 1997; what plans there are to increase these proportions; and if he will make a statement.

 The Department for Work and Pensions was formed in June 2001. In 2001, the former Department of Social Security produced 24,000 tonnes of waste, of which 37 per cent. was recycled. The vast majority of recycled waste was paper. No waste was composted. Details are not available prior to 2001.
<P>

<a name="20723w38.html_para0">For 2002, figures show that paper recycling has risen to 55 per cent. of the total waste produced, amounting to 16,172 tonnes. We plan to extend our paper-recycling scheme across the whole Department in the coming year.
<P>

<a name="20723w38.html_para1">Redundant office furniture is recycled by DWP's estates partners wherever possible. Metal components are reused and desktops are pulped and recycled where possible. Volume figures are not available for this.
<P>

<a name="20723w38.html_para2">Surplus IT equipment is refurbished and reused wherever possible. This is facilitated by the Disposal Service Agency, and the refurbished equipment is then distributed through the Computers Within Reach initiative.
<P>

<a name="20723w38.html_para3">DWP as a whole does not currently separate plastics and aluminium cans from the general waste stream, although local schemes to recycle waste are encouraged and are in place at a number of locations. We plan to examine the potential for a national scheme to recycle these waste streams.
<P>

<a name="20723w38.html_para4">In addition to the recycling initiatives in place, staff are also actively encouraged to reduce the amount of waste that they generate.

 2.12 per cent. of the 1,824,682 reams of paper purchased by DWP in 2001&#150;02 was recycled paper. Of this 1,330,392 reams were purchased from the joint OGC/DWP contract at a cost of &#163;4,913,629. Costs for the remaining 494,290 reams are not available.
<P>

<a name="20723w38.html_para5">In 2001&#150;02 DWP also purchased 8,434 tonnes of pre- printed paper (leaflets and forms), of which 16 per cent. was recycled. 721 tonnes of card and board were also purchased of which 68 per cent. was recycled. Costs are not currently available.
<P>

<a name="20723w38.html_para6">Information is not available prior to 2001&#150;02.

<a name="20723w38.html_para7">We are currently reviewing the measures we have in place to reduce the overall amount of paper used within the Department at the same time as increasing the percentage of recycled paper used.

 Up to March 2002, we estimate that around 17,979 sanctions <sup>1</sup>  had been applied to people aged over 24 on the New Deal programme. This represents the number of sanctions applied, not the number of people sanctioned as some people will have been sanctioned more than once.

 <sup>1</sup>  This information has been collected by undertaking a special exercise and is based on a combination of IT-generated statistics and information supplied clerically. The figure is therefore an estimate and should be treated as a guide to the number of sanctions applied only.

 <i>[holding answer 4 July 2002]:</i> Every child has a right to a decent start in life whether their parents live together or apart. Children are entitled to care and support and both parents are responsible for providing it. It is reasonable to expect that the parent with care should co-operate with the Child Support Agency unless there are reasonable grounds for believing there would be a risk of harm or undue distress to the parent or any child living with them. If a parent with care refuses, without

good cause, to co-operate with the agency, their benefit may be reduced by up to 40 per cent. of the income support personal allowance for a person aged 25 or over.
<P>

<a name="20723w38.html_para9">The available information is in the tables. Following the introduction in April 1998 of face-to-face interviews with parents with care claiming benefits, there has been a sharp rise in compliance and a corresponding fall in the number of reduced benefit directions issued. These interviews provide the opportunity to explain to parents with care the advantages of co-operating with the agency as well as the good cause rules.

<P>
<a name="20723w39.html_spnew6"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 There will always be an element of complexity in the benefits system due to the diverse range of contingencies for which it must cater. However, we are overhauling service delivery to meet the different needs of the Department's client groups and investing in improved and modernised services that are more accurate, make better use of technology, and are simpler for people to understand and access.

Some 50 pathfinder offices opened in October 2001, and Jobcentre Plus was launched as a national organisation at the beginning of April 2002. 56 integrated Jobcentre Plus offices are now open, and we aim to roll out a further 225 between October of this year and April 2003. The 2002 spending review further advances our reform and modernisation programme by announcing the roll-out of Jobcentre Plus nationally by 2006 to deliver an enhanced work-focused service for all people of working age.
<P>

<a name="20723w39.html_para1">Further steps to promote work include the introduction of the Working Tax Credit from April 2003 which extends support to low income workers without children. And the new Child Tax Credit, also from April 2003 will provide a single, seamless system of support for families.

<a name="20723w39.html_para2">The new Disability and Carer Directorate operates as a discrete business within the Department, responsible for the civil rights agenda for disabled people. Through the Disability and Carers Service, it also delivers Disability Living Allowance, Attendance Allowance and Invalid Care Allowance and will, over time, streamline benefits delivery and improve customer service.
<P>

<a name="20723w39.html_para3">The Pension Service replaced the Benefits Agency services for pensioners from April 2002, and is working to introduce an improved service tailored to the needs of today's and future pensioners. For the first time, there is a service dedicated to the needs of pensioners and helping people understand their pension options and ways to save for their retirement. Pensioners can use The Pension Service as a gateway to other services such as Housing Benefit and Attendance Allowance.
<P>

<a name="20723w39.html_para4">The Pension Service will also deliver Pension Credit from October 2003. This replaces the Minimum Income Guarantee and represents a major simplification of provision for pensioners. For example, it does away with the rules excluding pensioners with savings of &#163;12,000 or more from receiving help and, from age 65, most pensioners will not have to report changes in income for a fixed period of five years, effectively abolishing the weekly means test.

<BR>
As Jobcentre Plus is an Executive Agency, the Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question about the number of employers who have contacted Employer Direct since it was introduced and the measures that have been taken to ensure that this initiative meets the needs of employers.

Since the national implementation of Employer Direct on 26 January 2002 over 700,000 calls from employers have been received and nearly 600,000 vacancies notified.
<BR>
During the development of Employer Direct there was wide ranging consultation with employers. This included the formation of a national group of employers in addition to discussion and liaison at local level.

In addition to taking employers' views in the development and roll out of Employer Direct we seek feedback from employers as a matter of course whenever they use the Employer Direct service.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what pilot schemes he will run to ensure that information and procedures given to benefit recipients will have been fully tested prior to the April 2003 deadline; and if he will make a statement.  [70556]

<a name="20723w41.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 There will be a phased introduction of different benefit types and customer volumes. This is aimed at reducing risk and operational complexity during the early part of the conversion period and will also be a way to test conversion processes and the information to be given to customers to ensure that it meets their needs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many individuals' personal data have been processed in data matching exercises in connection with benefit fraud; how many cases were identified as part of that data matching exercise as being possible cases of benefit fraud requiring further investigation; how many cases after investigation were deemed likely to be fraudulent; how many cases were prosecuted; what the total costs were of all data matching exercises, including staff and computer costs; and what the estimated total savings to the public purse are and the multiplier used in this calculation.  [59210]

<a name="20723w41.html_spnew5"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Data-matching is a powerful tool in the detection of fraud and incorrectness in the benefit system. The Department's Matching Intelligence Data Analysis Service (MIDAS) operates the Generalised Matching Service (GMS) for benefits administered by the Department, and the Housing Benefit Matching Service (HBMS) for housing benefit and council tax benefit which are administered by local authorities.
<P>

<a name="20723w41.html_para2">The data-matching process involves data extracts being taken from the Department's main benefit computer systems and local authority benefit systems which are matched against each other using data matching "rules" to identify discrepancies between the data sets. Such discrepancies are then referred for local investigation. Legislation also provides for personal data held by other Government Departments to be matched against departmental and local authority data to identify discrepancies.
<P>

<a name="20723w41.html_para3">It is not possible to say how many individuals' personal data have been processed in data-matching exercises because each individual's details may be held on several systems at the same time.
<P>

<a name="20723w41.html_para4">Information on the overall cost of conducting data- matching exercises and investigating discrepancies is not available.
<P>

<a name="20723w41.html_para5">The available information on the results from GMS and HBMS data-matching operations is in the tables.

<P>
<a name="20723w42.html_spnew7"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The asylum system is working increasingly quickly, through reforms and increased resources. Measures in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill will continue this process. This means that the employment concession, whereby asylum seekers could apply for permission to work if their application remained outstanding for longer than six months without a decision being made, is becoming increasingly irrelevant. The vast majority&#151;around 80 per cent. of asylum seekers&#151;receive a decision within six months, and work is continuing to improve that further. An increasingly small number of people, therefore, are entitled to apply for the concession. It is also the case that the great majority of new asylum applicants will have their cases decided within two months and the concession, which dates from a time when lengthy delays were widespread in the asylum system, is therefore no longer appropriate.
<P>

<a name="20723w42.html_para5">I am determined to make it clear that there is a distinct separation between asylum processes and labour migration channels. It is essential that we have a robust asylum process that works effectively and swiftly in the interests of refugees, and also is not open to abuse by those who would seek to come here to work. But that does not mean we are 'fortress Britain'. The Government are putting in place an effective managed migration programme and continues to create a number of work routes to allow more people to come and work here legally in ways which boost our economy. For example, the Government have overhauled the work permits system and the number of work permits issued has doubled over the past two years&#151;in 2001 we issued work permits to nearly 140,000 people. Other entry routes for people who want to work in the United Kingdom include the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme, the Working Holidaymakers Scheme (under which nearly 40,000 Commonwealth young people a year come to the United Kingdom for a working holiday) and the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme (which brings in nearly 20,000 seasonal workers a year). In addition, the Government are currently consulting on schemes to bring in more temporary workers in industries with recruitment difficulties.
<P>

<a name="20723w42.html_para6">Those who are granted refugee status can work immediately, and we welcome the enormous contribution that the skills and knowledge of refugees can make to our society and to our economy. However, our asylum system 



<P>
<P><I>23 Jul 2002 : Column 1042W</I><P>
exists to help those fleeing persecution&#151;those who want to come here to work must do so through the various economic routes available rather than abuse the asylum system.
<P>

<a name="20723w42.html_para7">I have therefore decided, with immediate effect, that the concession should be abolished. Asylum seekers who already have permission to work will retain that right until such time as a final decision is made on their claim.

 We aim to decide straightforward general immigration applications, which can include those for indefinite leave to remain, on initial consideration within three weeks. At present such applicants are taking on average around four weeks to decide but we are working to reduce this to three weeks as soon as possible. Some applications that need more detailed consideration of further inquiries are, at present, taking up to 12 months to consider due to the large number of cases currently in the system.
<P>

<a name="20723w42.html_para10">All applications are acknowledged within two weeks of receipt which includes advice as to the likely time scale for initial consideration. If the application cannot be completed on initial consideration a further letter is sent advising the likely time scale for considering such cases.

 Asylum seekers in emergency accommodation are provided with temporary support under section 98 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (the 1999 Act). Asylum seeking mothers in emergency accommodation are not eligible to receive a maternity grant because this is available only to asylum seekers assessed as eligible to receive support and in receipt of support under section 95 of the 1999 Act. Asylum seekers in emergency accommodation who give birth to a baby are provided with a pack of items to enable them to meet the needs of their baby.

All correspondence received within the Operations Section of NASS&#151;currently in excess of 4,000 pieces per week&#151;is subject to a target for completion. Targets are applied across the board&#151;there is no distinction between correspondence received from an asylum seeker or a third party.

<a name="20723w45.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Figures for the number of officers leaving police forces on transfer are collected annually by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC). In 2000&#150;01, the latest full year for which figures are available, the total number of officers leaving forces in England and Wales on transfer was 1,189 or one per cent. of the police strength.
<P>

<a name="20723w45.html_para3">The figures collected by HMIC do not distinguish between officers who transfer soon after completion of initial training and those who transfer later in their career. Nor do the figures identify how many of the officers transferring have transferred between forces on previous occasions.
<P>

<a name="20723w45.html_para4">In the case of West Midlands police, that between April 2000 and March 2001, 59 officers left the force on transfer. This represented 0.8 per cent. in fall of force strength at the start of the year, a little below the overall rate from England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="20723w45.html_para5">The number of officers transferring between forces remains small. It is healthy for there to be an interchange of experience between police forces and I do not intend to prevent transfers.
<P>

<a name="20723w45.html_para6">Of course, the number of transfers from a force may present a problem if those transferring leave predominantly from particular areas or specialisms, or if the number leaving is not offset by transfers in. We are presently conducting research into the reasons why officers resign from the police service or choose to transfer from one force to another. The findings of this research will help forces decide on which measures to implement in order to encourage officers to stay in the service, or in a particular force.
<P>

<a name="20723w45.html_para7">It is for the Home Secretary to determine police pay and allowances. In doing so, he is required to take into account any recommendation by the Police Negotiating Board (PNB). It would, therefore, be for PNB to consider in the first instance the case for a regional allowance for officers in the West Midlands. In 2001, the PNB failed to reach agreement on a Staff Side claim for a regional allowance for all police forces. The matter was then referred to the Police Arbitration Tribunal (PAT). The PAT rejected the Staff Side claim and decided that there was no evidence of a significant nationwide recruitment problem for the police service.

<a name="20723w46.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Yeo: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what recent representations he has received regarding the progress of the investigatory branch CIB3 in investigating alleged misdemeanours.  [69332]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w46.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 I received representations on alleged malpractice in corruption investigations by the Anti- Corruption Unit of the Metropolitan Police Service's Directorate of Professional Standards (formerly CIB3) from my noble Friend (Lord Graham) of Edmonton, five hon. Members and a solicitor at a meeting on 20 March 2002. I received a dossier of written material from my noble Friend Lord Graham on 30 April.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w46.html_wqn2"><B> Dr. Murrison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what steps he is taking to reduce the number of deaths in police custody;  [70830]
<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment he has made of the causes of the change in the annual number of deaths in police custody since 1992.  [70952]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w46.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The number of people dying in police stations has fallen from 16 to five in the period 1998&#150;99 to 2000&#150;01. Provisional figures for 2001&#150;02 show that the decline is continuing.
<P>

<a name="20723w46.html_para1">The definitions of deaths in police custody or otherwise with the police were revised in 1996 to make them clearer, and to distinguish between deaths of those in police detention and other deaths involving the police. This resulted in a broader range of deaths being reported, for example people who died while attempting to evade arrest in vehicles. This has resulted in an increase in the published figures.
<P>

<a name="20723w46.html_para2">The increased figure for 1995&#150;96 reflected the change to collecting the figures on a financial year basis rather than on a calendar year basis and were collected over a 15 month period (1 January 1995 to 31 March 1996).
<P>

<a name="20723w46.html_para3">Much has been done in recent years by the police, the Home Office and the Police Complaints Authority (PCA) to identify the main factors responsible for deaths in custody and to consider how the position can be improved. Police forces in England and Wales are taking a range of actions to reduce such deaths. These include safer custody facilities, improved training, Close Circuit Television (CCTV) monitoring and an emphasis on better care, assessment and monitoring of detainees.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w46.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Special constables are a key element of our police reform agenda. We are working on a package of measures designed to help improve the way they are recruited, managed and deployed.

<P>

<a name="20723w46.html_para4">We are particularly keen to improve liaison with employers. Later this year, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Home Secretary will publish a joint discussion paper on fiscal and other changes we can make to promote community service, including service as a special constable. A new headline role for specials has been published, focusing on intelligence-led patrolling and crime reduction initiatives. A new foundation training package for specials was issued in June and revised conditions of service regulations and new conduct regulations are being prepared.
<P>

<a name="20723w46.html_para5">Central to this process will be Home Office/the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) good practice guidance covering all aspects of the recruitment, management and deployment of specials, which will be issued by the end of the year. We have also set aside &#163;300,000 to help "specials champions" forces drive forward initiatives to improve the recruitment and retention of specials. I have asked deputy chief constable Peter Fahy of Surrey police to help with this.

Those conclusions were prompted by United Kingdom concerns at the lack of progress on asylum and immigration measures and incorporate specific ideas proposed by the United Kingdom for the purpose of advancing that work. In particular, the conclusions set deadlines for agreeing the instruments which will form the basis of the European Union's common asylum system, and I attach importance to supporting the Danish Presidency in securing agreement to the Dublin II Regulation (on responsibility for processing an asylum claim) by the end of this year.

 In November 1999, the Treasury published a statement of Best Practice on the use of consultants within Government. This is accessible on the archive section of Office of Government Commerce's (OGC's) website (www.ogc.gov.uk). It represents a set of principles that should apply to many areas of consultancy. But it is not binding on Departments and has no status in law.
<P>

<a name="20723w49.html_para0">Decisions on the use of consultants is left to individual business units, but in making positive decisions units will take into account value for money considerations and whether the particular skills exist internally.
<P>

<a name="20723w49.html_para1">The increase in expenditure on Public Relations Consultants can be attributed to the Criminal Records Bureau and United Kingdom Passport Agency undertaking a greater degree of Public Relations work in areas such as market research and media. We do not have historical information to provide any other valid comparisons for the increase.

 <i>[holding answer 11 July 2002]:</i> The development of an assessment process for those who are dangerous as a result of a severe personality disorder is innovative and groundbreaking work.
<P>

<a name="20723w49.html_para12">We are currently piloting assessments at Whitemoor prison and Rampton hospital and using their experience, along with the latest research evidence, to develop a framework for assessment in which clinicians, tribunals and the courts can have confidence. This is fundamental to ensuring that people are referred appropriately to services and that any new legislative powers are applied properly.
<P>

<a name="20723w49.html_para13">The target to complete 180 assessments was agreed early in the life of the pilots, following which a number of refinements were made, the most significant being to extend the assessment process from 12 to 16 weeks. In addition the Whitemoor pilot has had significant difficulties in recruiting suitably qualified clinical staff and had to be temporarily suspended to allow for some refurbishment work in preparation for the treatment unit there. While these factors have inevitably had an effect on throughput, the 94 assessments completed during the period have proved invaluable in informing the development of a high quality assessment process, and provide a sound basis for further work.

 <i>[holding answer 11 July 2002]:</i> Results from the 1998 and 2000 British Crime Surveys estimate that 29 per cent. of adults aged between 16 and 24 reported to have used an illegal drug in the previous year.
<P>

<a name="20723w50.html_para0">Results from the 2001 survey of drug use, smoking and drinking among school children aged 11 to 15 years in England (published in a statistical press notice by Department of Health on 15 March 2002) show that 42 per cent. have been offered at least one or more drugs and that 20 per cent. reported the use of an illegal drug in the previous year.
<P>

<a name="20723w50.html_para1">A revised method of measuring the prevalence of drug use was introduced in 2001. The format of the questions was changed as was the wording of the questions, after research showed that pupils found the previous survey difficult to answer. It is likely that the increase in levels of reported drug use is due to this change in question

format rather than a real change in behaviour. Because of this revised methodology the 2001 estimates on drug use are not strictly comparable with results from previous sweeps.
<P>

<a name="20723w50.html_para2">The estimates from previous years for those who reported ever having been offered at least one or more drug are 34 per cent. in 1998, 35 per cent. in 1999, and 35 per cent in 2000.
<P>

<a name="20723w50.html_para3">The estimates from previous years for those reporting use of an illegal drug in the previous year are 11 per cent. in 1998, 12 per cent. in 1999 and 14 per cent. in 2000.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what payments have been made for projects under the Recovered Assets Fund, broken down by region.  [69337]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w50.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Confiscated Assets Fund (CAF) was the forerunner of the Recovered Assets Fund (RAF) and provided funding for anti-drug projects. In 1999&#150;2000 it approved national projects totalling &#163;764,300. In 2000&#150;2001 its national projects totalled &#163;6,841,000 plus one in Wales for &#163;262,000. Finally, in 2001&#150;2002 it approved national project funding of &#163;5,624,143 plus &#163;2,500 in the south west, &#163;879,600 in the midlands and &#163;625,500 in London and the south east.
<P>

<P>

<a name="20723w50.html_para11">I am placing in the Library a paper explaining the respective roles of lead Government Departments and the Civil Contingencies Secretariat and a table summarising which Departments will have the lead for different categories of emergency.

<P>

<a name="20723w50.html_para13">Arrangements are also being made for this material to be made available to the local authority and emergency services associations and to be placed on the internet at www.ukresilience.info that will be updated whenever necessary and should be consulted for the latest information on pre-designated lead Departments.

The female estate does not have any dedicated units specifically for vulnerable prisoners as they are managed within the general female population. There are some beds reserved for women who are vulnerable from the nature of their offence but these are only in very small numbers and not in designated units.

<a name="20723w54.html_para3">The advice of the JCVI sub-group was that there was no difference between the two strains on scientific grounds. Vaccines based on both strains were considered to have been effective in the past. However, the JCVI sub-group concluded that there was a greater body of evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of the Lister strain rather than for the New York City Board of Health strain, and that the smallpox vaccine has been challenged in the field more often by the more severe form of smallpox (variola major) with the strain chosen by the United Kingdom Government. The JCVI sub-group also recommended that using a different strain of vaccine from that used in the United States offered the greatest safeguard if difficulties arose with the production of either strain, ensuring that the alternative strain could act as a fallback.

 The administration of medication within care homes is a major responsibility and should not be undertaken lightly, since inappropriate administration could result in harm or, in some instances, the death of a service user. In this respect care home providers, therefore, must ensure that any staff who are charged with the responsibility to administer medication must fully understand the seriousness of this task, are trained in safe practices, and also have some awareness of the side effects of drugs on service users. The Commission is currently considering what forms of accredited training would be acceptable, but in the first instance, would suggest that training supplied by local pharmacists and community nurses would be acceptable.

 The National Care Standards Commission takes 'regular contact with residents' to mean where a member of staff employed by the care home routinely interacts with residents on a one-to-one basis as part of their employment. This interaction may be restricted to talking to residents, but generally the commission will take it to mean where an individual is

<P>

<a name="20723w55.html_para0">The staff having regular contact with residents will also vary from home to home. A range of internal and external people are likely to have regular contact with residents.

<P>
<a name="20723w55.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The care homes regulations and the national standards are related but they are not the same. There are, therefore, differences in the language and level of detail they contain. The regulations set out in general terms mandatory requirements with which care homes must comply. The national standards are an assessment tool which the commission must take into account when it makes a decision about whether a care home conforms to the regulations. However, the commission may also take into account any other factors it considers reasonable or relevant to do so. The regulations do not, therefore, specifically refer to business and financial plans.
<P>

<a name="20723w55.html_para1">The regulations and standards do not specify what must be contained in a care home's business and financial plans. In deciding whether a care home's business and financial plans conform to the requirements, the commission will need to satisfy itself that they contain sufficient information to ensure that service users are safeguarded by the accounting and financial procedures of the home.

 The process of formal monitoring of suspensions lasting over six months began in March 1995, six months after the issue of HSG(94)49, the current guidance on suspension of hospital and community medical and dental staff.
<P>

<a name="20723w55.html_para3">As a result of an undertaking to the Public Accounts Committee in April 1995, the Department monitors formal suspensions lasting over six months on a quarterly basis.

 Under the national health service contract, digital hearing aids had been available at a cost of between &#163;140 and &#163;205 each, for moderately powered aids. The contracts and prices have been renegotiated by a team set-up by Ministers and led by James Strachan, Chief Executive of Royal National Institute for the Deaf, which includes representatives from the Department and the Purchasing and Supply Agency (PASA), and allows moderate powered digital aids to be purchased at &#163;65 to &#163;75 each plus value added tax (VAT).

 The Government's plans for increasing the size of the national health service work force were set out in the NHS Plan and our manifesto before the last election. Both targets for increasing nurse numbers have been met ahead of schedule. Our latest projection for 2008 is 35,000 more nurses than there were in 2001. This has not been broken down by strategic health authority (StHA).

To date, there has been an increase of 483 GPs and 3,130 consultants. The target has been broken down by StHA level. Cheshire and Merseyside Strategic Health Authority have an envelope of 141 more GPs and 377 more consultants by 2004.

Friend to the answer I gave him on 24 April 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 351W, regarding current mental health promotion and early intervention services for children and adolescents. Additionally, under the NHS Plan, 50 early intervention services will be established over the next three years to reduce treatment delay in psychosis. All young people who experience a first episode of psychosis such as schizophrenia will receive the early and intensive support they need. This is expected to benefit 7,500 young people in the 14&#150;35 age range each year. The early detection of the onset of mental illness is also an issue we expect to consider in the child and adolescent mental health services strand of the children's national service framework on which work is currently progressing.

<P>
<a name="20723w57.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Laws: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what his estimate is of the level of public confidence in the Government's arrangements for food safety measured by public opinion surveys in each year since 1997&#150;98; and if he will make a statement.  [69086]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w57.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 July 2002]:</i> The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has had responsibility for food safety since its establishment in April 2000. Levels of public confidence have been measured quantitatively rather than estimated as part of the annual "Consumer Attitudes to Food Standards", published in January 2001 and February 2002. In the most recent survey, 71 per cent. of consumers are aware of the FSA and, among them, levels of trust are high approximately 80 per cent. When asked how confident they were about the role played by the FSA in protecting health with regard to food safety, only 13 per cent. of consumers stated that they were not confident. Both surveys were widely reported by national media and are freely available on the Agency's website. The next annual survey will be published in early 2003. There were no similar surveys or estimates of public confidence by the Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, now the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, before 2000.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w57.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 July 2002]:</i> The Department does not collect figures on the cost of national health service services in a way that enables an accurate figure to be calculated for the cost of treatment or research for individual cancers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will undertake research into the reasons underlying the increase in the number of children being looked after in residential placements in the south west since 1997.  [70356]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w57.html_spnew10"><B> Jacqui Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 July 2002]:</i> The most recently published figures for children looked after by local authorities at 31 March 2001 show that, over the past three years, while the overall number of children looked after by local authorities in the south west region has risen slightly, the relative proportion of children in residential placements has declined from 9 per cent. to 8 per cent. There is no evidence that south western local authorities have increased their use of placements in residential care.

<P>
<a name="20723w58.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Oaten: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the estimated cost to the NHS is of compliance with new junior doctors' hours regulations.  [71563]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20723w58.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2002]:</i> The junior doctors' hours regulations are those incorporated into the new contract for junior doctors which requires Pre- Registration House Officers to be contracted for no more than 56 hours from August 2001, with senior house officers and specialist registrars following suit in August 2003.
<P>

<a name="20723w58.html_para0">The estimated cost of implementing the new contract from January 2001 to December 2003 is in the region of &#163;210 million on a total junior doctors' pay bill of some &#163;1.3 billion per annum. However, detailed information on doctors' pay is not held centrally. The driving principle underlying the new contract was to create financial disincentives through the pay bill if trusts continued to employ doctors in non-compliant posts. The effect of these cost pressures on trusts has been to bring overall non-compliance down from 44 per cent. in March 2001 to 32 per cent. in March 2002, with consequent potential long-term reductions in the junior doctor pay bill.
