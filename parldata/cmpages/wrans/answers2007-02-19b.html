 We have no plans to set national targets for the diagnosis of individuals infected with hepatitis C. In the &#145;Hepatitis C Action Plan for England&#146;, there are two national outcome indicators, drawn from epidemiological surveillance by the Health Protection Agency (HPA), intended to track increased testing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"><a name="70219w0009.htm_para0"><a name="07021932000624">The first indicator is the total number of laboratory confirmed hepatitis C infection reports. There has been a significant increase in hepatitis C diagnoses in England reported to the HPA through national surveillance from around 4,700 in 2001 before initial hepatitis C awareness-raising activities begun, to around 7,600 in 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"><a name="70219w0009.htm_para1"><a name="07021932000625">The second indicator is the proportion of those attending treatment and support agencies for injecting drug users who are aware of their hepatitis C infection. This proportion has increased from 41 per cent. in 2001 to 52 per cent. in 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"><a name="70219w0009.htm_para2"><a name="07021932000626">Other surveillance sources also indicate that hepatitis C testing and diagnosis is increasing. For example, in the unlinked anonymous prevalence monitoring programme, the proportion of injecting drug users attending specialist services who self-report a previous hepatitis C test has increased from 55 per cent. in 2001 to 71 per cent. in 2005. Sentinel surveillance of hepatitis C testing in nine laboratories from 2002-2005 indicates that overall the number of individuals tested for hepatitis C increased by nearly 40 per cent. Testing by general practitioners and in genito-urinary medicine services both increased by over 50 per cent. and in prisons by around 65 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="70219w0009.htm_para3"><a name="07021932000629">There is some indication from comparison of the number of hepatitis C diagnoses reported through sentinel surveillance in certain parts of the country against those reported to national surveillance that there may be significant under-reporting by laboratories. The HPA's view is that it may be possible that under-reporting of hepatitis C diagnoses to routine surveillance could be significant. This could mean that approximately 100,000 people in England might already have been diagnosed.</p>

 There are two suppliers of diamorphine injection to the national health service&#151;Novartis and Wockhardt UK. Both companies are manufacturing to their full available capacity but they are unable to produce sufficient to meet historic levels of demand. We have been in close and ongoing discussions with the suppliers to increase the levels of the drug supplied to the NHS and believe that through careful prescribing and use of available stocks patient care is not being compromised. This is in part because we arranged for the increased production and availability of other alternative drugs such as morphine when the problem arose in December 2004.</p>

 In October 2003, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence published guidance on antenatal care.

For women at a low risk of complications, a schedule of seven to 10 appointments should be appropriate. For those women who have particular needs and those have difficulty in accessing services, such as the socially excluded, additional antenatal appointments will be necessary. This will in turn improve the outcomes for both the woman and child.</p>

 These hospitals fall under the jurisdiction of the part of the national health service in which they are based.

The Government consider that decision-making on individual clinical interventions, whether conventional, or complementary/alternative treatments, have to be a matter for local NHS service providers and practitioners as they are best placed to know their community's needs. In making such decisions, they have to take into account evidence for the safety, clinical and cost-effectiveness of any treatments, the availability of suitably qualified practitioners, and the needs of the individual patient.</p>

 An interim review of the microfinance sector was carried out between June and August of 2006. The review was commissioned by the Government of Afghanistan, microfinance donors, and the Microfinance Investment Support Facility for Afghanistan (MISFA) management to assess the current status of the Afghan microfinance sector and MISFA&#146;s role in developing it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="70219w0014.htm_para0"><a name="07021932001106">The review found that the Afghanistan Government&#146;s MISFA has made significant progress in helping Afghans to invest in income generating activities. Rapidly increasing the number of people receiving loans over a short period has been successful in helping to build the microfinance sector. Nearly 75 per cent. of those receiving loans are women. So far, over &#163;83 million worth of small loans have been given to 234,000 families, shopkeepers, tailors, farmers, builders and others to invest and increase their savings. The review suggested that with continued support and an enabling environment, there is potential for many microfinance institutions (MFIs) to become financially sustainable over the next three years. To date, the role of the MISFA to support the sector has been successful, and justifies a clear need for its continuation to channel funds to the MFIs to improve their capacity, outreach and sustainability. The MISFA&#146;s design and implementation can serve as a good example for building microfinance sector in conflict affected countries.</p>

The majority of the 9.7 million people considered &#147;economically inactive&#148; (ie above 15 years but neither working nor actively seeking work) were women, who are significantly less likely to engage in paid employment than men (this is common to the region). In addition, young men constitute 15 per cent. of the economically inactive. The majority of young economically inactive men (68 per cent.) say they are studying and thus not available to work. 20 per cent. claim to be &#147;discouraged workers&#148; (ie believe that there are no jobs available and have therefore given up looking for work).</p>

 The Emergency Public Administration Programme (EPAP) ended in July 2005 and its impact was assessed in September 2005. DFID judged that it fulfilled its initial objective: to help the Iraq Government set up key institutions at the centre of government. These included the Prime Minister's Office, the Council of Ministers Secretariat, and the Government Communications Directorate. The team of technical experts advised the Iraqi government on institutional structures and staff roles and responsibilities. They also provided targeted training to help key staff manage the machinery at the heart of government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="70219w0015.htm_para1"><a name="07021932001156">At the same time, the programme also provided vital economic policy advice to the Ministry of Finance during a period when the international financial institutions had no formal presence in Baghdad. This focused on preparing the budget and also provided the Government of Iraq with technical advice to help then negotiate an Emergency Post-Conflict Arrangement (EPCA) with the International Monetary Fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="70219w0015.htm_para2"><a name="07021932001157">In late 2005, we launched a follow-on programme to provide training and advice to the three central Government institutions. Our 2006 assessment of the support to the centre of government project showed that despite changes in Government personnel, the project has met its objectives. The organisational structures set up under the Iraqi interim Government were successfully built upon when Prime Minister Maliki took office in May 2006. In an environment beset by political and security challenges, efforts to build institutional capacity take time; now staff are more effectively trained and able to develop policy. We expect to continue our support to these institutions during the course of 2007, to consolidate the gains made in public sector management practices at the heart of government.</p>

 The Government's responses to the reports were placed in the Libraries of both Houses and can also be found on the Home Office website. The response sets out in some detail the steps which are being taken to maintain and improve, where necessary, the quality of decision making by officials scrutinising claims for asylum. The relevant time target for the period 2002 to 2006 was to ensure that by 2004 75 per cent. of substantive asylum applications were decided within two months; and that 75 per cent., including final appeal, are decided within six months. Under the new asylum processes, with effect from April 2007 the target is for 35 per cent. of new asylum applications to be concluded within six months, rising annually to 90 per cent. by 2011. These targets are set on the basis of the Government's assessment of the quality of service which can reasonably be expected in the light of the resources available.</p>

 The factors to be taken into account when deciding the timing of a family detention visit are whether it is the best time of day to pick up the whole family as an entire unit, the sensitivity of the immigration visit, whether there may be community or other local difficulties, and whether the purpose of the visit would be frustrated if carried out at a different time. Chapters 46 and 47 of the Operational Enforcement Manual (OEM), available on the IND website, set out the levels of authority of enforcement visits, including when Ministers are advised of forthcoming operations.</p>

 Malawian asylum seekers will be returned to Malawi only where the decision making and independent appeals system have found that this would be consistent with our obligations under the Refugee Convention and ECHR. Where an individual is not a national of Malawi but is entitled to reside there we would take into account any likelihood of their being onwardly removed to another country. The nationality or entitlement of an applicant to reside in a country is determined by looking at and weighing up all of the available documentary and oral evidence. Where a person holds a genuine Malawian passport or other identity document issued by the Malawian authorities, that would normally be enough to show that the holder is entitled to reside in Malawi.</p>

 We are discussing with the Association of Chief Police Officers whether a national firearms amnesty should be held later this year. The last national amnesty in 2003 resulted in the surrender of 44,000 firearms and over a million rounds of ammunition. Taking such potentially lethal items off the streets contributes to community safety but an amnesty is just one aspect of the wider overall strategy. This includes enhancing already tough legislation through the Violent Crime Reduction Act, supporting community activity through the Connected Fund and other project funding, and working with the Association of Chief Police Officers Criminal Use of Firearms Group on a range of issues focusing on prevention, intelligence and enforcement.</p>

 It is not possible for the Identity and Passport Service (IPS) to identify how many passports were reportedly lost or stolen in Northern Ireland in the last 15 years. The IPS can provide information on passports replaced since 24 September 2001 when the current passport issuing system was introduced in the Belfast passport office which serves the Northern Ireland area. Improved arrangements for the reporting of lost and stolen passports came into effect in December 2003, and IPS can also provide information on reports of lost and stolen passports, for the calendar years of 2004, 2005 and 2006. These figures are set out as follows.</p>

 The Crime Fighting Fund, introduced in April 2000, provided specific grant for police forces to recruit 9,650 additional police officers over and  above their own recruitment plans in the four years to March 2004. There was a target for police numbers to reach 132,500 by March 2004.</p>

 Only adult male sentenced prisoners are allocated a category of A, B, C or D. Categorisation takes into account a number of factors, one of which is security.

<i> [holding answer 9 February 2007]:</i> Penalty Notices for Disorder (PND) provide the police with a swift non-bureaucratic disposal option to deal with minor offences. They are fixed penalty. There is no means test as part of the process of issuing PNDs and it would be impractical and overly bureaucratic to seek means information before issuing a ticket. Payment must be made in full; the current PND computer processing system precludes payment by instalments. If the recipient does not pay the penalty or request a court hearing, a fine at one and a half times the penalty amount is registered against the recipient and enforced in the same way as any other fine. However, operational guidance to the police advises officers that PNDs may not be appropriate for a suspect who appears to be destitute.</p>

 The Home Office commissioned the pilot use of polygraph (lie detection) testing of sex offenders in 10 Probation Areas. The pilot lasted for two years, between September 2003 and September 2005; 347 offenders volunteered for testing, 33 per cent. of whom (116) were tested on two or more occasions. In total, 483 polygraph examinations were carried out. The majority of offenders tested had been convicted of offences against children: 166 (48 per cent.) of contact offences against children, 111 (32 per cent.) of internet related offences, with 70 (20 per cent.) for offences classified as other sex offences. Rapists were not separately classified but were among this 20 per cent. of the sample. The main aim of the study was to assist Offender Managers in risk assessment and risk management based on new disclosures made by offenders during the examination. Overall new disclosures relevant to treatment or supervision were made in 70 per cent. of tests. However, the report does not provide information on differences between offence types and, as the sample was of volunteers, no firm conclusions may be drawn from it as to whether the disclosures are attributable to the polygraph tests. The full report is available from the website of the National Probation Service.</p>

Where an offender is cautioned or convicted for an offence under schedule 5, and the police and courts believe the motive to be sexual, they can make that person subject to a Sexual Offence Prevention Order and consequently to notification requirements.

<i> Notes:</i><br>
 1. It is known that for some police force areas, the reporting of court proceedings in particular those relating to summary motoring offences, may be less than complete. Work is underway to ensure that the magistrates courts case management system currently being implemented by the Department for Constitutional Affairs reports all motoring offences to the Office for Criminal Justice Reform. This will enable more complete figures to be disseminated.<br>
2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their limitations are taken into account when these data are used.<br>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. It is known that for some police force areas, the reporting of court proceedings in particular those relating to summary motoring offences, may be less than complete. Work is under way to ensure that the magistrates courts case management system currently being implemented by the Department for Constitutional Affairs reports all motoring offences to the Office for Criminal Justice Reform. This will enable more complete figures to be disseminated.<br>
2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their limitations are taken into account when these data are used.<br>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. It is known that for some police force areas, the reporting of court proceedings in particular those relating to summary motoring offences, may be less than complete. Work is under way to ensure that the magistrates courts case management system currently being implemented by the Department for Constitutional Affairs reports all motoring offences to the Office for Criminal Justice Reform. This will enable more complete figures to be disseminated.<br>
2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces.<br>

 The Government are committed to the elimination of trafficking and child labour in all countries and for all purposes&#151;including the possible role of trafficked children in harvesting cocoa beans. Through our links with PROBA (EU Working Party on Commodities), we encourage the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO) work on improving long-term and sustainable economies in cocoa-producing countries. This includes strengthening institutional capacity to address forced labour and the worst forms of child labour. It is critical that the underlying poverty that is at the root of trafficking and child labour is tackled. Stopping child labour without ensuring alternative income for the family or appropriate, good quality education opportunities for the children is likely to be ineffective and may drive children into more hidden and harmful jobs.</p>

 Higher Level Stewardship (HLS) is open to all farmers in England. HLS is a competitive scheme which aims to deliver significant environmental outcomes in high priority situations and areas. The key characteristics of the different parts of the English countryside have been outlined in over 150 Joint Character Areas. Each area has priority targets for the management of a variety of features and HLS applications are scored directly against these targets. Those applications which meet or exceed a pre-determined regional threshold may be offered an agreement. It therefore follows that applications which address the relevant priority targets for their area have the greatest likelihood of approval.</p>

 DEFRA has overall policy responsibility for flood risk management in England, funds most of the Environment Agency (EA)&#146;s flood related work and grant aids individual capital improvement projects undertaken by local authorities and internal drainage boards.

 Currently, we have no plans to base the parental contribution for continuity of education allowance on the salaries of service personnel. I should also point out the contribution is not based on a service person's earnings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_465"><a name="70219w0040.htm_para15"><a name="0702205000551">We recognise that service parents may find it difficult to maintain the continuity of their children's education, due to the nature of their employment and the unique demands of military life. It is for this reason that there are various educational allowances available to eligible service personnel to help meet some of the costs of ensuring continuity of their children&#146;s education. Continuity of education for their children would not otherwise be possible in the state maintained day school sector if these children accompanied their parents to postings in both the UK and overseas. However, the Ministry of Defence does not reimburse the full cost of school fees and parents are required to pay a minimum 10 per cent. parental contribution for each child when they claim a service education allowance. Also, when assessing each claim, any grant or scholarship made by the school, official benefactors, local education authorities or other public bodies, and any discounts offered to the service parent by the school, is deducted from the fees before the 10 per cent. minimum parental contribution is calculated. It is a matter for the service parent to decide which state or private sector boarding school they wish their children to attend. In doing so, service parents will consider the full cost of their child's education, a significant part of which will be schools fees, for which all parents must pay a minimum 10 per cent.</p>

The integration of an Infantry Battalion into a strong coalition amphibious structure that includes the US Marine Corps and the Royal Netherland Marine Corps units will have wider Defence benefits. In addition, the co-operation and co-ordination of effort between the Army and Navy will bring benefits in terms of resource and information sharing in the training and education of soldiers and single service tactics, techniques and procedures.

 When service personnel return from operations they receive post operational leave (one working day for every nine calendar days deployed), which enables them to spend quality time with their families and friends, to assist in the process of adjustment. All service personnel and their families have access to significant single service welfare resources, which are permanently available to assist them with any difficulties they may encounter following the return of the serviceman or woman. This can be accessed through unit welfare and community support staff. Service personnel and their families also have access to independent Confidential Support Line provided by the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association (SSAFA) Forces Help.

<p><a name="stpa_541"><a name="70219w0048.htm_para10"><a name="07022015001934">The index will be populated from existing national and local data sources. Data sources are yet to be confirmed but officials are in discussions with a number of national organisations. Draft regulations set out those organisations and bodies whom we expect to be required and those whom we expect to be permitted to supply information to the index. Wherever it is possible, securing data from existing practitioner systems will avoid the need for double data entry on the part of practitioners. Where direct data feeds are not possible, practitioners may be required to enter the information directly into the index via a web browser or indirectly via an authorised index user.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_542"><a name="70219w0048.htm_para11"><a name="07022015001935">We see now the need to introduce penalties relating specifically to the index. There are already measures in criminal law which impose penalties for theft or misuse of data or unauthorised access to computer records. Mandatory training for all users and operators of the index will stipulate that section 55 of the Data Protection Act 1998 makes it an offence to unlawfully obtain or disclose personal data without the consent of the data controller. The DCA are considering increasing the penalty for those who misuse personal data from a fine to imprisonment for up to two years. The Computer Misuse Act 1990 provides that unauthorised access, or attempted unauthorised access, to a program or data held on a computer may be punishable by imprisonment.</p>

Access will be granted according to the role of the practitioner. For example, in a school a small number of named designated staff, such as teachers of children with special educational needs or those with pastoral or child protection responsibilities will have access. Before being granted access to the index, all practitioners will have undergone an enhanced Criminal Records Bureau check, any other relevant checks and relevant training in the safe and secure use of the index.</p>

The college currently receives core funding through recurrent grant of over &#163;4.1 million a year. On Objective One funding, it is unlikely that any substantive Darlington college project could be funded from the current Objective One programme as this funding is close to being already fully allocated.

 Our guidance for local authorities on planning and delivering Sure Start Children&#146;s Centres makes it clear that the most intensive support should be available for the most disadvantaged families. For the period 2006-08 we allocated funding to local authorities based on numbers of children under five and levels of deprivation. Local authorities have responsibility for allocating that funding to children&#146;s centres in their area; securing value for money; and ensuring the overall quality of services in children&#146;s centres. We have appointed the &#147;Together for Children&#148; consortium who will support and challenge local authorities to plan a suitable range of services at each centre. The Government are undertaking a comprehensive spending review and decisions on funding for Sure Start Children&#146;s Centres beyond March 2008 will be taken in that context.</p>

It is designed to reform the supply of skills; to ensure we deliver economically valuable qualifications and skills which will enhance the UK&#146;s productivity and to raise demand for skills from employers and individuals. We have made good progress towards our skills PSA targets. Since the end of 2001, over 1.4 million learners have achieved first &#147;Skills for Life&#148; qualifications and there are 1.6 million more adults in the work force with level 2 or higher qualifications. The number of apprenticeships has risen from 76,000 in 1997 to 256,000 in 2006. Lord Leitch&#146;s final report &#147;Prosperity for all in the global economy&#151;world class skills&#148; (December 2006) gave a clear analysis of the future skills needs of the UK.

In order to bring consistency and an agreed set of standards to RE syllabuses, the Secretary of State launched the non-statutory National Framework for Religious Education in 2004. The Framework was agreed by all the major religious communities and professional RE associations. The standards set out in the Framework are currently informing the reviews of local agreed syllabuses around the country and the shaping of RE programmes in faith schools.

 Sunderland is one of 10 local authorities who have volunteered and been accepted for piloting the youth opportunity card. The pilot authorities are making an invaluable contribution to the detailed design of the delivery arrangements for the card. In particular they have each seconded a member of staff to work part-time with the youth opportunity card team in my Department. A project of this nature is complex as well as ambitious and it is important that we get it right. There are important aspects to the project that we are still working through.

 DFID's unearmarked &#163;50 million support, along with the resources of other contributing donors, are managed by the World Bank in a pooled trust fund which reimburses Government for any expenditures that meet certain eligibility criteria. This puts the government of Afghanistan in the lead, in setting and implementing its development priorities.

Of these resources, 69 per cent. of expenditures were spent on salaries (predominantly for teachers), 6 per cent. on pensions and the remaining 25 per cent. on operations and maintenance costs (e.g. fuel and electricity for Ministries). Split by Ministry, the largest share (39 per cent.) went to the Ministry of Education. The Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Public Health, Labour and Social Affairs, Higher Education and Martyrs and Disabled all received approximately 5 per cent. each with other Ministries also receiving smaller sums.</p>

We have also issued guidance on methods of keeping domestic birds separate from wild birds, if housing is not practical, by feeding and watering domestic birds under cover where possible. Bird feed and any standing water should be kept free from contamination by wild birds and other animals. Poultry owners should make sure that hands, clothes and footwear are clean before and after contact with birds. Owners need to be vigilant and monitor their birds frequently.</p>

 The most recent objective report by the Central Science Laboratory, &#147;Rodent infestations in domestic properties in England 2001&#148;, was published in July 2005. The report was compiled from data collected during the 2001 English House Condition Survey (EHCS) and included comparisons with data from 1996. The report concluded that the rates for both mice and rats inside dwellings were similar for 1996 and 2001, while the rate for rats outside dwellings was higher in 2001.</p>

These include charges by local authorities for pest control, treatment of local sewerage systems, overfeeding birds and an increase in fast-food related litter and fly-tipping.</p>

 Information on the number of prisoners serving sentences for violent offences released on the Home Detention Curfew release scheme (HDC) can be found in Table 10.19 in the Offender Management Caseload Statistics 2005 which can be found at the following website:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_703"><a name="70219w0063.htm_para10"><a name="0702212000448">As noted in the footnote to table 10.19, investigations suggest that around 5 per cent. of offence types recorded on this system do not relate to the offence they were released on HDC for, but relate to offences committed after release from prison and before the licence expiry date for their sentence. Our inquiries have shown that this is the case with the two offenders classified as sexual offenders in table 10.19.</p>

Figures for the regions and countries are presented using a three-year moving average, as single-year estimates do not provide a robust guide to year-on-year changes. Hence, figures are not consistent with any previously published single-year estimates and there may be differences in changes over time. In circumstances such as a change in trend, moving averages will show less variation than single-year estimates.<br>

Benefits with small amounts of expenditure are not included.  7. From the early 1990s, family credit was paid to qualifying families who worked full time, that is at least 16 hours each week.  8. Family credit was replaced by working families' tax credit in October 1999.  <i> Source:</i>  Figures are based on DWP accounting data combined with statistical data to identify the proportion of expenditure paid to single parents.<br>

 We are not able to collect definitive data on total scheme membership until schemes submit data on individual members on completion of wind-up.

 This is based on projections using the Department&#146;s Pensim2 dynamic microsimulation model. It represents an estimate, after taking account of the proposed reforms to state pension provision, of the proportion of pensioner households in 2050 who might face an initial 100 per cent. reduction in pension credit entitlement in respect of an increase in private pension income. Of these, around three-quarters will be in receipt of premia taking them above the standard guarantee level for example because they are severely disabled or are carers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_773"><a name="70219w0072.htm_para10"><a name="0702212001971">In practice, very few pensioners who face a 100 per cent. withdrawal rate at some point will do so over the whole of their retirement; by 2050 just 2 per cent. pensioners will receive the guarantee credit only when they first reach state pension age. Even then, we would expect many to be able to reduce the interaction between additional private saving and benefit entitlement by taking some or all of their private pension income as a lump sum. &#145;Less than 10 per cent. of pensioner households&#146; can therefore be considered a cautious estimate.</p>

 A study is currently being undertaken by my officials into the practicability and costs of introducing vehicle restraint measures at railway stations. This follows vehicle access barriers being placed temporarily at two London stations, Waterloo and Victoria in June 2006, as part of a series of railway security measures. The current study is in collaboration with both Network Rail and London Underground who are conducting detailed engineering surveys of certain major railway stations. The results of the first three detailed surveys should be available in April 2007.</p>

 The Colombians have advised our embassy in Bogota of the current stage of the judicial process each time the embassy sought information on developments in the case against Mr. Morales and  Ms Castro. These regular updates did not include specific details of the case itself. Rather, our embassy has consistently sought assurances from the Colombian Government that the human rights of the detainees were being fully observed. It has not questioned the safety of the convictions nor the nature of the offence. While we have concerns over the human rights situation in Colombia, and engage regularly with the Colombian Government over specific cases, we have neither the locus nor the resources to monitor and evaluate every legal and technical aspect of each case.</p>

 We are well advanced in our preparations for the Gender Equality Duty.

We see all diversity strands&#151;including gender&#151;as of equal importance and in line with many employers we have produced one scheme to underline that message. Our Diversity Equality Scheme has provided us with a framework to ensure that the FCO meets its statutory duties and promotes inclusive management practice so that all staff of whatever background are encouraged to fulfil their potential.</p>

 The Department invited mental health trusts to submit bids for a share of the &#163;130 million capital funding pot through their strategic health authorities (SHAs). The bids were assessed by a group comprising Department officials, service users, commissioners and clinical services representatives, following criteria which were outlined in a letter sent to SHA and mental health trust chief executives on 2 March 2006, &#147;Capital allocation process: &#163;130 million for adult mental health services&#148;. A copy has been placed in the Library.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_904"><a name="70219w0083.htm_para1"><a name="07022131000433">The Department considered bids in the following order of priority: for Section 136 health-based place of safety developments; for improvements in the psychiatric intensive care unit (PICU) estate; and, for acute mental health ward improvements.</p>

Approximately &#163;42 million has been allocated in 2006-07, and approximately &#163;52 million is provisionally identified for allocation in 2007-08. Identifying the exact allocations made to places of safety or PICUs is not possible because some of the successful bids combine development of PICUs and places of safety as single bids, not as separate projects. Similarly timescales for project development varies as some projects involve new build and other relatively small refurbishment works.</p>

 The independent investigations commissioned and published by local health authorities, and latterly strategic health authorities, are primarily established to examine the care and treatment provided by local services to an individual or individuals. As such, the recommendations that they produce are in general aimed at local service delivery improvements and a local action plan is developed to address the issues identified. Therefore, the Department does not routinely expect to receive copies of these reports. However, it is clear that there may be lessons to be learnt nationally  <br>

This is why the Department, and latterly the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA), commissions the centre for suicide prevention at the University of Manchester to produce the national confidential inquiry into suicide and homicide by people with mental illness (NCISH).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_908"><a name="70219w0083.htm_para5"><a name="07022131000440">NCISH covers data on all suicides and homicides committed by someone in touch with mental health services and all sudden, unexplained deaths in psychiatric units. A wide number of aspects of these cases are analysed and recommendations for policy and practice improvement made. In addition, NCISH receives copies of independent investigation reports and undertakes a regular review of them. The NPSA has commissioned NCISH to conduct a review of recent cases which will be completed in March this year, with an initial report available in late 2007 or early 2008.</p>

The list, which is available in the Library, has been compiled on a best endeavours basis and is as complete as possible but it is likely that there have been other reports published that are not included.</p>

This will be through Building Schools for the Future, the Academy programme or the BSF One School Pathfinder programme. Over &#163;1 billion has been allocated to the 38 authorities within the one school pathfinder element of the BSF programme. The following authorities have been allocated funding to rebuild one of its schools with the highest level of building need: Barnet, Bath and North East Somerset, Bexley, Bracknell Forest, Bromley, Buckinghamshire, Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, East Sussex, Gloucestershire, Harrow, Herefordshire, Isle of Wight, Kingston upon Thames, Leicestershire, North Somerset, North Yorkshire, Plymouth, Redbridge, Richmond upon Thames, Rutland, Sefton, Shropshire, South Gloucestershire, Southend on Sea, Sutton, Torbay, Trafford, Warrington, West Berkshire, West Sussex, Wigan, Wiltshire, Windsor and Maidenhead, Wirral, Wokingham, York.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_923"><a name="70219w0084.htm_para9"><a name="07022131000635">Primary schools are not covered by Building Schools for the Future. However we are taking a similarly transformational approach to capital investment for the primary sector. Funding for the pathfinder phase of the Primary Capital programme will commence in 2008-09 with &#163;150 million of additional funding being shared among 23 regional pathfinders. The programme will be rolled out nationally from 2009-10 underpinned by &#163;500 million of additional investment. Subject to future government spending decisions, we anticipate that the additional investment will continue at that level for at least 15 years.</p>

 There has been ongoing consideration of the status of personal, social and health education (PSHE) since the introduction of the National Curriculum. In considering the statutory position of PSHE, we have taken a number of factors into account. Firstly, many aspects of PSHE (sex education, drug education and careers education) already have a statutory basis. Secondly, further statutory requirements would run counter to the overall aim of current curriculum reform to give schools greater flexibilities to plan and deliver the school curriculum. Thirdly, legislation would not necessarily lead to improvements in teaching and learning in PSHE.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_928"><a name="70219w0085.htm_para2"><a name="07022131000710">The Department's priority for PSHE is to improve the effectiveness of what is taught by providing clear guidance, supporting high quality continuing professional development for teachers, identifying and disseminating good practice, and helping schools to meet the standards for PSHE required by the National Healthy Schools Programme. We are also supporting the new PSHE Subject Association which will provide advice, guidance and support to those delivering PSHE.</p>

 The Framework for Excellence (FfE) is still in its development phase. The Learning and Skills Council (LSC), partnered by the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted), the Quality Improvement Agency (QIA) and the Department for Education and Skills are working closely with the FE sector to develop the framework. Through consultation, piloting, testing and trialling they will continue to explore a range of options to help decide the best and most appropriate measures to assess quality of outcomes&#151;including those for non-accredited learning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_946"><a name="70219w0086.htm_para7"><a name="07022131000767">One of the underpinning principles of the framework is that it will use &#147;absolute&#148; rather than &#147;relative&#148; success measures. This means that all providers can aspire to, and achieve, an excellent standard measured against set criteria rather than achieving excellence relative to others. So it will be theoretically possible for all LSC-funded providers to achieve excellence under the framework.</p>

 The Department has not made such an assessment. The Key Stage 3 programme of study for modern foreign languages does not prescribe the amount of time which should be given to individual language skills. It is for schools to choose how they organise their curriculum to include the programme of study for modern foreign languages. However, the current programme of study does set out the attainment targets for the knowledge, skills and understanding that pupils of different abilities and maturities are expected to reach by the end of Key Stage 3 for each skill. The programme of study also sets out statutory modifications to the level descriptors for &#145;listening and responding&#146;, &#145;reading and responding&#146;, and &#145;writing&#146; for pupils studying Mandarin and Cantonese.</p>

 Since 2001, English for Speakers of Other Languages has been delivered to adults as part of the Skills for Life Strategy. In that period, demand and funding for ESOL has tripled. We will continue to deliver ESOL as a significant strand of the Skills for Life strategy in the future.</p>

As a result of that process, we are considering what additional support may be included in family literacy, language and numeracy provision to meet the language needs of families and in particular of women who are parents. We are also considering how women can demonstrate an entitlement for free ESOL where they have no access to either benefits documentation of their own or to family funding. These groups are among the highest priority learners for Skills for Life provision.</p>

 A Race Equality Impact Assessment exercise is being undertaken. The final consultation session took place on 6 February. The exercise has taken views from around 150 people including trade unionists, FE principals, learners and staff from organisations such as the Refugee Council and other local voluntary groups. Contributions to the exercise have been helpful and constructive. The sessions have identified a number of areas for further consideration and a report will be published late in February.</p>

In English one in eight schools are achieving below 65 per cent. compared with just under half in 1997. Impressive gains have been made towards meeting the KS2 PSA school-level floor target (reduce by 40 per cent. by 2008 the number of schools where less than 65 per cent. of pupils achieve level 4 in English and in maths). There are now 1,785 schools below the target in English and 2,555 schools below in mathematics down from 2,849 in English and 3,570 in maths in 2003 (baseline year).</p>

 Proposals to close schools are normally made by a local authority and are decided under local decision making arrangements. Under current provisions, such decisions are taken by the local School Organisation Committee (SOC) or, if the SOC cannot reach a unanimous decision, the schools adjudicator. SOCs and adjudicators must have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State when deciding proposals. The guidance sets out a range of factors that must be considered for the different types of proposals but stresses that all cases must be considered on their individual merits. The factors include: the overall impact on local standards of provision, the demand/supply of school places, the impact on the local community and the views of interested parties. Decision making arrangements will change in May, when we aim to introduce the new provisions of the Education and Inspections Act 2006. These provide for the local authority to decide most proposals for school closures, but with some explicit powers of appeal to the schools adjudicator.</p>

 Tax legislation requires that pension saving must be converted into a secure income, often through an annuity, by age 75.

For small self-administered occupational pension schemes (the only kind of occupational pension scheme that was directly required as a condition of tax approval to secure member's benefits through annuitisation) the requirement to purchase an annuity by age 75 was first introduced in 1994.</p>

 Data limitations preclude meaningful estimates of the average value of migrant workers by country of origin. However the average migrant worker (across all countries of origin) makes a positive contribution to the UK economy. Migrants (defined as people not born in the UK) constitute 10.5 per cent. of people above the age of 16 in the UK. Migrants (including family reunification and refugees) typically have lower employment rates than the UK average, around 5 per cent. lower, but typically earn 8 per cent. more. Assuming that the higher earning signify that migrants are, on average, more productive, this would indicate that migrants contribute around 11 per cent. to total gross domestic product, and cause a small but positive increase to gross domestic product per capita.</p>

 The Highly Skilled Migrants Programme was amended in November 2006 to trial changes proposed as part of the move to a points based system for managed migration. The Points Based System will simplify the multitude of current routes into a scheme with five tiers for entry. One of the key objectives for changing the scheme is to reduce subjectivity and base decisions on objective evidence, making the process more transparent for the applicant. The aim of the change in November was to allow for a period of &#145;live testing&#146; of the proposed tier 1 criteria, presenting an opportunity to review the effects of the criteria and refine them before full tier 1 roll out. Tier 1 in the new scheme will be broadly equivalent to the existing Highly Skilled Migrant Programme (HSMP) in aim (to attract the most highly skilled who can benefit the UK) and entitlements (unrestricted access to the UK labour market, no need to have an employer in UK sponsoring application, the option to settle in the UK after five years, the right to bring dependants).  <br>

 Council tax bands are based on property values in April 1991. Adding any of these items will have no effect on the current council tax banding of a property. If a property is subsequently sold any improvements may have an effect, but only if they are such that they push the value of the property into the next band range. Any of the above improvements are, in isolation, unlikely to result in a banding increase.</p>

(b) The Major Repairs Allowance was introduced in 2001, providing substantial additional funds to counter depreciation of housing stock.<br>
(c) 2004-05 saw a 47 per cent. increase in West Lancashire&#146;s maintenance allowances as part of the initial effects of rebasing took effect. There was, in the same period, a reduction in assumed rental income following a small reduction in housing stock levels over the previous year. Together these factors reduced the level of negative subsidy generated by the authority substantially.<br>

<i>  [holding answer 25 January 2007]: </i>Households living in decent homes are less likely to experience fuel poverty The decent homes standards requires homes to provide thermal comfort through having both efficient heating and effective insulation. Our guidance for delivering decent homes sets out the means by which landlords can meet this thermal comfort criterion, and also recommends that they seek to go further to improve energy efficiency, for example by replacing inefficient boilers, or installing extra insulation or double glazing.</p>

Excess cold is included as a potential hazard and a hazard assessment should take account of the adequacy of the heating, insulation and ventilation. The Housing Act 2004 gives local authorities powers to intervene where they consider housing conditions to be unacceptable following the proper application of the HHSRS.</p>

 The amount and distribution of new housing to be provided in the West Midlands region over the next 25 years is currently being considered through the revision of the Regional Spatial Strategy (RSS). As part of the revision, the West Midlands Regional Assembly is consulting on options to provide up to 575,000 new homes across the Region. The consultation on the options will inform the Assembly&#146;s decision on how much housing should go in different locations in their preferred option. At this stage, options for housing development in Solihull are between 11,000 and 18,000 new homes; however, it is possible that the final figure for Solihull may be different from these figures depending on the outcome of the consultation. The location and level of housing are a matter for the regional and local planning process. Until these decisions are made it is not possible to say whether there will be any loss of Green Belt in any specific areas in the Region. However, the current RSS would expect to see all other possibilities exhausted before consideration of Green Belt.</p>

better value for money. The Corporation aims to reduce the costs of provision and the amount of grant provided. This grant reduction has enabled the delivery of additional affordable homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1062"><a name="70219w0106.htm_para5"><a name="07022139001896">Where homes are no longer used for social housing or where a home owner has purchased 100 per cent. of their property initially subsidised by grant the Housing Corporation recovers grants to be used on new schemes. This is achieved by RSLs using Recycled Capital Grants Funds (RCGF) to hold recovered grant plus interest and re-invest it within a certain time. For properties acquired by tenants under Right to Acquire and Voluntary Purchase Grants, RSLs credit Disposal Proceeds Funds with the net proceeds of the sale. These funds are then used to provide replacement properties.</p>

 The Department has consulted extensively with stakeholders, including representatives of the UK soluble coffee industry, on European Commission proposals to deregulate specified quantities for the majority of pre-packaged products and also on the broader issue of specified quantities. Officials have also had discussions with representatives of specific industry sectors. The views of business sectors and consumer groups have been taken into account during the course of negotiation on the proposals.</p>

The Government support deregulation as they believe that it will give greater freedom to packers and increased choice to consumers. The removal of fixed pack sizes will not impose any direct costs on UK businesses as packers will continue to be able to pack in the sizes they now use.</p>

 The six payments refer to compensation payments made by ACAS to six employees in relation to the termination of their employment. Four of the payments were made to settle employment tribunal cases involving claims for unfair dismissal and other alleged breaches of employment law in advance of the tribunal determination. The fifth payment was made in respect of an early retirement case to compensate for untaken annual leave and pay in lieu of notice that exceeded the Approved Early Retirement Scheme terms.

<a name="70219w0110.htm_brev0"><a name="07022140001180"><ul><p class="tabletext">(a) extend cancellation rights and a cooling off period to consumers for sales concluded in their home following a solicited visit, similar to those they currently enjoy for unsolicited visits;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1098"><a name="70219w0110.htm_para5"><a name="07022140000103">As the hon. Member will know, the Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Bill is currently going through Parliament and the doorstep selling provisions will enable the Secretary of State to make regulations that provide cancellation rights for solicited sales visits to the consumer's home (and workplace). Later this year we intend to publicly consult on the draft regulations, which will extend cancellation rights to all sales concluded in a consumer's home and require cancellation rights to be incorporated within contracts. We expect these measures to come into force in April 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1099"><a name="70219w0110.htm_para6"><a name="07022140000104">I would also like to refer the hon. Member to the unfair commercial practices directive. This will be implemented this year. The new provisions will protect consumers against the physical or non-physical use of harassment, coercion or exploiting undue influence. This is also the first directive that recognizes that vulnerable consumers need a greater level of protection. Practices which would not be unfair to the average member of the shopping public can still be unfair if they are likely to adversely affect a group of vulnerable consumers in a way that a trader can reasonably foresee. For example, elderly consumers are much more likely to succumb to intimidating sales tactics than able-bodied consumers.</p>

 The Department currently has no plans to fund an air ambulance service. A Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) feasibility study published in 2004, which was commissioned by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the Republic of Ireland&#146;s Department of Health and Children, concluded that, other than for inter-hospital transfers, there was no clear advantage in helicopter emergency medical services. Current policy is to develop ground ambulance services and the Department is working with the four Health and Social Services Boards and the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service in this regard.</p>

 The University of Ulster looked at this issue in 2003 when it carried out its impact assessment of options for reform of the domestic rating system. Its findings were inconclusive. It did note that, as the new rating system is not a new tax but the redistribution of an existing tax, in the unlikely event that any measurable impact should emerge it could affect the market unevenly and in either direction, depending on location and sector. This work did not extend to examining the impact of Water Reform and no specific study has been carried out.</p>

This exceptional growth continues and it has included the period in which the Valuation and Lands Agency were advising individual householders in NI of their new capital values, together with an indication of their new rate liability. This would suggest that rating and water reform have not affected the residential property market in NI.</p>
