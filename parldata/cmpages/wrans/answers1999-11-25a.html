To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how much his Department has spent on civil servants' transport in each of the last two years.  [98710]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91125w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 All travel undertaken by DTI civil servants complies with the requirements of the Civil Service Management Code. The Department maintains records on the travel and subsistence costs of civil servants, but does not break down separately the transport component of this. Budgets for travel and subsistence for DTI civil servants totalled &#163;12.9 million in 1997-98 and &#163;13.0 million in 1998-99.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what motor mileage allowance rates his Department offers to <i>(a)</i> Ministers and <i>(b)</i> civil servants using their own vehicles for official business; and what has been the cost of each in each of the last five years.  [98711]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91125w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 When travelling on official business, Ministers may use a private car instead of an official car, and claim mileage allowances in the same circumstances and on the same terms as civil servants within the DTI. Ministers and civil servants using their own vehicles for official business may claim the following Fixed Profit Car Scheme (FPCS) mileage rates (pence per mile):

<P>

<a name="91125w01.html_para0">The DTI does not record expenditure on motor mileage separately from other travel and subsistence expenses paid when civil servants or Ministers undertake official business. To provide the information requested would entail disproportionate cost.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91125w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Loughton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many companies have gone out of business since May 1997.  [98639]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91125w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 November 1999]:</i> There are no official statistics on the number of business closures. Collating them would impose too great a burden on business. Quarterly estimates from Barclays Bank show that there were 922,000 business closures in England and Wales in the 27 months between April 1997 



<P>
<P><I>25 Nov 1999 : Column: 164W</I><P>
and June 1999. This is the lowest total of any such period since 1990, and 26 per cent. lower than when closures peaked in the early 1990s.
<P>

<a name="91125w01.html_para1">Other indicators confirm that business closures are lower than in previous years. There have been 97,700 company and individual insolvencies in England and Wales since April 1997, 32 per cent. fewer than when insolvencies peaked in the early 1990s. There were 155,900 VAT de-registrations in the UK in 1998, a fall of 5 per cent. on 1997 and the lowest total for five years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if the implementation of the OECD guidelines on multi-national enterprises will be on the agenda of November's WTO Seattle Round.  [99247]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91125w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Byers </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 November 1999]:</i> The OECD Guidelines on Multinational Enterprises are under review in the OECD. There will be a report on the progress made for the OECD ministerial meeting in June 2000. Progress so far in the working group tasked with carrying out the review has been good, with broad agreement on how to bring the text of the Guidelines more up to date. There is also broad agreement that there has to be more effective implementation and wider dissemination of the Guidelines. We believe that the results of the review will make the Guidelines of greater relevance and use for business, other organisations and governments alike.

<a name="91125w01.html_wqn4"><B> Ms Southworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps he is taking to ensure an informed decision on the site for the new synchrotron.  [99739]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91125w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 I have considered the issues carefully and it is clear to me that on scientific and financial grounds the choice of a site for the new synchrotron lies between the two main sites of the Central Laboratory for the Research Councils: the Daresbury Laboratory in Cheshire and the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire. There has been a number of studies looking at the project proposals and the sites. At the same time, however, the project has been evolving, for example with the announcement in August of the French Government's participation in the project and changing views on capacity requirements and technical solutions. I am, therefore, commissioning two further studies to inform a final decision on the site.
<P>

<a name="91125w01.html_para2">First, I have asked the Director General of Research Councils to seek the views of synchrotron users on what they see as the key issues of relevance to a decision on the site for the new synchrotron.
<P>

<a name="91125w01.html_para3">Second, we will be commissioning an external engineering survey and report on the two potential sites for the new synchrotron. I have asked for this report by early January to enable me to make a final decision in the light of all the evidence and announce it by mid January.

 <i>[holding answer 22 November 1999]:</i> Although the Millennium Experience will be a car free event, it is acknowledged that some visitors will wish to make the first leg of their journey by car. The New Millennium Experience Company is therefore to manage a small number of formal park-and-ride facilities around London at which a limited number of visitors each day, who pre-book in advance, will be able to leave their vehicles before completing their journey on convenient public transport links.

<a name="91125w02.html_para0">Whether in existing car parks or in specifically created sites, the park-and-ride capacity is temporary and required only for the duration of the Millennium Experience.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91125w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Government have pressed for concerted action by the Environment Agency and the water companies to improve bathing water quality. This year compliance with the mandatory coliform bacteria standards of the Bathing Water Directive in England was the best ever, at 90.3 per cent. The Government also wants substantial additional investment under the current periodic review of water prices in England and Wales to increase mandatory compliance to 97 per cent. by 2005, together with a significant increase in compliance with the more stringent, guideline standards.

<P>
<a name="91125w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Burgon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what further guidance he has given the Director General of Water Services in the context of his periodic review of water company price limits.  [100178]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91125w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Director General of Water Services, Ian Byatt, is currently engaged in a periodic review of water company price limits in England and Wales between April 2000 and March 2005. As part of the review, the Director General sought guidance from Ministers on the environmental and drinking water quality requirements to be placed on water companies during this period. This is an essential element in establishing the extent of companies' investment programmes and in turn enabling the Director General to fulfil his statutory duty to set price limits which enable the companies to finance the proper carrying out of their functions.
<P>

<a name="91125w02.html_para1">In September 1998, the Government published "Raising the Quality", which set the strategic framework of environmental and quality standards for each of the main areas of investment. In March of this year, the Environment Agency and the Drinking Water Inspectorate published material which had been endorsed by Ministers, setting out detailed requirements for each company at the level of individual investment schemes. In July, the Director General published draft price determinations and 



<P>
<P><I>25 Nov 1999 : Column: 168W</I><P>
set out the assumptions on which these were based, including the size of the investment programme in each company.
<P>

<a name="91125w02.html_para2">One area which has been the subject of subsequent debate is the size and phasing of the environmental programme. I have looked again at the programmes of each of the nine large water and sewerage companies in England. In the case of seven of these companies (Anglian, Northumbrian, North West, Severn Trent, Thames, Wessex and Yorkshire Water) I have reconfirmed my original guidance that the entire agreed investment programme should be completed by March 2005. This encompasses work on improving rivers and unsatisfactory intermittent discharges and in upgrading coastal sewerage and sewage treatment systems. For Southern Water, I have again reconfirmed my earlier guidance that the agreed investment programme should be completed by March 2005, save for a small proportion of the programme to improve rivers.
<P>

<a name="91125w02.html_para3">The size of the investment programme for South West Water deserves special consideration, given the level of water bills in comparison to the remainder of the country and the scale of the environmental requirements which are necessary or desirable, particularly for coastal sewerage discharges. I have considered carefully the investment package which underlay the draft determination proposed by the Director General and have concluded that this strikes the appropriate balance between the pace of environmental improvements and the burden on water bill payers. I have also accepted the Director General's advice that a large scheme proposed by Wessex Water, designed to address low flow problems in the Hampshire Avon area deserves further study to identify the most cost-effective solution. A scheme will need to go ahead in the pricing period to address the environmental problems, once the studies are complete.
<P>

<a name="91125w02.html_para4">I have asked the Director General, in his final determinations, to phase the investment programmes sensibly, taking into account my stated environmental priorities, such as the early improvement of large continuous coastal sewage discharges, together with schemes to benefit key bathing and shellfish waters, within the constraints presented by the need to ensure efficient financing and practical delivery. Further discussions will be necessary between water companies and the Environment Agency before the timings of individual schemes are finalised.
<P>

<a name="91125w02.html_para5">The Director General also identified 63 of over 550 schemes designed to improve the quality of rivers, which he recommended should receive further study in terms of their costs and benefits before they go ahead. The Environment Agency has advised that for 14 of these schemes, the evidence suggests that no investment is necessary during the pricing period, given the current performance of the treatment works involved, while a significantly less expensive option has already been identified for one more scheme. On this basis I plan to instruct the Agency to take these 15 schemes forward. I intend to ask the Environment Agency to explore in more detail the benefits of the remaining schemes and to set them out in a way which will allow Ministers to judge these against improved information on costs from Ofwat and the companies concerned.

<a name="91125w02.html_para6">Improvement of the water environment is an urgent priority.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on the outcome of recent consultation on changes to the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997.  [100179]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91125w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I have considered the advice of the Advisory Committee on Packaging as set out in Sir Peter Parker's letter to me of 22 December 1998, in particular as this relates to changing the percentage activity obligations for each of the four main sectors of the packaging chain. Following consultation on these proposed changes and other matters, and subject to Parliamentary approval, I propose to make a number of changes to the Regulations as set out.




<P>

(i) As I indicated in my reply to the hon. Member for Elmet on 28 January 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>335-37</i>, I have accepted the advice of the Advisory Committee on Packaging to change the percentage activity obligations and I have now consulted on this recommendation more widely. I therefore propose to change the percentage activity obligations of three of the four main sectors in the packaging chain as follows:
<BR>
Reduction in the convertor obligation from 11 per cent. to 9 per cent.
<BR>
Increase in the packer/filler obligation from 36 per cent. to 37 per cent.
<BR>
Increase in the seller obligation from 47 per cent. to 48 per cent.
<BR>
The recent consultation paper discussed the option of requiring compliance plans from individually registered businesses. The Regulations currently require operational plans to be provided by compliance schemes to the relevant Agency showing how, over three years, they propose to meet the recovery and recycling obligations of their members. Earlier advice from the Advisory Committee on Packaging on this point recommended that, where there is a significant number of individually registered businesses, they, too should plan ahead and give thought to the steps that would need to be taken to meet the mandatory Directive in 2001. In 1998, there were some 890 individual registrations with the Agencies and some 800 in 1999.

I am also aware that there has been concern among businesses who are members of compliance schemes that there would be a higher rate of non-compliance among businesses pursuing this individual route. For 1998 this proved to be true, with around 200 individually registered businesses failing to provide compliance certificates as required and a number of these failing to take steps to comply with the recovery and recycling obligations. I believe that it is important that all those obligated under the Regulations should have to consider what infrastructural development might be needed to enable the UK to meet the mandatory Directive targets in 2001. At the same time, I am concerned to ensure that smaller businesses should not be faced with disproportionate administrative burdens. I am therefore proposing that businesses registered individually with an Agency who have annual turnover of more than &#163;5 million, should provide a compliance plan to the relevant Agency upon registration and update this annually. We will be looking carefully at the new requirement in its first year of implementation to assess its effectiveness in improving compliance and the associated administrative burdens.
<BR>
(iii) In my reply to the hon. Member on 28 January 1999, I announced that the financial turnover threshold test for 2000 would be "more than &#163;2 million" thus excluding smaller businesses in the &#163;1 million to &#163;2 million turnover range from the scope of the Regulations. The recent consultation document discussed a number of threshold test scenarios to see whether it was going to be possible to exclude a further number of smaller businesses. However, the Government's view is that the optimum balance of costs and benefits is to be achieved by continuing with the proposed "over &#163;2 million" financial turnover and "over 50 tonnes" packaging handled. I am glad to confirm that these are the two threshold tests that will apply from 1.1.2000 as this will exclude a number of smaller businesses from the scope of the Regulations.
<BR>
(iv) In my reply to the hon. Member referred to above I also noted that the fee charged by the Environment Agency and Scottish Environment Protection Agency would rise to &#163;900. Since that fee was calculated in mid-1998, the Agencies have had further experience of the monitoring that is required and have had feed-back from business as to the sort of monitoring programme that is wanted to ensure that free-riding does not provide some businesses with a competitive advantage and does not inhibit the achievement of the Directive targets in 2001. The Agencies fee will therefore rise to &#163;950 with effect from 1.1.2000.

The Competition Act 1998 comes into force on 1 March 2000. As a result, the Government is proposing to simplify the Regulations and remove the special competition scrutiny

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what representations he has received on the damage to Holy Trinity Primary School in Richmond caused by a block of ice falling from an aircraft on 19 November; and if he will make a statement on the action his Department takes to prevent such incidents.  [99647]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91125w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 My Department has not received any such representations. Nor has the incident been reported to the Civil Aviation Authority.
<P>

<a name="91125w03.html_para0">Most icefalls from aircraft are due to ice which has formed on the outside of the aircraft detaching itself as it descends into warmer air. The accumulation of ice may be caused by atmospheric conditions, or it may occur due to leakage from a faulty seal on one of the hose sockets used to load or unload liquid to the aircraft. Incidents are rare in relation to the volume of air traffic. In the last 12 months, 24 incidents have been recorded of icefall and 16 of other falling objects; this level of occurrence has not risen in the last five years, despite significant increases in traffic over that period.
<P>

<a name="91125w03.html_para1">The Government take seriously all occurrences of ice and debris falling from an aircraft. The primary way to tackle the problem is to ensure that regulations on the safe manufacture and operation of Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) aircraft are adhered to. There are many such regulations: for example, before aircraft can be entered on national registers they must meet the appropriate standards for design and construction of aircraft, including resistance to leakage of on-board water or toilet systems which is cause of the build up of ice on the exterior of aircraft.
<P>

<a name="91125w03.html_para2">The CAA will investigate icefall incidents if possible, but it is not an easy process and it is extremely rare to confirm the origin of an icefall. The main focus has to be on striving to reduce the number of icefalls by encouraging the aviation industry to improve the relevant systems and procedures.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is the outcome of the consultation on the revaluation of non-domestic rates in April 2000.  [100220]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91125w03.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 Businesses have overwhelmingly supported the need for a transitional relief scheme to phase in changes in business rate bills, as proposed in our recent consultation paper. Following that consultation, I am pleased that we can announce today limits on the size of annual increases over all five years of the new rating list.




<P>
<P><I>25 Nov 1999 : Column: 172W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="91125w03.html_para3">Rate bills will fall for many properties, while others will see only modest increases. The transitional relief scheme will place maximum limits on any larger increases, with additional protection given to small properties.
<P>

<a name="91125w03.html_para4">The largest possible increase in bills for small non-domestic properties will be 5 per cent. in real terms in 2000-01, rising to 7.5 per cent. in each of the following four years. The threshold for these small properties will be increased to a rateable value of less than &#163;12,000 (or &#163;18,000 in London). The equivalent limits on bill increases for all larger properties will be 12.5 per cent. in real terms in 2000-01, 15 per cent. in 2001-02 and 17.5 per cent. in each of the following three years.
<P>

<a name="91125w03.html_para5">Small properties will also be given preferential treatment on the limits on the amount by which rate bills can fall in any year. Their bills will be allowed to decrease by up to 5 per cent. in real terms in the first two years, up to 10 per cent. in the third, 12.5 per cent. in the fourth and 25 per cent. in the last year. Decreases for all larger properties will be limited to 2.5 per cent. in real terms in the first two years, and 5 per cent. in the third, 7.5 per cent. in the fourth and 15 per cent. in the last year.
<P>

<a name="91125w03.html_para6">Revaluation does not mean that more money will be raised from the rates, since the rates multiplier (or poundage) will be reduced next year to take account of the increase in rateable value across the country. What it does mean is that the rate burden will be distributed more fairly, reflecting changes in the property market since 1995.
<P>

<a name="91125w03.html_para7">A number of responses to the consultation paper called on the Government to review the current system of business rate revaluation. We agree that such a review is needed. This will not be a fundamental review of the business rate, but it will look for ways of improving the approach to valuation in order to increase stability, certainty and simplicity in the system, including changes to the frequency of valuations. The details of the review will be announced in due course.

This payment will not be available to those who are on the statutory interim arrangements (in schedule 9 to the Act), nor will it apply to those who are in receipt of social security benefits. The six-month period will not begin until an asylum seeker has been accepted for support under section 95 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.
<P>

<a name="91125w05.html_para0">Asylum seekers will need to apply for the additional provision setting out the length of time that they have been in the support system and indicating the items which they need to replace. This information will act as a prompt to the payment of the additional provision, but also as a survey to enable us to review the amount to be paid and the purposes for which it is to be used. Once an application has been received, due consideration will be given provided there is no evidence that the asylum applicant has failed to comply with the asylum support procedures or has actively sought to frustrate or delay progress on the asylum application.

As a result, a programme of reform of the current arrangements was announced by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary in a reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston (Ms Hughes), now the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, on 29 July 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 255-56W. This included the provision of &#163;51 million to improve accommodation and regimes for under-18-year-olds in prison custody. These resources will provide for a new distinct estate for 15 to 17-year-old boys and enhanced regime standards to operate within it. This will support the delivery, from April 2000, of the new custodial sentence for under-18-year-olds under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, the Detention and Training Order. The new regime standards emphasise the importance of safeguarding the welfare of the young person, recognising the needs and vulnerability of this age group.

 Statistics on pleas in the Crown Court are collected centrally, but they do not record whether the defendant elected for trial or was directed by magistrates. However, there is some information available from the baseline data collected by the Home Office in 1998 for the evaluation of the pilot schemes to reduce delay in the criminal justice system. In a sample of nearly 1,000 cases in the six pilot areas, about 60 per cent. of those who elected for the Crown Court pleaded guilty before the trial started.

There is, of course, a balance to be struck between protecting the rights of those undertaking lawful activities and the rights of demonstrators and marchers. Violent activity or inciting racial hatred are not legitimate forms of protest and the police and the courts have the power to deal with these offences under the provisions of the Public Order Act 1986. The investigation of complaints about incitement of racial hatred or other public order offences rests with the police as part of their general duties in the enforcement of criminal law

This applies equally to the method of calculation of police grant, as a common formula is used for distribution of police grant and SSA.
<P>

<a name="91125w06.html_para6">Our present intention is that, subject to consultation and approval by the House, we shall not make any changes to the method of police grant distribution, or revenue support grant distribution, generally for 2000-01.

<P>

<a name="91125w06.html_para9"><i>Central Government</i>
<P>

<a name="91125w06.html_para10">I am delighted to report that work on business critical systems is now complete in all Government Departments and Agencies with one exception. This means that systems have been fixed, tested and successfully put back into operation.
<P>

<a name="91125w06.html_para11">The MOD has completed over 99 per cent. of work on its critical systems. Although there has been a small slippage within part of MOD's complex programme, this has been offset by progress elsewhere, and its critical systems are now predicted to be completed by the end of November. In any event robust and tested contingency plans are in place to maintain defence capability.
<P>

<a name="91125w06.html_para12">Business Continuity Plans (BCPs) and Millennium Operating Regimes (MORs) are essential safeguards against the impact of unforseen bug failures and the other particular pressures of the Millennium holiday period. I am pleased to say that all Departments and Agencies now have robust and tested BCPs and MORs in place.
<P>

<a name="91125w06.html_para13">I reported, in my last statement, that as part of the Central Government MOR, Government and the key infrastructure providers would be testing proposed information flows. Exercise Herald took place on 26 October and showed that the structures being put in place are robust. The exercise also identified some areas for further development. These lessons are being factored into the Central Government MOR.
<P>

<a name="91125w06.html_para14"><i>The Wider National Infrastructure</i>
<P>

<a name="91125w06.html_para15">Independent assessments of the readiness of the national infrastructure with respect to Y2K compliance and business continuity planning have been undertaken as part of the National Infrastructure assessment project run by Action 2000. Organisations within the programme are also required to have millennium operating regimes in place.
<P>

<a name="91125w06.html_para16">In my last statement to the House, I reported that all but a very few areas of the national infrastructure were rated as 100 per cent. blue--this means that independent assessors have not identified any risk of material disruption as a result of their full assessment, and that the public can expect a normal service. These sectors included utilities such as electricity and water, as well as police, fire, telecommunications and healthcare. I am pleased to report that those few organisations which were not then blue have now achieved blue status. This included various local authorities in Northern Ireland, gas shippers and suppliers, Scottish Islands transport, seven medium- impact financial institutions, Housing Associations in England, and Manchester Metrolink light railway. The UK infrastructure is therefore now 100 per cent. blue.
<P>

<a name="91125w06.html_para17"><i>International</i>
<P>

<a name="91125w06.html_para18">While the UK remains one of the world leaders in tackling the Millennium bug, the Government has also been proactive in offering financial and technical assistance to other countries, both bilaterally and through international organisations such as the World Bank Info Dev fund and the International Year 2000 Co-operation Centre (IY2KCC). The &#163;10 million we gave to the Info Dev fund to assist Year 2000 work in-less developed

countries remains the largest single donation. The MOD has been proactive in raising awareness of defence aspects of the Year 2000 problem and exchanging relevant information.
<P>

<a name="91125w06.html_para19"><i>Conclusion</i>
<P>

<a name="91125w06.html_para20">Although almost all testing across government and the national infrastructure is now complete, the possibility of failures, however low, still remains. With less than 40 days to the Millennium, we cannot rest on our laurels. To address any remaining or unforeseen risks, we are asking all providers of key services--including government departments--to keep their business continuity plans under review so they can continue to deliver essential services come what may.
<P>

<a name="91125w06.html_para21">There has been a vast amount of work in the UK to prepare for the Millennium bug--indeed the UK is generally acknowledged to be among the front rank in the world in terms of readiness. We have less information about other countries, so cannot be confident that the rest of the world will be ready. We can only prepare against potential disruption and make contingency plans to minimise any impact.
<P>

<a name="91125w06.html_para22">The Government will continue to lead by example and be open and transparent. I will make a final report for 1999 to the House in December by way of an oral statement.

Commission reports on progress achieved in relation to public health protection from the harmful effects of tobacco and on developments on the negotiations taking place on the World Health Organisation's tobacco framework convention were presented. Following an open debate on the general policy of reduction of tobacco consumption, Council Conclusions were adopted on combating tobacco consumption. A Council Resolution was adopted on mental health promotion and progress was noted on a Resolution on antibiotic resistance to be adopted by the Agriculture Council in December. The Presidency reported on health issues beyond the present European Union borders, including: health in the applicant countries; health questions related to the Northern Dimension and the common strategy on Russia; and the euro-mediterranean conference of Health Ministers to be held in December. The Council noted that Conclusions had been adopted at a previous Council on the importance of co-operation with the applicant countries in the sphere of public health. The Commission reported on its plans for a new exchange of letters with WHO to encourage effective working relations. Commissioner Byrne reported on his wide-ranging plans to transform the Community's approach to food safety, including plans to establish a European food agency.

<P>
<a name="91125w08.html_spnew2"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 November 1999]:</i> Fuel poverty and cold homes can exacerbate a number of illnesses such as asthma in children and respiratory and cardiovascular diseases in older people. However, poor health can be influenced by a large number of causes other than cold housing. Poverty, unemployment and unhealthy life styles are examples of interacting factors that can have at least as great an effect. Therefore, while we clearly recognise that fuel poverty and cold homes undoubtedly contribute to ill health, it is not possible accurately to assess the direct impact on winter admissions, public health, death rates or the level of National Health Service expenditure incurred.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91125w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary represented the United Kingdom at the Summit meeting of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe on 18-19 November in Istanbul. The meeting agreed a Charter for European Security, an adapted Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, and a revised Vienna Document on confidence and security building measures. Copies of these documents and the Summit Declaration will be placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="91125w09.html_para0">The Charter for European Security sets out principles for future security co-operation in Europe and improves the operational capabilities of the Organisation, particularly in response to crises. It also reinforces the immediate and legitimate interest of all participating states in the implementation of their commitments undertaken within the Organisation.
<P>

<a name="91125w09.html_para1">The Summit welcomed the signature of an adapted Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. The adapted Treaty will provide a greater degree of military stability through strict limitations, increased transparency and lower permitted levels for conventional forces in its area of application. My right hon. Friend made it clear that UK ratification would depend on the level of compliance of all states within the agreed limits.
<P>

<a name="91125w09.html_para2">The revised Vienna Document incorporates various decisions taken since 1994. The Forum for Security Co-operation also agreed to study the contribution that the Organisation might make to the international effort to curb the spread of small arms and light weapons.
<P>

<a name="91125w09.html_para3">The situation in Chechnya was a key concern at the Summit. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary discussed the issue intensively in a range of meetings with other Ministers, including the Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation. The Russian Delegation eventually accepted a passage in the Summit Declaration saying that a political solution to the situation in Chechnya was essential and that the assistance of the Organisation would contribute to achieving that goal. The Declaration also welcomed the agreement of the Russian Federation to a visit by the Chairman-in-Office to the region and reaffirmed the existing mandate of the Organisation's Assistance Group to Chechnya.
<P>

<a name="91125w09.html_para4">The Summit also welcomed the separate bilateral agreements between the Russian Federation and the Republics of Georgia and Moldova under which all Russian forces will withdraw from Moldova by the end of 2002 and two of the four Russian bases in Georgia will be closed by 1 July 2001.
<P>

<a name="91125w09.html_para5">The Summit Declaration draws attention to the Organisation's important role in early warning, conflict prevention, crisis management and post-conflict rehabilitation in its area, including particularly the work of the High Commissioner on National Minorities and the

We understand that the TNI and INTERFET are now co-operating more closely. 92,000 refugees are now reported to have returned to East Timor.

activities are commercial-in-confidence, I can say that these establishments have been exporting British beef to several EU member states. As yet, no consignments have been sent to non-EU countries, but the Government have approached countries with a view to ensuring that they will accept British beef. To date, we have agreed export certification with Cyprus, the Falklands, Hong Kong and Mauritius and are at different stages in concluding certification with other countries. Only Russia, Singapore and Malta have said that, at present, they will continue to not admit British beef.

 We have approached the authorities in non-EU countries to lobby them to lift their import bans, where they exist, or to agree the necessary export certification. This is a concerted campaign which follows up, and builds upon, earlier approaches to key markets. So far, we have agreed export certification with Cyprus, the Falklands, Hong Kong and Mauritius, and are at different stages in concluding certification with other countries. Only Russia, Singapore and Malta have said that, at present, they will continue to not admit British beef.

 My Department has a wide-ranging food surveillance programme to protect consumer safety, food authenticity and nutritional quality of the UK diet. In 1998, MAFF spent more than &#163;10.5 million on these surveys, carrying out over 190,000 analyses on more than 63,000 food samples. Similar figures are anticipated for the current year.

 The UK allocation of 154m euro a year for the Rural Development Regulation is very disappointing. This has been based on low spending levels on rural programmes in past years. We will be pressing the European Commission quickly and comprehensively to fulfil its commitment to review allocations.

 The last time the Green Pound was adjusted was on 11 October 1998.
<P>

<a name="91125w12.html_para1">The present depressed state of farm incomes results from various factors, including the strength of sterling, the collapse of world prices and the loss of some key export markets. It is difficult to single out one factor in isolation and assess its impact when the factors are to an extent interlinked.

 As I made clear in my answer to the hon. Gentlemen on 2 November 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 164W, strengthening the regional dimension of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) requires action on a regional specific fishery basis.
<P>

<a name="91125w13.html_para3">This can be done, for example, through the organisation by the Commission of regional meetings bringing together fishermen and fisheries scientists and managers to consider the problems of particular stocks, as with the meeting on the Celtic Sea demersal fishery in March. Under the CFP, the principle of equal access is subject in practice to the application of relative stability shares. I expect this to continue after the review of the CFP in 2002.
