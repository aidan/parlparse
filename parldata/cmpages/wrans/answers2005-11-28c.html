 The detection of <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> directly from live badgers and their excretions using techniques based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is complex and difficult.

Note:<br>

1. Data in the table is from waste collection authorities and the Environment Agency for England as recorded on the Flycapture database from April 2004&#150;March 2005.<br>

2. Volume details are an estimate only as the database records summary numbers linked to average sizes rather than reporting specific volumes in an incident database. &#039;assumption&#039; indicates an average size that can be assumed, whereas &#039;guidance&#039; indicates that a suggested size is proposed in the database guidance.<br>

1. Environment Agency data capture on the nature of wastes fly-tipped and available for 2001 to 2005 is in the table. The number of pollutants identified will exceed the number of incidents due to single incidents with multiple pollutants.
2. Environment Agency volumetric data capture commenced last year It is therefore as yet detailed will not provide as complete a picture as Flycapture.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate the Government have made of the financial implications for local authorities of its proposed household duty of care on waste.  [26925]</p>




<p><a name="st_30"><a name="51128w05.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Waste (Household Waste Duty of Care) (England and Wales) Regulations 2005 give local authorities a new power to take action against householders for breaches of the duty of care. There is no duty on local authorities to enforce this requirement or to prosecute offenders. Therefore, the extent to which this new power is used will be a matter for individual local authorities based on their enforcement and prosecution policies, and the financial implications will vary accordingly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w05.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_33">As many local authorities have enforcement teams to deal with fly-tipping and other local environmental quality offences, there will be no additional cost as this is simply another power they can use to target offenders. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Nov 2005 : Column 16W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Local authorities have been requesting this power for some time. They currently spent around &#163;44 million from April 2004 to March 2005 on clearing fly-tipping, 55 per cent. of which was household waste. Enforcing the household waste duty of care will help to reduce illegal dumping and could lead to resource savings for authorities.

The decision as to whether carcases are required for examination is made during this second, more detailed assessment.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the likely effect of the EU&#039;s most recent offer in the World Trade Organisation trade negotiations on <i>(a)</i> applied EU agricultural tariffs and <i>(b)</i> total levels of EU agricultural subsidy.  [29489]</p>




<p><a name="st_46"><a name="51128w06.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 For most EU tariffs, the general &#039;most favoured nation&#039; (MFN) applied tariffs are the same as the bound tariffs. This means that, in general, the cuts in the bound tariffs will translate into equivalent cuts in the general MFN applied tariffs. (The most notable exceptions are some of the tariffs in the cereals, rice and fruit and vegetables sectors.)
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w06.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_39">For some countries EU applied tariffs are less than the applied MFN tariffs. These lower applied tariffs are granted to groups such as the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries (for least developed countries most tariffs are already zero under the everything but arms agreement). At present there is no proposal for any specific reduction in these preferential tariff rates. Neither is there any proposal for a reduction in the concessionary within-quotas tariffs which already exist.

<a name="51128w06.html_para1">
Total agricultural support consists of two broad categories: market price support (keeping domestic agricultural prices above world prices), which involves costs to consumers and Government expenditure; and direct payments by Government. The two aspects of the EU offer which will have the most impact on consumer costs are the elimination of export subsidies and the reductions in tariffs. The elimination of export subsidies and the reductions in tariffs will allow prices to fall, resulting in a decrease in the overall level of subsidy due to a decrease in consumer costs. However, it is difficult to predict the magnitude of this effect because of the complex interactions between domestic support reforms, trade reforms, and reforms in other major agricultural producing countries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w06.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_40">The EU&#039;s offer on domestic support will consolidate the 2003 CAP reforms. The result of the offer would be a real reduction in trade-distorting subsidy from both the pre-2003 position and the current position. However, the non-trade-distorting direct payments are not affected by the EU&#039;s offer in the WTO negotiations as these are eligible for the WTO &#039;green box&#039;.

 The use of animals in scientific procedures in the United Kingdom is strictly regulated by the Home Office under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Licences are granted for animal experiments undertaken for specific permissible purposes. There must be no alternative to the use of animals, the potential benefit of the work has to outweigh the adverse effects on the animals involved and the number of animals used and any suffering that may be caused must be minimised.

One of the functions of the Ethical Review Process is to examine the efficacy and conduct of work to be undertaken. In addition, research councils and charities fund many research projects carried out under the 1986 Act and such work is evaluated by and reported to those organisations. A licence application is only submitted to the Home Office once participants in the local ethical review process are satisfied that the work can be justified.

 Information on how many female asylum seekers are pregnant on application for asylum is not available. Information on asylum applications by sex is published annually.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the Immigration and Nationality Directorate&#039;s protocol is for returning personal documentation to failed asylum seekers.  [31182]</p>




<p><a name="st_55"><a name="51128w07.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The Immigration and Nationality Directorate will take all reasonable steps to return personal documentation to asylum seekers whose claims have been rejected. The process for returning these documents depends on the circumstances of the person&#039;s case.

<p><a name="qn_56"><a name="51128w07.html_wqn7"><b> Mr. Benyon: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) whether the immigration and nationality directorate review of managed migration routes has resulted in <i>(a)</i> the suspension of and <i>(b)</i> delay to applications from Commonwealth citizens residing in the UK under the ancestral visa scheme for indefinite leave to remain;  [25345]
</p>



<p><a name="qnpa_3">(2) how many individuals from each Commonwealth country have had applications through the ancestral visa scheme for indefinite leave to remain <i>(a)</i> delayed and <i>(b)</i> suspended since the outset of the review of managed migration routes.  [25346]</p>




<p><a name="st_56"><a name="51128w07.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 Concern about possible abuse of the UK ancestry route was identified during the course of the top-to-bottom review of managed migration routes launched by the Prime Minister in April 2004. The review found evidence of suspected abuse of the ancestral visa route from Zimbabweans, which has therefore resulted in suspension and delay of these applications. The suspension on decision making relates only to those UK ancestry cases submitted by Zimbabwean nationals and has affected approximately 300 indefinite leave to remain applications.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w07.html_para10">
It is only right that the immigration and nationality directorate (IND) should take all actions necessary to identify the level of abuse and put in place measures to prevent it, and I regret any delay this creates for bona fide applicants. However I am pleased to announce that the investigation is now at such a stage that consideration of UK ancestry cases from Zimbabwean nationals can now be resumed.

<p>
<a name="51128w07.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_52">We are currently consulting on a new points based system for managed migration to cover routes to work, study and train in the UK. As we develop the new system, we will consider how it relates to existing routes such as UK ancestry, and will assess the possible impact before making changes.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the penalty is for lorry drivers who allow illegal immigrants to enter the UK in their lorry.  [26457]</p>




<p><a name="st_57"><a name="51128w07.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The civil penalty regime, as amended by the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, enables the imposition of a penalty on drivers, owners, operators and hirers of transporters of up to a maximum of &#163;2,000 per clandestine entrant carried to the UK or to a UK immigration control operated in a prescribed zone. In cases where liability is incurred, the level of penalty: code of practice sets out the factors to be taken into consideration when setting the amount of penalty.

<a name="stpa_54">In 2003&#150;04, 22 per cent. of people in the London region had a high level of worry about violent crime and 25 per cent. of people perceived a high level of disorder in their local area, compared to 29 and 34 per cent. respectively in 2002&#150;03.

Perceiving a high-level of disorder (also termed the overall antisocial behaviour measure) is defined here from responses to five disorder strands (the BVPI 122 measure). Perceiving a high-level of disorder has since been redefined, and is now derived from responses to seven individual disorder strands, see Dodd et al. 2004 (HOSB 10/04) for further detail.

<sup>(36)</sup> The Crime Reduction programme (CRP) was a multi-million pound intervention programme running for three years from April 1999. The effectiveness of each initiative was evaluated to add to the knowledge base of what works in reducing crime in England and Wales. Over &#163;340 million has been committed to over 1,470 projects in England and Wales under the various initiatives that formed part of the Crime Reduction programme. Figures are not available for constituency or CDRP level. The CRP funded projects rather than allocated money to CDRPs.<br>

<sup>(37)</sup> The figures relate to the regional figures for the whole south east region and cannot be further broken down.<br>

<sup>(38)</sup> The figures relate to allocated funds to Milton Keynes BCU within the Thames Valley police force area.<br>

 Following the publication of HM Inspectorate of Constabulary&#039;s report &#039;Closing the gap&#039;, which concluded that the existing 43 force structure was no longer fit for purpose, police authorities and chief constables have been asked to submit proposals for restructuring by 23 December. Restructuring would commence in 2006 and be completed by April 2008. Against this backdrop, we have considered what arrangements should apply in the short term when chief officer vacancies arise. In his capacity as chair of the Senior Appointments Panel Sir Ronnie Flanagan, Her Majesty&#039;s Chief Inspector of Constabulary, recently wrote to police authorities advising, except where specific approval had already been granted, not to proceed with existing or future plans to recruit new chief constables. Currently there are discussions between the Thames Valley police authority and Sir Ronnie Flanagan on how to address this particular situation and I would expect the police authority to make an announcement in due course.

<p>
1. Quarterly figures are provided because this is consistent with the Agency&#039;s compliance measurement. It also takes account of the variations in NRP payment patterns which make it difficult to produce an accurate average over a shorter time frame
2. This excludes cases for which no maintenance was due via the collection service (e.g. cases with a nil liability and maintenance direct).




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Nov 2005 : Column 72W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
3. The figures quoted relate to the average amount of maintenance received per case, as opposed to the value of the average calculation. A non-resident parent can pay maintenance in respect of more than one case.
4. The figures for the self-employed presented reflect the status of the non-resident parent currently held on the system as of the last intervention by the Agency. This will not necessarily reflect the current status of the non-resident parent if the Agency has not been informed of (or not yet actioned) a change of circumstances.
5. Figures are rounded to the nearest pound.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what recent assessment he has made of the effects of energy costs on competitiveness in the UK; and if he will make a statement.  [29755]</p>




<p><a name="st_234"><a name="51128w26.html_spnew0"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 The Government take the recent increases in energy prices very seriously, and particularly their impact on the competitiveness of UK industry. In January this year the Department set up the Gas Prices Working Group with the Energy Intensive Users Group and Ofgem, with the remit of examining the workings of the gas market and developing ideas for improving its operation. The group has now agreed a list of action points for the short to medium term, such as maximising gas supplies, encouraging demand side response and pursuing energy market liberalisation in the EU.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w26.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_186">The impact on UK businesses of increases in gas and electricity prices will depend on a variety of factors, including how much gas or electricity a particular company uses, the degree of their exposure to spot and forward prices and the duration of high prices. It will also be affected by the energy prices paid by their competitors. A further sector-specific issue is whether they are in a competitive market where international trade sets the price or in a sector where prices are determined more locally and rising energy costs could be passed on.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w26.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_187">In making decisions about phase 2 of the EU emissions trading scheme the Government are determined to minimise the impact on the UK&#039;s international competitiveness. The evidence to date suggests that the impact of the scheme on electricity prices in the UK is around the average for the EU as a whole.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w26.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_188">Despite recent rises, UK gas and electricity prices for industrial users at July 2005 were at or below the EU median. However, individual companies will have agreed commercially confidential contract terms and prices which might differ from these averages. There is anecdotal evidence that, for very large users of gas, gas prices in the UK are above those on the continent, as they buy gas at wholesale prices. On 16h May DTI held a seminar with major users to discuss forward gas prices. We and Energywatch are planning a further seminar with smaller users on 30 November 2005 to discuss energy purchasing strategies.

 The Government have taken a number of measures to support the development of small and micro generation technologies connected to the distribution networks close to the point of demand. Not least of these was the creation of the industry-wide Distributed Generation Coordinating Group (DGCG) which operated over a three-year period to November 2004 and which initiated a range of projects designed to address barriers to the integration of distributed generation. Building on the valuable work of the DGCG, the DTI together with Ofgem established in January 2005 the Electricity Networks Strategy Group (ENSG), which looks more widely at issues relating to the electricity networks while maintaining a focus on the development of distributed generation.

<p><a name="st_284"><a name="51128w30.html_spnew3"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 The EU&#039;s second offer sought agreement on a simple Swiss tariff formula for industrial goods. This is a non-linear, harmonising formula that is effective at reducing high tariffs and peaks and narrowing tariff escalations. Such a formula would lead to a substantial improvement in real market access through cuts in the applied duties of developed and more competitive developing countries, on the understanding that developing countries should do less. The UK is working hard within the EU to ensure no new obligations are imposed on LDCs and that any NAMA agreement for developing countries respects the principle of less than full reciprocity and maximises Special and Differential Treatment. We recognise the importance for developing countries of maintaining flexibility.

<a name="stpa_221">The EU proposal on services aims to substantially improve market access, and recognises a distinction between developed and developing countries in setting targets and the need for balance in the negotiations.

We are particularly determined to ensure the maintenance of flexibilities to reflect the individual circumstances of developing countries and preserve members&#039; ability to respond to targets based on their own national policy objectives.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w30.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_222">For ease of reference I set out the full text of his letter here:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_101"> This has been a big year for international development. In June, Gordon Brown&#039;s deal with world finance ministers cancelled large chunks of the debt that has crippled the poorest countries and held back their development. In July, at the G8 summit in Gleneagles, the Prime Minister secured an agreement that pledged $50 billion extra in aid.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_102"> The third crucial area with which to tackle world poverty is fairer trade. The World Trade Organisation talks in Hong Kong in December offer an opportunity for the world community to address the imbalances in the world trading system and to deliver an outcome that will enable developing countries to trade their way out of poverty.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_103"> Trade offers huge potential for developing countries. Inequities in the world trading system disadvantage poor countries. Boosting Africa&#039;s share of world trade by just 1 per cent. could deliver seven times as much income as the whole continent currently gets in aid. So increasing the opportunity to trade is vital. But there are risks in trade liberalisation for developing countries&#151;dislocation, job losses and income volatility&#151;if it is done too quickly and not as part of a broader development strategy. So we oppose forced liberalisation.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_104"> Today, as thousands of campaigners are lobbying Parliament to make poverty history by delivering trade justice, I want to record Government&#039;s support for your objective of no forced liberalisation. We want to ensure better access to Western markets, as well as removing the hidden barriers to trade faced by developing countries and other inequalities that remain in the world trading system.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_105"> The Trade Justice Movement is asking the UK government to use its influence within the EU to deliver on four key concerns:</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_106"><i> Stop pushing poor countries to open their economies through world trade talks.</i> We agree. The UK believes that developing countries should not be forced to open up their markets either through trade negotiations or aid conditionality.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_107"> <i>Respect poor countries&#039; right to decide on trade policies to help end poverty and protect their environment.</i> We agree. It is for developing countries to make their own decisions on the timing, pace, sequencing and product coverage of any market opening in line with their own national development plans and poverty reduction strategies.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_108"> <i>Allow developing countries to shape trade policies that protect vulnerable farm sectors and promote national industries.</i> We agree. A pro-development agreement at Hong Kong should include meaningful provision for special and differential treatment, including special products, that enables developing countries to promote food security, rural development and the protection of livelihoods.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_109"> <i>Allow countries to choose the best policies for poor people and the environment in services such as water, health and education.</i> We agree. We strongly support the current voluntary arrangement for trade in services precisely because it allows liberalisation of services to take place in a way that supports national development plans. In the run up to Hong Kong, we are pushing other developed countries to ensure that the Hong Kong deal gives developing countries the flexibility that they need to plan and sequence trade reform in line with their national development plans. It may not be possible to deliver all that we would like to see, but we are committed to use our influence to secure the best possible deal for developing countries.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w30.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_223">It will be challenging to build the consensus around a package at Hong Kong that truly delivers on the promises of the Doha Development Agenda, but, as the Prime Minister has said, we will not let this opportunity pass without a monumental struggle.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the capitation cost is of <i>(a)</i> relocating a civil servant in his Department on public interest terms and <i>(b)</i> an average redundancy compensation payment for non-mobile civil servants.  [31865]</p>




<p><a name="st_3"><a name="51128w32.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Both transfer and redundancy costs are dependent upon a wide range of individual factors and arithmetic averages are likely to be of limited relevance and, potentially, misleading if applied to any single site closure or relocation programme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w32.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">However, in answer to part <i>(a)</i> , the Department does use an overall average figure of &#163;28,000 as an approximate guide to the costs that might arise when a mobile civil servant moves home at public expense. It is important to understand that this figure is a UK average and covers a span from the relatively inexpensive transfer of a single non-householder (costing around &#163;5,000) up to a married owner occupier (costing some &#163;36,000). But when individual moves are in prospect, the actual costs will depend upon the relative housing costs within the existing and new areas as well as upon the individual personal circumstances of those being transferred. Where a transfer is made to a new location within what is deemed to be reasonable daily travel of the existing home, the value of the allowances paid will generally be lower.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w32.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">Turning to part <i>(b)</i> , the provision of a meaningful redundancy cost is equally problematic. This is because the amount paid will depend on factors such as length of service, salary and age. To illustrate this, in a recent redundancy exercise involving 17 non-mobile civil servants, the highest total redundancy liability cost was &#163;77,000 and the lowest was &#163;1,000. The overall average for that particular exercise was &#163;24,500.

 No record is kept of categories of electors who cast votes in UK elections based upon nationality. Elections are conducted on the basis of the relevant electoral register which does not identify the nationality of electors. Whilst there is no definitive data on turnout among electors of different national groups, the Office for National Statistics compiles and publishes each year the annual register of those entitled to vote in elections in the UK. Resident citizens of the Irish Republic or of other EU States like Cyprus and Malta that are also members of the Commonwealth are included indistinguishably with British citizens in the register of parliamentary electors. The register of local electors reveals that as of 1 December 2003 the number of citizens of other EU states who were eligible to vote in June 2004 at local elections in Great Britain was 407,145. No separate record is kept of such EU citizens who have opted to vote in the UK rather than in the state of which they are nationals at European parliamentary elections.

 The answer of 11 July 2005, <i>Official Report,</i> column 759W, on automatic number plate recognition, quoted figures from the assessment of Project Laser 2, a 13 month pilot project which commenced in June 2003. The inaccuracies in the data supplied by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) related primarily to the timeliness of information about vehicles that were evading Vehicle Excise Duty. At this time, DVLA often experienced delays of up to six weeks in the receipt of vehicle licensing information from post offices, resulting in vehicles being stopped unnecessarily. This timeliness issue has now been addressed through the introduction of an electronic link between DVLA and post offices and electronic vehicle licensing. Moreover, the data was conveyed to individual police forces via CD Rom and so was necessarily out of date. The police now have access to live data, and this facility is being rolled out to all forces. Those forces that still receive data on CD Rom currently do so every two weeks, soon to be weekly.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs whether Sir Christopher Meyer submitted the manuscript of his recent book to his Department for <i>(a)</i> comment and <i>(b)</i> clearance; and if he will make a statement.  [26840]</p>






<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Nov 2005 : Column 165W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>



<p><a name="st_137"><a name="51128w46.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 Under the diplomatic service regulations, which are based on home civil service codes of conduct, all former ambassadors remain bound by a continuing duty of confidentiality after they have left Crown employment. The regulations require that former members of the diplomatic service should consult their Department before writing memoirs based on their experience and should submit any part of them which draws on official information or experience for clearance by their Department before publication. Departments are required to assess texts for any harm to national security or defence; international relations; and confidential relationships within Government. The first two categories are based on the Official Secrets Act. The third category broadly reflects the common law of confidence. These categories were established in 1976 following the Report of the Committee of Privy Counsellors on Ministerial Memoirs chaired by Lord Radcliffe, which also set a period of 15 years for maintaining confidences within Government. In practice there is a high threshold to establish a breach of the regulations, which are based as much upon well established conventions and standards of conduct expected of all civil servants as on actual legal obligation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w46.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_115">In the case of Sir Christopher Meyer&#039;s memoirs, there was no prior consultation by the author with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) before he entered into a commitment with a publisher and began writing. Following the appearance of a trailer for the book on the Amazon website in May, Sir Christopher Meyer was contacted by the FCO, reminded of the publication rules and repeatedly asked to submit his text to the Department when completed. In the event his book was only submitted to the Cabinet Secretary for comment by his publisher on 7 October, some four weeks before planned publication on 10 November.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w46.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_116">The Cabinet Office sent a copy of the book to the FCO and both Departments reviewed it against the standard criteria for clearing publications under the rules. The judgment, with which I agreed, was made on the particular facts of this case that no changes should be sought primarily because the book posed no national security risk; it contained nothing substantially new which we judged would harm relations with the US; and nothing was specifically identified that was considered so damaging as to require consideration of legal action.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w46.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_117">However, in his letter of 4 November to the publisher, the Cabinet Secretary made it clear that, while the Government had no comments to make on the book, it was disappointing that a former diplomat should disclose confidences gained as a result of his employment. The Cabinet Secretary stated that it was not the Government&#039;s responsibility to check the accuracy of remarks attributed to individuals in the book and emphasised that his response should not be taken to indicate any form of official or unofficial approval of the book. A copy of the Cabinet Secretary&#039;s letter has been placed in the Library of the House.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w46.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_118">By deciding to write and publish this book, Sir Christopher Meyer has broken the trust placed in him as a former servant of the Crown. As I have already said publicly, it is completely unacceptable for former senior civil servants or diplomats to break such trust in this way. It undermines the key relationship between 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>28 Nov 2005 : Column 166W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
civil servants and Ministers. It is greatly to be regretted that Sir Christopher Meyer has chosen to reveal the substance of conversations with individuals at the centre of sensitive issues, especially as those individuals would not have expected that information to be revealed so soon after the event or in such terms. His disclosures fall well below the standard of discretion expected of former Officials and the conventions set out in the Radcliffe report.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w46.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_119">I note from the comment on this book to date that this view is shared across a very wide political and public spectrum. It has also led to very great concern among the whole of the diplomatic service. The General Secretary of the PDA&#151;the senior civil and public servants&#039; union&#151;has described the book as utterly wrong and a fundamental breach of trust and confidentiality. The Chairman of the Diplomatic Service Association has called Sir Christopher Meyer&#039;s action in publishing

<a name="stpa_120">As many have said, including their noble Lords on 17 November 2005, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 1187&#150;89, this case calls into question the effectiveness of current publication rules, which depend for much of their effect on norms of conduct and behaviour rather than laws. I am currently examining the relevant diplomatic service regulations with a view to making changes so as to ensure that they more accurately reflect the overall purpose of the regulations and conventions in this field. I hope to make an announcement soon. There is also a wider Government review under way as well as one by the Public Administration Select Committee.

The UK, in common with our EU partners, views with deep concern the arrest of the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) leader, Dr. Kiiza Besigye, and 22 others on charges including treason. The move to a pluralist democratic system in advance of the next elections in February or March 2006 is seen by the EU as a crucial step in the political development of Uganda. In this regard, the EU is concerned that all parties should be able, and be seen to be able, to compete in a fair and transparent manner. The UK therefore calls for the due legal process and protection guaranteed under the Ugandan Constitution to be made fully available to Dr. Besigye and the others charged, and for those charged to be granted an early, free and transparent trial.

 We attach a high priority to helping schools prevent and combat bullying: it is a serious problem which puts the emotional well-being and educational achievement of pupils at risk.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w47.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_122">Since September 1999, head teachers of maintained schools have been under a duty to draw up measures to prevent all forms of bullying among pupils; this should include the making of rules and provision for enforcing them. Our detailed guidance &quot;Don&#039;t Suffer in Silence&quot; offers further advice on strategies and approaches schools can utilise in investigating and responding to incidents of bullying, alongside those that can be used preventatively.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what research her Department has undertaken to compare the economic benefits of investing in 14 to 19 education with investment in adult education; and if she will make a statement.  [27949]</p>




<p><a name="st_152"><a name="51128w48.html_spnew1"><b> Bill Rammell: </b> 
 The Department has commissioned a wide range of independent academic research into the economic benefits of education and skills and it is an important part of the Department-funded Centre for the Economics of Education (CEE) work programme. Investments in 14 to 19 and adult education may encompass a variety of different types of provision and therefore, any direct comparison of investments in each would have to include all of these different types of learning and the qualifications which they result in. Moreover, investments made in 14 to 19 and adult education are typically complementary rather than competing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w48.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_130">The economic returns for young people attaining qualifications at school are high with average returns to five or more GCSEs at grades A*-C estimated at 28 per cent. for males and 24 per cent. for females while two or more A levels earn an average return of 15 per cent. for both sexes (McIntosh, 2004).
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w48.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_131">While attainment rates at 14 to 19 are improving, there is still a stock of older adults in the labour force with low level or no qualifications that would benefit from access to learning in order to attain qualifications.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w48.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_132">Returns to adult training are more varied with some low-level NVQs generating low or no returns for some individuals. However, the returns to low-level NVQs are higher in certain sectors, when gained in the workplace and for particular groups. For example, adults who undertake their NVQ level 2 through workplace training gain a 6 to 7 per cent. return compared to an individual with no qualifications. (Dearden at el, 2004). In light of this evidence the Government have introduced Employer Training Pilots, which subsidise employers to train low skilled employees to obtain a basic skills or first level 2 qualification. At the end of October 2005, the pilots had signed up 25,938 employers and 213,422 employees and 107,059 learners had successfully completed their learning. Evaluation has shown very high rates of employer and employee satisfaction and a range of benefits are reported by both. On 2 December 2004, the Chancellor announced in his Pre-Budget Report that there will be a National Employer Training Programme, to be rolled-out from April 2006. The programme will be applying the lessons learned from the successful Employer Training Pilots and give employers the opportunity to access publicly funded support to training their low skilled workers.

<p>
<a name="51128w48.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_133">There is a current emphasis on improving qualification design to ensure consistently high returns for all qualifications by enhancing the role of employers in shaping provision through Sector Skills Agreements, Centres of Vocational Excellence and National Skills Academies.

<a name="stpa_134">Improving the qualification level of the adult labour force also benefits the economy in terms of improving our relative productivity performance at an international level. O&#039;Mahony and de Boer (2002) estimate that up to 20 per cent. of our productivity gap with France and Germany can be explained by the UK&#039;s relatively low skills levels. There are also wider benefits from learning in terms of improved health, reduced crime and increased social cohesion. The Department funds the Centre for Research on the Wider Benefits of Learning which has produced some estimates of these benefits.

 Non-religious schools cannot gain faith school status. It is possible for a non-religious school to close and for a new faith school to be established on the same site. This would require the following process. There must be local consultation followed by the publication of linked statutory proposals to close the school and open a new faith school. There would then follow a six-week period during which objections/expressions of support may be registered. The school organisation committee would then consider the proposals taking into account a number of factors including the views of local parents and the community. If the committee could not reach unanimous agreement, the proposals would pass to the schools adjudicator to make a decision. Approved proposals must be implemented. Before 1999 these decisions were made by the Secretary of State.

 No. The Graduate Teacher Programme (GTP) scheme has been a highly successful initial teacher training programme that continues to attract and recruit large numbers of new high quality trainees, many of whom train in secondary priority subjects and who are employed in schools in areas that find the recruitment of new teachers more difficult. During 2004/05 more than 5,400 new trainees were recruited on to the GTP scheme.

<p><a name="st_160"><a name="51128w49.html_spnew5"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s guidance, &quot;Safeguarding Children in Whom Illness is Fabricated or Induced&quot; (2002), focuses on children when there is a concern that the child is or is likely to suffer harm as a result of their carer inducing or fabricating illness. The key issue is the impact of fabricated or induced illness on the child&#039;s health and development, and consideration of how best to safeguard the child&#039;s welfare. The guidance emphasises the importance of carefully evaluating the child&#039;s signs and symptoms of illness in order to understand the reasons for them and that professionals should be open to all possible explanations. The question refers to the consultation version of this guidance, the final version of which has an amended title and content. The sentence in question sets out the process that should be followed when there is a concern that illness in a child might be being induced or fabricated. It relates to the previous section on the medical evaluation of a child&#039;s signs and symptoms.

This amount, however, is not all an additional cost for consumers as the only new document to be required under the home information pack proposals is the home condition report.

 The Government have been working closely with the Council of Mortgage Lenders and their members in the development of the Home Condition Report and the associated certification arrangements for Home Inspectors, to ensure that lenders can have confidence in the report and that it contains the information they need to generate valuations for mortgage purposes. Lenders will have a legal right to rely on the Home Condition Report. The Council of Mortgage Lenders has indicated that lenders are likely to use the report in the majority of cases.

 Only a very small proportion of home buyers (our research suggests less than three per cent.) obtain a detailed building survey. Indications from the industry suggest this is not likely to change significantly when home information packs are introduced from June 2007. The Home Condition report in the pack will provide for prospective buyers a mid-range survey report on the condition of the property. This will involve a level of inspection similar to that for the current Homebuyer Survey and Valuation Report provided by Chartered Surveyors. Home buyers and their lenders will have a right to rely on the Home Condition Report, which will provide substantially more information about the property than a lender&#039;s valuation inspection report upon which most home buyers currently rely.

In addition, the Highways Agency is investing in ongoing major schemes, including the &#163;138 million A2/A282 Dartford improvements, &#163;110 million Swale Crossing and &#163;16 million A2 widening. Kent will also benefit from billions of additional investment in rail, in particular through CTRL domestic services from 2009. Also the Crossrail bill is currently going through parliament.

 The information requested is not available either by constituency or for Northern Ireland as a whole. Victims of domestic violence are supported by a range of agencies depending on their needs but individual cases of domestic violence are not tracked at present by the agencies involved, for example, within the criminal justice system and the health and social services. A new strategy for addressing tackling domestic violence in Northern Ireland, &quot;Tackling Violence at Home&quot;, was launched in October 2005. As the strategy is implemented, it should be possible in the future to track cases and associated costs across a range of public services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51128w61.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_214">It is estimated, however, that the direct cost of services provided to victims (through the police, criminal justice system, health and social services care, housing support and civil legal cases) could amount to about &#163;90 million each year in Northern Ireland. It is estimated that the loss of economic output in Northern Ireland due to the suffering of domestic violence victims could amount to a further &#163;90 million each year. These estimates are based on an extrapolation of 2004 research figures for England and Wales on a pro-rata population basis.

<a name="stpa_215">Rehabilitation is an integral part of all drug and alcohol treatment whether community or inpatient based. The cost of this generic rehabilitation cannot be disaggregated from the total costs of such programmes. The majority of drug rehabilitation can and does take place in the community as part of an overall community care and rehabilitation programme. Within each health and social services board area provision exists to refer individuals to residential rehabilitation centres outside Northern Ireland if deemed to be clinically appropriate.

There has been a full match in 94.6 per cent. of cases and the Electoral office is currently pursuing the reason for mismatches with the remaining 5.4 per cent.

 No specific funding has been earmarked by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety for the provision of information leaflets on prostate cancer. However, the Chief Medical Officer&#039;s (CMO) report of 2003 included a short article on prostate cancer. This Report was issued with every copy of the three main Northern Ireland newspapers sold on a particular day. In the article, inter alia, doctors were advised to ensure that men who asked for a Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test were properly informed about it, including the benefits and downside of the test. In November 2003, in a CMO update, which is sent to all doctors in Northern Ireland, they were told about an information pack, &quot;Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme&quot;, available from the Department of Health (L). Included in this pack are a supply of information leaflets for men considering a PSA test. The CMO&#039;s report of 2004 reiterated this information.

Notes:<br>

1. A last minute cancellation is one that occurs on the day the patient was due to arrive, after they have arrived in hospital or on the day of their operation. For example, you are to be admitted to hospital on a Monday for an operation scheduled for the following day (Tuesday). If the hospital cancels your operation for non-clinical reasons on the Monday then this would count as a last minute cancellation. This includes patients who have not actually arrived in hospital and have been telephoned at home prior to their arrival.<br>

2. Some common non-clinical reasons for cancellations by the hospital include: ward beds unavailable; surgeon unavailable; emergency case needing theatre; theatre list over-ran; equipment failure; admin error; anaesthetist unavailable; theatre staff 



unavailable; and critical care bed unavailable. These examples are based on information from the Modernisation Agency&#039;s Theatres Project and do not necessarily cover all non-clinical reasons.<br>

 Consultation on revising the Government guidance on safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children, &quot;Working Together to Safeguard Children&quot; finished on 28 October. The Government plan to publish a revised version. The guidance is expected to make it clear that designated health professionals are a key part of local safeguarding arrangements and are a vital source of professional advice on child protection matters to other professionals, the primary care trust (PCT) and to the local authority children&#039;s services departments. Chapter three of that guidance is about the role of local safeguarding children boards (LSCBs), which will be set up under sections 13&#150;16 of the Children Act. Each strategic health authority, PCT, NHS trust or NHS foundation trust will be required to link up with the local authority and other key stakeholders, as set out in the Children Act 2004, who cover the same areas in order to establish a LSCB by April 2006.

This will provide PCTs with a measure of the overall commitment of their local dentists to NHS dental services, which could be used in the future to measure the overall commitment to the NHS.

1. Patients are included within the constituency area according to the postcode of the dental practice and not the patient&#039;s own home address.<br>

2. Most Personal Dental Service schemes that have registrations have a re-registration period in excess of 15 months, so the figures for PDS schemes are generally higher than they would have been for the same attendance pattern under General Dental Service.<br>

Data Quality:<br>

Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS Trusts and PCTs in England. The Health and Social Care Information Centre liaises closely with these organisations to 



encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Sickness absence rate is defined as the amount of time lost through absences as a percentage of staff time available.<br>

2. This does not cover maternity leave, carers leave or any periods of absence agreed under family friendly/flexible working policies.<br>

3. General practitioners and their staff are not included in the figures.<br>

4. The figures are estimates as some organisations in the NHS did not provide figures for sickness absence.<br>

 Four regional deliberative consultation events were held as part of the overall consultation which also included a citizens&#039; summit and events co-ordinated by local health and social care organisations, including the voluntary sector. We produced an online questionnaire, copies of which were available in hard copy, an assortment of languages, braille and easy read. An abbreviated questionnaire was published in the magazine &quot;Take-a-Break&quot; and in the national health service publications, &quot;Prime&quot; and &quot;Fit&quot;. Five policy taskforces of key stakeholders have been established to make recommendations on the policy options associated with the public&#039;s view and five academic seminars were organised.
