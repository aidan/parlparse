To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the total population of badgers in the UK; and in which areas the population is greatest.  [148650]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 English Nature advises that there are likely to be in the region of 300,000 to 400,000 badgers in Great Britain. This figure is derived from a National Badger Survey which took place in the mid-1990s.
<P>

<a name="40126w01.html_para0">The survey also reported that there had been a 77 per cent. increase in badger numbers between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. The increasing number of applications received by Defra for licences under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 (up 50 per cent. since 1999) suggest that this trend is continuing.
<P>

<a name="40126w01.html_para1">Badgers densities are highest in the south-west of England, with high densities present throughout southern counties, the west midlands and Wales.
<P>

<a name="40126w01.html_para2">The Department has been funding the Winter Mammal Monitoring Project which is being carried out by the Mammal Society and the British Trust for Ornithology. This is a pilot study intended to develop a multi-species terrestrial mammal monitoring system. The project is still at the pilot stage&#151;but is intended in the future to provide valuable data on the abundance of mammal species, including badgers. Early findings confirm the pattern of distribution report in the National Badger Survey.
<P>

<a name="40126w01.html_para3">Full details of the badger survey findings are published in: "Changes in the British badger population, 1988 to 1997" by G. Wilson, S. Harris and G. McLaren (1997), published by the People's Trust for Endangered Species (ISBN 1 85580 018 7).

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the impact of birds of prey eating and preying on other <i>(a)</i> birds, <i>(b)</i> mammals and <i>(c)</i> the food chain.  [149443]<P>

<P>
<a name="40126w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 A Raptor Working Group was set up in 1995, jointly chaired by the DETR and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, following increasing
<P>

<a name="40126w01.html_para5">concerns from grouse moor owners and racing pigeon fanciers over the impact of rising raptor populations on bird numbers. The recommendations from the Raptor Working Group's final report, published in 2000, 



<P>
<P><I>26 Jan 2004 : Column 2W</I><P>
provides the basis for and inform efforts to find an effective and acceptable solution to the problems caused by birds of prey.
<P>

<a name="40126w01.html_para6">Work is now being taken forward by the country conservation agencies, and other organisations. In addition, English Nature has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Moorland Association on addressing the issue of raptor predation in the uplands.
<P>

<a name="40126w01.html_para7">Implementation of the Working Group's report's recommendations in Scotland and Wales is a matter for the devolved Administrations. A paper on progress in implementing the recommendations of the Raptor Working Group Report was presented to the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, and noted by them, in September 2003. The paper is now publicly available on their website at: http://www.jncc.gov.uk/management/committee/papers03&#150;09/jncc03N06.pdf
<P>

<a name="40126w01.html_para8">Copies of the Raptor Working Group report are available from the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="40126w01.html_para9">Birds of prey are usually the top predators in their food chains. As with other predatory species, populations of birds of prey are normally heavily influenced by their prey populations rather than the other way around. The available evidence suggests that recovering populations of birds of prey are not responsible for recent declines in some songbirds and that other factors related to habitat change and the intensification of farming are mainly to blame. Although there is little specific information on the impact of birds of prey on mammal or other prey populations in the UK, the same general principle applies and population declines driven solely by predation are highly unlikely. Healthy bird of prey populations can exist only where their main prey species are sufficiently abundant.

<a name="40126w01.html_sbhd2"><H3 align=center>Bovine Tuberculosis</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of whether wild deer are responsible for the spread of TB to cattle.  [148655]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 In Great Britain, there is very limited evidence that deer have been responsible for transmitting tuberculosis to cattle. Wild deer in GB have generally been considered a sentinel or 'spill-over' host of infection in cattle and other wildlife, rather than the cause of it. Whether any wild deer populations (of any species) may constitute a reservoir of TB will depend upon the prevalence of TB, density and ecology of the hosts and the pathology that TB shows in those species.
<P>

<a name="40126w01.html_para10">Defra has funded a survey of wildlife in the Southwest of England by the Central Science Laboratory. The first phase established whether <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> (<i>M. bovis&#151;</i>the causative organism for bovine tuberculosis) was present in a number of wild mammal species, including deer. <i>M. bovis</i> has been confirmed in five of the six established wild and feral species of deer in GB. The second phase of the survey (due to end March 2004) is to estimate prevalence of <i>M. bovis</i> in those species where it is found, by carrying out a more targeted and extensive sampling.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the incidence of TB in cattle by 2008 if current measures are continued and there is no increase in activity by her Department; and what her projections are for costs of compensation for slaughter of cattle reactors in that period.  [148657]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Our latest assessment shows that bovine TB restrictions affected 5 per cent. of cattle herds (5,181 herds) in Great Britain at some point between January and November 2003. At any one point in time there are about 3 per cent. of herds under restriction.
<P>

<a name="40126w01.html_para11">The average annual increase in the number of animals slaughtered as a result of TB control measures between 1990 and 2001 was 20 per cent. It is too early to say whether this long-term trend has been altered by the interruption of the testing programme due to Foot and Mouth disease in 2001, and the priority testing of high-risk herds once the programme resumed.
<P>

<a name="40126w01.html_para12">In 2002/03 we paid out &#163;31.1 million in TB compensation. With no new changes in policy, or disease dynamics, we could theoretically expect a 20 per cent. year on year increase in the compensation bill.
<P>

<a name="40126w01.html_para13">However, the TB programme will not remain static over the next four years. We recently consulted on proposals to rationalise compensation arrangements for all notifiable diseases including bovine TB and we will shortly be consulting on proposals for a new TB strategy and options for controlling the geographical spread of the disease in the short term. The key challenge for Government and the farming industry will be to work together to reduce the overall economic impact of bovine TB.

<P>
<a name="40126w02.html_spnew3"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 No such 'standard' has been issued by the Government. In project appraisal guidance the Department sets out a range of indicative standards depending on land use. For intensively developed urban areas, the indicative target range is from 1 in 50 to 1 in 200 for river floodplains and 1 in 100 to 1 in 300 for areas at risk of coastal flooding. It should be emphasised that many houses situated behind defences with a nominal standard of, say, 1 in 50, will individually have a risk of flooding that is significantly less than this.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 protects all wild birds and certain animals from killing and taking. Under Section 11 of the 1981 Act free running snares are permissible provided that the snare is not placed in such a way to allow injury to any animal listed on Schedule 6 of the 1981 Act, which includes badgers. Section 11(3) makes it an offence to set in position, or knowingly cause or permit to set in position, any snare which is of such a nature and so placed as to be calculated to cause bodily injury to any wild animal. The snare must also be inspected at least once every 24 hours, so as to avoid any animal held in the snare suffering unnecessarily through starvation or dehydration. All non-target species must be released from the snare.
<P>

<a name="40126w02.html_para2">Free-running snares are not considered an indiscriminate means of either capture or killing provided they are set correctly and are checked every 24 hours. They are designed to be a restraining device that is intended to slacken, not continually tighten, thus not causing bodily injury.
<P>

<a name="40126w02.html_para3">The purpose of Section 11 is to expressly prohibit the use of indiscriminate means of capture and killing, in accordance with our international obligations, under the Bern Convention. Penalties for offences under Section 11, including not checking snares and not releasing non target species, include fines of up to &#163;5000 and/or a custodial sentence of up to six months for each offence. The Police are the main authority for enforcing this area of legislation.
<P>

<a name="40126w02.html_para4">The Department does not issue advice to gamekeepers on how snares should be set. However, the British Association of Shooting and Conservation has published a Code of Good Practice and the Game Conservancy Trust includes detailed guidance on best practice with all snares that they sell.
<P>

<a name="40126w02.html_para5">It is considered that a complete ban on the use of snares might encourage the use of more dangerous, indiscriminate and illegal alternatives, such as poisons. We have no current plans to alter the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 with regard to snares.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps she has taken to ensure that gardeners are aware of the <i>(a)</i> symptoms and <i>(b)</i> procedures for reporting cases of sudden oak death.  [149114]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Government believe that the public should have as much information as possible about <i>Phytophthora ramorum</i>, the disease known as sudden oak death in the USA. Information about the disease and how to report it is available on the Defra website at http://www.defra.gov.uk/planth/oak.htm. An explanatory leaflet and poster are also available and copies will be placed in the Library of the House. Officials are in regular contact with interested organisations, for example the Royal Horticultural Society and the Horticultural Trades Association, so that information about the disease, its symptoms and guidance on reporting any suspected cases of infection can be disseminated to their members. This information has also appeared in a number of recent press and magazine articles.
<P>

<a name="40126w02.html_para7">Because the symptoms are difficult to distinguish from those caused by other pathogens, we are not relying on public awareness but are carrying out our own surveys of garden centres and nurseries in order to detect infected plants.

 Inspectors from the Department's Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate (PHSI) have authority to detain, inspect and sample plants at ports to ensure that they meet import requirements and are not carrying disease. These inspections relate to a wide range of plant pests and pathogens, not just "Phytophthora ramorum" Any consignment found to be infected or not to have the correct documentation is destroyed. In carrying out these duties, the Inspectorate may call on help from Customs, port health authorities and port operators.

<P>
<a name="40126w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Both Defra and the Forestry Commission have published posters and placed information on their websites covering the horticultural and forestry sectors respectively.
<P>

<a name="40126w02.html_para9">Disease management measures are currently focused on nursery and garden centres to ensure that gardeners and other customers can be confident that they are purchasing disease-free plants. There is, as yet, no evidence that the disease is present on any trees in forests but a survey of 1000 woodland sites is currently underway and we hope, by April, to have a better understanding of the status of the disease in the wider environment. This work will enable us to ensure that appropriate advice is made available to foresters. In addition, the Forestry Commission is advising those engaged in routine forestry operations to take basic hygiene precautions to minimise the possibility of accidentally spreading diseases such as "P. ramorum".

<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 There is at present no evidence, from the UK or anywhere else, to indicate that any plants or trees infected by Phytophthora ramorum might recover. It is for this reason that the current measures require all infected material to be destroyed, either by burning or deep burial. Symptoms of "Phytophthora ramorum" can affect both leaves and stems. In some plants only leaves are affected and in these cases it is possible that plants could recover following the removal of affected leaves. Methods of eradicating infection from specimen plants and of protecting new growth from reinfection are being investigated as part of Defra and the Forestry Commission's programme of research into this disease.
<P>

<a name="40126w02.html_para10">Sporulation of the fungus on certain shrubs which are themselves relatively unaffected, showing only minor symptoms, is believed to have played a key role in the epidemiology of the disease in California.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) whether she has consulted the national authorities of other countries on the treatment of sudden oak death; and if she will make a statement; [149239]
<P>
<UL>(2) what information she has received from other countries about the treatment of sudden oak death. [149253]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w02.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 There is regular dialogue between plant health authorities in the UK and those in other countries affected by or at risk from "Phytophthora ramorum". It was as a result of this collaboration that the link was first made, even before the pathogen was identified, between the death of trees in California and symptoms seen on rhododendrons on the continent.
<P>

<a name="40126w02.html_para11">Exchange of information on Phytophthora ramorum takes place between officials and scientists in EU Member States on a regular basis, particularly within the framework of the Standing Committee on Plant Health. It was as a result of discussion in this forum that EU-wide emergency measures against the introduction and spread of "Phytophthora ramorum" were introduced in November 2002. They were reviewed by the Standing Committee on 11 December last year and it was agreed that they should continue. An EU funded research project on Phytophthora ramorum started this month and a second project is due to start in April. Both are being co-ordinated by UK scientists and involve consortia with members from 6 to 21 countries.
<P>

<a name="40126w02.html_para12">We have also had regular discussions with officials and scientists in the United States. A US delegation visited in November 2003 and a conference is being organised in the USA in March at which scientists and regulators from a number of countries, including the UK, will discuss developments in research and management of the disease.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will publish the results of research that her Department has commissioned into sudden oak death; what other research into sudden oak death her Department has assessed; and what research projects commissioned by her Department are on-going.  [149248]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w02.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The results of research conducted on this disease will be published over time. However some preliminary results are already available on the Defra website http://www.defra.gov.uk/planth/phnews/csl.htm. The Forestry Commission are conducting complementary research as part of the same overall programme.
<P>

<a name="40126w02.html_para13">As this is a relatively new disease the research commissioned in the UK following its discovery in October 2001 is still on-going. Within Europe, the majority of research is UK based. Germany and the Netherlands are also investigating aspects of the disease. Defra and Forestry Commission have good links with scientists in these countries and also with scientists in the USA facilitating a regular exchange of scientific information. As the pathotypes of the disease, the host plant species and the environmental conditions differ between the UK and the USA results may not be directly applicable and therefore must be considered carefully.

<P>
<a name="40126w02.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The only known method of eliminating "Phytophthora ramorum" is the removal and destruction of infected plant material. Currently approved fungicides have a suppressive effect, which masks symptoms rather than eradicating the pathogen from infected plants. However, research at Defra's Central Science Laboratory, funded by the Horticulture Development Council, is looking at a range of substances to evaluate their effectiveness in eradicating infection and preventing reoccurrence.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what her Department's budget is for the prevention of the spread of sudden oak death in 2003&#150;04.  [149254]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w02.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Defra's 75 Plant Health and Seeds Inspectors are already employed for around 20 per cent. of their time on inspection and surveillance duties related to Phytophthora ramorum, known in the USA as sudden oak death. Therefore, although there is no specific budget allocation, this amounts to an expenditure of approximately &#163;1.8 million in 2003&#150;2004.
<P>

<a name="40126w02.html_para18">In response to the growing number of findings of this pathogen in England and Wales, Defra is redeploying around 20 additional staff to assist the Inspectorate in undertaking extra inspections at production nurseries, wild planting areas and ports of entry. They will be supplemented by the recruitment of six additional full time Inspectors for 2004&#150;05. This is part of a package of measures announced on 4 December.
<P>

<a name="40126w02.html_para19">The Forestry Commission has diverted existing resources into a survey of woodlands thought to be at the highest risk of infection. This will cost in the region of &#163;45,000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w02.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Although P. ramorum is a 'notifiable disease', it is difficult to identify visually, and symptoms are similar to those caused by other organisms. We do not rely on reports in order to locate outbreaks. Defra's Plant Health and Seeds Inspectors are carrying out inspections of all known nurseries and garden centres which trade in susceptible plants. They are also surveying other areas where susceptible plants are established (e.g. rhododendrons in historic gardens), and co-ordinating with the Forestry Commission inspectors who are surveying woodlands. Since the first finding was confirmed in April 2002, outbreaks at individual sites in England and Wales have now reached 302.

 Phytophthora ramorum was first described as a new species in October 2001 and the first outbreak in the UK was not confirmed until April 2002.
<P>

<a name="40126w02.html_para20">130 cases of infection were confirmed in 2002 and 171 in 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether she intends to increase the amount of money spent by her Department on research into sudden oak death. [149257]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w02.html_spnew19"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 During this financial year additional money was allocated to the budget responsible for funding research on Phytophthora ramorum. The budget for the coming year has also been increased. The need for research on different plant health risks is regularly reviewed and any issues of redeployment of effort or funding addressed as necessary.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in which soil types sudden oak death has been found to flourish. [149258]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w02.html_spnew20"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 From limited findings on plants growing in soil in the UK (as opposed to container grown nursery stock), it is hard to draw any firm conclusions. Many of the most susceptible host plants of Phytophthora ramorum are members of the Ericaceae family which are known to prefer acid soil.

<a name="40126w02.html_wqn22"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the risk to <i>(a)</i> nurseries, <i>(b)</i> gardens and <i>(c)</i> the countryside from sudden oak death. [149262]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w02.html_spnew22"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 A Pest Risk Analysis (PRA) for the organism causing sudden oak death in California was first conducted in the UK by Forest Research in September 2000.
<P>

<a name="40126w02.html_para21">In November 2001 the causal organism was described as a new species, Phytophthora ramorum. Since that time research has been commissioned both in the UK and in the USA, the results of which are being used to develop the PRA, along with field observations from the UK, Europe and the USA.
<P>

<a name="40126w02.html_para22">The PRA has assessed the risks posed to naturally and experimentally susceptible plant species, including those raised on nurseries, grown in gardens and occurring naturally in the countryside.
<P>

<a name="40126w02.html_para23">The assessment is updated as scientific knowledge about this disease increases. Copies of the risk assessment were placed in the Library of the House on 13 February 2003 and updates have since been placed on the Defra website at http://www.defra.gov.uk/planth/pra.htm.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many <i>(a)</i> of her Department's staff and <i>(b)</i> sub-contractors employed by her Department are researching sudden oak death.  [149264]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w02.html_spnew23"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Department has commissioned several research projects into the disease at the Central Science Laboratory (an executive agency of Defra), Forest Research (an agency of the Forestry Commission) and ADAS Consulting. In total there are approximately 22 staff working on these research projects. Around 20 per cent. of the work of the Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate is currently spent on surveys aiming to determine the distribution of the pathogen and take action against it. This represents the equivalent of approximately 20 staff. A further twelve staff have been transferred from elsewhere in the Department to assist with the surveys.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w02.html_wqn24"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what measures she has taken to encourage research into the <i>(a)</i> effect and <i>(b)</i> spread of sudden oak death.  [149265]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w02.html_spnew24"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Since June 2002 the Department has commissioned research to the value of about &#163;391k to investigate aspects of the biology of the disease including its effect and means of transmission between plants. The research programme is co-ordinated with, other research funded by the Forestry Commission and the Horticultural Development Council in order to maximise the scientific information obtained about this disease. Approximately 20 per cent. of the work of Defra's Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate over the last year has been directed at surveillance for this pathogen.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w02.html_wqn25"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether her Department operates a compensation scheme for those affected by sudden oak death.  [149266]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w02.html_spnew25"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Plant disease campaigns over many years have not incorporated compensation for the destruction of affected plants. The one exception was the campaign against beet rhizomania disease from 1987 to 2001 when compensation was paid from an industry funded scheme. Our judgment is that the limited resources of the plant health service are better deployed in detecting and identifying outbreaks, and in carrying out research on risks and risk management measures. We have recently received an approach from industry organisations wishing to discuss possible risk-sharing mechanisms to avoid disproportionate losses to individual enterprises when action has to be taken against plant pests or diseases. We welcome this opportunity to explore the available options.

<P>
<a name="40126w03.html_spnew4"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 At the beginning of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR's) repatriation programme in April 2002, UNHCR's estimate of the Afghan refugee caseload in Iran was 1.5 million. Since then, over 500,000 people have returned to Afghanistan. Only five per cent. of these are believed to have originated in camps.
<P>

<a name="40126w03.html_para5">In Pakistan, the refugee caseload was estimated at 3.5 million in March 2002. Over 1.5 million were repatriated in 2002 and over 300,000 returned in 2003. The bulk of returnees so far, has consisted of refugees living in urban areas rather than camps. The 1.5 million remaining in Pakistan almost all live in camps.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w03.html_spnew5"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) as yet have no specific figures for the number of Afghans in refugee camps belonging to women-headed households. The most detailed information they can currently offer is that approximately 50 to 60 per cent. of refugees in camps in Pakistan are women and that five to 10 per cent. of these are of adult age. In Iran, only five per cent. of refugees live in camps, and of these, only 38 per cent. are women.
<P>

<a name="40126w03.html_para6">UNHCR, however, anticipate that more detailed information will become available over the next year. Elections in Afghanistan are planned for June 2004 and UNHCR is currently discussing ways to carry out voter registration for Afghan refugees with the Government of Pakistan and the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). This should start to shed more light on the make-up of the refugee population. UNHCR also has plans for a separate census, which the Government of Pakistan have asked them to carry out in order to get a better picture of the remaining refugee caseload in Pakistan. It is expected that this will be carried out after voter registration of refugees to avoid confusion. UNHCR believes this will provide an insight, among other things, into the number of women-headed households and their dependents.

 Meeting the needs of the growing number of orphans and vulnerable children in Africa is a challenge that the Department for International Development is determined to address effectively. DFID is continuing its work and discussions with the United Nations Joint Programme for HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) who are co-ordinating other development agencies and NGOs to develop: treatment programmes to prolong the lives of parents; free access to education and enhanced support to the families and communities caring for orphans and vulnerable children.

The UK will provide &#163;12.5 million to the World Health Organisation in 2003&#150;04 to support its work, including '3 by 5'. We have supported WHO to make the strengthening of health services a key part of their strategy to reach the '3 by 5' target. As treatment programmes are expanded it will be essential to invest in health systems in order to ensure that services for HIV, including voluntary counselling and testing and the provision of treatment, and other health services, are of good quality and accessible by poor communities and particularly women. This includes better co-ordination of public, private and NGO treatment initiatives. We also support community

The UK was a prime mover in setting up the High Level Forum on Health MDGs, which was held in Geneva in January 2004 and at which developing and donor countries discussed concrete actions to increase health service capacity to meet international development goals.

 Since the end of the conflict, United Nation High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has facilitated the return of relatively small numbers of Iraqi refugees.

<P>

<a name="40126w05.html_para10">UNHCR is not encouraging returns to Iraq because of insecurity in parts of the country, a lack of humanitarian access, and economic conditions that cannot support mass returns.

 Carlowrie Cat Stane is one of a number of Scheduled Ancient Monuments in the vicinity of Edinburgh Airport that were identified in the optioneering and appraisal studies that underpinned the Scottish Consultation Document. The Cat Stane was taken into account, alongside a range of other factors, in the design and appraisal of the options for a new runway at Edinburgh and the development of White Paper policy. The ancient monument would ultimately lie between a new runway and the existing one and is therefore unlikely to be affected by development. The necessary protection of the Cat Stane will be addressed in the master plan for the airport and any future planning application for the development of a new runway.

<a name="40126w09.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Since April 2001, when the Rail Regulator modified Railtrack's network licence to require the company to establish and maintain an asset register, the company has thoroughly reviewed the state of its asset knowledge, established the key principles of how its asset information strategy needs to improve its business planning processes and developed detailed plans to meet these business needs. Good progress is being made, and Network Rail is continuing to press ahead with the implementation of these plans.
<P>

<a name="40126w09.html_para1">Development of the asset register comprises a number of key elements. It is replacing many old databases with new systems that will provide access to integrated and consistent, company-wide data for the first time. In some cases, existing data systems can be maintained, but they are being overhauled to ensure that data are accurate and fully up to date.
<P>

<a name="40126w09.html_para2">Much of this work is highly detailed and requires a painstaking review of large volumes of data. Inevitably, this is time consuming, but good progress is being made. Some elements of the project are complete, while others, such as the new system for managing maintenance work known as MIMS <sup>1</sup> , are well developed and in the course of introduction. It is expected that MIMS will be fully implemented by April 2004.
<P>

<a name="40126w09.html_para3">As the asset register is being completed, new data collection and storage systems are being implemented, requiring significant changes to the culture of data management within Network Rail. Development will continue to take effect for many years, but it is expected that a fundamental milestone will be the completion of a baseline asset inventory which will contain accurate and fully up-to-date information about the key attributes of the network assets by mid-2005.

 The information requested is not collected in this format. Taking into account time spent per week on curriculum PE, outside lessons in term time and during the previous summer holidays, the results of Sport England's Young People and Sport National Surveys suggested that, on average, young people spent eight hours 23 minutes a week on sport and physical activity in 1999 and that this had decreased to eight hours 12 minutes a week by 2002. Data are now being collected for the first time&#151;for publication in April&#151;on the percentage of school children who spend a minimum of two hours each week on high-quality PE and school sport within and beyond the curriculum.

 None. The calculation of qualifying revenue is a matter for Ofcom acting in accordance with the provisions of the Broadcasting Act 1990. Ofcom (formerly the Radio Authority) is required to draw up and from time to time review a statement setting out the principles to be followed in calculating qualifying revenue. Before doing so, Ofcom must consult the Secretary of State and the Treasury. This statement was last reviewed in November 1995. I understand there are currently no plans for further revisions.

 The UK Film Council, the Government's strategic agency for film, has recently announced a comprehensive Distribution and Exhibition Strategy costing &#163;24 million over the next three years aimed at widening audiences for film and ensuring a broader and more diverse range of films is available.
<P>

<a name="40126w11.html_para0">&#163;14 million of this funding will be allocated, in partnership with the Arts Council of England, to a Digital Screen Network which will enable the exhibition of a wider range of films, through the provision of equipment enabling the digital exhibition of films.
<P>

<a name="40126w11.html_para1">The strategy also includes a Specialised Print and Advertising (P&A) Fund, with &#163;1 million per annum over the next three years, to assist distributors to widen the availability of films defined as "specialised". These are films characterised by an innovative cinematic style, or which engage with challenging subject matter, offering audiences a different experience of cinema from that provided by mainstream US studio-originated material. Support will be available under this fund to enable a distributor to increase the print run and media investment (P&A) for specialised films.
<P>

<a name="40126w11.html_para2">The &#163;1 million UK Film Distribution Programme is another strand of the strategy which is aimed at assisting distributors to increase the theatrical release of indigenous UK films that are aimed at a wide, commercial market.

<a name="40126w11.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Britain's royal heritage plays an important role in VisitBritain's work to promote Britain overseas as a tourism destination. Many of the publications and campaign materials produced by VisitBritain feature occupied Royal Palaces as well as historic buildings and castles with links to the monarchy. To celebrate the Golden Jubilee in 2002, VisitBritain published a map of 'Britain's Royal Heritage' featuring a foreword by HRH the Prince of Wales. In addition members of the royal family have supported the tourism industry through visits to VisitBritain's overseas offices and other promotional events such as Royal Tourism Day in June last year

 The Government are taking the issue of transparency of pay seriously. We believe that secrecy can perpetuate the gender pay gap. Employers must ensure that pay systems and practices do not lead to pay inequalities between men and women. This is particularly important with discretionary performance pay and bonuses. We have introduced the equal pay questionnaire to help people who think they have an equal pay problem find out from their employers whether this is the case. We believe that carrying out an equal pay review should be good business practice for every employer and have developed a number of initiatives to help them, including funding the Equal Opportunities Commission to develop equal pay toolkits. We are working in partnership with business, trade unions, the EOC and Opportunity Now to ensure that 35 per cent. of large employers have done pay reviews by 2006. We are also improving the way the Equal Pay Act works in practice and will be consulting shortly on proposals to speed up and simplify complex equal value cases.

 There is no central data collected on the information requested. It is a matter for each MCC whether joint training and other events take place in co-operation with local authorities and the police. In making these decisions MCCs will also take regard to the need to protect the judicial independence of the magistracy. Local Criminal Justice Boards (LCJB) are the forum through which such co-operation may be discussed and agreed. For example, we know of an LCJB which has been instrumental in developing a protocol on anti-social behaviour order matters which is used by all criminal justice service agencies.
<P>

<a name="40126w13.html_para2">LCJBs are run under a tripartite arrangement involving the Home Office, my Department and the Crown Prosecution Service and seek to include the chief officers from the Police, the Probation Service, Crown Prosecution Service, Crown and Magistrates' Courts, the Prison Service, and Youth Offending Teams.

<a name="40126w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Kamal Hossain, the Special Rapporteur, in accordance with Commission on Human Rights resolution 2002/19, visited Afghanistan three times in 2002. His last, ninth report, issued on 13 January 2003, focused on the impact on human rights of Afghanistan's transitional process started by the Bonn Agreement of December 2001.
<P>

<a name="40126w13.html_para3">There has been progress on a range of human rights issues since the Special Rapporteur's last report. Most recently, Articles 5, 7 and 58 of the new constitution, agreed on 4 January 2004, oblige the Afghan State to

<P><I>26 Jan 2004 : Column 53W</I><P>
protect human rights, ensure unity and equality among all ethnic groups, abide by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and establish an Independent Human Rights Commission to promote the advancement and protection of human rights. Chapter Two of the constitution has 38 Articles covering the Fundamental Rights and Duties of Citizens. These include Articles 22 and 43 which establish equal rights for all Afghans (both men and women), including access to free education up to degree level; and Article 34 which states that freedom of expression is inviolable.
<P>

<a name="40126w13.html_para4">The Afghan Transitional Administration and international community are committed to providing the security and resources needed to support implementation of the new constitution, and to develop effective mechanisms to tackle continuing human rights violations and abuses, including those against women.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w13.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Since Resolution 2002&#150;04 there have been a number of significant developments affecting women and girls in Afghanistan.
<P>

<a name="40126w13.html_para5">On 5 March 2003, Afghanistan publicly demonstrated its intention to restore full and equal rights for women by ratifying the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. In the same month, the EU sponsored a resolution on Afghanistan at the Commission on the Status of Women, welcoming the progress that Afghanistan has made to improve the situation for women and urging the Afghan Transitional Administration (ATA) to ensure that a legal framework, protecting women's rights, was put in place.
<P>

<a name="40126w13.html_para6">The Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on violence against women, submitted her report on the situation of women and girls in Afghanistan in October 2003. Many of the recommendations requiring action by the ATA were reflected in the new Afghan Constitution, agreed on 4 January 2004. 23 per cent. of the delegates to the Constitutional Loya Jirga were women from across Afghanistan. Articles 22, 43 and 44 of the new Constitution establish women's equal rights, including access to education; and place an obligation on the Afghan State to develop education programmes for women. By March 2003, the number of children attending the first day of school rose to 4.2 million: 37 per cent. of the students are girls, and a third of the teachers are women.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will assess the feasibility of resettling the population to those parts of British Indian Ocean Territory permitted to Chagossians under the Immigration Ordinance (British Indian Ocean Territory) dated 3 November 2002. [150188]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w13.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 A study by independent experts into the feasibility of resettlement of the Chagos islands was commissioned in April 2000. The report on the first phase of the study was completed in June 2000 and the report on the second phase, which incorporated findings from the first, was completed in June 2002. Copies of these reports are in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="40126w13.html_para8">The study concluded that short-term habitation for limited numbers would be possible but only on a subsistence basis while any long-term settlement would be precarious and costly. No final decisions have been taken on any further phase of this feasibility study.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w14.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 I frequently discuss the future of Cyprus with my European colleagues. We all agree on the desirability of an early settlement of the Cyprus problem so that a united island can join the EU on 1 May. This remains the Government's objective.

<a name="40126w14.html_wqn1"><B> Sir Nicholas Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of prospects for an agreement between Greece and Turkey on the issue of the future sovereignty of Cyprus when the island accedes to the European Union on 1 May and if he will make a statement.  [150034]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w14.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 The Government continue to believe that a settlement to the Cyprus problem is achievable by 1 May. But this will only be possible if all sides meet the requirements set down by the UNSG in April last year, and make a full and clear commitment to reach a settlement on the basis of the UNSG's proposals. Current indications give some cause for optimism. I was impressed during my recent visit to Turkey by the Turkish Government's determination to work for an early settlement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 The Government believe that the UNSG's proposals are the only basis for a just, lasting and comprehensive settlement to the Cyprus problem. The proposals are the product of involvement by the UN over many years. I can see no other solution that can adequately satisfy the legitimate concerns of all sides (including Greece and Turkey) on the island's future.

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary met the Greek Foreign Minister on 22 January 2004. The Greek ambassador was present. The Foreign Secretary has not had a substantive meeting with the Turkish ambassador so far this year. But we are in very close contact with the Turkish embassy, and with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Ankara. I met the Turkish ambassador on 21 January. The future of Cyprus was one of the main topics of discussion in all of these meetings.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 Our first priority regarding Cyprus is to work for a just, lasting and comprehensive settlement. We believe the best, and only realistic, way of achieving this is through the continued efforts of the United Nations. We are actively encouraging all sides to meet the UN Secretary General's requirements for an early resumption of negotiations based on the UNSG's proposals, so that a united Cyprus can join the EU on 1 May 2004.

 We take a keen interest in supplies to countries of proliferation concern, whatever the source. But the UK Government do not directly monitor sales of nuclear-related technology by Canada and France.

We are concerned that the political dispute between President Kumaratunga and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe could have a detrimental effect on the process at a crucial stage. We continue to impress upon the two leaders the importance of resolving the underlying issues in a transparent way and of finding a rapid and positive way forward so that peace talks can resume as soon as possible. We are working closely with international partners to reinforce these messages. We are encouraged that the ceasefire continues to hold and we welcome the continued commitments of the President, Prime Minister and of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to the ceasefire and the peace process.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence in what circumstances his Department provides legal assistance to reservists to seek redress when they have lost their employment allegedly as a consequence of mobilisation; and if he will make a statement.  [148932]<P>

<P>
<a name="40126w17.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence does not provide legal advice or representation to reservists seeking reinstatement to their civilian employment under the terms of the Reserve Forces (Safeguard of Employment) Act 1985. It does, however, provide advice to reservists on their legal right to reclaim their civilian employment and how to seek reinstatement. Each reservist receives a copy of JSP 532, "Guidance for Reservists Returning to Civilian Employment Following a Period of Mobilised Service". The Supporting Britain's Reservists and Employers (SaBRE) campaign team provides a help line and a website which gives additional information and advice.

<P>
<a name="40126w17.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 Since the launch of the SaBRE campaign in October 2002, there have been two substantial pieces of independent research on the impact and effectiveness of the campaign, both commissioned through COI Communications. The reports found that while employers' awareness of the campaign in its first year of existence was low, over 60 per cent. of companies who had been in contact with SaBRE felt that that contact had been positive and worthwhile. The lessons we learn from both these and future studies will form a central part of future SaBRE campaign activity.

 The UK Government recognise the need for a review of the current preferential rules of origin. Support for less onerous regulations on rules of origin is outlined in the Government's 2000 White Paper, "Eliminating World Poverty: Making Globalisation Work for the Poor".
<P>

<a name="40126w19.html_para1">With a number of ACP regions now having reached the stage of launching Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) negotiations with the EU, there is an increased focus on some of the detailed issues facing EPAs, including rules of origin. An experts meeting on rules of origin for EPAs is planned for February 2004 in Brussels.
<P>

<a name="40126w19.html_para2">More generally on the issue of preferential rules of origin, the Commission (DG TAXUD) is consulting widely on this issue through its recently published Green Paper, "Future of Rules of Origin in Preferential Trade Agreements".

 The credit facility is a loan facility to British Energy that must be repaid by the company under the terms of the restructuring plan. It has been provided in respect of only the company's working capital requirements and cash collateral for its trading activities. A commercial rate of interest of 1 per cent. over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is chargeable on amounts drawn for working capital, and a fee of 1 per cent. per annum on amounts drawn for cash collateral. The maximum amount available under the facility was &#163;650 million but now stands at &#163;200 million. As I said in my reply to my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Anne Picking) on 14 January 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> column 780W, British Energy have repaid all outstanding amounts under the credit facility.

(3) what assessment her Department has made of the impact of current Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service guidance relating to bullying and harassment in the workplace.  [147903]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w19.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 The Government take bullying at work very seriously and believe that employees should be able to work without fear of being bullied or harassed by employers, fellow employees or anybody else.
<P>

<a name="40126w19.html_para3">There is a safety net of legislation already in existence that employees can turn to. This includes the: Sex Discrimination Act, Race Relations Act, Disability Discrimination Act, Protection from Harassment Act, Health and Safety Act, Employment Rights Act and the Employment Act 2002.
<P>

<a name="40126w19.html_para4">In addition New Employment Equality Regulations came into force last December protecting those experiencing discrimination, harassment and victimisation at work on grounds of sexual orientation or religion or belief. We are working to support the dissemination of high quality best practice information on the new regulations to employers, individuals and&#151;importantly&#151;advice giving organisations and agencies through the funding we have allocated in the current financial year.
<P>

<a name="40126w19.html_para5">The Health and Safety Executive are producing a set of management Standards. The Standards are designed to provide a yardstick for organisations by which they can gauge the levels of stress and other associated problems among staff thereby helping them to identify where action is required. One of these, the Relationship Management Standard, focuses on bullying.
<P>

<a name="40126w19.html_para6">Assisting with the development of best practice operations is a group, under ACAS management called Race and Equality Advisory Service (REAS). This team of advisers deliver practical, best practice equality advice to organisations. This complements ACAS's wider role of providing services to organisations to help their businesses to flourish.
<P>

<a name="40126w19.html_para7">Continuing the promotion of best practice is the Partnership at Work Fund administered by DTI. This has provided grants to support organisations wishing to focus on best practice initiatives specifically encouraging employees and employers to work together to resolve issues. A number of projects have focused on reducing bullying, while others have included it as part of their wider objectives.
<P>

<a name="40126w19.html_para8">Bullying and harassment is an area of growing importance in the work of ACAS. It uses multiple channels for dissemination of guidance including: publications (available in hard copy and through the internet); face to face training and seminars; advice via the ACAS National Helpline; and also more in depth focused work within workplaces Two publications&#151;'Bullying and Harassment: A Guide for Managers and Employers' and 'Bullying and Harassment: A Guide for Employees' with an annual distribution of approximately 26,000 copies offer guidance and form the basis of training programmes and seminars organised by ACAS.




<P>
<P><I>26 Jan 2004 : Column 79W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40126w19.html_para9">In 2003, around 200 seminars and training events were run focusing on the subject of bullying and harassment. The feedback from delegates to ACAS events is overwhelmingly positive with, across the board, 97 per cent. reporting that they were satisfied with the quality and content of their training. Follow up work with delegates in 2003, around 200 seminars and training events were run focussing on the subject of bullying and has also shown that the guidance offered by ACAS has positive and lasting benefits with 60 per cent. saying that they review policy and practice after attending ACAS events and around a third actually implemented change or introduced new policies after attending events.
<P>

<a name="40126w19.html_para10">The ACAS National Helpline also plays an important role in disseminating guidance. Around 600 calls are received monthly on this issue. Overall the feedback on the helpline is found to be extremely beneficial with 92 per cent. reporting satisfaction with the service received from the Helpline and 84 per cent. of callers reporting that they found the information provided was valuable in fully answering their inquiry.

 Following a small pilot in 1986, the full Smart scheme was launched in 1988. Initially, there was no separately identifiable funding allocation for the scheme within the larger "Innovation Budget" which provided funds for several other schemes.

The SPUR scheme was introduced in 1991 and merged with Smart in 1997. Since that time there has been a separate provision for the expanded Smart. Expenditure on Smart will occur for several years yet as existing projects progress. Provision, where separately identified, and expenditure were as follows:

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what quantitative assessment she has made of the impact of dumping of agricultural produce by developed countries on the economies and living standards of developing countries.  [146639]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w21.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The best source of information on this topic are the large number of studies which have already been undertaken by international organisations such as the World Bank, IMF, UNCTAD and the OECD, and by charitable organisations such as Oxfam. The work of these organisations demonstrates through individual case studies the adverse effects which dumping of subsidised agricultural products on world markets can have on developing country economies. It remains, however, very difficult to make an accurate quantitative economic assessment of the overall impact of dumping of subsidised agricultural produce on developing country markets. The World Bank have, however, estimated that the comprehensive reform of all aspects of agricultural policies in developed countries could boost the income of developing countries by as much as $100 billion.

Where an interim payment has been paid previously&#151;for example, on the basis that the claimant has previously received a DWP payment for respiratory disease&#151;the Department will reassess the claim after having completed interim payments to those claimants who have received no payments, and will ensure that compensation is topped up to the equivalent of 75 per cent. of estimated British Coal share of general damages.

The Government's Memorandum and response to the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee inquiry (UK Science and Europe: Value for Money?) in 2003 outlined evidence for the benefit to the UK. The Government are examining these issues further in preparation for negotiation of the next programme. UK businesses benefit from participation in the programme in terms of funding, gaining access to European markets and researchers and participation/risk sharing in R&D on cutting edge technologies.

On 2 February I will be hosting a roundtable on offshoring with companies and organisations interested in offshoring issues.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In all cases falling under the "old scheme" where the resident parent (that is, the parent with care) is not receiving a prescribed benefit or Tax Credit, the Agency will seek to verify that parent's financial circumstances. Specifically we will ask the parent with care for evidence of their earnings and any other income, as well as their housing costs. We will do this whether or not the parent with care has a partner and whether or not the non-resident parent has applied for a departure.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It may help you to know that, under the "old scheme", if the parent with care has a partner, the Agency will ask for verification of that partner's income only if they share a child. This is because the only relevance of the partner's income is in determining whether we should make full allowance for the shared child in the parent with care's exempt income, or whether the partner can contribute to the support of the child. Under the revised Child Support scheme the Agency does not take into account the financial circumstances of the parent with care in any way.</FONT></UL>

 Quantitative assessment of the Gateway process is provided to OGC's Supervisory Board three times yearly. In addition, the National Audit Office are currently compiling details of the value for money benefits to projects of the OGC Gateway review process.

<a name="40126w28.html_para4">This assessment shows that use of the OGC Gateway process leads to a significant improvement in likelihood of success for all procurement projects and programmes&#151;including IT-enabled&#151;and this improvement is particularly marked where the process is applied to projects or programmes in their early stages.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The results of the 2001 Census showed that the mid-year population estimates had over-estimated the population of the UK over the previous decade. Subsequent research showed that this was partly because net migration into the country had been over-estimated. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) made several improvements to the methodology for estimating total international migration, making fuller use of the available sources. The improved methodology was used to produce the international migration estimates for 2001, and was also applied retrospectively from 1992 onwards in order to produce revised total international migration estimates for the inter-censual decade. ONS released final revised international migration estimates for 1992&#150;2001 in June 2003. The revised methodology was used again to produce the 2002 international migration estimates published in November 2003, which are available on the National Statistics website at the following address: http://www.statistics.gov.uk/pdfdir/inme1103.pdf</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It was already recognised that international migration is the hardest component of population change to measure before the results of the 2001 Census were published. A National Statistics Quality Review of international migration statistics was initiated in March 2002. This was aimed at identifying the means of making the required improvements to the reliability and comprehensiveness of international migration statistics. The National Statistics Quality Review report was published on the National Statistics website in September 2003. Following the publication of this report, ONS produced an implementation plan for taking forward the review's recommendations. This was published on the National Statistics website in January 2004. Both the review and the implementation plan are available at the following address: http://www.statistlcs.gov.uk/methods quality/quality review/population.asp</FONT></UL>

<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w29.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Gordon Brown: </B> 
 I am delighted to inform the House that on 20 January EU Finance Ministers agreed to base the new Lamfalussy committee of banking supervisors ('CEBS') in London. The equivalent committee for securities supervisors ('CESR') will continue to be based in Paris and that for insurance ('CEIOPS') will be based in Frankfurt. The location of these regulatory committees in Europe's major financial centres is a good outcome for the UK and for financial markets in the EU. This high-level committee of EU banking supervisors and central banks will be a key forum for national authorities to improve supervisory practices and advance the EU's legislative agenda. It should help ensure that more flexible EU legislation is adopted quicker, with improved consultation, transparency, and greater input from market practitioners. This should help drive forward the EU Financial Services Action Plan, providing Europe with a more dynamic, innovative, efficient and competitive financial services sector, to the benefit of consumers and businesses. The banking committee will meet at least three times a year, and should meet in London for the first time in the spring. It has already assumed its responsibilities and is currently looking to secure permanent offices in London. The committee is currently chaired by Jose Maria Roldan, Director General of the Bank of Spain, and around forty senior regulators and central bankers will participate in its meetings.

Recent research by the Centre for Economics and Business Research for the Liverpool Victoria Friendly Society suggested a much higher average cost of &#163;140,000, which includes spending on both 'necessities' and 'luxuries'.

<a name="40126w31.html_para7">We recognise the particular vulnerability of disabled children to abuse, which increases when, as a result of their disability, children are unable to communicate abuse. That is why Government guidance on safeguarding children, including Working Together to Safeguard Children (1999) and Framework for the Assessment of Children in Need Practice Guidance (2000), highlights the need to promote a high level of awareness of this increased vulnerability and sets out measures that should be taken to strengthen the capacity of disabled children and their families to communicate abuse.

 Section 17 of the Children Act 1989 sets out the duties of local authorities for safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children in need, including disabled children. Services for disabled children and their families are provided through local authorities, the health service and the voluntary sector. These services help to support families safeguard children and improve their life chances. Support services include short term breaks; day care; home help; domiciliary care; nursing and medical support; social events and outings for parents and children, as well as advice, guidance and counselling. In cases where there are concerns about possible abuse and neglect of disabled children, support services should work closely with local child protection services to ensure that all necessary steps are taken to safeguard the child.

 We have not had specific representations about abuse of disabled adults. However, the Department of Health liaises closely with a number of organisations who represent vulnerable adults and the Government is aware of their concerns in this area.
<P>

<a name="40126w31.html_para10">The abuse of vulnerable adults is of great concern to the Government. We have already instigated a range of general measures, such as the National Service Framework for Older People and National Minimum Standards for particular aspects of service provision, to raise the standards of care of older people and other vulnerable adults. It has implemented specific measures to tackle abuse, principally "No Secrets" guidance, which councils, the NHS and police forces have used to establish and strengthen their local procedures for preventing and tackling abuse. By June 2004, we intend to introduce the Protection of Vulnerable Adults list, which in practice will amount to a workforce ban on those who have abused or mistreated vulnerable adults in their care.
<P>

<a name="40126w31.html_para11">The Department for Education and Skills regularly receives correspondence from parents and voluntary groups about issues affecting disabled children including child protection. This has included reports from the NSPCC, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, and the National Working Group on Child Protection and Disability, which have influenced policy development. In particular, recent representations from the NSPCC were taken into account by the Disabled Children's External Working Group developing standards as part of the National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity Services which will be published later this year.

 There are 149 Children's Fund partnerships in England. These are listed in the annexe together with their lead and accountable bodies. The programme was launched in November 2001 and runs until March 2006. Each partnership is made up of representatives from the voluntary and statutory sector.

<a name="40126w32.html_para7">Children's Fund partnerships will continue to receive grants for 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06. These grants will enable the partnerships to continue to deliver preventive services for five to 13-year-olds in their area. In the early years of the programme the Partnerships under spent their allocations. To avoid this recurring partnerships were allowed to increase their planned commitment with increased allocations and monies used for other initiatives for five to 13-year-olds. However, it has become clear that the partnerships have been more effective in their spending, to the point that they are

spending more closely to profile. In order to avoid over-spends, not permitted under Government accounting, the Department is taking action now so as to reduce the levels of over-commitment without damaging the programmes already in place.

<a name="40126w32.html_para10">In a letter to all partnerships before Christmas the Department also explained that there was over-commitment in the programme and that there will therefore be some reduction in allocations for 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 in order that the programme can spend within its limits. Officials are currently assessing the extent of over-commitment in the programme. I expect this work to be completed by the end of January so that we can confirm partnerships' allocations for 2004&#150;05. Until then we have advised partnerships not to commission any new services.

<a name="40126w32.html_para11">There has not been any closure of Children's Fund partnerships. It is a key characteristic of the fund that decisions on which services to commission are taken locally, not by central Government, against the aims and objectives of the Children's Fund programme.

<a name="40126w32.html_para12">We advised partnerships that where our decisions at the mid-year review had compromised partnerships' ability to their meet contractual obligations, we would revisit them. Furthermore, we set aside money to assist with this and to ensure that there was no premature closure of projects. The Children's Fund regional teams have been discussing the detailed implications with partnerships and I expect the process to be complete by the end of January.

 None. There is no evidence of which the Department is aware that further education providers are considering withdrawal from Work Based Learning for Young People (WBL) on a large scale. Further education providers currently deliver around 20 per cent. of WBL provision and are an important and valued means of delivering such learning to young people. Further education providers are now funded by the Learning and Skills Council, the body responsible for planning and funding all post-16 learning (other than higher education).

 I have not commissioned such research. Since the introduction of tuition fees in 1998, demand for places on medical courses has continued to outstrip significantly the number of places, despite an increase in the number of places available. Between 1999 and 2001, plans for some 2,250 more medical school places in the UK were announced. As a result of the extra investment, the number of students entering medical school will increase to over 7,300 in 2005. The number of UK applicants to study medicine at UK universities is also at its highest since 1986 (the earliest year for which data is available).
<P>

<a name="40126w33.html_para7">We do not anticipate any significant impact on demand for medical courses after the introduction of variable fees. The Department of Health will, however, be monitoring demand for, and take-up of, places on medical courses.

 I have not commissioned such research. Medical students do not have to repay student loans until they graduate and earn over &#163;15,000 per year. Doctors earn considerably in excess of the national average: a newly qualified GP can expect to earn over &#163;45,000, and will receive considerably more than that in time. Consultants will earn even more. So medical graduates will be able to pay off their student loan for living costs and for tuition fees comparatively rapidly.
<P>

<a name="40126w33.html_para8">If, despite the high salary levels generally, some doctors who work part time or take career breaks pay off their student loans more slowly, the student support proposals announced by my right. hon.

 <i>[holding answer 20 January 2004]:</i> The current Higher Education Initial Participation Rate (HEIPR) is 43.9 per cent. for 2001/02.
<P>

<a name="40126w33.html_para9">The HEIPR covers English-domiciled 17 to 30-year-old first-time entrants to Higher Education courses who remain on their course for six months or more.
<P>

<a name="40126w33.html_para10">The HEIPR will replace the Initial Entry Rate (IER) as the way that we measure progress toward 50 per cent. A time-series of HEIPR figures will be published in Spring 2004.
<P>

<a name="40126w33.html_para11">The IER was recently quality-reviewed under guidelines issued by the Office for National Statistics. The review (published in November 2003) concluded that the IER was "basically robust" <sup>1</sup>  but highlighted some minor shortcomings which the HEIPR corrects for. More detail can be found in the report of the review, a copy of which has been placed in the House of Commons Library.

 The Government's national Skills Strategy, published in July 2003, emphasises the need for all relevant agencies to work together collaboratively in support of the skills agenda. We are committed to building strong and effective Regional Skills Partnerships, which will enable Regional Development Agencies, local Learning and Skills Councils, and other key stakeholders to work together to deliver skills, training, business support and employment services. The partnerships will help take forward the priorities identified in the regional economic strategies.
<P>

<a name="40126w34.html_para1">Elected Regional Assemblies also have an important role in training and skills, and in our White Paper 'Your Region, Your Choice' we set out proposals for each Assembly to appoint two members to the Board of each local LSC in its region, and for the national LSC to consult Assemblies on its guidance to local LSCs.

This was carried out between August 2002 and March 2003 by the Thomas Coram Research Unit at the Institute of Education, University of London, and will be published on the Home Office website shortly. The evaluation recognised that Parentline Plus provides a good quality helpline service to over 60,000 callers pa (three quarters of whom were first-time callers), and that further expansion in the helpline service is necessary to meet demand from callers. The charity makes significant use of trained volunteers.

In no case has there been a direct contractual relationship with an offshore company for an IT or call centre related contract.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how much <i>(a)</i> revenue and <i>(b)</i> capital funding each local education authority has been allocated by the Department to establish pupil referral units.  [148430]<P>

<P>
<a name="40126w35.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Miliband </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 January 2004]</i>: The Department does not allocate funding specifically for the setting up or maintaining of pupil referral units. Local education authorities receive revenue funding for pupils with high cost needs through the high cost pupil sub-block of the Education Formula Spending Share. The proportion of pupils with high cost needs is estimated for each authority using population data, children in families in receipt of Income Support and low birth weight.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills whether a school governing body can refuse to accept delegation from a local education authority of responsibility for the school meals service.  [150028]<P>

<P>
<a name="40126w35.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 22 January 2004]:</i> The effect of the Education (Transfer of Functions Concerning School Lunches etc.) (England) (No. 2) Order 1999 is that when a school's budget share includes funding for meals, the statutory duties to provide school lunches (including free school meals for eligible pupils), and to comply with nutritional standards, are transferred to the school's governing body. The governing body cannot refuse. In Essex funding is delegated in budget shares for all schools and consequently the statutory duties rest with the schools' governing bodies. If the authority provides a 'buy-back' service a school may choose to purchase that from the authority; if it does not, the school governing body must make alternative provision. The Department is in touch with Essex County Council regarding support for schools as the current contract comes to an end.

<a name="40126w35.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 Local education authorities have a duty to provide free and paid for school meals that meet nutritional standards. Where a school has a delegated budget for meals, this duty becomes the responsibility of the governing body. From April 2000, funding for school meals was delegated to all secondary schools. Primary and special schools can opt for delegation.

<P>
<a name="40126w35.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 22 January 2004]:</i> The Department has provided funding and is working closely with LEAs to support them in ensuring they have an infrastructure for management information systems in all their maintained schools, including those schools working collaboratively with other educational institutions or those within a federated structure. Total funding is &#163;30 million via LEAs in 2001&#150;02 and &#163;7 million supplementary in 2002&#150;03. Collaborative working is also supported in the form of access to on-line communities through the National College of School Leadership's Talk2Learn facility and will be part of a single annual conversation with the education system on targets, priorities and support and improved data flows.

<sup>(36)</sup> New student support arrangements were introduced from academic year 1998/99. New students in 1998/99 (apart from certain specified exceptions) received support for maintenance expenditure through means-tested grants (comprising about a quarter of the support available) and non income-assessed student loans (comprising about three quarters of the support available). From 1999/2000 students who entered higher education after 1998/99 received support for maintenance expenditure through loans, of which approximately three quarters of the value was non income-assessed. Loans made under these arrangements are repayable on an income contingent basis.<P>

 Based on the current student cohort we estimate about 30 per cent. of English and Welsh students will benefit from the full grant when it is introduced in the 2004/05 academic year. Approximately a further 10 per cent. of students should benefit from a partial grant. I refer my hon. Friend to the Regulatory Impact Assessment, published on 8 January, which sets out the costs of increasing the grant to &#163;1,500 a year from 2006/07. Copies of the Regulatory Impact Assessment were placed in the Library of the House it is also available on the Department for Education and Skills website.

 The following table shows the constituencies in Yorkshire and Humberside that have operational Sure Start local programmes, Early Excellence Centres, neighbourhood nurseries and children's centres based within them. Figures for neighbourhood nurseries however are changing by the day as new settings open.

 <i>[holding answer 21 January 2004]:</i> There are 524 Sure Start local programmes delivering services to children under 4 and their families in the most disadvantaged areas of the country. They aim to achieve better outcomes for children, parents and communities by increasing the availability of child care, improving health, education and emotional development for young children, and supporting parents as parents and in their aspirations towards employment. Services to meet these aims are designed in consultation with families in the area to ensure they reflect local needs.

 The funding, content and standards required of courses of initial teacher training provided by Welsh institutions are matters for the National Assembly for Wales. Courses funded by the Department for Education and Skills through the Teacher Training Agency and which lead to the award of Qualified Teacher Status by the General Teaching Council for England are governed by the Education (School Teachers' Qualifications) (England) Regulations 2003. These require that any periods of practical experience undertaken as part of a course of initial teacher training in England must take place wholly or mainly at schools in England, but do not preclude some periods of teaching experience taking place elsewhere. The same regulations provide for the automatic recognition in England of teaching qualifications awarded by the General Teaching Council for Wales.

 The information requested is not currently available at national level. Officials within DfES are currently identifying ways in which this data can be collected. At the meeting of the Technical Working Group on Personal Social Services Statistics, held on 23 October 2003, it was agreed that the question "Was the young person a parent at 31 March (if female)" would be included in the SSDA903 return for 2004&#150;05. In addition, the Technical Working Group agreed that other questions for future returns and detailed guidance be referred to an ad hoc Working Group for further consideration. The newly established Working Group will assess the feasibility of obtaining information about births among young people in and leaving care and identify methods for collecting this information, taking account of legal and confidentiality considerations.

 There are no formal mechanisms to monitor or enforce the Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal's decisions on special educational needs appeals or disability claims.

Identifying sites for additional housing, which would include developments for both private housing, affordable housing and homes for key workers, is one of the key priorities for English Partnerships.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what measures he has taken to ensure that new housing estates are not built on land that is prone to flooding; and what plans he has for further measures.  [150381]<P>

<a name="40126w38.html_spnew12"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The Government's policy requirements for England have been given in Planning Policy Guidance Notes 3 "(Housing)" and 25 "(Development and Flood Risk)". PPG25 categorises the suitability of land for various types of development, including housing, of the basis of the flood risk maps issued by the Environment Agency. The policies in PPG25 are due to be reviewed later this year against possible developments in flood risk assessments since it was issued in 2001.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what percentage of social housing is owned and operated by private housing foundations; and what plans he has for the further transfer of social housing to such foundations.  [150382]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w38.html_spnew13"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 In 2003 the breakdown between social housing owned by registered social landlords and local authorities was 41.4 per cent. and 58.6 per cent. respectively. The transfer of local authority housing to registered social landlords remains one of the three options available to local authorities where additional resources are required to deliver decent homes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w38.html_spnew14"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The duty to carry out on-going repairs and maintenance as well as any necessary major improvement works to a home lies with the local authority landlord rather than the tenant. Certain small, urgent repairs which are likely to affect the tenant's health, safety or security are covered by the 'Right to Repair', which means that by law, these must be carried out by the local authority quickly and at no cost to the tenant.
<P>

<a name="40126w38.html_para6">However, through their tenancy agreement, tenants may have responsibilities to carry out certain types of repair or to behave in a way which does not cause nuisance or annoyance to neighbours. The Council Tenant's Charter, published by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is readily available to councils and tenants and provides further details of the rights and responsibilities of council tenants.

 The Housing Corporation and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister hold data on rents paid by tenants, but only at the level of the average rent paid to RSLs/LAs for each bedroom category. However, the information requested is not held centrally, and could only be provided at disproportionate cost.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has received two representations from Taunton Deane borough council on the provisional local government finance settlement 2004&#150;05, which include comments on the transfer of funding for rent allowances and council tax benefit (CTB) to the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP).
<P>

<a name="40126w39.html_para0">In order to make a fair comparison, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has assessed what Formula Grant the authority would have received in 2003&#150;04 had the transfer of benefits taken place in the previous year. On this basis the Revenue Support Grant (RSG) plus National Non-Domestic Rates (NNDR) will increase by 3.3 per cent.
<P>

<a name="40126w39.html_para1">In 2003&#150;04 Taunton Deane received &#163;3.458 million in RSG and &#163;3.579 million in NNDR. Under the Government's proposals for 2004&#150;05, Taunton Deane receives &#163;3,680 million in RSG and &#163;2,824 million in NNDR.

Of these, two were withdrawn by the appellant and in five cases the flooding objection was resolved before the appeal decision.
<P>

<a name="40126w40.html_para0">In four cases (8 per cent.), appeals for minor development were allowed contrary to advice from the Environment Agency. Six appeals (12 per cent.) were allowed with the agency's objections fully mitigated through planning conditions and 33 appeals (66 per cent.) were dismissed, 30 of which were for minor developments. 28 cases are reported as dismissed using agency advice and five as dismissed not using Agency advice.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="40126w40.html_para1">The Social Exclusion Unit report on reducing re-offending by released prisoners, published in July 2002, recommended that the Government develop and implement a National Rehabilitation Strategy involving all relevant departments and agencies. In response, the Home Office has set up two inter-departmental groups of Ministers and officials to develop an action plan planned for publication in early 2004. Its work strands include finance and benefits; drugs; health; employment, training and education; children and families; and accommodation.
<P>

<a name="40126w40.html_para2">Within the accommodation strand, the Home Office, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM), and the Department for Work and Pensions are working together to devise an accommodation strategy for offenders. This will aim initially to increase the number of people leaving prison with some form of accommodation arranged. Its longer terms aims will be: to assess and identify the particular accommodation needs of each offender; to enable offenders to maintain or, where appropriate/to close down their accommodation while in 



<P>
<P><I>26 Jan 2004 : Column 167W</I><P>
custody; and to develop systems that enable offenders to access appropriate and sustainable housing options on release. The strategy will encompass the roles and responsibilities of the correctional services, local authorities and other housing providers, the voluntary sector and Jobcentre Plus. Pilots are currently being developed to test how best to join up these services, working initially with street crime offenders.
<P>

<a name="40126w40.html_para3">The strategy will build on some important provisions already in place in the community and custody: the Homelessness Act 2002; the Homelessness (Priority Need for Accommodation) (England) Order 2002; the Supporting People programme; and the Prison Service's Custody to Work Initiative.

The average annual increase in resources for personal social services of six per cent, over these three years is consistent with this target. It is for local councils to use these increased resources to ensure that the right amount and range of care is made available, taking account of local circumstances and priorities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what assessment he has made of the impact population growth will have on Chorley and South Ribble primary care trust; and what extra monies will be made available;  [148214]
<P>
<UL>(2) what extra staff and funding at Chorley Hospital he plans to make available to meet population growth in Chorley;  [148215]

<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w44.html_spnew1"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 An assessment of the impact of population growth on the local health economy has been made by Lancashire Teaching Hospitals National Health Services Trust. It is noted from population forecasts provided by local councils that the population is due to decline slowly over the 10 years from 2001. There is no perceived impact on the local health economy, including Chorley and South Ribble Primary Care Trust (PCTs), or Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust and its services across Chorley, South Ribble or Preston, and Chorley Hospital in particular.
<P>

<a name="40126w44.html_para0">For each round of allocations, the weighted capitation formula used to inform funding for PCTs is updated to take account of the best available measure of population from the Office for National Statistics.
<P>

<a name="40126w44.html_para1">Revenue allocations for PCTs covering the period 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06 were announced on 11 December 2002. There are no plans to revisit these allocations.
<P>

<a name="40126w44.html_para2">Any changes in population figures will be used for the next round of allocations. We will commence preparatory work on the next round of allocations early this year.

<P>
<a name="40126w44.html_spnew2"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 114 healthy living centres&#151;167 in the United Kingdom&#151;are providing activities covering diet and nutrition and 207 healthy living centres&#151;282 in the UK&#151;are offering physical and sporting activities. A substantial number of health living centres are addressing all of these: diet, nutrition and physical activity. Healthy living centres are funded through the New Opportunities Fund and do not receive any central funding from Department of Health.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what proportion of patients with MRSA bacteraemia in NHS hospitals in England died of their infection in the last 12 months for which figures are available; and what comparable figures his Department has collated regarding mortality in other countries.  [147499]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w44.html_spnew4"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Information on deaths from methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteraemias is not routinely available. Currently, mortality data can only be provided by enhanced surveillance or special studies. We do not have figures for other countries.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w44.html_spnew5"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The director of infection prevention and control is not a new post but an extra responsibility for an existing senior health professional within every organisation providing national health service services. They will:

To ask the Secretary of State for Health on what date the Retained Organs Commission will be wound up; on what date he proposes that a shadow Human Tissue Authority will be created; and what transitional arrangements he will put in place to bridge any gap between these two dates.  [149379]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w45.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The Human Tissue Bill, which received its second reading on 15 January 2004, sets out plans to create a Human Tissue Authority. The intention is to establish a shadow authority, in advance of the new authority, once the Bill receives Royal Assent.
<P>

<a name="40126w45.html_para0">The Retained Organs Commission was scheduled to close on 31 March 2003. It was extended for a further year until 31 March 2004 to enable it to complete its work.
<P>

<a name="40126w45.html_para1">The aims of the Commission are primarily to oversee national health service arrangements for the return of human organs and tissue and to ensure that any returns reflect families' wishes and take place promptly and sensitively. As the Commission's support to the NHS in dealing with inquiries from families will cease, it is currently engaging with trusts and strategic health authorities (SHAs) to secure the sensitive transfer of these responsibilities to them before it closes.
<P>

<a name="40126w45.html_para2">The Commission also issues guidance, and advises Government on the retention and use of human organs and tissue from post-mortems. It will issue final guidance to SHAs and trusts before it closes and provide a final report to Government. Any subsequent guidance in this area will be issued by the Department of Health or by the Human Tissue Authority in due course.

 People who have experienced a stroke for the first time should be admitted to hospital for immediate assessment and to plan for their rehabilitation. Many stroke units are now developing early discharge schemes to help some people (usually those with satisfactory domestic caring arrangements) to return home at an early opportunity to continue rehabilitation at home for a few more weeks. Most disabled stroke patients who are discharged from hospital at any stage of their care will benefit from a period of post-discharge rehabilitation. This has been shown to stabilise the patient's function and make a small additional improvement in independence. During the period following discharge, there will also commonly be contact with mainstream health and social care community services. These will include: the patient's general practitioner; community nurses; and the home care service. These contacts often continue long-term for patients with persisting disability. The national service framework for older people has stipulated that stroke patients should have a review, performed by a stroke co-ordinator six months after discharge, to reassess their care needs.

This option is seldom used, but may be exercised in a variety of circumstances. For example, advice may be sought when the issues raised require specific, expert knowledge not available within the Inspectorate. It may also be appropriate when there is debate within the scientific or welfare communities, or between the Inspectorate and an applicant, as to the scientific validity of the hypothesis or methodology; the scope for further refinement of the programme of work; the benefits likely to arise from a programme of work; or the welfare costs to the animals.

 The Home Office, Department for Constitutional Affairs and Crown Prosecution Service are working together to develop the first pilot Community Justice Centre in the United Kingdom, which is to be located in Liverpool. Our current timetable is for the Centre to be operational by the end of 2004. This will be conditional on a number of factors, including the identification of an appropriate site to accommodate the Centre and ensure it is fit for purpose. We also want to develop the Centre with the full engagement of the local community. From early 2004 a local community needs assessment will be undertaken which will feed into the design of the Centre and into community sentence planning and community work. From April 2004 these community projects which will be run in conjunction with the Centre.

 The Home Office, Department for Constitutional Affairs and Crown Prosecution Service are working together to develop the first pilot Community Justice Centre in the United Kingdom, which is to be located in Liverpool. The area of the city that the Community Justice Centre will be located is in the Liverpool north. This part of the city has experienced the problems that the Justice Centre will aim to tackle, such as anti-social behaviour and low-level criminal activity, but maintains a strong sense of community spirit and pride that the Justice Centre can build on and enhance.
<P>

<a name="40126w48.html_para6">Agents, with experience of developing court buildings, are working with Liverpool City Council to locate suitable sites for the Justice Centre in this part of the city. The site will accommodate a building housing a multi-jurisdictional court room as well as criminal justice and other agencies to provide on-site services for offenders, victims and the wider community. The exact location of the Liverpool Community Justice Centre is due to be announced later this year to ensure that the Justice Centre can commence operations at the end of 2004.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what action is being taken to reduce and tackle persistent offending through targeting <i>(a)</i> prolific offenders and <i>(b)</i> improving security; where such schemes and projects are being trialled; and how and when such initiatives will be introduced in Middlesbrough South and Cleveland, East.

<P>
<a name="40126w49.html_spnew2"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The national Persistent Offender Scheme was launched in April 2003. It is a component of Local Criminal Justice Boards' action plans to increase the number of offences brought to justice, aimed at targeting a small group of prolific offenders who are responsible for a disproportionate amount of crime. Areas have devised their own 'premium service' protocols which include elements of proactive policing, improved investigation and case management, priority court listings, and strategies for rehabilitation.
<P>

<a name="40126w49.html_para0">The National Probation Service is piloting 15 Intensive Supervision and Monitoring Schemes (ISMSs) for persistent offenders in local probation/police areas. All Schemes involve joint working between probation and police. In addition, some Schemes are testing mechanisms for involving the prison service in pre-release work with persistent offenders. ISMSs target the most prolific offenders in a locality, based on police intelligence. They provide intensive surveillance and supervision of offenders, offering fast access to services and support for rehabilitation, alongside swift action and penalties for non-compliance. They involve other partner agencies such as providers of housing, education and training, alcohol and drug abuse treatment groups and employment services.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to formulate a definition of a crime of violence in relation to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme.  [146281]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w49.html_spnew3"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 None. The Scheme has functioned effectively since its inception in 1964 without the need to define what is meant by such terms as 'criminal injury' or 'crime of violence'. Any detailed definition runs the risk of being too prescriptive and excluding borderline cases where discretion might reasonably be exercised. There would also be the risk of failing to include sufficient scope to accommodate changes in the nature of crime, such as deliberately infecting someone with Aids, or stalking. We consider that in its present form the Scheme strikes an appropriate balance between breath of scope and necessary clarification.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w49.html_wqn4"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps the Government is taking to ensure the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme does not deem physical violence to be an essential component of a sexual offence.  [146282]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w49.html_spnew4"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme already recognises that physical violence is not an essential component of sexual offences by making provision (at paragraph 9 of the 2001 Scheme) for compensation to be paid where such offences have caused mental injury alone.

<a name="40126w49.html_wqn5"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w49.html_spnew5"><B> Paul Goggins: </B>

 Following successful pilots of the Auld recommendation to increase the role of crown prosecutors in charging decisions, measures to put this on a statutory footing have been enacted in the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The relevant provisions will be brought into effect in April 2004, and the new arrangements will then be implemented on an area-by-area basis.
<P>

<a name="40126w50.html_para0">In preparation for that implementation, Crown Prosecution Service areas and their police partners are establishing shadow charging arrangements in each area. This will provide an infrastructure of duty prosecutors working in police operational units to provide on-the-spot advice to investigators, to be available for early consultation in investigations, and to make charging decisions in a wide range of cases.
<P>

<a name="40126w50.html_para1">Early guidance will focus on the lines of enquiry to be pursued in individual cases, the likely charges to be preferred and the evidential requirements to support these. Guidance will also be given on the case preparation requirements in each individual case.
<P>

<a name="40126w50.html_para2">Charging decisions will be made by crown prosecutors following a review of all the available evidence in each case. Where the evidence presented by an officer is insufficient for the charging decision to be made at that time, further guidance will be given on continuing case preparation and evidential requirements.

<P>
<a name="40126w50.html_spnew4"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The Youth Justice Board (YJB) commissioned an internal study from PA Consulting on the factors inhibiting or assisting the take up of early release.
<P>

<a name="40126w50.html_para7">PA's report, in September 2003, found that establishments generally saw early release as a useful incentive to influence the behaviour of trainees serving terms of eight months or more. Where early release was not granted, the main reasons were decisions by review meetings that trainees were unsuitable; lack of appropriate accommodation for them to go to; and young people's refusal of early release. PA recommended monitoring the reasons for decisions not to agree early release; investigating ways of improving the availability of suitable accommodation; and developing a system to record centrally the outcomes of early release decisions. The YJB are pursuing these recommendations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w50.html_spnew5"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The Home Office does not keep any data on the reasons for discharges and the Crown Prosecution Service holds no central records of reasons for the outcome of proceedings. The Crown Prosecution keeps data on the number of unsuccessful outcomes (finalisations other than a conviction) for magistrates and crown courts, and the stage at which the outcome was unsuccessful.
<P>

<a name="40126w50.html_para8">The proportion of total magistrates court outcomes that were unsuccessful as a result of being-discontinued or bound over; write off; discharged committals; dismissal no case; or dismissals after trial was 22.0 per cent. for 2003 (to September). The corresponding figure was 23.4 per cent. in 2002, 23.5 per cent. in 2001, 23.5 per cent. in 2000, and 23.1 per cent. in 1999.

<P>
<a name="40126w50.html_spnew6"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 Information relating to the national average waiting time to access drug or alcohol treatment by offenders in the community in each of the last five years is not available. However, since October 2000 drug treatment can only be imposed by the courts as a provision of a drug treatment and testing order (DTTO). The DTTO National Standard requires that appointments are arranged to take place with the Probation Service within one working day and with the treatment provider within two working days of the order being made and this is being achieved in over 75 per cent. of cases. From 2004&#150;05 areas have been set a target to increase this performance to 90 per cent.

<P>
<P><I>26 Jan 2004 : Column 210W</I><P>
introduced, and 9 January 2004, over 86,000 prisoners have been released under the Home Detention Curfew scheme. At any one time about 3,600 low risk prisoners, who would otherwise be filling prison places, are serving the last part of the custodial portion of their sentence on HDC. Since the scheme began 90 per cent. of those granted HDC have completed their curfew period without any problems at all and 2 per cent. are reported as having been convicted, cautioned or are awaiting prosecution for an offence committed while subject to HDC.

 The Home Office has not carried out a survey specifically addressing public attitudes to the Home Detention Curfew (HDC) scheme but the scheme has been running successfully for over four years and public confidence in the Prison Service over this period has remained good.

changed the law to align the penalty associated with fraudulently obtaining a driving licence with that for fraudulently obtaining a passport and to make these offences arrestable. This will ensure consistency of approach during prosecution so that fraudulently obtaining either document will incur a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment, serving as a more effective deterrent and ensuring that neither document is considered a weak link in establishing a false identity.

 There have been discussions with the Irish Government at both Ministerial and official level about those aspects of the introduction of identity cards which are of particular relevance of them, including the Common Travel Area. The Common Travel Area cover the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man as well as Ireland, and the UK and its operation affects everyone travelling within it, whatever their nationality. Routine immigration checks are not carried out on people travelling within the area. The Government's proposals for identity cards do not compromise the principle of the Common Travel Area. Discussions will continue with the Irish Government on those issues.

 Following the conclusion of the consultation on Entitlement Cards and Identity Fraud in July 2003, the Home Office is taking work forward on the introduction of identity cards, including examining the role identity cards could have in countering identity theft and fraud.
<P>

<a name="40126w52.html_para0">In addition to this work, the Passport Service is piloting a system to conduct more background checks on passport applications. DVLA is working with the Passport Service and other Government Departments to raise the quality of its identity checks using good practice already identified elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="40126w52.html_para1">We have also looked at legislative changes to make identity theft or fraud easier to prosecute or to ensure that the penalties associated with fraudulent use of documents take account of their use in creating false, or stealing genuine, identities. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 changed the law to align the penalty associated with fraudulently obtaining a driving licence with that for fraudulently obtaining a passport and to make these offences arrestable. This will ensure consistency of approach during prosecution so that fraudulently obtaining either document will incur a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment, serving as a more effective deterrent and ensuring that neither document is considered a weak link.

<a name="40126w52.html_para2">We also announced in 2003 our intention to create a new offence relating to being in possession or control of false identity documents, without reasonable cause.

 The total number of offenders falling within the remit of the multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) in the reporting period 2002&#150;03 was 52,809. 41 per cent. were registered sex offenders; 56 per cent. were violent offenders and other sexual offenders; and 3 per cent. were other offenders who fall into neither of the first two categories but who pose a risk of serious harm. In 2002&#150;03, 2,843 MAPPA offenders were referred to a multi-agency public protection panel because they posed the highest risk of harm and/or because the management of those risks was particularly difficult.

 Two pieces of research into the multi-agency public protection arrangements (the MAPPA) are being conducted and will report next autumn. One will evaluate the effectiveness of the statutory framework of the MAPPA; the other will analyse the offenders referred to the multi-agency public protection panels and will identify good practice.
<P>

<a name="40126w53.html_para6">In addition, the publication of an annual report on the MAPPA by each area of England and Wales provides a regular review of this important area of work. My written statement to the House on 15 September 2003 announcing the publication of these reports, indicated that the MAPPA have made a significant contribution to improving public protection.

 A final decision about the budget for the National Probation Service has not yet been made. The gross domestic product (GDP) deflator set by the Treasury is 2.5 per cent. for 2004&#150;05. It is not expected that any probation areas will have an increase in their main resource allocation of less than the GDP deflator, after central recharging (outside the control of the local area) and performance-linked penalties are taken into account.

<a name="40126w54.html_para1">Reducing the number of self-inflicted deaths and instances of self-harm in prison establishments is a ministerial and Prison Service priority. A proactive three-year programme to develop policies and practices to reduce prisoner suicide and manage self- harm began in April 2001. The programme has included:

<P>

<a name="40126w54.html_para2">Over recent months a wide-ranging review of this programme has taken place in consultation with partner agencies such as the Youth Justice Board and outside organisations such as Samaritans, taking into account the evaluations of pilot projects and emerging research findings. This review will inform future suicide prevention strategy beyond April 2004.
<P>

<a name="40126w54.html_para3">The Prison Service is also developing a violence reduction strategy that re-addresses problems of inter-prisoner violence and bullying by providing a national framework of protective mechanisms and positive behaviour management. A new national cell-sharing risk assessment tool was introduced in June 2002 to enable staff at reception to identify those who may be high-risk prisoners, to prevent cell sharing that may generate prisoner-on-prisoner assaults, and to take the necessary steps to minimise potential harm to others. This procedure is currently being revised in the light of the alleged homicide in 2003.

 The incident classification system used by the Prison Service does not include 'disturbance'. Incident types most often associated with disturbances are concerted indiscipline, hostage taking, at height incidents (including rooftop protests), barricades and combinations of these. The information given in the following table records the numbers and location of incidents that were serious enough to warrant the opening of the Gold Command suite at Prison Service Headquarters. The Prison Service does not maintain a record of the cost of damage arising from incidents and such information could only be gathered at disproportionate cost.

<a name="40126w54.html_spnew5"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The prison projections model has been shown to be accurate in predicting the prison population given the correct assumptions about sentencing. It is not possible to be certain about the direction of future trends in sentencing because trends observed over a number of years cannot be assumed to continue. It is for this reason that the projections cover a range of different scenarios and are regularly updated to take account of changing trends and new policies affecting the prison population. The central projections were updated in the summer and published in the April Prison Population Brief in September. The actual prison population was 116 below the projection used for planning purposes on 12 December 2003.
<P>

<a name="40126w54.html_para5">The projections take into account known changes in policy and legislation where the relevant legislation has been passed and a timetable agreed for implementation. The impacts of the new Criminal Justice Act are therefore yet to be included.

<a name="40126w54.html_para6">Reducing the number of self-inflicted deaths and instances of self-harm in prison establishments is a ministerial and Prison Service priority. A proactive three-year programme to develop policies and practices to reduce prisoner suicide and manage self-harm began in April 2001. The programme has included:

<P>

<a name="40126w54.html_para7">Over recent months a wide-ranging review of this programme has taken place in consultation with partner agencies such as the Youth Justice Board and outside organisations such as Samaritans, taking into account the evaluations of pilot projects and emerging research findings. This review will inform future suicide prevention strategy beyond April 2004.

<P>

<i>[holding answer 22 January 2004]:</i> Private sector contractors are responsible for carrying out the movement of prisoners from courts to prisons. Remand and convicted prisoners, including male and female prisoners, can travel in the same vehicle. No central record of journey times is kept, nor is it possible to identify any differences in journey times between remand and convicted, male and female prisoners.
<P>

<a name="40126w55.html_para0">Contractors are required to deliver prisoners to courts before 9.30 am and back to prisons before their receptions close. Contract managers are robust in monitoring their performance and there are financial remedies built into the present contracts for failure to deliver prisoners to prisons on time.

 There are around 100,000 prisoner moves between prisons each year. These moves may be for a number of reasons, such as security, discipline or as a result of normal sentence planning. In addition,

 <i>[holding answer 21 January 2004]:</i> A higher rate of discharge grant (&#163;94.40) is paid to prisoners on release only if there is a need to seek, obtain and pay for accommodation. It is only paid to prisoners with no accommodation arranged in advance if this arises through no fault of the prisoner.

 The Home Office is working on a value for money case for a replacement programme to create a new generation of larger prisons with the facilities needed to deliver effective programmes designed to reduce re-offending. New large prisons could also provide economies of scale, which would allow us to close some smaller prisons and redirect resources to community punishments. This case will be subject of discussion in the forthcoming Spending Review the outcome of which will be published. We will not publish the case we make to the Treasury on which decisions are taken.
<P>

<a name="40126w55.html_para2">There is an established procedure for the announcement of decisions to change the role of or close prisons. Once Ministers take a decision to change the role of or close a prison, staff and local MP's affected by the change or closure are briefed before the formal announcement.

<a name="40126w55.html_para3">A survey has been commissioned to identify suitable sites for new, large prisons although no sites have yet been purchased or other commitments made. To be effective in delivering regimes that aid rehabilitation and reduce re-offending new sites need to be close to, or have good transport links with, large conurbations. The search is concentrating on sites available in London and the south east, the west Midlands, the north west and Wales. These are the regions that have the greatest need for additional prison capacity at this stage.

 Available data on seizures of drugs in prisons and on visitors involved in suspicious incidents do not show any seasonal trends. Random mandatory drug test (MDT) rates in prisons fluctuate quite widely on a monthly basis. However, there is some evidence nationally of a pattern of slight increases in drug misuse in the months of July, August and December.

 Sex Offenders Orders (SOOs) came into force on 1 December 1998 under the Crime and Disorder Act and were subsequently amended by the Police Reform Act 2002. There is no centrally held record of the number of offenders currently the subject of a SOO. However, a SOO has effect for a period not less than five years and can only be discharged before the end of this period with the consent of the police and the defendant. In addition, an individual may only be subject to one SOO at any one time. Therefore the number of SOOs granted by the courts may be used as an estimate to the number of offenders currently subject to such orders.
<P>

<a name="40126w56.html_para2">Since 2001, statistics on the number of SOOs have been collated under the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA).

 The requirement for sex offenders to notify the police of their name and address was introduced in the Sex Offenders Act 1997 and has proved an invaluable tool in helping the police to monitor convicted sex offenders within their area. An offender who is subject to the notification requirements must inform the police within 14 days of using a new name or moving to a new address. A failure to comply with the requirements is a criminal offence, with the maximum punishment set at five years imprisonment. We estimate that compliance with the requirements is currently around 97 per cent.

<a name="40126w57.html_para0">We are improving the notification requirements through the Sexual Offences Act 2003.

In line with other police areas, the offenders classed as "very high risk" are visited at least once a month; those classed as "high risk", at least once every two months; those classed as "medium risk", at least once every six months and those classed as "low risk", at least once every 12 months.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how much revenue the Metropolitan Police received from the operation of <i>(a)</i> speed and <i>(b)</i> red light cameras in 2002; and how much was (i) imposed and (ii) collected in fines resulting from (A) speed and (B) red light cameras in London in each of the last five years.

<P>
<a name="40126w57.html_spnew3"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 The amount of revenue which the Metropolitan Police received from the operation of safety (speed and red light) cameras in 2002 is not yet known. Police forces receive income from safety camera fixed penalties under the provisions of the national safety camera netting-off scheme. The London Safety Camera Partnership, of which the Metropolitan Police are a member, joined the scheme in July 2002. Partnership performance and revenue received, from this time up to March 2003, will be detailed in the next report on the progress of the national safety camera scheme. The Department for Transport, which manages the scheme, expect to publish this report in March 2004.
<P>

<a name="40126w57.html_para5">Before 2002, the Metropolitan Police received no income from safety the number of speeding and red-light offences detected by cameras in the Metropolitan and City of London Police areas and the estimated revenue for the five years up to 2001 is shown in the table. Information for 2002 will be available in the next few months.

 The significant increase in the female prison population, and the wider consequences of this in terms of disruption to their families, particularly their children, underlines the importance of using custody as a last resort.
<P>

<a name="40126w57.html_para7">The Women's Offending Reduction Programme (WORP) is a three-year programme that aims to promote a more focused and joined-up response to the range of factors that have an impact on why women offend.
<P>

<a name="40126w57.html_para8">A long-term aim of the WORP is to reduce the number of women in custody. We are particularly concerned about the 58 per cent. of women held on remand who do not go on to receive a custodial sentence. This is why the WORP focuses on the need to maximise the opportunities for diversion at the pre-sentence stage.
<P>

<a name="40126w57.html_para9">Gender specific training and guidance for sentencers, court report writers and bail information staff will be supported by the development of more appropriate community interventions that are better tailored to meet the needs of women, particularly those with mental health and substance misuse problems. Ensuring appropriate housing or bail hostel provision for women will also be key to reducing the use of remand. The

<P>
<P>

 Arrangements for escorting juveniles home on release are made on a case-by-case basis, usually at the final review meeting at the end of the period in custody. The preferred arrangement is for a parent, relation or other carer to meet the young person and take him or her home. Where this is not possible&#151;for example, where alternative accommodation has been arranged&#151;a youth offending team worker will usually accompany the young person.

<a name="40126w58.html_para1">Sustained investment in young peoples drug treatment, means that by March 2004 95 per cent. of all drug action teams (DATs) will provide a minimum of six different types of treatment interventions, which meet a tough set of young peoples focused quality standards. The interventions include restricted and Tier 3 services.
<P>

<a name="40126w58.html_para2">In addition, the Youth Justice Board (YJB) is providing &#163;8.5million funding each year to give all 155 youth offending teams across England and Wales access to an allocated named drugs worker.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40126w58.html_spnew2"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 Young offenders should be deprived of their liberty only as a last resort. Courts considering a custodial sentence must be satisfied that the offending behaviour is so serious that only a custodial sentence can be justified or, in the case of a violent or sexual offence, that such a sentence is needed to protect the public from serious harm. The only other situation where custody can be given is where the young offender refuses to co-operate with the requirements of a supervision order or a drug treatment and testing order. The court must also explain in open court its reasons for giving custody.
<P>

<a name="40126w58.html_para4">There is a further requirement where the court is considering making a Detention and Training Order on an offender below the age of 15: the court must additionally be satisfied that the young person is a persistent offender.
