<P>
<P>
<a name="70521w01.html_wqn0"><B> Dr. Godman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what plans he has to implement the recommendations contained in the report of the Working Group on Residential Care Home Registration Procedures; and if he will make a statement. [129]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70521w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 We will be consulting this month on draft guidance to local authorities on a wide range of measures recommended in the Working Group's report. A Bill on the regulation and inspection of residential and domiciliary care will be introduced at a suitable opportunity.

<a name="70521w01.html_sbhd1"><H4><center>Mental Illness Grant</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="70521w01.html_wqn1"><B> Dr. Godman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will list the cost to public funds of the mental illness specific grant in each of the last seven years; what sums have been allocated for <i>(a)</i> 1997-98 and <i>(b)</i> 1998-99; and if he will make a statement. [117]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70521w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 Expenditure on projects supported by the mental illness specific grant in each year since 1990-91 has been &#163;0, &#163;2.3 million, &#163;5.7 million, &#163;9.9 million, &#163;14.0 million, &#163;18.0 million and &#163;18.0 million. The allowance for 1997-98 is &#163;18.0 million. The allowances for community-based services for people with mental health problems in 1998-99 will be considered along with other elements of the local government settlement. The grant has been the subject of a Scottish Office review and an independent evaluation which will be published later this year.

<P>
<a name="70521w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Doran: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland how he proposes to reply to questions about the Scottish Prison Service. [1068]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70521w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 In view of the special sensitivity of prison matters, I have decided that all Questions about the Scottish Prison Service will be answered by a Scottish Office Minister and not by the Chief Executive of the Service. This is no reflection whatever on the Chief Executive who has discharged well his responsibilities in this regard, nor does it have any implication for the Scottish Prison Service as an Agency; but it recognises particular concerns that Ministers should answer personally on matters relating to imprisonment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70521w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many invitations to tender were issued, and to whom, in respect of maintenance of water treatment plants on or near Salisbury Plain during 1996, listing the establishments; and which contractors were successful. [97]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70521w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Army's water and sewage treatment plants on or near Salisbury Plain are managed from the five military stations at Upavon, Larkhill, Warminster, Netheravon and Tidworth. All are maintained in accordance with our normal practice of appointing a Works Service Manager from the commercial sector whose responsibility it is to maintain the estate and to issue invitations to tender for the work involved. The Works Service Manager contract in respect of the plants managed from Tidworth was reviewed in 1996. The contract was awarded to BP Defence following competition in which the following firms were also invited to tender: Serco, Laings, Trant, Amey and Trafalgar House. Invitations were also issued in 1996 to companies interested in making proposals for the provision of water and sewage treatment at Tidworth under a Private Fiance Initiative exercise.

<a name="70521w01.html_sbhd4"><H4><center>Pensions (Service Men's Widows)</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="70521w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Letwin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what are the pension entitlements of widows of service men <i>(a)</i> who retired before March 1973 and <i>(b)</i> who retired after that date; what effect remarriage of a widow under either of these circumstances has upon that widow's entitlement; and if she will make it her policy that such widows receive pensions equal to at least half of the pensions to which their husbands would have been entitled. [651]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70521w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 I am replying to this question as it concerns benefits payable to Service widows under the provisions of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS).
<P>

<a name="70521w01.html_para0">Under the provisions, a widow of a Serviceman who retired before 31 March 1973 is entitled to a pension equal to one third of her late husband's pension. A Service widow whose husband retired on or after that date is entitled to a pension equal to one half of her husband's pension. On remarriage a Service widow's entitlement to an AFPS pension ceases. However, if the subsequent marriage should end, there is discretion to restore the original Forces Family Pension. 80 per cent. of such applications are successful. In the case of those widows whose husband's death is accepted as attributable to their military service the original Armed Forces pension is automatically restored.
<P>

<a name="70521w01.html_para1">One of the principles which underpin the way in which the major public service schemes operate is that improvements to the scheme should not be retrospective. An extension of widows' pensions to half rate would breach this principle. If improvements to pensions schemes were to include the cost of backdating, it would become very difficult for schemes to afford any worthwhile changes. The AFPS therefore operates on the principle that when Service personnel retire, they and their dependants are entitled only to the provisions of the pension scheme in force at the date of retirement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70521w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the President of the Board of Trade if she will make available for public inspection her Department's inspectors report on Lord Archer's share dealings; and if she will make a statement. [277]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70521w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 No. Reports of inspections under section 177 of the Financial Services Act 1986 are not published and are therefore prepared on that basis. The inspectors undertake their task with the knowledge that there is no power in the Act providing for publication and that they need not, therefore, be inhibited in expressing their views. Individuals who are criticised in a section 177 report are not given any opportunity to comment upon the criticisms, as would be the case if the report was to be published. Section 177 reports are prepared to enable the Secretary of State to consider further action including possible criminal proceedings. 

<a name="70521w01.html_sbhd6"><H4><center>Debt (Late Payment)</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="70521w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Baldry: </B> 
To ask the President of the Board of Trade what research her Department has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> evaluated on late payment of debt by companies. [69]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70521w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 My Department is aware of the continuing difficulties experienced by small businesses as a result of the late payment of commercial debts. Although this Department has not commissioned any research on this matter it has closely analysed the findings of other key pieces of research including the recent work undertaken by NOP which showed that 80 per cent. of British businesses wanted a statutory right to interest. These findings are supported by similar research undertaken by Lloyds Bank and Office World which show that the majority of small firms are in favour of legislation.
<P>

<a name="70521w01.html_para2">The Government is determined to change the payment culture in the UK and that is why we have responded to the calls from small businesses and announced in the Queen's Speech that we will introduce the Fair Payment of Commercial Debts Bill. The Government will consult on the most appropriate way of introducing legislation and plans to bring forward a Green Paper in the Summer to enable interested parties to put their views forward.

<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="70521w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Griffiths: </B> 
 My Department's recruitment procedures take full account of the need to attract ethnic minority applicants when posts are available. This includes the use of ethnic minority press to advertise vacancies; advertising in inner city job centres; race awareness training and guidance for those involved in recruitment activity; and detailed monitoring of recruitment campaigns.
<P>

<a name="70521w01.html_para4">However, the number of staff in the Department has reduced significantly in recent years, and there has been little recruitment at any level. When there is a need to recruit new staff, the Department will actively seek to attract applications from all sections of the community. It will also keep under review the effectiveness of the Department's recruitment procedures in this respect.

<a name="70521w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 As we made clear in our manifesto, we are committed to relieving the regulatory burdens on businesses, particularly on small businesses.

 My officials will shortly be writing to potential sponsors inviting bids for trade fair and seminar support in 1998-99 under the Trade Fair and Seminar Support Schemes and with a view to announcing the successful ones later this year. Industry had told us that it believes a separate scheme is more effective than including trade fairs in a Challenge approach. In the light of these representations we have decided that support for trade fairs will not be included in any future round of the Sector Challenge. Together with industry we will be reviewing all forms of export assistance, including trade fairs, through the new Export Forum. These actions fulfil commitments made in our business manifesto to review the previous government's decision to change the arrangements for supporting British participation in trade fairs.

 Our best estimate suggests that over 3 per cent. of Lottery awards so far announced, representing around 2 per cent. of total value of awards have been to ethnic minority projects, though many other projects provide benefits for people from ethnic minorities.

 The operation of the National Lottery is regulated by the Director-General who is appointed by the Secretary of State for National Heritage under the National Lottery etc. Act 1993. The Director-General is head of the Office of the National Lottery (OFLOT) which is an independent, non-Ministerial Government Department. As its head, the Director-General is 



<P>
<P><I>21 May 1997 : Column: 70</I><P>
accountable for the exercise of his statutory functions under the National Lottery etc. Act 1993, and for the financial operation of his Department.
<P>

<a name="70521w02.html_para1">The Director-General must report each year to me on the exercise of his functions. This report is then laid before Parliament. He is also accountable to Parliamentary committees. The Director-General must also provide me with information relating to the National Lottery, or a lottery forming part of it, as I may direct.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70521w02.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Smith: </B> 
 I intend to publish a White Paper in the summer setting out our plans for reforming the National Lottery and to introduce the National Lottery (Amendment) Bill before Christmas. The first priorities will be after-school clubs to provide homework centres and extra-curricular opportunities in the arts and culture; establishing a national network of one-stop healthy living centres promoting health and fitness; training teachers in the IT skills they need in the information age; and the establishment of the National Endowment for Science and the Arts. These programmes will begin as soon as the necessary legislation is in place.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70521w02.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 May 1997]:</i> In addition to establishing new good causes to benefit from the National Lottery, we will review the existing distribution system to ensure that there is the widest possible access to Lottery funds throughout the UK. We will consider particularly the need for a proper strategy for the distribution of funds and co-ordination between the distributing bodies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70521w02.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Smith: </B> 
 I do not have the powers to restrict the level of profit which Camelot makes under its current licence. We will seek a competitive and efficient not-for-profit operator to run the National Lottery when Camelot's licence runs out so that the maximum amount of money possible goes to the goods causes.

 When the Globe's remains were discovered in 1989, part of the site was excavated and fully recorded. English Heritage is prepared to consider the case for further archaeological investigations beneath the basement of Anchor Terrace, provided it can be shown convincingly that there is a high probability of discovering valuable and particular information about the Globe as a result.

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary had no immediate plans for such a visit.

In particular, we will not permit the export of arms to regimes which might use them for internal repression or international aggression. We shall work for increased transparency on defence exports at the national and international level. We shall also work for the introduction of an EU code of conduct setting high common standards to govern arms exports from all EU countries, and for the strengthening of the UN Register on Conventional Arms.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked me to reply as the Director of the Office for National Statistics to your recent question on the number of households in Hull and Kingston upon Hull North without a wage earner.

Estimates of non-pensioner households with no-one in employment are available from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) at national and regional level. They are also available for counties, except a few for which the numbers are not sufficiently reliable.

No information on households or families is available from the LFS below county level because the analyses would not be sufficiently reliable.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70521w03.html_spmin0"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 The pledges we made in our manifesto and the paper "The Case for the Prosecution" published before the election envisaged a change to the organisational structure of the Crown Prosecution Service so that there would be a one-to-one relationship between a police force and its corresponding CPS area as equal partners. In addition, we undertook to establish a review under the auspices of a person of the calibre of a High Court Judge to examine more closely the internal structures of the CPS, together with its policies and procedures and in particular whether they have been a factor in the extent to which convictions have fallen--by more than a third--whilst crime has risen so dramatically in recent years.
<P>

<a name="70521w03.html_para4">Immediately on taking office I asked the Director of Public Prosecutions to work up proposals for dividing the Crown Prosecution Service into 42 areas each having its own Chief Crown Prosecutor ie. one for each police force outside London with the Metropolitan Police and City of London Police beings served by one CPS area. She has now done so. The basic timetable of the arrangements to be implemented is as follows:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
1.   By 1 June 1997:
<BR>
DPP will have, as an interim measure, identified and named individuals to be known as the Crown Prosecutor for each of the proposed new CPS areas. The immediate role for those persons would be to assume oversight of the casework in the relevant area, together with the responsibility for local, consistent delivery of casework practices; and a personal involvement in serious or sensitive cases. He or she would also represent the CPS within the police force area and act 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>21 May 1997 : Column: 74</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as principal point of contact for the Chief Constable having a general role in developing and influencing local relationships with other criminal justice agencies and the wider public.
<BR>
2.   The broader management and administrative arrangements within the CPS, apart from the casework and representational functions mentioned above, would remain unaltered for the time being.
<BR>
3.   By April 1998:
<BR>
The DPP will formally vary the division of the CPS into the 42 new areas through a direction made under Section 1(5) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985.
<BR>
Selection boards will have been held to appoint 42 Chief Crown Prosecutors for the areas.

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="70521w03.html_para5"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The 42 Chief Crown Prosecutors will assume their full management responsibilities for areas. They will manage their areas within an agreed framework with responsibility for their budgets, but accountable ultimately to the DPP for the performance of the service in their areas.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="70521w03.html_para6">The detail surrounding these arrangements will be informed by the proposed review of the CPS on which I will be making a further announcement shortly. I should add that we are firmly committed to the principle of an independent prosecution service within a coherent national framework: our aim is to build on and adapt the underlying strengths and real achievements of the CPS in the past 10 years, so that the Service is able to deliver its full potential.

 The question of giving reasons for decisions on applications for British citizenship is currently before the courts.

It would not be appropriate for the length of a person's residence in the United Kingdom alone to determine whether reasons are given.

 Judith Ward's final claim for compensation was only received in the Home Office in April 1997.

 Sixty-five compensation claims were settled during 1996-97, including 50 stemming from the quashing of a high number of drink-driving convictions in Greater Manchester following possible contamination of blood samples.

 Health authorities have a statutory duty to consult their local Community Health Councils (CHCs) on proposals brought forward by National Health Service trusts for substantial developments or variations in services.

consulted so that they can satisfy themselves that a PFI scheme is affordable, is consistent with their healthcare strategies and represents the best way of meeting patient needs. The number and types of bed required will be one of the factors they will take into consideration. The local health authority must, in turn, consult the relevant Community Health Council--who represent the public interest in the health service--when any major service change, including major changes in bed numbers, is proposed by a trust.

 No medicine which is effective is completely risk-free. Therefore, there are well-established systems for licensing and monitoring the safety of all medicines available in the United Kingdom. These ensure the benefits of medicines outweigh any risks and prevent users coming to unnecessary harm.

 Section 5 of the Public Records Act 1958 already gives power to the Lord Chancellor to prescribe a public access period of less than 30 years for particular public records in the Public Records Office. For example, records of British Coal and of the Treasury Solicitor concerning the Aberfan Disaster in 1966 and the subsequent inquiry were all opened together, although a number of them were less than 30 years old.

 My Departments' current measures to enhance and encourage the employment and advancement of ethnic minorities are as follows.
<P>

<a name="70521w06.html_para1">Action plans for people of ethnic minority origin were first published in 1991 and are under constant review along with other equal opportunities action plans for women and disabled staff within which they are consolidated. Examples of how the action plans for ethnic minorities are put into practice include: the provision of a range of equal opportunities training for managers and staff; positive action training for developing the potential of ethnic minority staff only; training for members of interview panels; publicising staff vacancies in specialist recruitment publications which feature role models to help encourage ethnic minority group representation; a revised approach to staff appraisal procedures, backed up by mandatory training programmes, to eliminate prejudice by focusing on clarified objectives and a competency-based framework for assessing individuals' performance; participation in the Windsor Fellowship Scheme, providing vacation work experience for ethnic minority undergraduates and in the Office of Public Service's Double Disadvantage Study relating to ethnic minority women; membership of a mentoring consortium led by the East London University to contribute to the development of ethnic minority students through establishing links with role models in employment; offering networking opportunities for ethnic minority staff and positively encouraging them to apply for promotion and sit as panel members; monitoring and analysing success rates by ethnic origin of the processes of recruitment, internal postings, advancement, staff appraisal; identifying any barriers to progress and improving the processes to ensure equality of opportunity in the workplace and reflect local needs; and formal annual reporting to Board level, the Trades Union Side and staff generally about equal opportunities progress. Executive Agencies have autonomy to develop comparable local strategies.

 The recording of information in Ordnance Survey's National Topographic Database and its depiction on maps at various scales are primarily a matter of resources. Funding to collect, store and disseminate information comes from two sources--commercial sales of OS products and from government funding for those OS activities which are judged to be in the national interest. Discussions are currently underway on the funding of a National Interest in Mapping Service Agreement (NIMSA) and the Ordnance Survey activities to be covered by it. I have ensured that the question of recording urban commons is included in the considerations. A decision on NIMSA is expected to be taken by Ministers later in the year.

 In the early years of BSE epidemic, incineration capacity was insufficient to deal with all the cattle involved. Therefore, during the summer of 1988 this Department approached East Sussex County Council seeking licensed landfill facilities for the disposal of cattle suspected of having BSE. At that time, the County 



<P>
<P><I>21 May 1997 : Column: 96</I><P>
Council was responsible as a waste disposal authority for the granting and supervision of licences under Part I of the Control of Pollution Act 1974. Following an assessment by the authority of the landfill sites then it its ownership, Beddingham was identified by that authority as suitable for the disposal of waste of this kind. The Ministry's records, cross checked with those available to the Environment Agency, indicate that the carcases of fewer than 10 cattle affected, or suspected of being affected, with BSE were disposed of at the Beddingham landfill site between August 1988 and October 1989.
<P>

<a name="70521w09.html_para1">Compulsory slaughter of all cattle suspected of having BSE, with compensation, was introduced from August 1988. Under these arrangements the heads of suspects were removed from the carcases for confirmation of the presence, or otherwise, of BSE and were subsequently incinerated. The removal of spinal cord was not necessary for this purpose. The Southwood Committee, the group of independent experts initially set up to advise Ministers on BSE, recommended precautionary action against spinal cords and other cattle tissues which might carry the BSE agent in respect of certain foodstuffs. The bovine offal controls introduced in November 1989 in response to the Committee's advice went further than the Committee recommended. The Committee noted without objection that some cattle were disposed of by burial.

 In May last year a sub-group of the independent Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC), which advises Ministers on BSE, considered the issue of BSE and the environment, including the past disposal of BSE suspect cattle to landfill. They considered that, although the spongiform encephalopathy agent was not yet fully characterised, there was good evidence to believe that individual molecules were not infectious and that infectivity was associated with macro molecular agglomerations and possibly with tissue fragments, albeit small ones. On this basis they concluded
"it was unlikely that leachate from landfill sites would present a significant risk and there was certainly no justification for taking heroic measures to excavate sites, even those which had previously been used for material such as BSE-confirmed cattle".
<P>

<a name="70521w09.html_para3">The Environment Agency has regulatory responsibility for supervising the safe operation of landfill sites and is in possession of SEAC's advice. The Agency monitors ground water quality in the vicinity of licensed landfill sites as a check for any leachate contamination. They are assessing data on a typical selection of identified sites to determine whether there is a possibility of impact on water quality.

<a name="70521w09.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The conclusions of epidemiological investigations have been published in peer reviewed journals and submitted to Government advisory committees from time to time. These have also been included in the six-monthly Progress Reports on BSE in Great Britain which are laid in the Library of the House. Cattle feed is still considered to have been the primary route of infection, although advice recently received from SEAC suggests that a small proportion of cases may arise

<P>
<P>
<a name="70521w09.html_spnew18"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 My officials have evaluated the epidemiological analysis carried out by Professor Anderson of Oxford University and his team, in collaboration with Wilesmith and others at VLA, which was published in Nature, Vol. 382. Their research indicates that the BSE epidemic will reach insignificant levels by the year 2001 irrespective of any further measures. This analysis supports Government predictions on the future pattern of the disease.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what is his estimate as to the projected cost of the culling of cattle under each of the BSE-related cull schemes. [293]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70521w09.html_spnew19"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 We estimate that the selective cull will cost &#163;185 million, although this is partly financed by the European Union and there will be savings on other schemes. The cost will depend, however, on the distribution of exposed animals and the number of animals which have to be slaughtered which can only be estimated at this stage.
<P>

<a name="70521w09.html_para5">It is impossible to predict with any accuracy the total cost of the Over Thirty Month Scheme, given the duration of this demand-led Scheme is unknown. However, by the end of the current financial year expenditure is expected to amount to around &#163;1,230 million, part of which is financed by the European Union.
<P>

<a name="70521w09.html_para6">Expenditure on the Calf Processing Aid Scheme, which is wholly financed by the European Union, is expected to amount to around &#163;140 million by November 1998. The Scheme's operation after that date is subject to consideration by the Council of Ministers.

 I refer my hon. Friend to the paper published in <i>Nature</i> in August 1996 by Professor R. M. Anderson et al, a copy of which can be found at Appendix 5 of the November 1996 Progress Report which has been placed in the Library of the House. That paper gives a prediction of future tends in the incidence by year of BSE infections. It is anticipated that the BSE epidemic is likely to fade close to extinction by the year 2001 as a result of the control measures which are already in place. It is, however, pertinent to point out the many assumptions that had to be made in making such estimates. Significant deviation from such assumptions will inevitably affect the predicted outcome.

 No research has been commissioned into the transmission of BSE-related conditions through pet food.

<BR>
As Chief Executive of the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) your Parliamentary Question to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food concerning the number of veterinarians dismissed for failure to ensure compliance with health inspection regulations over the last 36 months has been passed to me for reply.(13)
<BR>
The Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) was established as an Executive Agency of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) on 1 April 1995. It took over from some 300 local authorities responsibility for enforcing meat hygiene, inspection and animal welfare at slaughter legislation in licensed fresh meat premises in England, Scotland and Wales. The MHS has no information about veterinarians dismissed prior to this date.
<BR>
The MHS directly employs 45 Official Veterinary Surgeons. In addition, the Agency makes use of 131 full time equivalent contract OVS. These OVSs work together with Meat Hygiene Inspectors as meat hygiene and inspection teams in abattoirs. MHS staff take appropriate action to ensure plant operators comply with the relevant hygiene, inspection and animal welfare legislation. The MHS operates a clear hierarchy of enforcement starting with informal advice and guidance escalating, where problems persist or are severe, to the service of statutory notices, and ultimately progressing in severity to prosecution or action by the State Veterinary Service to revoke the premises licence where there has been a failure to respond to earlier requirements. No directly employed OVSs have been dismissed for failure to ensure compliance with this legislation. A number of contract OVSs have had their contracts terminated as their performance has not proved satisfactory.
<BR>
The MHS has recently reinforced its instructions to its staff on ensuring compliance with hygiene legislation. All MHS staff have been reminded of the importance of ensuring full compliance with hygiene controls, and of those procedures which must be followed in relation to hygienic carcase dressing. In particular staff were reminded that meat showing evidence of contamination must not be health marked as fit for sale for human consumption. Where there is evidence that the health mark has been applied to a carcase showing signs of visible contamination, this will be regarded, prima facie, as a potential gross misconduct, and will be the subject of disciplinary investigation. Gross misconduct is a dismissable offence.
<BR>
The MHS is also responsible for enforcing Specified Bovine Material (SBM) controls in licensed premises. These controls are central to the protection of public health from any risk of BSE. They require the removal from all cattle at slaughter of all those tissues that might, in theory, harbour BSE infectivity. MHS staff are also fully aware that they may face disciplinary action as a result of any failure to enforce these controls. One contract OVS has received a written caution.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what reports he has received from <i>(a)</i> the Independent Tribunal Service and <i>(b)</i> other sources regarding the effect of the Social Security (Adjudication) and Child Support Amendment (No. 2) Regulations 1996 on the number of oral hearings held by social security appeal tribunals, disability appeal tribunals and child support appeal tribunals. [108]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70521w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 Data on the number of oral hearings since the regulation changes came into effect are not yet available. Initial information from the Independent Tribunal Service suggests that currently paper hearings are being arranged in around 5 per cent. of cases.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70521w11.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bradley: </B> 
 Appointments of members of Disability Appeal Tribunals are a matter for the President of the Independent Tribunal Service, His Honour Judge Bassingthwaighte, who has informed me that measures are in place to prevent any conflict of interest arising.

<a name="70521w11.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Flynn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if she will make a statement about the Government's policy regarding the contractorisation of the Benefits Agency Medical Services. [111]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70521w11.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Field: </B> 
 We are reviewing this and other initiatives designed to test the value for money of involving external contractors against: our objectives for modernising the delivery of the welfare system; our approach to partnership with the private sector where there is scope to apply its expertise, discipline and economies of scale in procuring public services and investment; the implications for customer service, staff and the taxpayer; and our commitment to work within announced spending totals for the first two years of the Government. We will make announcements in due course.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70521w11.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Flynn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if she will review the conceptual basis and practical operation of the all work test to take account of the evidence submitted to the Social Security Committee's inquiry into incapacity benefit (HC 80, Session 1996-97); and if she will report on the progress already made in evaluating the all work test. [112]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70521w11.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The evidence provided to the Social Security Select Committee and the findings of the survey of people who have left Incapacity Benefit, currently under way, will enable us to consider whether changes are necessary to ensure that the test provides a fair assessment of a person's incapacity for work for benefit purposes.
<P>

<a name="70521w11.html_para2">An initial evaluation of the reliability and validity of the all work test was carried out by this Department last year. A report of the findings is in the Library.
