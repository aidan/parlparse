 Estimates from the Association of British Insurers indicate that approximately 17,000 households were displaced by the floods in summer 2007. We do not have data on the number of those households who moved into caravans immediately. As at December 2007 we estimated that around 2,300 households were living in caravans.</p>

In Castle Morpeth, which was by far the most badly affected area, 906 households were affected by the September flooding in some way, though of course many of those did not have to move out of their homes. The council contacted every household and continues to monitor the situation closely offering advice and information during the recovery period.</p>

 Returns from affected local authorities indicate a quickening in the pace at which displaced households are returning to their homes following the floods of summer 2007. On a like-for-like basis, local authority data shows that the number of displaced households fell by about 30 per cent. between the end of June and beginning of September and we estimate the figures have fallen by around 36 per cent. between the beginning of September and 24 October. Those living wholly or partially in caravans halved between the end of June and the beginning of September and, where we have updated data, the number had at least halved again by 24 October. Furthermore, the figures we have from local authorities show that all council and housing association tenants are now home.</p>

 While it is still too soon to make a definitive judgment on the impact of the duty to co-operate, early indications are that LAAs have led to a strengthening of partnership working in local areas.

 Individual Separated Service is currently recorded on the Joint Personnel Administration (JPA) system. Individual separation is recorded as one of 16 activity codes; these codes allow commanders to identify how much separation is caused by each activity. Data from the system is currently only available to the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force. The Army, being the last to transfer to JPA, does not yet have sufficient data to provide meaningful statistics. A complete period of data should become available in January 2010. Even with a full cycle of data the system is not configured to identify individual tour intervals for Service personnel. The system is designed to identify where individual harmony guidelines are being broken. The current individual harmony guidelines are:</p>

 According to our records, the L14A1 side attack mine was not in service with British Armed Forces. Two variants of an off-route anti-tank mine, the LI 14A1 and the L131A1, are known to have entered military service prior to 1971, but no record can be found of the precise dates. Initiation was either by an operator using a trigger switch or by means of a break-wire stretched across the road. Neither munition was fitted with infrared sensors. They were withdrawn from service in 1994 and were disposed of by burning at the MOD range at Shoeburyness in the mid 1990s.</p>

(Mr. Rammell) that the February ICRC report contained allegations concerning treatment of detainees by forces other than UK forces, although naturally the part of their discussion which covered detainees in Iraq focused on specific allegations against UK forces. The Minister discussed the concerns raised by Dr. Kellenberger with officials on his return to London. Officials had already received assurances that UK investigations were under way into allegations of abuse of detainees at Abu Ghraib prison. Defence Ministers became aware of the specific allegations against UK forces contained in the ICRC report when they read the report over the weekend of 8-9 March 2004. A copy had been passed by officials to the Defence Secretary&#146;s office on 7 May 2004.</p>

Ministers had been aware of those issues relating to UK forces for five months before they were aware of the report itself. Allegations of abuse are taken very seriously and, by the time the ICRC report was published, the Royal Military Police were already engaged on several investigations into specific alleged incidents of abuse by UK forces.</p>

 The situation in Iraq makes it very difficult to be certain of the identity and background of individuals detained by UK forces and in particular whether or not they are or have been members of the Serious Crimes Unit.

 There was a six week delay in the two-year concept phase for the Trident successor programme due to the speed of contract letting and the build up and mobilisation of capacity in the supplier base.

As a result, BAE Systems has had to refresh these skills and recruit the staff numbers needed for a project of this size and complexity. The cost of the first three Astute boats was approved in 1997 at &#163;2.5 billion; the current forecast is &#163;3.8 billion.</p>

 The National Bee Unit (NBU) provides a free comprehensive training and education programme for all beekeepers to enable them to develop their skills and become more self-reliant in combating disease problems through improved bee husbandry. In 2008, beekeepers in England benefited from nearly 23,000 colony inspections and an extensive programme of training, including over 800 technical events to date, delivered by the NBU to help improve disease control through good apiary management.</p>

 Details of beekeepers and their colonies are not recorded by local authority area. Details of those registered on the National Bee Unit&#146;s Beebase database are shown by county in the following table. As registration is voluntary, actual numbers are likely to be significantly higher. An Economic Evaluation of bee health carried out by ADAS Consulting Ltd in 2001, estimated that there were about 33,000 beekeepers and 230,000 colonies of bees in England of which less than 1 per cent. keep bees on a commercial basis.</p>

 When inspectors find pyrethroid resistance in samples of Varroa, they advise beekeepers on alternative methods of control, including alternative chemical treatments and husbandry techniques.

 As of 3 November 2008, all of Great Britain became a single confluent Protection Zone for Bluetongue serotype 8 (BTV-8).

 I have been asked to reply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_712"><a name="81126w0028.htm_para0"><a name="08112782001406">The independent expert advisory Committee on the Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT), advises the Department and other government departments and agencies, including the Health Protection Agency, on the health effects of emissions of dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls. The Committee recommends the levels for the tolerable daily intake (TDI), which is the amount that can be ingested daily over a lifetime without appreciable health risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_713"><a name="81126w0028.htm_para1"><a name="08112782001407">The TDI is expressed in World Health Organisation (WHO) - toxic equivalents per kilogram body weight per day (TEQ/kg bw/day). The WHO-TEQs are an internationally recognised method for considering the toxicity of mixtures of dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls, by comparing them to that of the most thoroughly studied dioxin, Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, based on considering their relative potencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_714"><a name="81126w0028.htm_para2"><a name="08112782001408">The COT has recommended a tolerable daily intake for dioxins of two picograms WHO-TEQ/kg body weight/day based on the most sensitive effect in laboratory animals, namely, adverse effects on the developing foetus resulting from exposure in utero. As this was the most sensitive effect it will protect against the risks of other adverse effects including carcinogenicity. A copy of the full statement has been placed in the Library and is available at:</p>

Limited exposure may also occur via inhalation of air or ingestion of soil depending on circumstances. Provided that the strict emission limits on modern incinerators are adhered to, inhalation of dioxins is not a significant source of exposure for the general public. It has been estimated for example that current levels of dioxin emissions from incinerators accounts for less than 1 per cent of UK  <br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans he has for each of the sites owned by his Department which are registered on the Register of Surplus Public Sector Land; what construction projects are planned for each site; and when he expects each site to be returned to use.

 The land recorded on the Register of Surplus Public Sector Land has been identified as no longer required in the delivery of Departmental business. Unless there is a demand from another Government Department, in which case the land would be transferred, the primary intention is to seek the earliest possible disposal and maximise the value for money from the sale of surplus assets, subject to prevailing market conditions and planning and development constraints.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_733"><a name="81126w0030.htm_para1"><a name="08112782001529">Listed as follows is a summary of the surplus land held by the core Department published on the public register as at September 2008 and the status of each site is noted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_734"><a name="81126w0030.htm_para2"><a name="08112782001530">Due to the surplus nature of the land, no construction projects are currently proposed and it is not anticipated that the land will return to public sector use. The return to beneficial use, and the nature of that use, will be linked to disposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_735"><a name="81126w0030.htm_para3"><a name="08112782001531">Where it is consider appropriate and the holding is capable of short term beneficial occupation and use pending disposal the Department has sought to mitigate property holding costs by short term commercial lettings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_736"><a name="81126w0030.htm_para4"><a name="08112782001532">Where appropriate to do so the Department seeks to influence future beneficial use. There are two sites where the future beneficial use for residential development has been identified and this is being explored prior to disposal via the property market. These sites are recognised in the Departmental contribution to the Government&#146;s affordable homes targets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_737"><a name="81126w0030.htm_para5"><a name="08112782001533">The two sites in Perthshire are legacy sites which demonstrated long term beneficial use for residential development, however changes in local planning framework policy and long term housing demand means that the land is now unlikely to be designated to meet future housing need and disposal in existing use is being pursued.</p>

No changes have yet been made to our import controls for pets as a result of that review as we are reviewing further evidence to inform our discussions with the European Commission on the shape of the controls that should be in place in 2010.</p>

The risk assessments closely examined our existing controls and those controls that may apply should the current derogations which apply to the UK lapse or change in some other way in 2010. Both risk assessments have also been considered by the independent expert Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens. The risk assessment have been placed on the DEFRA website.

<i> [holding answer 17 November 2008]:</i> Discussions relating to both London 2012 Olympic games and Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth games arise in a wide range of meetings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_829"><a name="81126w0036.htm_para0"><a name="08112782002155">The Government Olympic Executive (GOE), which is part of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), was set up in 2006 as the lead Government organisation to oversee delivery of the London 2012 Olympic games and Paralympic games.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_830"><a name="81126w0036.htm_para1"><a name="08112782002156">GOE and the Scottish Executive officials meet every quarter through the Nations and Regions Group to discuss preparations for 2012 and securing the legacy from the games. These meetings have taken place over a number of years since the bid phase.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_831"><a name="81126w0036.htm_para2"><a name="08112782002157">Up to March 2008, GOE also worked closely with all central Government Departments and the devolved Administrations through meetings of an Inter- Departmental Steering Group made up of senior responsible officials. The group was supported by Departmental Olympic Co-ordinators, including from the devolved Administrations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_832"><a name="81126w0036.htm_para3"><a name="08112782002158">We have also recently established a Government Operations Group, which includes representation from the Scottish Executive, to discuss matters of mutual interest across Government Departments in respect of staging the games.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_833"><a name="81126w0036.htm_para4"><a name="08112782002159">Officials are working closely together to share any lessons learned from London 2012 with the Glasgow 2014 team. Most recently, the GOE organised a day of meetings on 21 July for the Scottish Executive to speak with officials from across build, staging and legacy teams in GOE to talk about the delivery process and planning for a games legacy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_834"><a name="81126w0036.htm_para5"><a name="08112782002160">Additionally, on specific issues, officials from GOE and the Scottish Executive are discussing the development of regulations under the London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006 to restrict advertising and street trading during games time.</p>

In addition to providing better support for victims of domestic violence, one of the overall aims of the strategy is to hold perpetrators and abusers accountable and provide effective interventions for their behaviour. For example, a current media campaign highlights that  a perpetrator can be prosecuted even when a victim remains silent.</p>

Finally data for PPS take account of the number of cases received during a particular calendar year; these cases would not necessarily be proceeded with through the courts during this calendar year.</p>

 The main recommendations from the 2006 Review of the Child Care Proceedings were implemented through two key reforms: revised statutory guidance issued to local authorities and the Public Law Outline. It was estimated this could lead to a reduction in the number of care and supervision applications under section 31 of the Children Act 1989 of between  8 per cent. and 13 per cent. per annum, brought about through better early engagement with families through use of initiatives such as Family Group Conferences and early identification of alternatives such as kinship care, as well as better prepared applications to court.</p>

1. Figures relate to the number of children subject to each application. For example, an application relating to two children will be counted twice.<br>
2. Public law cases cover the following applications brought by local authorities or an authorised person (currently only the NSPCC):<br>
care order, discharge of care order, substitute supervision order for a care order, supervision order, discharge of supervision order, contact with a child in care, authority to refuse contact with a child in care, education supervision order, child assessment orders, emergency protection order, extension of emergency protection order, discharge of emergency protection order, recovery order, parental responsibility order, section 8 orders (residence, contact, prohibited steps, specific issue) and special guardianship order.<br>
3. Figures for Family Proceedings Courts prior to April 2007 are likely to be an undercount. A new method of data collection was introduced in April 2007 which has improved the coverage and completeness of data. Any comparison with figures prior to April 2007 may be affected by the improved data recording.<br>
4. Special Guardianship Orders figures in the Family Proceedings Courts are only available for those courts which share premises and administrative systems with county courts. The total has therefore been estimated based on the proportion of the total public law and private law applications made in each tier of court.<br>
5. Research undertaken on behalf of Ministry of Justice has identified that some cases that have transferred from the Family Proceedings Court to the County Court have been incorrectly recorded as new applications in the County Court, thus inflating the number of new applications (see Masson et al, 2008).<br>

 The following table shows the proportions of community sentences that terminated in England and Wales in each of the last five years for positive and negative reasons, including failing to comply with the order and conviction for further offences. Information specifically on the numbers or proportions of 'breaches' which resulted in orders being continued and not terminated is not held centrally. The improvement shown in positive terminations for the community rehabilitation order reflects the fact that this is a pre Criminal Justice Act 2003 sentence and was only given for offences committed before 4 April 2005.

 It is important that community orders and other sanctions are enforced and that offenders comply with their orders. This remains a key priority for Government. The National Offender Management Service is improving performance on compliance by a range of measures which include:</p>
<a name="81126w0041.htm_brev0"><a name="0811281002629"><ul><p class="tabletext">(a) the provision of a compliance toolkit for all probation areas/trusts that highlights best practice;</p>

The blueprint sets out HMCS&#146; strategic objective for enforcement which is for a cheaper, faster and more proportionate system that primarily focuses on first time compliance while continuing to apply the principles of rigorous enforcement to the hard core of defaulters.  The blueprint covers fines collection and account management, community penalty breach enforcement, failure to appear warrant execution and confiscation order enforcement.</p>

The Sentencing Guidelines Council is developing a definitive guideline on theft from a shop following full public consultation on a draft guideline. Sentencing in any individual case is entirely a matter for the court within the penalties prescribed by Parliament and taking account of any sentencing guidelines. Community sentences, where appropriate, can often be more effective at reducing re-offending than short prison sentences.</p>

 The CORE project remains within its published budget of &#163;9.7 million capital, with a further &#163;2 million non-capital funds being added during the current spending round to support the appointment of the CORE Keeper. The cost of developing CORE from its launch to date, excluding staff costs, is &#163;3,079,648.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_872"><a name="81126w0041.htm_para2"><a name="0811281000964">The CORE project was launched in January 2004 with initial delivery of the project being envisaged in 2006-07. Following project initiation a detailed planning exercise was undertaken and this timescale was subsequently revised to reflect issues highlighted by the political parties in relation to the format and completeness of data held at that time on electoral registers. By undertaking work to introduce electoral registration data standards, CORE should provide a more reliable mechanism for donation checking. Following consultation in 2006-07, and to ensure the system developed would be as rigorous as possible, the scope of the project was expanded and associated timescales amended to accommodate the enhanced functionality now required (including some anti-fraud measures). Current time scales indicate that the full system should be operational in 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_873"><a name="81126w0041.htm_para3"><a name="0811281000965">The data standards were introduced following a direction from my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State (Bridget Prentice) made under section 52 (1) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 (c2) (as amended). The direction requires all Electoral Registration Officers in Great Britain to ensure that any electoral registration data held on electronic systems is formatted in compliance with the standards by 1 December 2009.</p>

 The Penalty Notice for Disorder (PND) was established under sections 1-11 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001. Under section 2 (4), a penalty notice is defined as a notice offering the opportunity, by paying the penalty, to discharge any liability to be convicted of the offence to which the notice relates.</p>

PNDs for recordable offences must be recorded on the Police National Computer, not least to ensure that they are not issued to those who repeatedly offend. I am however considering how to improve the reliability of recording of PNDs on the Police National Computer and whether they should be different arrangements by which their issue could be taken into account by a court.</p>

 We are making good progress towards my Department's contribution to meeting the Nation's skills challenge. We estimate that by 2020 we will need to provide 250,000 apprenticeship starts and 190,000 successful completions in England to deliver Lord Leitch's ambition. Last year (2006-07) we delivered 184,000 apprenticeship starts and 112,000 successful completions. Completion rates have improved from 24 per cent. in 2001-02 to  63 per cent. in 2006-07. Data on the number of starts in 2007-08 is due to be published in December. World-class apprenticeships, published earlier this year, confirmed our commitment to making apprenticeships a high quality option for both young people and adults and set out steps to increase the numbers of people successfully completing an apprenticeship. In the summer, we published an Apprenticeships Draft Bill to drive and help sustain improvements in the quality of the programme. This focus on continuous improvement will be complemented by an increase in apprenticeships funding to over  &#163;1 billion by 2010-11.</p>

 In keeping with good procurement practice most consultancy contracts placed by Department are based on a requirement for the delivery of outcomes or outputs, and not for a number of consultancy days or hours. We are, therefore, unable to answer the question in the way it has been asked. However, the total number of live consultancy contracts in former Department for Education and Skills; Higher Education Group and Further Education Group, at the end of August 2008 was 17. Work is progressing to harmonise policies within the former Department for Trade and Industry Groups, Government Science, Innovation, Science and Research, to capture group portfolio information on external based resource, and therefore is not currently collected in  the form requested and can be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>

 Information on the operating deficits of individual universities and further education (FE) colleges is not held at Departmental level. The financial performance of universities and FE colleges is a matter for the Higher Education Funding Council for England and the Learning and Skills Council respectively.

 Under the current arrangements, institutions are required to pay a minimum bursary to all students receiving the maximum grant. Beyond this, it is for institutions themselves, subject to approval from OFFA, to decide how to support their students. The latest figures show that acceptances to universities for England are at an all time high, with the proportion of applicants from lower socio-economic groups also up. How the bursary system has operated will be looked at in the independent review of the way in which the fee system operates. We are reluctant at this stage to say that we should go from a system of locally determined bursaries to a national bursary system, which would simply be an extension of student financial support. Sir Martin Harris has judged that there is far more money in the bursary system as a result of local decisions than would have been the case had we imposed a bursary target as part of the fees legislation.</p>

 The first payments of income-contingent student loans and grants are made after the university or college confirms that the student is in attendance. On current performance, the Student Loans Company (SLC) then initiates payment within one working day of receipt of the confirmation in all cases. Payments are made through an automated system into bank accounts, which takes three working days from initiation.</p>

A change in student&#146;s circumstances can also affect payment where re-assessment is required. If the reassessment is for a higher amount than the original and/or includes a new product such as a means tested grant then the system works out what the further term 1 payment should be and pays it immediately.</p>

For some SHAs, the small numbers of cases and deaths for some of these cancers lead to wide random fluctuations in the relative survival rates and this Is reflected in the wide confidence intervals. For some cancers, the numbers of deaths within a SHA were too small for reliable estimation of all of the age-specific survival rates. In such cases, the overall survival rates have not been age-standardised; in the table such rates are marked with an asterisk (*).<br>
<sup>(1)</sup> Cancer survival varies with age at diagnosis, so the survival rates for all ages (15-99 years) have been age-standardised to control for differences in the age profile of cancer patients between geographical areas. We used the standard weights given in Chapter 3 of Coleman M P et al (1999) Cancer Survival Trends in England and Wales 1971-1995: deprivation and NHS Region. Studies in Medical and Population Subjects No.61. London: The Stationery Office. 1999.<br>
<sup>(2)</sup> Relative survival takes into account that some cancer patients will die from causes other than their cancer. It is the ratio of the crude survival to the survival in a corresponding (age and sex) group in the general population.<br>
<sup>(3)</sup> Aged 15-99 years at diagnosis.<br>
<sup>(4)</sup> Cancers registered in 1997-99 are defined by codes in the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Therefore, bladder cancer is defined by code C67. breast cancer by code C50. cervical cancer by code C53. colon cancer by code C18. lung cancer by code C34. oesophageal cancer by code C15. prostate cancer by<br>
<sup>(5)</sup> There are well-recognised differences in the classification and registration of some bladder tumours, which are recorded as malignant by some cancer registries and as non-malignant by others. This contributes to some of the apparent geographical variation in the survival rate for bladder cancer. Survival rates for transitional cell papillomas are very high, so where cancer registries define these as malignant, this results in an apparently higher overall survival rate for bladder cancer.<br>
<sup>(6)</sup> On repeated sampling, 95 times out of 100 the true value would be within the calculated confidence interval range and 5 times the true value would be either higher or lower than the range.<br>

1. The table presents median monthly income, net of tax and national insurance contributions, for disabled adults in the UK. This is consistent with our standard approach used when presenting household incomes in the Households Below Average Incomes.<br>
2. Disability is defined as having any long-standing illness, disability or infirmity that leads to a significant difficulty with one or more areas of the individual&#146;s life. Everyone classified as disabled under this definition would also be classified as disabled under the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA). However, some individuals classified as disabled under the DDA would not be captured by this definition.<br>
3. The Family Resources Survey (FRS) collects information on the incomes and circumstances of private households in the United Kingdom. The FRS is a nationally representative sample, covering approximately 26,000 households in 2006-07, the latest survey year.<br>
4. The estimates are based on sample counts that have been adjusted for non-response using multi-purpose grossing factors which align the FRS to Government Office Region populations by age and sex. Estimates are subject to sampling error and remaining non-response error.<br>
5. Evidence suggests that some items of income may be under reported in the survey, particularly self-employment and investment income.<br>
6. Income data on the FRS has not been adjusted to account for variation in household size and composition, or economic status.<br>
7. Most benefits are claimed on a benefit unit basis. Where the benefit unit consists of more than one adult, the benefit income is assigned to the lead claimant. Looking at the income of a subgroup of individuals may not therefore be an accurate reflection of income as it may exclude benefit income paid on behalf of the benefit unit where the individual is not the lead claimant.<br>

The network of posts in Europe is at the forefront of FCO efficiency programmes with a savings target of &#163;15,000,000 by the end of FY 2010-11. These efficiencies, which are under regular review, will be realised by reprioritising the use of posts' budgets and redeployment of frontline staff.</p>

 The military have held power in Burma since 1962. Under their current guise of the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), power is concentrated in the hands of General Than Shwe and a handful of senior generals. In spite of recent internal challenges, such as mass protests last September, the SPDC has retained a firm grip over the country and continues to preside over gross economic mismanagement and systematic human rights abuses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1084"><a name="81126w0059.htm_para12"><a name="0811283001336">Following a flawed constitutional referendum in May, the regime appears intent on pressing ahead with elections in 2010 designed to entrench military rule in all but name. The recent sentencing of around one hundred monks and political activists to long prison terms underlines the regime's determination to snuff out dissent in advance of the poll. Unless elections are conducted in an atmosphere free from political repression, with the full participation of all Burma's political and ethnic groups, they will lack all credibility and perpetuate the country's many problems.</p>

 The matter was raised during discussion of the situation in the eastern DRC at the GAERC on Monday 10 November. EU Foreign Ministers agreed that it was unlikely that a rapid deployment of forces from the EU or elsewhere could produce a significant increase to the capability that already exists in the region. They agreed that the best way forward was continued support for a political solution under the framework provided by the Nairobi communiqu&#233; and the Goma accord and to ensure that the 17,000 strong force in the UN mission to DR Congo are correctly deployed and effectively mandated to provide security in the east of the country.</p>

 The recruitment and conscription of children as fighters in contravention of international humanitarian law by many of the armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), including the Lord&#146;s Resistance Army (LRA), is of serious concern. The UK is providing &#163;17 million to the Multi-Country Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme, a significant proportion of which is spent on special projects for children associated with armed groups.

 The UK supports US plans to expand Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) assets in Europe to provide defensive coverage against the potential threat from ballistic missiles. The planned BMD system is not intended for, or capable of, countering Russian strategic nuclear forces. It is designed to counter limited ballistic missile threats from a small number of states of concern.</p>

In the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), NATO and the EU we have tried and tested mechanisms that are delivering security in Europe. We must not undermine them. The UK is interested in President Sarkozy's suggestion of convening an OSCE summit to discuss European security, when the conditions are right. It is important that all transatlantic partners take part in any such talks and that they also take into account our broader common values: democracy, human rights and rule of law, as well as our existing commitments.</p>

 Effective financial monitoring and efficient use of resources is a high priority in our embassies in Paris, Berlin, Madrid, Brussels, Rome and Dublin, as it is in all posts in Europe and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). Given the importance of effective financial monitoring the Head of Mission is accountable at each post for the sign off of expenditure and receipts and the day-to-day management of post budgets being overseen by a management officer. The network of posts in Europe is at the forefront of FCO efficiency programmes with a savings target of &#163;15,000,000 by the end of FY 2010-11. These efficiencies, which are under regular review, will be realised by reprioritising the use of posts budgets and redeployment of frontline staff.</p>

 The regional agreement between Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore to coordinate law enforcement in the Malacca Straits established a joint mechanism for tackling piracy which is widely regarded as a success. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) sponsored a series of conferences on Security, Safety and Environment of the Malacca Straits with the engagement of the regional states which examined the high incidence of piracy in these waters. The UK along with other principal users of the Straits (USA and Japan) offered technical assistance to the littoral states to help combat piracy.

 The BBC World Service&#146;s operations in Russia provide the Russian audience with trusted, high quality current affairs programmes and new media services. BBC Russian is a distinctive public service, and is a World Service priority language service. It is the second largest language service in the World Service both in terms of budget and radio programming. It is essential that it remains relevant and maximises its audience impact by the appropriate means (e.g. through a more focused streamlined news delivery on radio and an increased online presence). That is why the Foreign and Commonwealth Office supported the recent changes that will assist BBC Russia in its mission to be the most trusted and influential international news provider in Russia.</p>

 The EU disbursed nearly  &#163;1 billion pounds to the water sector in Africa last year. The EU Africa Working Group works with the African Ministers Council on Water (AMCOW) to improve the effectiveness of this aid. The Department for International Development (DFID) is this year co-chairing, with AMCOW, the Africa Working Group. This has led to a strengthened engagement with African partners and donors to ensure that future aid provided to Africa more closely matches the needs of those countries to meet the water and sanitation targets. The Africa Working Group has also worked to highlight the need to do more on sanitation, the most off-track of the millennium development goals. This has led to 32 African Ministers committing to give increased priority, including more national funding, to sanitation.</p>

While global prices may continue to fall until the end of the year, the economic slowdown could reduce yield growth as producers spend less on irrigation, fertilisation, and other inputs necessary to boost yields.</p>

 The Department for International Development's (DFID) programmes in India conform to the non-discrimination provisions of the Indian Constitution. DFID supports specific government strategies, such as positive discrimination and provision of incentives, which are used to benefit disadvantaged groups. DFID tracks the impacts of its programmes on different social groups and women to make sure these strategies are working.</p>

Dalit teachers are recruited to encourage Dalit students to enrol, stay in school and get the most out of their time there. Dalit children's share in elementary enrolments improved from 18.6 per cent. to 19.9 per cent. between 2006 and 2007. Similarly, the DFID-supported Reproductive and Child Health Programme has a specific aim to increase access to quality health services for the most socially excluded. As a result of this programme, the percentage of institutional deliveries among women increased by 30 per cent. between 2006 and early 2008, a large proportion of whom are Dalits as the programme specifically targets Dalit women.</p>

The actual number for each country will be determined by country needs and take into account the role of other partners such as the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria.</p>

 Support to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) is at the heart of UK Government engagement in Sudan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1247"><a name="81126w0072.htm_para5"><a name="0811283002845">The Department for International Development (DFID) is working closely with the British embassy to support implementation of the CPA in the run up to the elections. Elements of our support are highlighted as follows:</p>
<a name="81126w0072.htm_brev2"><a name="0811283006241"><ul><p class="tabletext">We support the Assessment and Evaluation Commission (AEC)&#151;the body responsible for monitoring the implementation of the CPA. A senior UK ambassador&#151;Sir Derek Plumbly&#151;is now the chair of the AEC. The UK chairs the Security Working Group of the AEC and has a large programme in support of implementation of CPA security protocols, including security sector reform.</p>
</ul><a name="81126w0072.htm_brev3"><a name="0811283006242"><ul><p class="tabletext">Between 2005 and 2008, we contributed &#163;49.6 million to the two Multi-donor Trust Funds (National and Southern Sudan). These Funds are the primary mechanisms for donor support for the priority reconstruction and development needs of war affected regions in Sudan. We have pledged a further &#163;63 million to these Funds for the second half of the interim period, 2008 to 2011.</p>
</ul><a name="81126w0072.htm_brev4"><a name="0811283006243"><ul><p class="tabletext">We have worked intensively to resolve crisis points in the CPA. For example, following the conflict in Abyei in June 2008, we worked with the international community to establish the Abyei road map. DFID funding will support construction of the new Abyei administration and the police headquarters.</p>
</ul><a name="81126w0072.htm_brev5"><a name="0811283006244"><ul><p class="tabletext">We provide support to address the underlying drivers of conflict in Sudan. For example, we plan to set up a Peace Building Fund for the conflict sensitive areas along the disputed border (&#163;750,000 in 2008) and piloted innovative approaches to community security and arms control in Jongiei state in Southern Sudan (&#163;1.7 million in 2008).</p>
</ul><a name="81126w0072.htm_brev6"><a name="0811283006245"><ul><p class="tabletext">We provide support to ensure that the key CPA milestones are met. In 2008, DFID provided &#163;3.1 million in support of Census preparations and monitoring. In 2007-08, we provided technical assistance to the National Constitutional Review Committee (NCRC) to revise the electoral law. We have also supported the establishment of the National Elections Commission (NEC) through UNDP.</p>

In response to 237365, the information available to parents and young people will include information about shielding: that a shielding facility exists on ContactPoint, that there are criteria about when it is appropriate to apply a shield, and that a young person, parent or carer will be able to contact their local authority if they have reason to believe their child's record should be shielded on ContactPoint.</p>

3. The reference period for Households Below Average Income figures is single financial years. Three sample years have been combined for London as regional single year estimates are subject to volatility.<br>
4. The income measures used to derive the low income estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication &#145;Households Below Average Income&#146; series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or &#147;equivalised&#148;) for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br>
5. The low income figures are based on OECD equivalisation factors.<br>
6. Low income figures have been presented before Housing costs, which is consistent with the child poverty PSA target. For before Housing costs, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income.<br>
7. Numbers of children in low income households have been rounded to the nearest 100,000 children, while proportions of children in low income households have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.<br>

In the past 12 months, the Government have also made significant progress towards the implementation of the new vetting and barring scheme, which will further strengthen the system for preventing unsuitable adults from working with children, including in schools.</p>

The review will examine the practical operation of the current statutory and non-statutory safeguarding arrangements that apply to independent schools, non-maintained special schools and boarding schools in the maintained, non-maintained and independent sectors in England. Sir Roger expects to conclude his work in February 2009.</p>

In June 2008, new materials on forced marriage were launched specifically for schools and for young people to raise awareness of forced marriage. These were sent to all secondary schools, pupil referral units, local authorities and Local Safeguarding Children Boards. New draft guidance on forced marriage was published for consultation in July 2008. The consultation closed in October, and the new statutory guidance was launched on 25 November.</p>

We have also started a series of regional conferences (late 2008 to early 2009) on Partnership Working to Keep Pupils Safe which is aimed at schools, police and local authorities. We have an ongoing programme of work to prevent and tackle the bullying of children. Our guidance, &#147;Safe To Learn&#148;, advises schools on tackling bullying related to ethnicity, sexuality, disability and cyberbullying.

 The Government&#146;s school standards and school improvement strategies aim to raise standards in all schools, and thanks to a range of measures including increased investment, excellent leadership and teaching; renewed primary and secondary teaching frameworks; better use of pupil data; and the targets schools and local authorities have set for their pupils, school standards have risen substantially since 1997.

disadvantaged children therefore receive additional funds to help them improve standards. In addition, the Government support the City Challenge programme which aims to break the link between deprivation and educational under-achievement in London, Greater Manchester and the Black Country.</p>

City Challenge is an expansion of the successful London Challenge programme, which Ofsted reported had a dramatic impact on London schools: reducing the number of secondary schools in special measures, maintaining GCSE results ahead of the national average and narrowing the attainment gap between disadvantaged children and their peers more quickly than nationally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1351"><a name="81126w0082.htm_para12"><a name="0811283004207">The National Challenge programme shares the City Challenge objective to break the link between disadvantage and low attainment. The National Challenge seeks to ensure there are no schools where fewer than 30 per cent. of pupils achieve five good GCSEs including English and mathematics by 2011. Over the next three years, we are investing &#163;400 million in the National Challenge, which builds on the successful London Challenge approach in providing bespoke support for schools facing some of the most significant challenges across the country. As in City Challenge areas, National Challenge schools serve areas where pupils are more likely than average to come from deprived backgrounds&#151;as shown by eligibility for free school meals. None the less, since there are many schools in similarly adverse socio-economic conditions where more than 30 per cent. of students gain five good GCSEs including English and mathematics, deprivation should not be seen as an excuse for low achievement.</p>

Under the legislation, the priority need categories include, among others, applicants whose household includes a child or pregnant woman and applicants whose household includes someone who is vulnerable for some reason, for example because of mental illness or is ability. In the pre-Budget Report the Chancellor announced an extension of the mortgage rescue scheme to cover second charge lending.</p>

As the table illustrates, seizures were at their highest in 2001-02 following the launch of the Government&#146;s highly successful &#145;Tackling Tobacco Smuggling&#146; strategy in 2000.

This set out further measures to clamp down on tobacco smuggling, and, in particular, the persistent problem of smuggled HRT. This resulted in an increase in HRT seizures as shown in the table.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1470"><a name="81126w0093.htm_para2"><a name="0811283005197">The new measures included the introduction in 2006 of new legislation placing obligations on tobacco manufacturers to control their supply chains. We expect this measure to have a significant impact on the illicit HRT market. However, because its objective is to reduce the availability of hand rolling tobacco to smugglers, it will not necessarily result in greater levels of seizures.</p>

This strategy was published alongside the pre-Budget report on 24 November.</p>

<i> [holding answer 10 September 2008]:</i> By the end of March 2008<sup>(1)</sup>, four out of five of the televisions sold were digital, up from 73 per cent. in December 2007. Major stores have committed to not stocking analogue-only television equipment. The digital switchover certification mark (the &#145;digital tick&#146; logo), owned by the Secretary of State, indicates products such as integrated digital television sets which are designed to work through switchover. By July 2008 85 per cent. of retailers (by volume of TV and set top box sales) were using the &#145;digital tick&#146; logo and 76 per cent. of people are aware of the &#145;digital tick&#146; and what it means. The Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations which came into force on 26 May 2008 forbid retailers and manufacturers from misleading consumers, including by omitting information that the average consumer needs to make an informed transactional decision. This would include any retailer not telling a potential purchaser of an analogue-only TV that it would not be capable of handling broadcasts when the analogue transmissions were switched off without the addition of a digital adaptor box. This example is included by the OFT in their guidance on the application of the Consumer Protection Regulations. We will keep the developments in the market under review, but currently do not consider that further action to encourage the purchase of integrated digital television sets (as opposed to analogue-only televisions) is needed.</p>
