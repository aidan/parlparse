To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to his written statement of 7 January 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 9&#150;10WS, on reserve forces, what his policy is in respect of <i>(a)</i> full-time regular Service and <i>(b)</i> compulsory call-out when making provision for medium-sized operations of low intensity.

 The reserve forces are an integral part of the United Kingdom's military capability for a wide variety of different types of operations. Many factors will determine the number of reservists required to support a particular operation and whether it is necessary to mobilise reservists compulsorily. These factors include: the size of the operation; other concurrent operations; the time available to set up and train a force before deployment; the expected length of a particular operation; the individual skills and trades required; and the pool of people available with the requisite qualifications.

 The article in <i>Nature</i> indicated that about a quarter of the land species in the areas studied could be committed to extinction in 2050 under mid-range global climate warming scenarios. However the article did not provide a prediction for extinction rates in the UK.
<P>

<a name="40115w02.html_para4">The Department, along with the devolved Administrations, statutory nature conservation agencies and non-governmental organisations, is contributing to an ongoing research programme on the impacts of climate change on biodiversity in the UK. Results suggest that as climate changes, the distribution of species and the composition of habitats will change. With warmer temperatures, some northern species are likely to retreat, while southern species may be able to expand their ranges. Movement of some species may be strongly impeded by our highly fragmented landscapes, possibly leading to local extinctions.

<a name="40115w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The application by Bayer for the importation of herbicide tolerant rice (event LLRICE62) into the European Union is being considered under the procedures set out in Directive 2001/18/EC. The UK is the lead member state and therefore undertakes the initial assessment. The Government has been advised by ACRE that "This GM rice does not pose a risk to human health and the environment. The marketing of this product for importation and processing in the UK will be no different from that of other rice imported for processing and animal feed purposes. In coming to this conclusion ACRE have taken account of the advice of the Advisory Committee on Animal Feedingstuffs (ACAF). ACRE 



<P>
<P><I>15 Jan 2004 : Column 827W</I><P>
also recommends that reports of post market monitoring for general surveillance of this product be provided to the regulatory authorities on an annual basis". The complete ACRE advice is available on the Defra website at: www.defra.gov.uk/environment/gm/regulation/euconsent.htm.

<a name="40115w03.html_para1">The application and the UK's assessment will now be assessed by other EU member states and the Commission before a collective decision is made.

 The silhouette on a passport must be signed by a veterinary surgeon or someone deemed competent to do so by the Passport Issuing Organisation. This is clearly the intention of the legislation but recently we became aware that some passport issuing organisations were allowing individual horse owners to complete and sign the silhouette. Independent verification is clearly essential. In underlining this point to the organisations I have proposed that the owner may complete the silhouette provided a microchip is inserted at the same time. This reflects our approach of working with the industry and seeking to be practical rather than gold plating the legislation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40115w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 It is difficult to provide accurate data on the overall numbers of street children in Asia or to provide a breakdown by country. Estimates are unreliable and coverage is patchy. According to UNICEF there are roughly about 25 million children estimated to be living on the streets in Asia. However there is no reliable information for many Asian countries. In India the Ministry of Social Welfare estimates that there are between 75,000 and 250,000 street children in Calcutta alone. UNICEF estimate there are 15,000 street children in Vietnam and 16,000 in Sri Lanka.
<P>

<a name="40115w04.html_para1">The fundamental cause of children living on the street is poverty. This is exacerbated by chronic hunger, lack of school places and family conflict. Between 30 per cent. to 50 per cent. of children in South Asia are malnourished. Despite improvements in education provision around 41 per cent. of children drop out of school before they reach the fifth grade. Between 30 per cent. to 55 per cent. of school age children are working. Many of these children are exploited through child labour or are involved in the sex industry. Unless these problems are addressed the problems of street children in Asia will continue to grow.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development how much money has been provided by his Department in each of the last six years to tackle the problem of street children in Asia; what proportion of the money has been spent by whom; and with what results.  [148131]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40115w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 Urban poverty, homelessness, lack of education and the demand for child labour forces children to leave their families and live on the streets in Asia. It is important that these underlying problems are addressed as well as helping street children directly. Our bilateral programmes in Asia aim to alleviate family poverty more generally as a basis for addressing the needs of street children.
<P>

<a name="40115w04.html_para2">Many of our programmes support NGO activities that advocate for the rights of children and work directly with street children. In Bangladesh we are supporting two NGOs to provide informal education to vulnerable working children in urban areas at a cost of &#163;8 million. In Burma we have been supporting a street and working children project with World Vision at a total cost of &#163;450,000. In India we are supporting a local NGO to work with child street vendors and have several other small projects in the pipeline focusing on vulnerable working children in urban areas.
<P>

<a name="40115w04.html_para3">We are providing &#163;1.6 million to Save the Children to work directly with vulnerable children in the Mekong sub region. This project aims to prevent poor rural children being trafficked to urban areas in the region for purposes of sexual exploitation and under age employment. This helps to reduce the potential for these children to end up on the street.

<a name="40115w05.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 The Northern Ireland Local Government Officers' Superannuation Committee is required, by regulation, to obtain an actuarial valuation of the assets and liabilities of its pension fund every three years. The next actuarial valuation exercise takes place on 31 March 2004. Each quarter the Committee and the fund's actuary monitor the position and the Department of the Environment is advised accordingly, on a regular basis.

Superannuation Fund would be to his Department's annual budget; and whether the spending plans for 2005&#150;06 reflect such a possible increase.  [147534]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40115w05.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 For all employing authorities contributing to the Northern Ireland Local Government Officers' Superannuation Fund, the estimated cost of an increase from the current employer contribution rate of 4.6 per cent. to 11.9 per cent. would incur further contribution income amounting to &#163;32,605,830 in one year. There are currently 209 employing authorities, including district councils, education and library boards, the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, Housing Associations and certain schools and colleges, all of which would have to budget for any increase.
<P>

<a name="40115w05.html_para1">The rate of 11.9 per cent. is, however, at this stage, an indication of the potential required increase and the position will be determined when the actuarial valuation of the fund, as at 31 March 2004, is obtained by the Northern Ireland Local Government Officers' Superannuation Committee. It is anticipated that a stepped approach to increasing contribution rates would be adopted, over the period 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2007. The position would also be reassessed at the 31 March 2007 valuation. Efforts would be made to keep annual increases in the contribution rate within the range of 2 per cent. to 4 per cent. of pensionable payroll. 2005&#150;06 spending plans do not, as yet, take account of any potential increase.

no evidence was found to suggest that nuclear materials were diverted from their intended uses. Nor was any evidence found to suggest non-compliance with provisions relating to particular safeguards provisions assumed by the Community under agreements concluded with third states. The report includes comments on a number of UK installations; these comments are generally positive. Discrepancies that arose at some UK reactors (Bradwell, Sizewell A and Wylfa) were followed-up and, after consultation with the operator involved, satisfactorily resolved. The Commission acknowledges that the operator had taken steps to correct the discrepancy and prevent its recurrence.

 On 22 February 2002, the Chief Medical Officer (CMO), Professor Sir Liam Donaldson and the Chief Nursing Officer, Sarah Mullally, published an updated letter, "Carbon Monoxide: the forgotten Killer". The letter pulled together the most current information available on carbon monoxide and was forwarded to community nurses, midwives, health visitors and general practitioners, professionals who are most likely to be aware of patients' living conditions and so identify those at increased risk. This letter was originally published on 7 September 1998.

<a name="40115w09.html_para1">Similarly, the quarterly "CMO Update" has included several reminders to GPs on the importance of diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning since 1998. Officials also issued a video in March 2002, prepared for the Health and Safety Executive, to all GP surgeries. The video highlights the main symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, as well as advising GPs on how to diagnose possible cases of carbon monoxide poisoning.

 A general public consultation on the broad future research agenda for diabetes was undertaken to support the joint Department of Health and Medical Research Council review of current and future research in diabetes. The remit of the research advisory committee that conducted the review was to consider all research on diabetes in the United Kingdom in the international context, with a view to identifying opportunities for new research, options for strengthening research, and areas where research could support clinical practice, public health and the national service framework for diabetes.

<P>
<a name="40115w10.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The Department of Health and the Medical Research Council's review of current and future research on diabetes identified the principal opportunities for research across the whole field from molecular biology to health services research, including clinical research. The complications of diabetes which give rise to morbidity and to premature mortality were the subject of particular consideration by the members of the advisory committee and of a specific sub-group. A major determinant of the development of these complications in Type 1 diabetes is the control of the blood glucose by self-injection of insulin. The review identified research into the most effective use of existing and new insulin's, better insulin delivery systems, and training in self-management as fundamental to good control in these patients. Much research is being done in these areas. The Committee members did not consider, nor was it suggested to them, that the minor differences in the effects on humans of insulin from different species might contribute to differential rates of development of the complications of diabetes.

 <i>[holding answer 15 December 2003]:</i> The Cabinet Office is currently co-ordinating work between relevant Government Departments, including the Department of Health, to review imported infections and immigration. The review aims to establish the facts about the impact of immigration on public health and national health service expenditure, consider all relevant issues including health screening and propose solutions should action be required. It is on-going and no decisions have been taken yet.
<P>

<a name="40115w10.html_para1">Asylum seekers are offered health assessments and screening for tuberculosis (TB) at the Home Office induction centre in East Kent (and will be offered them at other induction centres as they are rolled out). Testing for HIV is offered as part of the health assessment on request or where medical history indicates they have been at risk. The aims of the health assessment are to identify the immediate healthcare needs of the asylum seeker and to protect public health. Imposing mandatory health screening on asylum seekers would breach their human rights and would be contrary to the 1951 Refugee Convention.
<P>

<a name="40115w10.html_para2">In relation to other migrants, long-standing policy is that any person subject to immigration control who either mentions health or medical treatment as a reason for coming to the United Kingdom, or appears unwell; or is seeking leave to enter the UK for six months or more and is at high risk of having been exposed to TB should be referred by the immigration officer to a medical inspector. These arrangements are governed by Schedule 2 of the Immigration Act 1971 and the Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules (HC 395).

<P>

<a name="40115w12.html_para5">The Government's overriding objective is to save lives by doing more to prevent fires occurring in the first place. The White Paper also set out the government's expectation that existing fire authorities, including those in the East of England, would develop robust regional management arrangements to deliver the functions which are most efficiently and effectively performed at a regional level. Under these arrangements staff numbers in the East of England will continue to be a matter for the individual Fire and Rescue Authority employers concerned.
<P>

<a name="40115w12.html_para6">Operationally, the benefits of the regional approach will be improved resilience to terrorism and to major incidents such as flooding, integrated modern control rooms with the latest technology and improved specialist fire investigation.
<P>

<a name="40115w12.html_para7">Financially, procurement, training and human resource functions will all benefit from standardisation and pooling of resources and expertise. It is not possible to provide a meaningful breakdown of the respective benefits these savings will bring to central Government, individual citizens and localities, but all will benefit from a reduction in the &#163;6.63 billion annual cost of fire to the economy in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="40115w12.html_para8">The Government are currently consulting on their draft National Framework for the Fire and Rescue Service. Those to whom the document has been sent include the Chairs of individual Fire Authorities, the Local Government Association and a wide range of bodies representing both retained and full time staff. Police authorities have not been specifically consulted, but comments from all stakeholders are invited by 12 March 2004.

 <i>[holding answer 12 January 2004]:</i> Gift Aid is designed to promote giving to charity by individuals. It has delivered significant benefits to all fundraising charities. Donations to charities using Gift Aid are subject to rules governing the level of benefit that a donor can receive from the charity in return for a gift. If a gift exceeds these limits then Gift Aid cannot be claimed on the gift. However, under a special exemption introduced in 1989 and imported into Gift Aid as part of a wider reform in 2000, certain heritage and conservation charities are able to claim Gift Aid on membership subscriptions in the same way as they were previously able to claim tax refunds under Deeds of Covenant. Deeds of Covenant lasted for at least three years, meaning that a donor was required to have an ongoing commitment to a charity, but Gift Aid can apply to one-off donations as well.
<P>

<a name="40115w13.html_para4">A number of charities eligible for the special exemption are claiming Gift Aid tax refunds under so-called 'day membership' schemes. These schemes do not generate additional giving, but simply reclassify admission fees as donations on which Gift Aid is being claimed.
<P>

<a name="40115w13.html_para5">The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the pre-Budget report (Cm 6042) that the Government will amend the Gift Aid legislation to ensure that the special exemption applies as it was originally intended and not to these 'day memberships'.
<P>

<a name="40115w13.html_para6">This will mean that heritage and conservation charities will continue to benefit from the special exemption where a donor has an ongoing commitment to the charity, such as an annual membership, and these charities&#151;like other fundraising charities&#151;will continue to benefit from Gift Aid on other donations of money.
<P>

<a name="40115w13.html_para7">No estimate is available of the amount of money being claimed by charities which are taking advantage of this. Charities are not required to differentiate on their Gift Aid claims the amounts they are claiming for 'day membership' income from other amounts they are claiming. However, the purpose of this measure is not to raise revenue but to maintain a level playing field for all charities. It is unfair that some charities are claiming Gift Aid payments on what is in effect an admission fee when most other charities cannot.

<P>

<a name="40115w14.html_para12">Under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, the Home Office can only license the use of animals for scientific purposes where there is no non-animal alternative, and then only when both the number of animals to be used and any resulting suffering is minimised. This reflects the principles of the 3Rs&#151;the refinement of scientific procedures, the reduction of the number of animals used and their replacement with other methods wherever possible. However, as a demand-led regulator working on a case-by-case basis, we have no control over the total amount of research taking place. That is determined by a number of factors, including the economic climate and global trends in scientific endeavour.
<P>

<a name="40115w14.html_para13">It is essential that we continue to regulate effectively. We must also continue to apply fully the 3Rs, and to support and encourage their development and promotion. We do this in a number of ways. For example, all applications are subjected to scrutiny within institutional local ethical review processes at licensed establishments, and are also assessed separately by Home Office Inspectors, who are all either medical or veterinary graduates, to ensure that no relevant replacement, reduction or refinement measure has been overlooked.
<P>

<a name="40115w14.html_para14">We are also currently exploring the recommendation by the House of Lords Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures that there should be a United Kingdom centre for research into the 3Rs. This is being considered by the Inter-Departmental Group on the 3Rs, led by the Home Office and also comprising officials from the Department of Health, the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Office of Science and Technology, the Food Standards Agency, the Health and Safety Executive, and other agencies. The Inter-Departmental Group is also reviewing the effectiveness of the Inter-Departmental Data Sharing Concordat announced in August 2000, which commits United Kingdom regulatory authorities to help resolve legal and other obstacles and encourages 



<P>
<P><I>15 Jan 2004 : Column 869W</I><P>
data sharing between clients to reduce animal testing. The Inter-Departmental Group will report back to me on both of these issues shortly.
<P>

<a name="40115w14.html_para15">In addition, every year the Home Office makes available to the Animal Procedures Committee a budget aimed at developing or promoting the 3Rs. The amount made available to the Committee for 2003&#150;2004 for this specific purpose is &#163;280,000. Work aimed at improving the environmental conditions in which laboratory animals are kept and transported has also been sponsored. This is not the only money spent by Government on the 3Rs. We estimate that Government Departments, agencies and funding bodies spend up to &#163;10 million each year on such research. Industry spends a great deal more.
<P>

<a name="40115w14.html_para16">On an international level, the United Kingdom Government supports the European Centre for the Validation of Alternatives Methods (ECVAM) through contributions to the European Union. It is the task of ECVAM to monitor and co-ordinate research into alternatives and to develop the processes of validation, that is, the assessment of alternative methods to see whether they are reliable and whether they produce a level of information similar to the animal based tests they are to replace.
<P>

<a name="40115w14.html_para17">This is not, however, an area where quick gains can be expected. In the longer term, we believe that further significant reduction in animal use will, and must, continue to rely largely on the scientific community's own efforts to develop, validate and adopt more advanced methods based on the 3Rs.

 The Government are fully committed to the effective and efficient implementation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 which makes provision for the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes while recognising the need to use animals in medical research, the development of new medicines, and scientific testing.
<P>

<a name="40115w14.html_para18">Under the 1986 Act, both personal and project licences are required. These ensure that those doing the work are qualified and suitable; that alternatives to animals are used wherever possible; that the number of animals used is minimised; and that any suffering or other harmful effects experienced by the animals have been weighed against the potential benefits (to humans or animals) and have been minimised.
<P>

<a name="40115w14.html_para19">In addition, work can only be carried out at designated establishments which have suitable veterinary and animal welfare personnel and the standards of accommodation and care provided for the animals must meet or surpass the provisions of Home Office codes of practice. Under the Act, the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate is charged with inspecting designated places to monitor compliance with these codes of practice and the licence authorities. About 2,500 inspections are made annually of which

 Since the financial year 1988&#150;89, the Home Office has made available to the Animal Procedures Committee a budget for the development and promotion of alternatives which replace animal use, reduce the number of animals used, or refine the procedures involved to minimise suffering (the 3Rs). Work aimed at improving the environmental conditions in which laboratory animals are kept and transported has also been sponsored. Details of completed research are published in the Annual Reports of the Animal Procedures Committee, which are available from The Stationery Office and, for recent years, on the Committee's website.
<P>

<a name="40115w14.html_para20">The Committee seeks to allocate 60 per cent. of the budgets provided on research into reducing, refining and replacing the use of animals in scientific procedures and another 20 per cent. on the development and promotion of awareness and use of alternatives.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many initial decision makers for asylum applications were in post on 1 October in each of the last six years.  [142155]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40115w15.html_spnew2"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Records are available for the years from 2000. The number of staff deployed on decision-making depends on the volume of cases. Internal management information indicates that, as the backlog of outstanding applications has fallen and decisions have been made more quickly, the number of full-time equivalent staff deployed on making initial decisions for asylum applications was 477 in October 2000, 465 in October 2001, 396 in October 2002 and 365 in October 2003.

 <i>[holding answer 8 December 2003]</i>: No written representations have been received from the First Minister of Scotland on detention policy as this is a reserved matter. The First Minister has, however, written recently to me emphasising the importance of the UK Government's careful engagement with this issue.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to permit asylum seekers in general to take up employment.  [142768]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40115w15.html_spnew4"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 There are no plans to allow asylum seekers in general to take employment. The European directive on reception standards for asylum seekers comes into force in February 2005. At that time asylum seekers who have waited more than one year for an initial decision on their claim will be able to seek permission to work. Although the employment concession for asylum seekers was abolished on 23 July 2002 we retain discretion to allow asylum seekers to work. The discretion is exercised sparingly but might be appropriate in cases where an asylum seeker has, through no fault of their own, waited for longer than 12 months for an initial decision on their claim. The majority of asylum claims receive an initial decision well within this period. 81 per cent. of applications for asylum received in the period April to June 2003 had initial decisions reached and served within two months.
<P>

<a name="40115w15.html_para1">We are currently considering whether asylum seekers and failed asylum seekers currently in work whose employment would meet the requirements for the issue of a work permit should be allowed to remain in employment.

<a name="40115w15.html_para7">The number of applications from nationals of the accession countries fell from 250 in October 2002 to 25 in June 2003 following the introduction (in November 2002) of the non-suspensive appeal measure included in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.
<P>

<a name="40115w15.html_para8">The Home Office will continue to remove nationals of the candidate states in the same circumstances as now up until accession, although this will be kept under constant review. This is being done in the interests of maintaining an effective immigration control and the need to control numbers prior to accession; because we are not legally obliged to grant free movement rights under 1 May; and because we are giving free movement rights earlier than some other member states.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department on what basis he judges that the terms of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Bill as regards the removal of the children of asylum seekers are compatible with <i>(a)</i> the Human Rights Act 1998, <i>(b)</i> the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and <i>(c)</i> section 1 of the Children Act 1989.  [143061]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40115w15.html_spnew8"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Bill creates no powers for the removal of children of failed asylum seekers from their parents. Insofar as the withdrawal of support from people who have failed to establish a right to political asylum and who refuse to co-operate in their removal from the country leads to consideratipn by local authorities of the need for support for their children, it will be provided in a way that is consistent with the Human Rights Act, the Children Act and the United Kingdom's obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many asylum seekers have been granted permission to work due to exceptional circumstances; and what criteria are used to determine whether an application will succeed.  [143461]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40115w15.html_spnew9"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The information requested could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. Generally speaking, however, asylum seekers are not now allowed to take employment while their claim for asylum is pending. Prior to 23 July 2002 asylum seekers could request permission to work if their claim remained outstanding for longer than six months without a decision being made on it. The concession was abolished on 23 July 2002.
<P>

<a name="40115w15.html_para11">The majority of asylum claims receive an initial decision well within six months. 81 per cent. of applications for asylum received in the period April&#151;June 2003 had initial decisions reached and served within two months. 74 per cent. of applications for asylum received in 2002&#150;03 had initial decisions reached and served within two months, 84 per cent. within four months and 87 per cent. within six months. The number of asylum seekers who would have been able to benefit from the concession had it remained in force is now much reduced.

<P>
<a name="40115w15.html_spnew11"><B> Beverley Hughes  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 5 January 2004]:</i> We received six representations on the provision in question from local authorities, or organisations representing them or the services they administer, during the consultation exercise we carried out recently. As we made clear in our response to this exercise, it is our objective to ensure that few, if any, children need to be taken into care as a result of this provision, and officials are meeting the Local Government Association in order to discuss its practical application.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many individuals have been housed at Oakington Immigration Reception Centre during 2003 as a result of the detention overspill facility.  [145366]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40115w15.html_spnew12"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Following the success of the NSA process in 2002 that resulted in considerable intake reduction earlier than anticipated, there was the potential for utilisation of the Oakington facility. In line with considerations of public financial accountability a decision was taken to use part of the facility to detain families prior to removal on flights from nearby Stansted. It continued to be used for this purpose successfully throughout 2003.
<P>

<a name="40115w15.html_para12">The latest available information on people held in the immigration removal estate show that as at 27 September 2003&#150;260 people were housed at the Oakington Immigration Reception Centre. Information on the number of these who were there as a result of the detention overspill facility and on the total number of people detained in 2003 is not available except by examination of individual case-files at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40115w15.html_spnew16"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 There are no plans to do so at present. Section 50 of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 allows us to withdraw the opportunity for asylum seekers to apply for financial support only. During the passage of the Bill through Parliament we gave a commitment that there would be a full public consultation process before the provision was introduced.

 The Updated Drug Strategy 2002 aims to concentrate resources on the most dangerous drugs, the most damaged communities and those individuals whose addiction and chaotic lifestyles are the most harmful.

<P>

<a name="40115w16.html_para7">The level of seizure of drugs and drug related assets is one indicator of the effectiveness of policies to reduce the supply of illegal drugs. Recently, over &#163;20 million worth of cocaine was seized in one of the UK's biggest ever drugs operation, while over &#163;37 million, suspected of being the proceeds of crime or intended for use in crime, has been recovered.
<P>

<a name="40115w16.html_para8">The Government are also addressing drug related crime&#151;which includes high levels of acquisitive crime such as theft and burglary&#151;by getting more offenders out of crime and into treatment. The numbers of problematic drug users entering treatment in 2002&#150;03 increased by 41 per cent. to 140,900, against a baseline of 100,000 in 1998&#150;99. In April 2003, the Criminal Justice Intervention Programme (CJIP) was introduced to break the link between drugs and crime and is now operating in the 25 Drug Action Team areas with the highest level of acquisitive crime. It will be extended to a further 22 DATs in 2004&#150;05.

 The United Kingdom was closely involved in the drafting of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons which supplements the United Nations Convention against Trans-National Organised Crime. This requires countries which are signatories to adopt legislation to establish "trafficking in persons" as a criminal offence. The UK was also fully involved in discussions on the subsequent EU Council Framework Decision on Combating Trafficking in Human Beings. This requires all member states to ensure that trafficking for the purposes of labour exploitation or any form of sexual exploitation are punishable by terms of imprisonment with a maximum penalty that is not less than eight years.
<P>

<a name="40115w17.html_para9">We have acted quickly to deal with the worst forms of exploitation by creating an offence of trafficking for the purposes of controlling someone in prostitution within the Nationality, Immigration, and Asylum Act 2002, carrying a maximum penalty of 14 years. More comprehensive offences concerning trafficking into, within or out of the UK for the purposes of sexual exploitation are included in the Sexual Offences Act 2003, these also carry a maximum sentence of 14 years.
<P>

<a name="40115w17.html_para10">A new offence covering trafficking for forced labour and removal of organs is included in the Asylum and Immigration Bill, which is currently before Parliament.

<a name="40115w17.html_para11">We are committed to helping the victims of human trafficking. On 10 March 2003, we launched a pilot scheme under which, adult female victims of trafficking for purpose of sexual exploitation, who are willing to come forward to the authorities and help law enforcement against organised criminals are offered protection and a range of support services, such as counselling and health checks in safe accommodation managed by a voluntary sector organisation.
<P>

<a name="40115w17.html_para12">The pilot scheme ended on 31 December, and in its place we have established the protection and support as a service stream of support to victims until the end of the financial year 2004&#150;05. Although limited, the service will meet the current identified needs in the London area of adult women trafficked into the UK for purposes of sexual exploitation.
<P>

<a name="40115w17.html_para13">Through the pilot scheme in partnership with a Non-Government Organisation (NGO) we have developed a communication strategy that is to be launched early in March. It is multi-dimensional and aimed specifically at three target audiences&#151;increasing general public awareness, potential victim awareness and reaching trafficked women who have not been identified. We are developing a range of approaches including posters, networking with agencies (Health, Social Care and Housing providers), multi-disciplinary training and media profiling.
<P>

<a name="40115w17.html_para14">The communication strategy will be run as part of the service providing accommodation and support to victims in the London area. We will consider its impact and potential for a wider campaign as part of the evaluation of the scheme.

<a name="40115w17.html_para15">We will continue to consider victims' legal status on a case by case basis. We acknowledge that, if they do co-operate with the authorities, they may risk reprisals against themselves or their families' abroad. We will consider, in the light of individual circumstances, whether it would be appropriate to allow them to remain here. But if they are not entitled to remain, and it is not appropriate to let them stay, then they must be returned to their country wherever possible. To do otherwise would undermine our immigration law.

 The United Kingdom was closely involved in the drafting of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons which supplements the United Nations Convention against Trans-National Organised Crime. Article 9 of this refers to the need for social and economic initiatives, and Article 10 encourages the provision of training for law enforcement or other relevant officials. There have been a number of subsequent discussions at EU level to encourage the ratification of the UN Protocol. These have recognised that an effective strategy to combat human trafficking must include both preventative action to tackle the causes of trafficking, and training and capacity building in source and transit countries.

<a name="40115w17.html_para16">The UK is also contributing to, and has been involved in discussion about, the European Commission five-year (2003&#150;07) AGIS funding programme. This will provide funding for projects in the field of police and judicial co-operation, focusing on combating organised crime, including organised immigration crime, and encouraging co-operation between law enforcement agencies.

<a name="40115w17.html_para17">Funding under the EU Phare scheme is also available to member states for projects involving training for police personnel on organised crime.

 The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 received Royal Assent in November 2002, and sections 145 and 146, which cover trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation, came into force on 10 February 2003. Data on numbers of prosecutions under these sections will be collected and published in due course. Given that the powers came into effect very recently, there is not any information yet held centrally about numbers of prosecutions. Statistics of court proceedings for 2003 will be published in the autumn of 2004. The maximum sentence for this offence will be 14 years.
<P>

<a name="40115w17.html_para19">Prior to the introduction of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act, there was no specific offence under which people traffickers could be prosecuted. In 2000, the Government established a multi-agency taskforce called Reflex, to co-ordinate the UK's operational response to organised immigration crime. Under Reflex, a number of organised crime gangs involved in the smuggling or trafficking of people have been disrupted. Traffickers have been prosecuted for associated offences, for example, facilitation of illegal entry or living off immoral earnings, where trafficking

<P>
19. <a name="40115w19.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills whether he plans that the cap on variable fees will stay at &#163;3,000 until 2014.  [147884]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40115w19.html_spnew7"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 I have already given my assurance that the fee cap will stay at &#163;3,000 in real terms for the life of the next Parliament and I confirm that once more. Beyond that, any increase which is above the rate of inflation will, under the terms of the legislation, need to be approved by affirmative resolution which would require the consent of both Houses. I recognise that there are none the less concerns about the impact of variable fees on the university system: the Government will therefore establish an independent review, working with the Office for Fair Access, to report to the House, based on the first three years of their operation.

 We are working with the Learning and Skills Council, further education providers and other partners to promote the Adult Learning Grant. The main focus of the 10 pilots is on promoting the grant to new learners starting courses during January 2004 and to existing learners who may be eligible but have not applied. This involves a variety of methods including posters, college prospectuses, advertising in the local press, on bus shelters and on local radio, and mail shots targeted at specific audiences. Over 2,600 people have applied for the grant.

<P>
<a name="40115w19.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 My Department recognises the potential benefits to the community in schools being connected to broadband and making access to their ICT infrastructure more widely available. The 10 Regional Broadband Consortia for England are working with their member LEAs and schools in their area to develop this network accessibility.
<P>

<a name="40115w19.html_para3">The cross-government Broadband Aggregation Project, announced by e-Commerce Minister Stephen Timms in July last year, is also addressing the issues involved in using schools as broadband hubs for the wider community. Although there are some instances already where schools are extending access to the community, there are a number of issues to consider and resolve before defining the way forward in this area.
<P>

<a name="40115w19.html_para4">In terms of access to ICT more broadly, the Department's Extended Schools and School Community Links Team are developing guidance to assist schools in offering a range of ICT facilities to their communities. This guidance is expected to be available by the end of March 2004.

<P>
<a name="40115w19.html_spnew11"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 A Bill designed to improve services which protected children was announced in the Queens speech will be introduced to improve services designed to protect children. Subject to the outcome of consultation on the Children's Green Paper "Every Child Matters", the Bill will include proposals for local information sharing systems to enable practitioners to share early information about children and young people where appropriate. Implementation of the proposed local systems will require the development of a basic dataset on all children in an area together with a unique identifying number. This would apply from birth or if a child moves areas still has the same number. Only when a child comes into the country will she/he have to be allocated a number.

 The Government introduced a new funding formula for local authorities in 2003&#150;04. Floors and ceilings have been used on both the calculation of education Formula Spending Shares and Revenue Support Grant to phase in the new formula. This means that some authorities receive funding allocations above the level of the new formula and some receive funding allocations below the level of the new formula. The Government expect floors and ceilings to continue for as long as they are necessary. We have also said that we expect the Schools Formula Spending Share floor to be at least 5 per cent. per pupil in 2005&#150;06.

<sup>(20)</sup> Expenditure was not distinguished between pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of the Section 52 outturn statement in 1999&#150;2000.<P>

<P>

<sup>(21)</sup> Education as a whole includes expenditure on all phases of school education (including pre-primary), education out of school, continuing education and management and support.<P>

<sup>(22)</sup> n/a<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Net current expenditure includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEAs.<P>

2. Figures are in cash terms and rounded to the nearest &#163;1,000.<P>

3. The decrease in local authority expenditure on education from 1993&#150;94 reflects the transfer of responsibility for providing most kinds of further education from local education authorities to the Further Education Funding Council on 1 April 1993.<P>

4. Financial data is drawn from the DfES Section 52 outturn statements from 1999&#150;2000 onwards and the ODPM's RO1 statement previously.<P>

5. Nursery education was not shown separately until 1999&#150;2000, therefore figures for nursery are included within pre-primary and primary.<P>

6. Figures are as reported by LEAs. <P>

 The social class gap among those entering higher education is unacceptably wide. The most recent UCAS figures show that in 2001 71 per cent. of applicants came from the top three social classes and only 29 per cent. from the bottom three.
<P>

<a name="40115w21.html_para1">The main problem is prior attainment. 19 per cent. of 18-year-olds from the three lower social classes achieve two or more A Levels, compared to 50 per cent. from the three higher social classes.
<P>

<a name="40115w21.html_para2">The Government have put in place a range of policies to raise attainment and aspirations. These were summarised in "Widening participation in higher education", published in April 2003. A copy is available in the House of Commons Library.

 We acknowledge that for some schools in deprived former coalfield areas, raising the &#163;50,000 sponsorship required to make a specialist school application can be difficult.
<P>

<a name="40115w22.html_para5">The Department grant-aids the Specialist Schools Trust (SST) and the Youth Sport Trust to assist schools with raising sponsorship. We have also introduced a 'Partnership Fund' to provide support to schools that can demonstrate that sustained efforts to raise the full amount of sponsorship have been unsuccessful. The fund is administered by the SST in accordance with the Department's criteria. In the October 2003 specialist school application round, 13 schools in coalfield areas received a contribution from this fund.

<a name="40115w23.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Gillan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (1) what assessment he has made of the effects of the increase in teaching assistants covering non-contact time with classes;  [147544]
<P>
<UL>(2) what percentage of classroom teaching was covered by classroom assistants without teaching professionals being present in the class in 2002/03.  [147545]<P></UL>

<P>
<a name="40115w23.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 It is up to head teachers to determine how they deploy teachers and teaching assistants in their schools taking account of current regulations and guidance. Information about how teaching assistants' time is spent is not held centrally.
<P>

<a name="40115w23.html_para0">Standards of attainment are rising and the quality of teaching is the best ever. And teaching assistants are playing their part in raising standards. A recent project has demonstrated the positive impact of teaching assistants on standards. In 18 of the largest LEAs, additional provision and training for teaching assistants was provided last year for around 30 per cent. of their Year 6 classes. Results from the 2003 Key Stage 2 tests shows that performance in participating schools appears to have improved by 3 per cent. points more than the national average for English and 2 per cent. points for maths.

<P>
<a name="40115w23.html_wqn1"><B> John Barrett: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what legislation was implemented between 1997 and 2001 preventing the introduction of university top-up fees.  [147842]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40115w23.html_spnew1"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998 section 26 imposes conditions upon tuition fees for full-time undergraduates. Section 26(5) provides that the amount of tuition fee that can be charged should not exceed the maximum amount of tuition fee grant. The Student Support regulations, which are laid annually, set out the maximum amount of tuition fee grant. In 2003/04, the maximum amount of tuition fee grant is &#163;1,125.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40115w23.html_wqn2"><B> Helen Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (1) what the income levels will be at which students will qualify for the receipt of university bursaries;  [148209]




<P>

<P>
<UL>(2) what his policy is on the indexation of family income levels at which students will qualify to receive <i>(a)</i> grants and fee remission and <i>(b)</i> university bursaries.  [148210]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40115w23.html_spnew2"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The family income thresholds are uprated annually to take account of inflation. The uprating is based on the Treasury's forecast in October each year of the forecast rise in the Retail Price Index (less Mortgage Interest Repayments).
<P>

<a name="40115w23.html_para1">As regards university bursaries, the level and type of financial support will differ between institutions. However, as a minimum, we want to ensure, via the Director for Fair Access that no student who qualifies for maximum state support, in terms of the new higher education grant and the existing fee remission grant, has to take on additional debt as a result of higher fees. The director will expect more from institutions with further to go in widening participation.

<a name="40115w23.html_wqn3"><B> Dr. Pugh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (1) how much of the total sum of new funding that the Government believes universities in England require is required by universities in <i>(a)</i> the South East region and <i>(b)</i> London;  [148033]

<UL>(2) how much of the total sum of new funding that the Government believes universities in England require is required by universities in the North West region;  [148034]
<P>
(3) how much of the total sum of new funding that the Government believes universities in England require is required for <i>(a)</i> physical science, <i>(b)</i> arts and <i>(c)</i> social science courses.  [148047]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40115w23.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The funding for higher education in England between 2002&#150;03 and 2005&#150;06 is set out in the White Paper 'the future of higher education' (Cm 5735). There are increases of over 6 per cent. above inflation in each year so that by 2005&#150;06 the overall funding reaches almost &#163;10 billion.
<P>

<a name="40115w23.html_para2">The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) allocate funds to higher education institutions according to a formula which takes account of the number and type of students at the institution, the courses they are taking, and other factors relating to the institution such as whether it has old or historic buildings. The funds are paid to institutions as a block grant and it is for the institution to decide how to spend the money.
<P>

<a name="40115w23.html_para3">Under our proposals for variable fees, it will be for institutions to decide the level of any fee which they charge, taking account of a number of factors, including their financial needs.
