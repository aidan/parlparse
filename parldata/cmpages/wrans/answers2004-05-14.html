<p><a name="40514w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 In 2002, an impact survey was conducted by the China Population and Information Research Centre (CPIRC). Using funds provided by DFID, Southampton University provided technical assistance and quality control in the process of preparing the impact survey report.

<p><a name="40514w01.html_spnew1"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The total amount of UK development aid to African countries since 1992 is set out in the first table. This includes development expenditure by DFID, other government departments and the CDC (formerly the Commonwealth Development Corporation), whose recent reorganisation will greatly enhance its ability to mobilise investment into Africa. The fluctuations in this series are due to volatility in CDC investments and debt relief over which DFID has no control.

 The Government have been actively engaged in the Extractive Industries Review (EIR) process. DFID does not anticipate that the review will significantly influence future UK policy-making. It will however contribute to the ongoing process of improving the sustainable development performance of oil, gas and mining sectors; and the high standards that the World Bank encourages from its partners.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40514w01.html_para5">
DFID supports the main conclusion of the review that the World Bank Group should remain engaged with the extractives sector and agrees that it is important that social and environmental safeguards are rigorously applied, that human rights are respected, and that efforts are made to improve the governance and transparency of revenue flows from the sector.

All of these forces are routinely engaged in creating the conditions for stability in Afghanistan, through conflict prevention and resolution; examples during the past six weeks include the PRT&#039;s contributions towards facilitating Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration in the North, and to calming tensions in Meymanyeh.

<p><a name="40514w02.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 It is estimated that there are around 1,200 fire fighters whose refresher training is now overdue. This has been caused by a temporary shortage of instructors at the Defence Fire Service Training Establishment at RAF Manston, a situation we expect to remedy over the next three months.

 Fire fighter training is included within the scope of the Airfield Support Services Project which is seeking to establish the most cost effective method of providing airfield support, and wider fire services, without compromising operational effectiveness.

 We fully recognise the importance of business participation in the work of crime and disorder reduction partnerships (CDRPs) and we have taken steps in a number of ways to encourage this.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40514w04.html_para11">
Firstly, companies and retail bodies are named under section 5(3) of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 as invitees to participate in CDRP audits which are currently under way.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40514w04.html_para12">
We have also appointed 10 regional business crime reduction advisers who are currently engaged in a mapping exercise that will pull together data on how CDRPs across the country are prioritising business crime in their strategies. The advisers will work with the CDRPs to promote ways of including business crime activities in their strategies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40514w04.html_para13">
A new toolkit on audits and strategies has been developed for CDRPs on the Crime Reduction website and a section on consulting on the findings of the audit will be available shortly highlighting the importance of consulting businesses during this process.

<p>
<a name="40514w04.html_para14">
Finally, one of the aims of the Action Against Business Crime (AABC) group is to strengthen the links between businesses and CDRPs, further reinforcing the importance of CDRPs and business working together.

The National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) was introduced across England and Wales in April 2002. Some police forces adopted the standard prior to this date.

<p><a name="40514w05.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Jenkins: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many offenders have been enrolled in the&nbsp;Criminal Justice Interventions Programme since its inception.  [172496]</p>









<p><a name="40514w05.html_spnew0"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The Criminal Justice Interventions Programme (CJIP) is a three-year programme to develop and integrate measures for directing drug-misusing offenders out of crime and into treatment. The programme draws together and builds on the best existing solutions available and introduces new elements. Delivery at a local level is through integrated teams, using a case management approach to offer access to treatment and support from an offender&#039;s first point of contact with the criminal justice system through custody, court, sentence and beyond.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40514w05.html_para0">
As the programme engages offenders in a wide range of circumstances and at different times in an individuals&#039; contact with the Criminal Justice System, there is no concept of &quot;enrolling&quot; offenders in the programme. Data systems for analysing activity and outcomes across the programme are still in progress but by March 2004 some 2,800 offenders per month were being drug tested&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of whom 52&nbsp;per cent. were testing positive. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>14 May 2004 : Column 609W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Approximately 900 Drug Treatment and Testing Orders were being commenced each month and criminal justice drugs workers were making 5,500 contacts with offenders. These numbers will increase from April 2004 as 36 more Basic Command Units join the full programme.

<p><a name="40514w05.html_spnew2"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The Government is reviewing the existing framework of the criminal law concerning bad driving, particularly where death or injury results, in order to ensure that appropriate offences and penalties are put in place. The offence of driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence is not specifically included within the terms of reference of the review, which focus on the standard of driving, but the Government will of course consider all responses and issues raised during the consultation process.

<p><a name="40514w05.html_spnew5"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 There is no specific offence code to cover paedophiles because there is no specific offence of &quot;paedophilia&quot;. The sexual abuse of children can occur in a variety of ways and our law, if it is to be effective, has to reflect this. The Sexual Offences Act 2003, which came into force on 1&nbsp;May 2004, includes a variety of new offences which cover various forms of sexual abuse inflicted on children.

<p><a name="40514w06.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 At airports designated for the purposes of section 78 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982, controls on aircraft noise at night may be set under that power: at present, only Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted are so designated. At regional airports, controls may be imposed voluntarily by the airport operator, in consultation with those affected. The Department has issued Guidance to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) on how to assess environmental impacts of changes to airspace arrangements to augment directions to the CAA under section 66(1) of the Transport Act 2000. The guidance picks up and promotes broader Government policy that the CAA should pursue policies that will help to preserve the tranquillity of the countryside where this does not increase significantly the environmental burdens on congested areas.

<a name="40514w06.html_para2">
The survey of the SS Richard Montgomery is an evolving process which takes advantage of new technology and understanding. Diver surveys have been undertaken on approximately a decennial basis, with intervening sonar surveys to increase knowledge of the status of the wreck and surrounding area. It is not anticipated that another full visual diver survey of No.&nbsp;2 Hatch area will be undertaken until 2013. However, if intervening surveys suggest a requirement to gather such information earlier, a visual survey would then be commissioned.

 The form of the next survey, planned for 2005, will be discussed with specialist advisers, and decisions will be based on furthering knowledge of relevant aspects of the condition of the wreck. The use of sonar (multi-beam, sidescan), Remotely Operated Vehicle, physical sampling, and visual or ultra sonic diver survey will all be considered, and might include further sampling and metallurgical analysis. However, as stated in the most recent report, there has been little appreciable change to the thickness of the hull plating in the last 22 years, so there is no reason to suggest this will be necessary before the next full diving survey.

<i>Letter from Colin Mowl to Dr. Vincent Cable, dated 14&nbsp;May 2004:</i>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question to the Chancellor of the Exchequer asking for an update for 2002&#150;03 of the figures for council tax as a percentage of gross income for Great Britain, together with a breakdown for England, Scotland, and Wales, given in the previous answer of 10&nbsp;June 2003. (172602)</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Estimates have been produced from the Office for National Statistics&#039; analysis &quot;The effects of taxes and benefits on household income&quot; published on the National Statistics website on 6&nbsp;May 2004 at http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits. The analysis includes measures of income inequality for the United Kingdom as a whole based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The current analysis presents data for the category &#039;Council tax and Northern Ireland rates&#039;, as opposed to the category &#039;Local taxes&#039; used in previous analyses. This is because, from this year, charges made by water authorities for water, environmental and sewerage services have been excluded. This treatment conforms to the National Accounts classification and definition of taxes where water rates and related charges are considered a charge for services rather than a tax. They have therefore been excluded from the calculation of disposable income. This reply is based on the new methodology and I have included updated figures on this basis for 2001&#150;02 for comparison.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The following table shows the estimated gross and net council tax for all households in Great Britain and <i>(a)</i> England, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;Scotland and <i>(c)</i> Wales, for each income quintile where households are ranked by equivalised disposable income. The net council tax figures are gross council tax less benefits and discounts. The table also shows the equivalised disposable income quintile point boundaries, which have been calculated separately for Great Britain and each country. For example, the 1st quintile point for each country is the income below which one fifth of households in that country are estimated to lie.</p>

<i>[holding answer 4&nbsp;May 2004]</i>: This Government is committed to rebuilding and restoring National Health Service dentistry to improve the oral health of the Nation. The proposals in the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 represent the most radical reform of NHS dentistry since 1948. Our proposals for NHS dentistry will underpin a modernised, high-quality primary dental service provided through contracts between primary care trusts (PCTs) and dental practices. The service will be properly integrated with the rest of the NHS providing better access to services and an improved patient experience.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40514w10.html_para0">
We have made considerable progress on implementation. We have consulted widely with representatives of stakeholders on the framework proposed for the new primary dental services. The consultation period ended on 30&nbsp;April and we are considering the responses received and will use them to inform implementation plans.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40514w10.html_para1">
The Department, supported by the special health authority shadow arrangements we put in place last year, will ensure that the NHS, both strategic health authorities and their PCTs, have the information they need to open meaningful discussion with their potential local providers of primary dental services to establish contracts for the provision of NHS dentistry in the new&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world. PCTs will be supported in this through the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;national primary and care trust development programme (NatPaCT) and by the shadow special health authority.

 Dental fluorosis is characterised by a flecking or more rarely a mottling of the teeth, which may leave some people concerned about the appearance of their teeth, although they are endowed with the extra resistance to decay offered by exposure to fluoride.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps his Department is taking to <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;raise public awareness of osteoporosis and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;reduce the number of avoidable hip fractures.  [169468]</p>








<p><a name="40514w12.html_spnew0"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 A considerable amount of work is under way which will help to raise general awareness of osteoporosis, for example, The National Institute for Clinical Excellence is to develop two clinical guidelines and a technology appraisal to provide the best available evidence of what is effective in:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">the assessment and prevention of falls in older people;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">the assessment of fracture risk and the prevention of osteoporotic fractures in individuals at high risk; and</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40514w12.html_para0">
The clinical guideline on the assessment and prevention of falls in older people is currently out for consultation. Although osteoporosis does not cause falls it significantly increases the likelihood of a fracture when a fall happens.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40514w12.html_para1">
The falls guideline will provide recommendations for good practice that are based on the best available evidence of clinical and cost effectiveness. It is due to be&nbsp;completed in August this year. A second clinical guideline has been commissioned to look at the assessment of fracture risk and the prevention of osteoporotic fractures in individuals at high risk.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40514w12.html_para2">
We know it is the fractures which result from osteoporosis which can lead to pain, disability, greatly reduced quality of life and premature death. This guideline will look at all groups of people recognised to be at high risk of osteoporotic fracture. It will examine both interventions used to prevent an initial fracture and those used to prevent subsequent fractures where one has already occurred.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40514w12.html_para3">
It will cover care from primary and secondary National Health Service healthcare professionals who have direct contact with and make decisions about the care of high risk individuals. It will look at areas where collaboration is needed between primary and secondary NHS services. Although it does not specifically cover areas outside the NHS, it will be relevant to practice in non-NHS residential and nursing homes, social services and the voluntary sector. This guideline will build on and where necessary extend the work already completed around osteoporosis. It is due to be completed in June 2005.
