 In 2005-06 the Department spent &#163;9,067 on producing the &#145;Cycle to Work Implementation Guidance'. In 2006-07 the Department's cycling delivery body, Cycling England, produced two promotional leaflets, one for employers and one for employees, which cost &#163;10,710. Cycling England promoted the scheme and leaflets through a marketing agency during the 2006 Bike Week, which focused on cycle commuting and although it is difficult to disaggregate each element of their promotion of Bike Week, we estimate that the cost in specifically promoting Cycle to Work was around &#163;6,000.</p>

<i> [holding answer 1 July 2008]:</i><i> </i>In 2008, we estimate that it costs US$385 to produce one kilogram of morphine equivalent<sup>(1)</sup> in Afghanistan. However, this is the &#145;farm gate&#146; cost of illegal opium production, not the manufacturing cost of the final morphine product. This does not therefore include the following: regulation and security (policing of product, security of product transport from farm to factory); processing; equipment; chemicals; labour costs; and other business costs. These costs are unknown for Afghanistan. We estimate that the breakdown of costs for opium production in Afghanistan (per hectare) is as follows: production costs include fertiliser (estimated at 250 kilograms of urea and 250 kilograms of diammonium phosphate per hectare at a cost of US$210); oxen (at a rate of 10 days per hectare at a cost of US$8 per day); 350 labour days, including 200 days for harvesting (at an estimated wage rate of US$4 per day); and 150 days for land preparation; sowing; weeding; field clearance and seed collection (at an estimated rate of US$2.80 per day).</p>

Due to the commercially sensitive nature of these data, a breakdown of the Australian Crime Commission figures is not available. In 1999 the International Narcotics Control Board stated that the price paid to growers was US$56 for each kilogram of morphine equivalent. The breakdown of these costs is also confidential.</p>

the Chinese Government and Taiwan President Ma Ying-Jeou&#146;s administration will continue to engage in direct dialogue to resolve differences and strengthen cross-Strait stability, with a view to finding a peaceful solution to the Taiwan issue, acceptable to the people of both sides of the Strait. We support the EU declaration of 26 May and the EU presidency statement of 13 June which similarly sought to encourage this dialogue and welcome the practical results seen so far. These include the institution of regular direct weekend charter flights between mainland China and Taiwan, which started on 4 July.</p>

During this period, there were two restructuring exercises which led to a higher than expected number of early retirements: one reduced the size of the FCO's senior management structure by almost 20 per cent.; and the other involved the closure of a number of business units in preparation for the launch of FCO Services as a Trading Fund from April 2008.</p>

 HM Revenue and Customs do not produce a single business case document for any specific building or location.

Laos and Burma is trafficked to neighbouring South East Asia countries (notably China) and to the Oceania region (mainly Australia). The main focus of the United Kingdom Government&#146;s drugs strategy is on drugs trafficked to this country and there was no indication that any of the traffic out of Burma is destined for the United Kingdom. The current stance of the Burmese Government makes it difficult for any non-Burmese national and international agency to work in that country.</p>

 The Government take all forms of fraud seriously which is why they have allocated &#163;29 million over the next three years to implement the recommendations of the fraud review. Some of this funding will be directed towards enhancing the police response to fraud by giving the City of London police a national lead role in fraud investigation. The force already receives additional Government and Corporation of London funding to perform a lead force role across the South East and this further funding will enable the force to expand its Economic Crime Department and take on the investigation of serious and complex frauds across the country. The force will also establish a centre of excellence which will provide best practice advice to other forces around the country.</p>

UKSP marketing is also targeted to attract new talent by showing potential recruits the career opportunities available right across the sector.

 The Veterans Badge is designed explicitly to recognise those who have served at any time in the country's armed forces and it would not therefore be appropriate to extend this badge to those who worked in munitions factories in the UK during the World Wars. The Government hold in high esteem the contribution of all those who supported the war effort during these major periods of national conflict which has been recognised in a number of different ways depending on the particular group. Any question of a badge specifically for munitions workers would be a matter for the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform which has legacy responsibility for those matters covered by the Ministry of Supply, including those who worked in the munitions industry.</p>

 The Service Personnel and Veterans Agency (SPVA) administers two schemes under which disability allowances may become payable&#151;the armed forces compensation scheme (AFCS) and the war pension scheme (WPS). In the case of AFCS, ongoing disability allowances are payable to the most seriously injured and this payment becomes due on discharge. Therefore there are no such claims for ongoing disability allowances outstanding for serving personnel. However the majority of awards comprise of a lump sum payment which may be paid in service or following service depending on when the individual decides to make a claim. WPS claims are always made and awarded following discharge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_565"><a name="80715w0019.htm_para2"><a name="08071617000134">SPVA records show that at 31 March 2008 the number of claims of disability related payments, in the process of consideration, against each scheme was 1,292 for serving personnel and veterans under AFCS and 7,238 for veterans under WPS. This does not constitute a backlog as the claims are at various stages of consideration in line with the normal procedures. In considering claims under both schemes, medical evidence of the condition(s) claimed, prognosis for recovery or enduring disability and evidence of the link to service is required. Depending on the complexity and needs of the individual cases, gaining sufficient information in order to properly inform the correct decision can take a varying amount of time.</p>

A selection of each pack date is sent for analysis by the MOD contracted chemist at the 18 month point. Depending on the recommendations made by the chemist the rations are then recommended for re-inspection in six months, three months or certified as no longer suitable for issue. This process is repeated until the rations are certified as no longer suitable for issue. A monthly report is issued to all units in the armed forces through front line Commands detailing the material condition of each pack date. Action is then taken to ensure that stocks are managed accordingly.</p>

 Medical Employment Standard (MES) codes (and supporting codes showing Medical Limitations) are used to define an individual&#146;s medical fitness and enable the communication of the necessary information to their career manager/chain of command without any breach of medical confidentiality. These codes are used to ensure that an individual is appropriately employed without unnecessarily endangering their own health or that of others. Historically, the codes have evolved along single-service lines and this presents difficulties in deriving a consistent, central view of medical employability across the services which has made it impractical to provide the information requested. Currently, the MES codes do not equate to medical &#145;deployability&#146; (i.e. the fitness of an individual to deploy on operations).</p>

 No. It would be difficult, in equity, to extend the half rate pension to widows whose husbands had left the service before 31 March 1973 because they had not contributed financially towards the improvement. It has also been the long-standing policy of successive Governments that discretionary changes to improve the benefits offered by public service pensions schemes should be implemented for future service only.</p>

The new facilities, not least the SLA blocks, have improved the living and working conditions for personnel at RAF Northolt.</p>

Of these, RAF Eastcote and RAF West Ruislip have been sold for residential development, releasing funding for development of the Defence estate and other departmental priorities. The former BFPO site at Mill Hill and RAF Bentley Priory closed in January and May 2008 respectively. These two sites will be sold once planning submissions have been agreed by the local planning authorities.</p>

 The Defence Training Review (DTR) Package 1 Integrated Project Team (IPT) has from the outset routinely consulted the trade unions representing all the civilian employees potentially affected by the proposals stemming from the project. Such meetings, which now include representatives of the Metrix Consortium, take place every three months and provide an informal opportunity to update trade union representatives on project progress and address concerns and questions. Where required, the obligations under TUPE (2006) Regulations have been met through more formal consultation and exchanges of information. The approach taken has been as open as commercial considerations allow and has been cited by the trade unions as best practice.

According to the IMF, an increase in the real price of crude oil from $75 to $100 from October 2007 to April 2008 has reduced economic growth by between 0.2 and 1.0 per cent. For some countries, the impacts of high oil prices has been partly offset by higher prices earned from other exported commodities. For all countries, there have been increases in the consumer price of oil products, such as petrol and kerosene.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) has funded research which showed that illegal fishing costs the global economy some $23 billion per year. This includes around $1 billion in sub-Saharan Africa, representing a quarter of the total value of legitimate African fish exports. DFID has contributed some &#163;700,000 to increase awareness of illegal fishing in southern Africa. This culminated in the Southern Africa Development Commission (SADC) Ministerial Conference on Illegal Fishing held in Namibia on 4 July (2008), at which urgent measures to tackle illegal fishing were discussed and agreed; these included improving sharing regional intelligence, improving fisheries governance and to encourage market measures that keep illegal produce out of supply chains. Subject to design and appraisal, DFID has allocated &#163;6 million over six years to take this forward under an international partnership for African fisheries governance and trade. Partner donors are likely to include Norway, Germany, the World Bank and the European Commission.</p>

 The Government Equalities Office (GEO), has a strategic and influencing role within Government to address the disadvantage that individuals experience because of their gender; race; disability; age; sexual orientation; religion or belief. It is managing a cross-Government emergency fund aimed at keeping a number of rape crisis centres open. However, GEO does not typically allocate funding to charities which provide specialist support services to those experiencing disadvantage and has no plans to do so for charities supporting women affected by domestic violence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_590"><a name="80715w0022.htm_para4"><a name="08071617001356">The responsibility for funding decisions about local level, including the provision of specialist support to women who have been affected by domestic violence, rests with local authorities. GEO will continue to work in partnership with the Women's National Commission, the Equalities and Human Rights Commission and other Government Departments to keep a close watch on the way in which local areas prioritise funding for domestic violence services.</p>

4. Money collected and arranged has been allocated to Jarrow Parliamentary Constituency, South Tyneside Local Authority and the North East by matching the postcode of the non resident parent against the Office for National Statistics postcode directory.<br>
5. Figures on money rounded to the nearest &#163;1,000 for Jarrow and South Tyneside and &#163;1m for North East and Great Britain and children rounded to the nearest 100.<br>
6. Children benefiting are allocated to Jarrow Parliamentary Constituency, South Tyneside Local Authority and the North East by matching the postcode of the parent with care against the Office for National Statistics postcode directory. Some movements in the caseload may be down to changes in the postcode directory over time. The reduction in children benefiting between February 2000 and February 2001 in Jarrow is largely due to changes in the postcode directory at this time and is not a real reduction.<br>

 There are a range of employment programmes that ensure that people get the support that they need to move back into work.</p>

In return for the extra support and opportunities provided, young people were expected to take up jobs and training or see their benefits cut. As we saw this approach working, we extended it to other groups. Together with a stable economy, this has helped take a million people off key out-of-work benefits and cut claimant unemployment by 50 per cent. The latest figures show that the number of people on jobseeker's allowance is 819.3 thousand. This is down 58.1 thousand on the year, and down 800.3 thousand since 1997. The result is we are spending over &#163;5 billion less on key out-of-work benefits.</p>

This is good for the individual and for our society as a whole. All the evidence shows that work is the best route out of poverty and that by helping people into work, we make sure our economy benefits from making better use of individuals' talent while cutting the welfare bill.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions pursuant to the answer of 9 May 2008, <i> Official Report</i>, column 1289W, on national insurance: immigrants, how many individuals were on the list of those whose licences had been revoked supplied by the Security Industry Authority to his Department; and when his Department began checking the national insurance numbers and national insurance status of the illegal workers. [206320]</p>

<p><a name="st_362"><a name="08071617001601"><a name="80715w0024.htm_spnew2"><a name="08071617003804"><b>Mr. Timms:</b>
 The Security Industry Authority (SIA) provided the Department for Work and Pensions with a list of 7,266 individuals on 7 March 2008, and a further 920 individuals on 16 April 2008. This total of 8,186 names included cases where licences had already been revoked and all cases where appeals were pending at the time and where revocation remained a possibility. Work on checking the cases commenced on the 10 March 2008 and has only recently been completed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_600"><a name="80715w0024.htm_para3"><a name="08071617001602">Analysis of the details provided by the SIA shows that a total of 294 national insurance numbers were issued following the introduction of the right to work test in July 2006. Detailed checks have confirmed that 269 of these did have the right to work at the time the NINO was issued. The right to work had subsequently expired which is why they were found to be working illegally by the SIA.

 We expect there will be similar proportions in receipt of the severe disability premium, carer&#146;s premium and pensioner premiums under employment and support allowance, as there are for the current incapacity benefits stock. The number of people eligible for the enhanced disability premium will increase under employment and support allowance, due to the automatic passport to the premium for those in the support group. This ensures that everyone in the group receiving income-related employment and support allowance will receive the enhanced disability premium.</p>

The first students to graduate from this cohort will qualify as dentists in the summer of 2011.</p>

 At the 30 June 2008, there were 2,082 information technology (IT) accounts which had remote access to the Department's IT infrastructure. This included departmental staff and other authorised workers such as seconded and contract staff. Staff can connect securely from practically any location with access to a telephone or broadband line including their home address. If a mobile telephone network card has been supplied, connection is possible from anywhere with a general packet radio service or 3G signal. To establish how many accounts are solely for departmental staff or how many staff actually access the Department's IT infrastructure from their homes, will not be possible without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>

 The Department and its agencies have two sets of arrangements under which bonuses can be awarded. For senior civil servants (SCSs), pay arrangements are common across all Government Departments. The Department's senior pay strategy, which conforms to these common arrangements, explains that bonuses may be awarded for delivery of personal objectives or other short-term personal contributions to wider organisational objectives. Individuals are required to agree their priorities with their manager at the beginning of the performance year. Line managers then make recommendations for  <br>

performance bonuses which are considered by the Department's pay committees at the end of the performance year. The pay committees, which meet annually, make the final decision on whether a bonus should be awarded, relative to the performance of others. In 2006 and 2007, 85 per cent. of SCSs in the Department and its agencies did not receive the maximum bonus possible under the scheme. Bonuses for 2008 have yet to be decided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_615"><a name="80715w0026.htm_para0"><a name="08071617001811">For staff below the SCS, the Department and its agencies operate a special bonus scheme whereby managers may award a bonus to recognise an outstanding contribution in a particularly demanding situation. This can include a temporary and substantial increase in job loading, dealing with pressures arising from temporary vacancies or job requirements, a high level of commitment and resolution to get a job done, difficulties requiring a special effort to overcome, or a contribution over and above what would normally be expected for the job and of the person, or team, concerned. Bonuses are generally small in value, but there is no specified maximum size of award. As a result, it is not possible to answer the question for this scheme.</p>

NHS Student Bursaries' database only holds details of the course that the student was actually funded for in that academic year, accordingly all medical and dental students who intercalated (undertook a one year BSc course part way through their medical/dental course) in any academic year have to be included with the figures for the medical students (because the vast majority of intercalating students are medical students) as they can not interrogate the data to clarify whether an intercalated student was a medical or dental student in previous or future academic years; and<br>
Due to the way tuition fee payments were paid prior to 2005-06, NHS Student Bursaries only hold data in relation to tuition fee payments for the academic years 2005-06 and 2006-07, therefore to ensure that the figures for the last five years compare &#145;like with like&#146; details for &#145;amounts paid&#146; they do not include any amounts paid for tuition fees in any academic year.<br>

 I am informed by the Parole Board that their incoming mail is initially scanned centrally for suspect devices, as is all mail for secure Government buildings in London. It is then delivered by Government messenger service to the board&#146;s London offices. The mail is not opened until it has been received by individual teams within the board who then open and action the mail. Following a recent review a new central services team will be set up to handle incoming mail once it arrives with the board and will be supported by a new post database that has been developed for that purpose.</p>

Measures in the Children and Young Persons Bill will enable us to revise Children Act Guidance setting out how we expect local authorities to exercise their statutory duties to continue to plan for looked-after children throughout any period in custody which would necessarily include planning for their support in the community to minimise the risk of re-offending. Clause 16 of the Bill provides for power to be given to the Secretary of State to require the local authority to visit children who were provided with voluntary accommodation by the authority but who then loses their looked after status because they received a custodial sentence. The purpose of these visits will be to assess the support that the child may need on release from custody. It will be essential that children's and youth justice services coordinate any support needed to prevent re-offending.</p>

 The minimum funding guarantee was introduced to the school funding system for the 2004-05 financial year. A schools forum may approve variations to the minimum funding guarantee proposed by the local authority that together affect no more than 50 per cent. of pupils in the authority's schools. The purpose of this provision is to allow local authorities and their schools forums to handle anomalies that may arise from the operation of the minimum funding guarantee, since the rules set down in the regulations are unable to cover all local circumstances. Where local authorities propose a variation to the minimum funding guarantee that will affect more than 50 per cent. of pupils, the Secretary of State's approval must be sought.</p>

 Schools should put as much effort into designing and managing toilets as they do in building and managing other facilities. They should be clean, safe, well equipped and accessible. Children and young people themselves cite the state of school toilets as a top priority. It is unacceptable that they are put off using toilets at schools because they are badly designed, vandalised dirty or hang-outs for bullies. We want pupils to be healthy by drinking plenty of water throughout the day and they cannot do that without feeling safe to use the toilets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_730"><a name="80715w0039.htm_para5"><a name="08071631001691">That is why last year for the first time we laid down clear guidance in the form of a specification for design so that schools can use the record amounts of investment in school buildings and facilities to provide the highest quality pupils&#146; toilets. The guidance sets out specific design features to combat antisocial behaviour; suggests how floor space can be designed effectively and encourages local education authorities and schools to involve pupils in the design and management of the facilities to foster a sense of pride and ownership.</p>
