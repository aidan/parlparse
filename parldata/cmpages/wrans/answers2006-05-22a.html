2007.</p><p><a name="06052325000187">The increase in
direct fighting between the Sri Lankan military, the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and militia&#146;s associated with each side
has been accompanied by an increase in communal tension. Development
agencies and non governmental organisations have evacuated staff for
their security and protection and recovery programmes have been
suspended. In addition, regular economic activities and recovery work
undertaken in communities without external assistance has also been
affected by military activity. Able bodied men are being mobilised for
LTTE service, and people are being displaced by fighting, or the fear
of fighting.</p><p><a name="06052325000188">The
situation continues to deteriorate, as evidenced by the recent suicide
bombing in Colombo and the subsequent air strikes and naval shelling in
the east. Without a considerable improvement in the security situation
it is unlikely that much recovery can be undertaken. The international
community, including the United Kingdom, are working hard to encourage
the Government and the (LTTE) to curtail violence and to return to the
negotiating table. Once the security environment improves we will renew
efforts to help ensure delivery of development assistance to
communities.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1259W</b><br><h3 align="center"><a name="06052325000016">Family

[72176]</p><p><a name="06052325000190"><b><a name="06052325001881">Mr.
Thomas:</b> The UK Government's approach to promoting
reproductive health is set out in the DFID position paper, "Sexual and
Reproductive Health and Rights". Our approach to achieving the fifth
Millennium Development Goal of improving maternal health is outlined in
the DFID strategy paper, "Reducing Maternal Deaths: Evidence and
Action". Both were published in 2004 after extensive consultation with
a broad range of stakeholders, including the research community, NGOs,
parliamentarians and civil society groups. A web-based consultation was
also held as part of this
process.</p><p><a name="06052325000191">Our
understanding of the so-called "Mexico City Policy" is that it requires
non-US NGOs to agree that they will not perform or actively promote
abortion as a method of family planning in order to receive US funding.
This means, for example, that non-US NGOs who accept US funding are not
allowed to use their own funds to provide information or counselling
for abortion care, or to promote awareness of the benefits of legal
reform. As the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF)
"Death and Denial: Unsafe Abortion and Poverty" report makes clear, the
policy forces NGOs to choose between carrying on work to protect the
health and rights of women or lose funds. No reproductive or maternal
health NGOs affected by the policy work to "promote abortion as a
method of family planning", and indeed this would be contrary to the
global consensus reached at the International Conference on Population
and Development (ICPD). What they try to do is to provide a
comprehensive range of information and services that can help save
women's lives, and reduce the need for abortion. The US policy means
that the work of such organisations is compromised, and that is why my
Department is opposed to
it.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06052325000017">Iraq</h3><p><a name="06052325000192"><b><a name="06052325001882">Mr.

Benn:</b> The Government of Iraq, supported by the UK and
other donors, has made significant progress with reconstruction since
2003. But there is still a long way to go. Once a relatively wealthy
country with high levels of education and health care, by 2003 Iraq had
suffered more than 20 years of conflict, mismanagement and chronic
under-investment from a brutal regime. Continued violence, especially
sabotage 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1260W</b><br>directed at key infrastructure, and low (but growing) levels of
management capacity in Iraq&#146;s national and local government have
slowed progress. The UK and international community are committed to
helping the new Iraqi Government tackle these
challenges.</p><p><a name="06052325000194">One
challenge is the lack of data, especially at the regional and
provincial level. The following information therefore covers the
progress that has been made across Iraq, including regional detail only
where this is
available.</p><p><a name="06052325000195">Electricity
generation is more equitably distributed across Iraq than before 2003.
Nearly 5,000 megawatts (MW) have been added to the national grid since
2003, but Iraq&#146;s average electricity generation has not improved
over that period. This is because at the same time as capacity is being
added through reconstruction projects, breakdowns of the pre-existing
dilapidated systems, shortages of fuel supplies and sabotage are
reducing capacity. So Iraqis are not getting the full benefit of those
extra megawatts. Demand for electricity also continues to rise
dramatically, as the economy grows and more people own and use
electrical goods such as fridges and air-conditioning units. The new
Iraqi Government will be starting work on a long-term power sector
strategy, with DFID&#146;s
support.</p><p><a name="06052325000196">In the south,
average electricity generation levels have increased from approximately
750 MW in January 2004 to over 1,000 MW in December 2005. The south now
receives its fair share of national power&#151;whereas under
Saddam&#146;s regime, power was often diverted from the south to
Baghdad.</p><p><a name="06052325000197">To improve

Thomas:</b> DFID is the only major bilateral donor to already
have a specific strategy focusing on maternal health: &#147;Reducing
maternal deaths: evidence and action&#148;, which was launched in
2004. We have disseminated this comprehensive maternal health strategy
throughout the international system, with other donors, the UN, and
most importantly, with the developing partners we
support.</p><p><a name="06052325000213">The strategy
provides the basis for DFID support to improve maternal health at
country level, which we do through a combination of programmes to
strengthen health services and improve overall reproductive and child
health, along with specific maternal health programmes and HIV
interventions. Long-term support for maternal health in Nepal, for
example, is demonstrating significant increases in women&#146;s
access to emergency obstetric care in remote areas and in a fragile
state. This work highlights the importance of support for community
level action to overcome cultural and socio-economic barriers to
accessing care, as well as the importance of addressing infrastructure
(roads, bridges) and communications issues to ensure an effective
referral system. In Malawi, DFID is supporting an Emergency Human
Resource Programme to address the acute shortages of health workers, an
issue which has been compounded by the AIDS epidemic. Overall
investments for maternal health (including reproductive health
services) have increased by over 40 per cent. over the past three
years, to &#163;242.9 million in
2004-05.</p><p><a name="06052325000214">The maternal
health strategy also provides the platform for DFID&#146;s regular
policy discussions with other donors, such as the EU, G8 and the UN, on
the actions needed to improve maternal health in developing countries
and the importance of doing more on maternal health. We are seeking to
highlight the importance of maternal health within the current G8
process, although the prime health theme at present is infectious
disease. We are also working to ensure that the new Partnership for
Maternal, Neonatal and Child Health can play a useful role in
advocating for more action on maternal health, and to improve the way
UN agencies work together on this issue.</p><p><a name="06052325000215">Importantly, good advocacy is
based upon good data. Getting reliable information on maternal deaths
is difficult in most developing countries where maternal deaths are not
recorded and where more than half of all births take place at home,
without a skilled attendant but either with relatives or alone. This is
why DFID, along with the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) and the Gates Foundation, supports IMMPACT, the
only global research initiative which is successfully identifying
effective ways in which maternal deaths can be measured and the
statistics used for high level advocacy. DFID further supports a recent
global partnership, Health Metrics Network, which aims to provide
country level support to governments to get better data.</p>

(WIPO) Intergovernmental Committee (IGC) in December 2004 which
suggests that disclosure of country of origin or source in patent
applications could be introduced on a global basis in national,

Nations is taking forward these reforms with the support and
participation of the wider donor community, including DFID, NGOs and
the Red Cross movement. In December 2005, a new UN Central Emergency
Response Fund (CERF) was approved by the UN General Assembly. It was
launched on 9 March 2006 with $254 million from 38 donors, including
$70 million from DFID. Under the direction of the UN's Emergency Relief
Coordinator, the CERF is now enabling UN humanitarian agencies to
respond rapidly to sudden disasters, such as earthquakes; time-critical
responses in slow-onset disasters, such as drought; and essential
life-saving actions in ongoing but under-funded crises such as in the
Democratic Republic of Congo and
Chad.</p><p><a name="06052325000246">A number of
proposals for strengthening the UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator system are
being taken forward, including developing a pool of suitable candidates
and associated training. Currently there are 21 trained humanitarian
co-ordinators, including some from NGO or Red Cross backgrounds.
Alongside this, DFID is leading seven other donors in piloting pooled
country level funding, to be used as directed by the resident
humanitarian co-ordinator, in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of
Congo during 2006. DFID is also providing support to the World Health
Organisation (WHO) and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) in developing
performance benchmarks for mortality, nutrition, and health. DFID has
supported progress over the last 12 months in reforming the UN
International Strategy for Disaster Reduction and in March this year we
launched our new Disaster Risk Reduction
Strategy.</p><p><a name="06052325000247">In September
2005, the UN Inter-Agency Standing Committee, which deals with
humanitarian issues, established a new 'cluster' system to deliver more
accountable and predictable humanitarian responses. Named agencies have
responsibility for coordinating responses in key sectors such as water
and sanitation (UNICEF), protection (the United Nations High
Commissioner fro Refugees (UNHCR), Logistics (the World Food Programme
(WFP), and Health (the WHO), and developing networks or clusters of
other agencies and NGOs to work together to improve capacity,
performance, and effectiveness. DFID is currently considering, along
with other donors, how best to support this
initiative.</p><p><a name="06052325000248">In January

bioethanol as a transport fuel by means of a 20 pence per litre fuel
duty incentive. Since this was introduced in January 2005, sales of
bioethanol in the UK have increased from zero to a monthly average of
some 7 million litres. We have also announced that we will introduce a
Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation in 2008, which will require all
transport fuel suppliers to ensure that biofuels account for a certain
percentage of their total fuel sales. In 2010, the level of the
Obligation will reach 5 per cent., which should mean that annual sales
of bioethanol reach over a billion litres a
year.</p><p><a name="06052325000784">European Union
fuel quality standards currently allow 5 per cent. ethanol to be
blended into petrol, and all petrol vehicles are already capable of
running on these blends. Above that level, a number of technical
modifications are required to vehicles and to refuelling points. We
introduced a new grant programme in 2005 to support the installation of
alternative refuelling infrastructure, and through this we are
supporting the installation of a small number of high level ethanol
pumps. In addition, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the
March 2006 Budget that cars manufactured to run on high level ethanol
blends will qualify for the reduced rate of Vehicle Excise Duty for
alternatively fuelled cars. Beyond that, the Government have no current
plans for other
incentives.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06052325000050">Road Fund

("contaminated land") of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. This
places local authorities under a statutory duty to inspect their areas
to identify contaminated land as defined in the Act, and to secure its
remediation, in accordance with the detailed provisions of the regime.
They are required to take a strategic and prioritised approach to the
duty of inspection. A local authority must designate contaminated land
as a &#147;special site&#148; if it meets specific legal
definitions. Where a local authority designates a site as a special
site, the Environment Agency will become the enforcing authority for
the site. In broad terms, the regime addresses unacceptable risk

Harvey:</b> To ask the Secretary of State for
Defence what recent steps the Government have taken to implement its
disarmament obligations under Article VI of the Non-Proliferation
Treaty.
[71522]</p><p><a name="06052325001655"><b><a name="06052325002257">Des
Browne:</b> The UK is fully committed to its obligations under
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, including those on disarmament
under Article VI, and has made significant disarmament steps since
1992. For example, the UK has given up both the nuclear Lance missile
and artillery roles we undertook previously with US nuclear weapons
held under dual-key arrangements, along with our maritime tactical
nuclear capability, so that Royal Navy surface 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1330W</b><br>ships no longer have any capability to carry or deploy nuclear weapons.
In 1998, the UK withdrew and dismantled the last air-launched nuclear
weapon, the Royal Air Force&#146;s WE117 nuclear bombs. The
dismantlement of the last remaining Chevaline (Polaris) warheads
occurred in April 2002, so that Trident is now our only nuclear weapons
system;</p><p><a name="06052325001656">In all, there
has been a reduction of the UK&#146;s operationally available
stockpile of nuclear weapons to fewer than 200 warheads, representing a
reduction of more than 70 per cent. in the potential explosive power of
our nuclear forces since the end of the cold war. Only one Trident
submarine is on deterrent patrol at any one time and that submarine is
normally on several days &#145;notice to fire&#146; and its
missiles are not targeted at any specific
country.</p><p><a name="06052325001657">In addition,
the UK announced in 1995 that we had stopped the production of fissile
material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, and we
continually press for negotiations to begin on a fissile material
cut-off treaty at the conference on disarmament in Geneva. We have also
been more transparent about our nuclear and fissile material
stockpiles, publishing an historical account of plutonium stockpiles,
along with an account of our highly enriched uranium earlier this
year.</p><p><a name="06052325001658">We are the only
nuclear power that has so far been prepared to take such important
steps on the route to nuclear
disarmament.</p><p><a name="06052325001659"><b><a name="06052325002258">Nick

remains as set out in the 1998 strategic defence review (SDR) (Cm 3999)
and the 2002 SDR New Chapter (Cm 5566). The UK&#146;s nuclear weapons
have a continuing use as a means of deterring major strategic military

security of the UK. We would only ever contemplate their use in extreme
circumstances of

use nuclear weapons only in extreme circumstances of self-defence. We
would not use our weapons, whether conventional or nuclear, contrary to
international law.</p><p><a name="06052325001672">A
policy of no first use of nuclear weapons would be incompatible with
our and NATO&#146;s doctrine of deterrence. We have made clear, as
have our NATO allies, that the circumstances in which any use of
nuclear weapons might have to be contemplated are extremely remote. Our
overall strategy is to ensure uncertainty in the mind of any aggressor
about the exact nature of our response, and thus to maintain effective
deterrence.</p><p><a name="06052325001673"><b><a name="06052325002270">Norman

Browne:</b> We have not undertaken a detailed assessment of
this hypothetical situation, as we have no reason to believe that the
withdrawal of US technical support for Trident is remotely likely.
However, we anticipate that, in this highly unlikely scenario, the main
impact on the UK would be in terms of the cost of maintaining the

Watson:</b> It has been the policy of successive governments,
applied to all public sector schemes and in accordance with common law
principles, that an individual cannot receive double payment for loss
of earnings and support where such compensation has been awarded by two
different routes for the same incident. The Ministry of Defence has no
plans to change that
policy.</p><p><a name="06052325001677">The armed
forces occupational pension schemes pay death benefits regardless of
whether the death was caused by service. This standard level of widows
pension is not reduced by any common law compensation
award.</p><p><a name="06052325001678">Where the death
of the serviceman has been caused by service in the armed forces, the
widow may receive compensation. Where the cause of death was on or
before 5 April 2005, this would be by way of a War Widow&#146;s
Pension under the War Pensions Scheme (WPS). This pension is paid in
full. In addition, an enhanced rate of widows pension under the
occupational pension scheme may be paid, which includes an element for
loss of earnings and support. It is only this final element that may be
affected by a common law compensation settlement, where that settlement
also includes an element for loss of earnings and
support.</p><p><a name="06052325001679">Where the
cause of death was on or after 6 April 2005, the widow may receive
compensation under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS), which
replaces both the WPS and the enhanced elements of the occupational
scheme. Because the AFCS benefits will normally be paid before any
common law compensation settlement, arrangements are in place to reduce
the common law compensation instead of seeking to claw back the AFCS
benefit that would already be in payment.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06052325000143">Predator Unmanned
