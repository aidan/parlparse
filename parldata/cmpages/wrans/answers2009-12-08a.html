 Since the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) was introduced in 2005, the timing of payments to English farmers has improved year on year. That progress continued under the 2009 scheme when over 80 per cent. of farmers received payment on the opening two days of the regulatory seven month payment window.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_436"><a name="91208w0002.htm_para3"><a name="09120870000234">Regrettably, some farmers are paid after the end of the payment window, but only under the 2005 scheme has the amount concerned exceeded the 4 per cent. 'franchise' in EU regulations that triggers late payment penalties. The 4 per cent. franchise exists in acknowledgment that some claims are particularly complex or involve legal issues, such as probate, which take additional time to resolve. Payments made after the end of the payment window may have an impact on individuals' financial position, but the Department is not aware of any data that would identify specifically related cases of debt. In order to minimise any such impacts, the Rural Payments Agency will continue its efforts to make outstanding payments as early as possible and pay interest in lieu of compensation, above a deminimis of Â£50, in cases where this is not possible until after the end of the payment window.</p>

 The revised standard instrument departure (SID) routings at London City airport were implemented in accordance with the independent airspace change process under which it is for the airspace change sponsor to develop and consult upon proposals.

Following the outcome of last year's public consultation, NATS decided to review the TC North design options. However, the London City airport SID change element was aimed at meeting already established International Civil Aviation Organisation design standards. In the circumstances, the London City SID changes were removed from the TC North proposals and progressed as a stand alone proposal. The CAA considered that further consultation on the London City airport SID changes were not needed as they had already been included in the full TC North consultation.</p>

 Service family accommodation (SFA) is assessed by Standard for Condition (SfC), an objective assessment of the physical condition of the property.

To date, no response has been received from the claimants' counsel or the law firm representing them (Rosenblatts). This is obviously disappointing, but we remain open to meaningful discussions. In the meantime, we have been left with no option but to proceed with our appeal for which the High Court judge has given us permission.

It does not incorporate the results of subsequent investigations and therefore does not differentiate between what might later prove to have been a problem caused by operator error or damage sustained as a result of operations. Nor does this data record the severity of a failure which might have no discernible impact on operational capability or safety.</p>

 We understand that there is a real concern about the possible links between cheap alcohol and antisocial behaviour. However, the evidence is inconclusive as to whether the introduction of a minimum unit price would reduce alcohol related crime and disorder. While there is evidence that cheap alcohol is linked to people drinking more and subsequent harm to their health, it is important that any Government interventions reduce harm without impacting unduly on the majority of responsible drinkers. We will look to develop further the evidence base in this area with a view to identifying concrete proposals for action which reduce irresponsible, harmful and/or binge drinking without impacting unduly on the majority of responsible drinkers.</p>

 The National DNA Database (NDNAD) is an intelligence database which matches DNA found at crime scenes with DNA profiles of individuals. It also provides police with potential leads on the identity of an offender. An individual may have their DNA profile loaded onto the NDNAD if they have been arrested for a recordable offence or if they have volunteered their DNA to assist in a criminal investigation and also provided separate written consent for the resulting profile to be loaded onto the NDNAD.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_521"><a name="91208w0009.htm_para5"><a name="09120870001215">The NDNAD stores only limited personal information about the identity of those with a profile held on it. Only an individual's name, date of birth, gender and ethnic appearance are recorded. Details of occupation are not held therefore it is not possible to say how many Government Ministers, hon. Members, Members of the House of Lords or judges have a DNA profile held on the NDNAD.</p>

A police officer may have voluntarily given a DNA sample for the NDNAD, or, like any other citizen, a police officer arrested for a recordable offence may have a DNA sample taken as a result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_523"><a name="91208w0009.htm_para7"><a name="09120870001217">However, there is also a separate DNA database known as the Police Elimination Database (PED) which holds the DNA profiles of serving police officers, who are potentially capable of leaving DNA at a crime scene in the course of their duties. PED searches are carried out only if a senior investigating officer requests a comparison of DNA profiles from a specified officer or officers with a DNA profile from a specified crime, unlike NDNAD searches which compare all profiles from crime scenes with all profiles from known individuals. Since 1 August 2002, all new recruits to the police service have been required to give a DNA sample as a condition of employment. As at 30 September 2009 there were 118,699 records held on the PED for England and Wales police forces. However, as the PED also holds the profiles of certain police staff such as scenes of crime officers and vehicle examiners and does not contain the details of people's professions, we are not able to state how many of these records relate to police officers.</p>

 There is no objective evidence to suggest that the police are arresting people for the purpose of obtaining their DNA. The taking of a person's liberty by arresting them is not undertaken lightly. That is why the power of arrest is subject to a test of necessity, set out in section 24 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE). Police officers are also required to have regard to the statutory guidance in the exercise of the power of arrest, which is set out in Code of Practice G, one of the codes of practice issued under PACE.</p>

 It is not possible at present to calculate accurately the proportion of members of ethnic groups in the population as a whole who are on the NDNAD. This is because the data held on the NDNAD  <br>

are not directly comparable with census population data. The NDNAD does not hold self-reported ethnicity data on arrested persons who have a DNA sample taken, but on their 'ethnic appearance'. The ethnic appearance data is based on the judgment of the police officer and is recorded for police intelligence purposes to assist in subsequent identification. It uses six broad ethnic categories (plus 'unknown') whereas census data is based on 16 ethnic groups self-reported by individuals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_527"><a name="91208w0009.htm_para11"><a name="09120870001233">Estimates of the proportion of different ethnic groups on the NDNAD calculated by simply dividing the number of profiles by the population data will give an inaccurate estimate as a number of other factors also need to be taken into account. Examples of these factors are the number of profiles from persons of mixed race, the number of profiles of unknown ethnicity, the number of replicate profiles and the use of comparable up-to-date population data. The National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) is working to produce an estimate which is as accurate and robust as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_528"><a name="91208w0009.htm_para12"><a name="09120870001234">Data is available on the number of DNA profiles from people with black, asian or white ethnic appearance aged between 18 and 35 years on the NDNAD. The following table displays the number of subject profiles retained on the NDNAD as at 16 October 2009 for males aged 18-35 inclusive (based on current age as at 16 October 2009) for England and Wales police forces, including the British Transport Police (BTP). The figures cover all subject profiles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_529"><a name="91208w0009.htm_para13"><a name="09120870001235">The number of profiles is not the same as the number of individuals. This is because some of the profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates, that is, an individual may have more than one profile held on the NDNAD. This may happen if, for example, an individual gives a different name on different arrest occasions. The existence of replicates does not affect the integrity or effectiveness of the NDNAD. The current replication rate across the entire NDNAD is 13.8 per cent.</p>

Since then, 190 of our Posts have faced exchange rate and inflationary pressures. In 2008-09 the exchange and inflation rate pressure on our Posts' budgets was Â£59.2 million. In 2009-10 the exchange and inflation rate pressures on our Posts' budgets is expected to be Â£80 million. I have placed details in the Library of the House.

It covered the social conditions of Palestinian Christians living in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs), reasons for Christian emigration from the OPTs (mainly the occupation and opportunities afforded to them elsewhere), and relations with the majority Muslim Palestinian community. Other than the usual issues of travel around the West Bank and between the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which affect all Palestinians, the report did not focus on travel, housing, or residency. Nor did it touch on the issue of equal taxation. We have not made a separate assessment of these points.</p>

 The Government do not routinely collect or hold information about the number of Henry VIII provisions. However in response to an earlier question from the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) on the number of Henry VIII powers that had been enacted up until that point in the 2008-09 Session, a detailed exercise was undertaken to collate the information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_646"><a name="91208w0024.htm_para0"><a name="091208116001369">My right hon. Friend the Minister of State for Justice (Mr. Wills) wrote to the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) on 10 November 2009 with the following information:</p>
<a name="91208w0024.htm_brev0"><a name="091208116001834"><ul><p class="tabletext">As you know, a Henry VIII clause is a power in a Bill which enables primary legislation to be amended or repealed by secondary legislation. Such provisions are included in legislation for a variety of reasons.</p>

However we estimate that there are around 70 such powers contained within legislation enacted so far this Session. At least 10 of these powers are not new, but have been re-enacted this Session and at least 15 of the powers are provisions allowing for consequential amendments. The majority of the remaining powers are narrow in scope, applying in specific circumstances, including 18 powers in the Finance Act 2009.</p>
</ul><a name="91208w0024.htm_brev2"><a name="091208116001836"><ul><p class="tabletext">15 of the 70 powers are contained in the Banking Act 2009, which was passed in response to the recent period of sustained disruption in global financial markets. The more substantive of these 15 powers are necessary to ensure that the special resolution regime can be used effectively to resolve a failing bank or building society, in order to protect depositors and maintain financial stability.</p>
</ul><a name="91208w0024.htm_brev3"><a name="091208116001837"><ul><p class="tabletext">Parliament has long-and rightly-been hostile to the principle of Henry VIII powers, and so have I and my colleagues. They are only used when there is substantial call for them; no practical alternative of dealing with the issue in the original legislation; and such powers are rarely wide-ranging. The exercise of any Henry VIII power will be subject to subsequent parliamentary approval, either by way of the negative resolution procedure (for example where the change is technical, consequential or minor) or, as in most cases, the affirmative resolution procedure.</p>
</ul><a name="91208w0024.htm_brev4"><a name="091208116001838"><ul><p class="tabletext">All of the powers themselves were subject to parliamentary scrutiny prior to their enactment and were accepted as necessary by Parliament having considered the views of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee.</p>

 While not making this a formal recommendation in his report David Blakey highlighted the potential for abuse of Rule 39 mail for smuggling drugs. The Government undertook that the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) would review Rule 39 mail to maintain legal privilege while reducing misuse.</p>

Any interference in these communications needs to be against a background of reasonable cause to believe that the communication is being made with the intention of furthering a criminal purpose.</p>

 Delivery for the completion of sex offender treatment programmes (SOTP) is scheduled against annual targets, Targets for the number of completions of SOTP have been negotiated and agreed locally between Probation Areas or Trusts and the NOMS regional (and Wales) offices since 2007-08. In 2006-07 there were no area-level targets for SOTP completions, only a national target. Monthly milestones for delivery throughout the year are also agreed locally. These targets cover the overall provision of SOTP and are not broken down by the programme type.</p>

Supervision commences as soon as the offender is sentenced or released from custody and involves assessment of risk and treatment needs in addition to sentence planning and preparing the offender to engage in treatment. Other measures designed to protect the public may also be put in place, such as Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA). Supervision requirements for sex offenders are usually longer (up to three years) in order to allow sufficient time for treatment to be completed.</p>

 We understand that there is wide variability in costs of reablement in different councils. The Impact Assessment for the Personal Care at Home Bill makes clear that the Â£1,000 cost of re-ablement per person is an assumption-paragraph 5.15 states, "If we assume the cost of a package of re-ablement is Â£1,000 per person..."-and its derivation is clearly and transparently stated in Annex B. Given the uncertainties associated with alternative cost figures and the relatively conservative stance taken with regard to potential benefits, the Â£1,000 per person estimate used in the impact assessment is not considered to be unreasonable.</p>

 The London Brownfield Sites database was launched on 8 October 2009 by the London Development Agency and the Homes and Communities Agency. The database is a freely available online tool. It is being used by all 33 London local planning authorities and other stakeholder groups including the Environment Agency, Natural England and English Heritage. Visitors to the database website are able to identify sites suitable for development, and explore and understand a site's context due to the themed data made available. Data includes transport routes, deprivation, social infrastructure, as well as heritage and natural environment assets. The Homes and Communities Agency is considering options for the development of similar systems in other English regions. As part of this process HCA will monitor the effectiveness of the London Brownfield sites database over the coming months.</p>

<i> [holding answer 7 December 2009]:</i> There are two types of sponsorship payments for academies: traditional procurement and the endowment model. It is for traditional procurement academies that sponsorship payments are a contribution to the capital cost of constructing academy buildings. The amount of cash sponsorship varies according to how many academies a particular sponsor has. The timing for the receipt of payments varies from academy to academy and is agreed as part of the Funding Agreement between the Department and the academy.</p>
