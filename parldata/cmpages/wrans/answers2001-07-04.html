 As the then Parliamentary Under- Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin), made clear on 6 June 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 203&#150;04W, it is premature to comment on what options are being considered in the South East and East of England Regional Air Services (SERAS) study. Following completion of the study there will be a public consultation on the options arising from it.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10704w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Fire total standard spending was increased by 3.5 per cent. to &#163;1,463 million for 2001&#150;02. The settlements took account of information on spending pressures provided by the local authorities Fire Service Expenditure Forecasting Group. Best Value administration was not identified as a separate significant pressure in the group's most recent report. Information on overall costs for the fire service is not held centrally. The scale of costs is likely to be different for county fire authorities compared with single-service fire authorities, like East Sussex, which are Best Value authorities in their own right. Additional items of expenditure for single-service fire authorities include publication of Best Value performance plans and distribution of summary plans to local households.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10704w01.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 Under the Building Regulations, builders are required to calculate the energy rating of a new home and to place a notice of the energy rating there. In addition, we are proposing to make it a new requirement of the Building Regulations that builders should provide occupiers of new homes with information on operation and maintenance of the heating and hot water services in ways that would help to optimise energy consumption.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what plans he has to require local authorities to produce cycling strategies.  [1731]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10704w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 All local highway authorities in England (excluding London) were asked to produce a cycling strategy as part of their local transport plans (LTPs) last year. This should identify gaps in the local network and potential improvements to the cycling infrastructure. Almost all authorities subsequently included strategies for cycling as part of their LTP submissions. Initial monitoring suggests that the strategies will result in considerable additional provision for cycling. The London boroughs will be expected to implement the policies for cycling contained in the Mayor's Transport Strategy, which is due for publication in the summer.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10704w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 July 2001]:</i> The Government are committed to quadrupling the number of cycling trips, from a 1996 base, by 2012, and in the 10-Year Transport Plan, we have set an interim target of tripling the number of cycling trips between 2000 and 2010. The local transport settlement provided &#163;8.4 billion of Government funding which will help to promote sustainable transport measures, including cycling. The cycling strategies in local authorities' local transport plans will provide opportunities to improve the cycling infrastructure and make cycling more accessible.
<P>

<a name="10704w01.html_para6">Action is being taken to effectively market the key messages of the National Cycling Strategy (NCS). An NCS website has been launched and a promotional video has been produced. A series of cycling seminars has just been concluded across England, which provided a good opportunity for local authorities, major employers and health and education practitioners to come together.
<P>

<a name="10704w01.html_para7">We are also re-organising the way the National Cycle Forum, which co-ordinates progress on the NCS, works. The current Forum will be reconstituted, meeting annually to review progress on delivering the NCS, and to set the policy agenda for the year ahead. An executive board is to be established with the task of securing NCS objectives and developing broad policies established by the NCF. The NCS Board will be 8&#150;10 people strong. We have advertised for a Chairperson, and are considering the applications at present.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10704w02.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 My Department's monitoring system requires Single Regeneration Budget (SRB) Partnerships to set out the objectives of their bids in annual Delivery Plans. The Regional Development Offices (RDAs) monitor Partnerships' progress in delivering their schemes, normally each quarter, against Key Indicators of Performance which are recorded in Delivery Plans. The RDAs also undertake periodic reviews of SRB Schemes to assess overall progress.
<P>

<a name="10704w02.html_para0">In their recent Corporate/Business Plans, RDAs set out regional priorities and activities and key outputs for the SRB in 2001&#150;02. They will report on achievements in their 2002&#150;03 Plans.

<P>
<P><I>4 Jul 2001 : Column: 159W</I><P>
it clear that existing open space should not be developed for housing or other forms of built development in urban areas, unless the planning authority's assessments undertaken in accordance with guidance in PPG17 shows the land to be clearly surplus to requirements.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what estimate he has made of the hectarage of farmland which is surplus to agricultural requirements but cannot be used for any alternative purpose due to <i>(a)</i> local plans and <i>(b)</i> greenbelt zoning.  [2130]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10704w02.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Consideration of whether to grant planning permission for the alternative use of agricultural land is a matter in the first instance for local planning authorities taking into account their development plan policies and national guidance. National planning policy for the countryside is contained in Planning Policy Guidance Note (PPG) 7: The Countryside&#151;Environmental Quality and Economic and Social Development. PPG7 was recently amended to encourage local planning authorities to be more supportive of farm diversification projects that are consistent in their scale with their rural location.

<P>
<a name="10704w02.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 No research has been commissioned or undertaken to investigate the costs and benefits of introducing compulsory voting nor into turnouts for elections in other countries. As to the low turnout in the recent general election, the Electoral Commission is undertaking a review of the conduct of that election. The Government will give careful consideration to the findings once the report is presented to Parliament.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10704w02.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Keeble: </B>

<a name="10704w02.html_para2">My Department was closely involved, both through the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC), in drawing up the relevant advice for the aviation industry. We have more recently been working with the UK industry&#151;airlines, airports and travel agents&#151;and with our disability advisers, the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee, to draw up a voluntary code of practice for the industry on meeting the needs of disabled passengers.

The study's recommendations will be considered by the Regional Planning Bodies for the South West and the South East, which are both represented on the steering group for the study. Only then will any decisions be taken on the addition of schemes to the trunk roads programme.

 The Strategic Rail Authority intends that the Exeter to Waterloo line be included in the new Wessex franchise for which they invited expressions of interest in November last year. This is at a relatively early stage. The SRA has announced seven pre-qualifiers from whom it intends to invite proposals for the new franchise.

[733]<P>

<a name="10704w03.html_para0">HMG will consider favourably any proposal that Members of Parliament join the delegation when the assembly covers issues of particular concern to them, subject to accepting that any interventions could not be made in a personal capacity but would have to represent the views and policy of HMG.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10704w03.html_spnew6"><B> Peter Hain: </B> 
 The 57th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights (CHR) adopted a resolution proposed by Cuba on "The use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination" by 35 votes to 11, with six abstentions. The UK, with Belgium and Germany, voted against the resolution. The other EU members of the CHR, (Spain, France, Italy and Portugal) abstained. While fully recognising the numerous dangers caused by mercenary activity, the UK does not believe that the CHR is the appropriate forum to address the issue. This was the only resolution on mercenaries tabled at the CHR.

 The UK attaches importance to meeting its obligations to report on implementation of commitments under UN core human rights treaties. The UK's Fifth Periodic Report under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), submitted in 1999, was approved by Ministers. But in line with usual practice, there are no plans for a Minister to attend the Human Rights Committee examination of the UK report in October this year. Senior officials from the relevant Government Department will attend.

 We supported United Nations Security Council Resolution 1359 which was passed unanimously on 29 June 2001, which extended MINURSO's mandate until 30 November 2001. We fully support the efforts of the United Nations Secretary General to invite all the parties to meet directly or through proximity talks, under the auspices of his Personal Envoy, James Baker, and encourage the parties to discuss the draft Framework Agreement and to negotiate any specific changes they would like to see in this proposal, as well as to discuss any other proposal for a political solution, which may be put forward to the parties, to arrive at a mutually acceptable agreement. We also affirm that while such discussions go on, the official proposals submitted by the Polisario Front to overcome obstacles preventing implementation of the Settlement Plan will be considered.

<P>
<a name="10704w03.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The first ever UN Conference on Small Arms in July will signal a step-change in the international community's efforts to combat the uncontrolled spread and misuse of small arms that are the primary instruments of death and injury in conflicts and criminal acts worldwide. The UK has been actively engaged in the conference process both in its national capacity and within the EU.
<P>

<a name="10704w03.html_para2">FCO has been in frequent and close consultation with EU partners, both bilaterally and through the regular EU working groups which discuss these issues.
<P>

<a name="10704w03.html_para3">We also have many formal and informal contacts with the UK, for example in various arms control regimes and working groups, through which officials are able to discuss the subject of small arms and light weapons and other related issues. We also had contact with the US during the meetings in the preparatory process for the conference itself.

<a name="10704w03.html_para4">The Government attach particular importance to contacts with developing countries, as these include a large number of states most affected by the effects of small arms and light weapons. In February this year the UK hosted a small arms and light weapons policy brainstorming seminar to which a wide selection of countries was invited. The then Foreign Secretary, my right hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook), addressed that meeting. We also hold regular EU Troika meetings with SADC (Southern African Development Community), and participated in an EU/SADC meeting in the margins of the third PrepCom. In addition, the EU Presidency will be organising consultations between the EU and SADC, Latin American countries and others during the early stages of the conference. The subject has been a regular agenda item for a wide variety of bilateral meetings over the past year. Most recently, the Foreign Secretary, my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw), discussed prospects for the conference with the South African Foreign Minister.

 The Belgian MFA has carried out an internal inquiry into allegations made by a former employee of the Belgian Embassy in Sofia regarding the sale of visas at the Embassy. Although passports were not included in the allegations, we understand that the inquiry also looked into passports. The inquiry found no evidence to support the allegations and concluded that no rules had been broken. Separately, a judicial inquiry was launched in 1997 into the allegations and is still under way. It will be for the Belgian Procurator General to decide the outcome in this case.
<P>

<a name="10704w04.html_para1">Visas issued by the Belgian authorities allow access to the countries in the Schengen zone, which covers all EU countries except the UK and Ireland. They therefore do not permit entry to the United Kingdom, which maintains its own frontier controls and does not participate in Schengen visa arrangements.

<P>

<a name="10704w04.html_para2">However, there have been two substantive reports on PFI, since its inception, which have indicated that PFI is delivering value for money. The independent Arthur Andersen and Enterprise LSE Report stated the average percentage estimated saving against conventional procurement for the sample of projects they looked at, averaged 17 per cent. Also the NAO report on "PFI and value for money" found an average cost saving of 20 per cent. or just under &#163;1 billion in total, across seven projects examined by the NAO up until December 1999. This saving is measured against the conventional procurement route.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to his answer of 26 June 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 59W, on company cars, what assessment he has made of the impact of the loss to employees of company car tax concessions.  [2084]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10704w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The new company car tax system from April 2002 is designed to achieve lower levels of harmful emissions from cars. It does away with the reductions for driving higher levels of business mileage as this can be an incentive to drive unnecessary business miles. The reforms have been projected to have a broadly neutral effect on tax revenues, so in overall terms there is no loss to employees.
<P>

<a name="10704w05.html_para1">Many company car drivers will be paying less tax for the benefit of their company car under the new system. Having a company car with relatively low carbon dioxide emissions would help to ameliorate tax liabilities under the new system for any driver.
<P>

<a name="10704w05.html_para2">It is worth noting that we expect more drivers to take the opportunity of having a company car under the new rules. In fact the Inland Revenue has estimated that the reforms will lead to a net increase of around 200,000 company cars in the long term.

[2133]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10704w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 Contracting authorities/entities are required to call for competition for procurement contracts, above certain financial thresholds, in the Supplement to the <i>Official Journal of the European Communities</i> (OJEC). This includes PFI/PPP contracts where appropriate. Advertising in other publications is not mandatory, but must not pre-empt advertisement in OJEC.
<P>

<a name="10704w05.html_para3">This requirement arises from the EC procurement directives (which are based on principles of the EC Treaty). The principal legal basis was Articles 30, 57(2), 66 and 100a and the Directives have been implemented in the UK by the following Regulations (as amended):

<a name="10704w05.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Customs estimate that the reduced VAT rate for renovating empty homes should help to bring back into use up to 2,400 empty homes each year. Additionally, the Budget made a minor adjustment to the zero rate for the sale of renovated long-term empty houses, which from 1 August will benefit from relief if they have been empty for 10 years or more. This is expected to bring back into use up to 25 empty houses a year.

 A reduced 5 per cent. VAT rate applies to renovation work on an empty home that has not been lived in for three years or more.

<a name="10704w05.html_para10">The Government did not, however, want to disadvantage people who have to live in a house while renovating it. So if someone buys a house after it has been empty for three years or more and lives in it during the renovation work, the reduced rate applies to the building work provided it is completed within one year from the date the owner bought the house.
<P>

<a name="10704w05.html_para11">In addition, from 1 August, no VAT applies to the sale of a renovated house which has been empty for 10 years more.

Proposals are considered against a variety of criteria that include the impact of the redundancy on the local labour market, the level of partnership involvement, clear outputs and value for money. We also expect training proposals to be matched as far as possible to the needs of employers with vacancies so that people can move quickly into new jobs. DfES officials make every effort to ensure bids submitted via regional development agencies are processed as quickly as possible and provide an initial approval decision within three working days. The fund is designed to be as flexible as possible and, within the last year, we have introduced changes to increase its flexibility and make it more responsive to local needs.

 The US has made it clear that missile defence is envisaged as one element of a comprehensive strategy to deal with a new threat caused by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It is not aimed at defending against the Russian strategic arsenal, still less at giving the United States the capacity to attack Russia. President Bush has made it clear that it no longer considers Russia an enemy.

<P><P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will place in the Library what risk assessment of ballistic missile attack on the UK from <i>(a)</i> North Korea, <i>(b)</i> Iran, <i>(c)</i> Iraq, <i>(d)</i> Libya and <i>(e)</i> Syria has been made; and what assessment has been made of the potential of these countries to develop inventories of (i) global medium-range, (ii) intermediate range and (iii) inter- continental range ballistic missile.  [329]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10704w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 We assess that there is currently no significant ballistic missile threat to the mainland of the United Kingdom. We do, however, continue to monitor developments closely, particularly as they might affect deployed forces.
<P>

<a name="10704w08.html_para1">North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Libya and Syria all have ballistic missiles development and/or production programmes and have the potential to develop, or to obtain inventories of, longer-range ballistic missiles. North Korea and Iran already possess medium-range ballistic missiles and North Korea has the technology needed to develop ballistic missiles of intercontinental range.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what has been the cost of the combat effectiveness gender study; and if he will make a statement.  [1791]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10704w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Work on the study into the effect of gender upon combat effectiveness has mainly been carried out by staff in the course of their normal business, and the costs have not therefore been recorded. Those costs that can be identified relate to work conducted on our behalf by contractors. This amounts to approximately &#163;100,000.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="10704w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The UK remains committed to participating in the US national ignition facility programme in order to gain access to a high powered laser which is a key element of our warhead stewardship programme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the impact of proposed wind farm developments in Moray on RAF training flight paths; and if he will make a statement.  [1978]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10704w08.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 As there is potential for wind farms to interfere with radar, low flying and other communications, each wind energy proposal received by the Ministry of Defence is evaluated on a case-by-case basis by several specialists; this includes the assessment of the impact upon RAF training paths.
<P>

<a name="10704w08.html_para2">The Ministry of Defence supports fully the Government's renewable energy policy. However, we must ensure that the defences of the United Kingdom are not jeopardised and that our aircrews are able to conduct training safely. Of the eight proposals we have had, we had no objections to seven and one is currently being assessed. Owing to the commercial sensitivity of the information I am withholding details of the sites under exemption 7 of the code of practice on access to government information.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of anti-satellite weapons, called parasitic satellites.  [328]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10704w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Small satellites do not yet constitute a credible capability as anti-satellite systems; such threats continue to be monitored closely. The effectiveness of anti-satellite weapons is best assessed on a case-by-case basis.

This follows a comprehensive and detailed review by the Government of the existing legislative framework governing strategic export controls, taking into account the views of all interested parties. The Export Control Bill will replace the export control provisions of the Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act 1939. The Bill contains new powers to strengthen the export control regime, sets out the purposes for which export controls can be imposed and provides for parliamentary scrutiny of secondary legislation made under the Bill.

 The Environment Agency's prosecution database runs only from January 1999 and does not provide narrative in respect of prosecutions. The failure to report leakage from a storage tank would not therefore be specifically identified and case-by-case information would be disproportionately expensive to obtain. If leakage from a petrol tank occurred, a prosecution would be likely to be based on the leakage itself and the resulting pollution or a breach of a licence condition.

 <i>[holding answer 3 July 2001]:</i> The Government's policy towards air pollution is set out in the Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, published in January 2000. The Strategy sets health-based standards for the eight air pollutants of most concern, as well as the Government's and devolved Administrations' air quality policy objectives for the short to medium term. We will also be consulting shortly on a number of new or revised objectives for certain pollutants. In doing so, we will take full account of the emerging evidence on the health effects of long-term exposure to air pollution.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10704w11.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Local authorities across the country have been carrying out detailed studies of their local air quality over the past three years. Within the Yeovil constituency, the relevant authority (South Somerset district council) is undertaking a major study of air quality in Yeovil town centre, having identified some potential air pollution problems there. No other areas within the Yeovil constituency have so far been identified as having levels of air pollution which might exceed the nationally prescribed objectives.
<P>

<a name="10704w11.html_para6">Within Yeovil town centre, South Somerset district council has identified a potential exceedence of the nationally prescribed objective for nitrogen dioxide in the vicinity of the A30/A37 hospital roundabout. A new monitoring station has therefore been installed in the grounds of the Yeovil district hospital, to measure levels of nitrogen dioxide and particles in the area of concern. I understand that South Somerset district council is due very shortly to publish an interim report giving the first detailed monitoring results from this station.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how much illegal meat was imported into the UK and confiscated from ports and airports in the last 12 months; and if she will list the species of animal concerned.  [1999]<P>

<P>
<a name="10704w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 A number of enforcement authorities are involved in the seizure of illegal imports of meat into the UK and no central records are kept of meat confiscated from ports and airports. As part of the new action across Government on illegal imports of animal products, we are developing mechanisms to centralise such records in future. Consolidated historical figures are not available but the information we have gathered to date indicates that in excess of 1,750 kg of illegal meat was confiscated from individuals during the financial year 2000&#150;01

<P>
<P>
<a name="10704w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is co-ordinating action across Government to ensure that rules governing both commercial and personal imports are enforced effectively at ports and airports. We have introduced improved publicity to ensure travellers are aware of the restrictions on what may be imported. Posters have been placed at main airports and information is being provided by the travel industry and FCO posts abroad. New arrangements have been introduced to improve sharing of information within Government on known or suspected illegal imports to enable enforcement authorities to better target their activities. In addition, the European Commission have agreed to give urgent attention to ensuring that the law on personal imports is clear and robust so that consistent and effective controls can be maintained across all the Community's borders.

 The new Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will bring together the Government's drive to help people get into work as well as to provide a better service for pensions and pensioners.
<P>

<a name="10704w12.html_para0">The new Department will have two core operations to enable it to do this: Jobcentre Plus and the Pension Service.
<P>

<a name="10704w12.html_para1">The Pension Service will offer a local service working in partnership with local authorities and voluntary organisations. To support the local service network, we will bring together the backroom processing in about 20 locations rather than over 400 at present, allowing frontline staff to concentrate on dealing with customers. For example, they will undertake outreach activity such as home visiting, private interviews in locations that suit pensioners and drop-in services.
<P>

<a name="10704w12.html_para2">As we already process much of our pensions work for the whole of the UK in Newcastle, centralising processing work is a logical next step to support the national frontline network. Staff are being consulted and kept informed as plans develop.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement about the Government's plans to establish anti-social behaviour units in each local authority; and what the cost to public funds will be.  [1245]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10704w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The report of policy action team 8, published in March 2000, recommended that a named person in each local authority district should co-ordinate action on anti-social behaviour and also encouraged the setting up of specialist teams to focus on anti-social behaviour. This second point has been reiterated in our manifesto. We think it important that each local authority district should have an effective means of tackling anti-social behaviour. The precise level of resources will vary from area to area depending on local need.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement about the Government's plans to increase the powers of and the resources available to HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary.  [1244]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10704w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary has a broad remit to inspect and report to the Secretary of State on the efficiency and effectiveness of police forces in England and Wales, the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the National Crime Squad and the National Criminal Intelligence Service. Under the Local Government Act 1999 these powers were extended to cover the inspection of best value in police authorities. The Police Act 1996 provided that the Secretary of State may direct the inspectors of constabulary to carry out other duties for the purpose of furthering police efficiency and effectiveness. Under this provision, from April 2001, the inspectorate has additionally been tasked with 



<P>
<P><I>4 Jul 2001 : Column: 200W</I><P>
inspecting, over a five-year period, every police basic command unit (BCU) in England and Wales. There are no plans at present to further increase the powers of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary.
<P>

<a name="10704w13.html_para0">Budgetary allocation for the inspectorate in 2001&#150;02 is just over &#163;7.7 million. This includes &#163;1 million for the additional costs associated with the BCU inspections.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what resources have been allocated to each Group Family Five area; and what the level of crime is in each such area, broken down by standard category, since 1997.  [1136]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10704w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Resource allocation for basic command units within police forces is a matter for each chief constable. The information is not held centrally.
<P>

<a name="10704w13.html_para1">Recorded crime statistics at basic command unit level are available from April 1999 onwards. They are contained in the Home Office Statistical Bulletins "Recorded Crime Statistics" published on 18 January 2000, 18 July 2000 and 16 January 2001, copies of which are available in the Library.

<P>
<a name="10704w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B>

Authority and the considerable help of the Police Authority itself, we will be able to make sense of the matter without a further public inquiry.
<P>

<a name="10704w13.html_para2">It will be important to ensure that all necessary lessons are learnt from this tragic incident so that the possibility of similar events taking place in Sussex or other forces are minimised.
<P>

<a name="10704w13.html_para3">I will want to listen to the concerns of the Ashley family, and I will be meeting them on 4 July.

 <i>[holding answer 3 July 2001]:</i> Her Majesty's Prison Garth does not hold sex offenders for long periods of time and therefore there is no rehabilitation programme for sex offenders at Garth prison. The sex offender treatment programme (SOTP) does operate at Wymott prison, which is adjacent to Garth. The proposed reduction in the number of prison officers at Wymott will not have any impact on completion of SOTP courses.

 The Home Office certificate of identity (CID) is a travel document issued to foreign nationals who are resident in the United Kingdom and cannot obtain a passport from their national authorities. The majority of people issued with CIDs have applied unsuccessfully for asylum, but subsequently been granted exceptional leave to remain for a limited period. Between 1 May 1997 and 7 June 2001, the Home Office issued 58,454 CIDs. Separate records are not kept of the number of CIDs issued to persons with current exceptional leave to remain in the United Kingdom as opposed to those with indefinite leave to remain.
<P>

<a name="10704w13.html_para5">The certificate of identity is issued on a discretionary basis, not under an international convention. European Union member states are not obliged to recognise the document. Those member states which do not do so, and generally do not issue travel visas to CID holders, include France, Germany, Greece and Spain.

 The police reform programme will deliver a modern police service providing the highest standards of detective capability, public reassurance, scientific and technical support, leadership, and modern working practices to secure reductions in crime and in the fear of crime.

 Within the broad statutory limits set by Parliament, sentences in individual cases are a matter for the courts alone, taking into account all the circumstances of the offences and the offender, including all mitigating and aggravating factors.

 Tackling crime and the fear of crime is a clear priority for this Government. It applies to all areas, whether suburban, rural or inner-city, and our approach is to assist the police and the local crime and disorder partnerships to address local crime effectively.
<P>

<a name="10704w14.html_para3">We are providing increased funding for police forces covering rural areas to take account of the additional costs involved: &#163;30 million is being allocated to 31 forces this year. The allocation for Leicestershire police is &#163;433,516. In addition, the rural crime toolkit, on the Home Office's crime reduction website, provides a new resource to help local partnerships to address crime in rural areas.
<P>

<a name="10704w14.html_para4">The nine crime and disorder partnerships in Leicestershire are supporting a varied programme of crime reduction initiatives and projects as part of the Government's crime reduction programme. Each of the partnerships is being provided with &#163;10,000 from the crime reduction programme this year to help them to improve their performance in tackling crime in their areas. In addition, the partnerships in Leicestershire have received money to support closed circuit television initiatives, and they have been allocated &#163;565,000 this year to tackle drug related crime. In November last year, Leicestershire received &#163;341,000 for a project to tackle burglary in Leicester as part of the reducing burglary initiative, and &#163;168,000 was awarded to eight forces, including Leicestershire, to tackle distraction burglary in central and eastern England as part of the targeted policing initiative.

 Statistics concerning asylum applications have been published since 1992. Separate figures are given both for principal applicants only, and for principal applicants and dependants; and cover the period from 1984 to the present. The information is published in the annual Home Office statistical bulletins entitled "Asylum Statistics", copies of which are available in the Library and on the Department's website at www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration1.html.
<P>

<a name="10704w14.html_para5">Statistics concerning asylum removals published before March 2001 have given figures for principal applicants only. From April 2001, the figures show the total number of failed asylum seekers removed, including dependants. This is to reflect the change in the removals target for failed asylum seekers for 2001&#150;02 which is expressed in terms of the total figure for the first time. The change is intended to give a more informed picture of the number of people being removed from the United Kingdom as a result of failed asylum applications and to give a fairer reflection of the activity involved in enforcing their departure. The details were published in December 2000.
<P>

<a name="10704w14.html_para6">The removals target is equivalent to some 24,000 principal applicants and 6,000 dependants, although the number of dependants removed will vary according to the balance between individuals and families as well as family size, and is difficult to predict.

<a name="10704w14.html_para7">Despite these difficulties, the Government are committed to increasing the number of failed asylum seekers who are removed from the United Kingdom. The Labour manifesto said that in excess of 30,000 people who had not justified their claim would be removed in 2003&#150;04, which is about 2,500 people a month. We have decided that that monthly target must be met by early next year, which enables us to have a commitment to reach and exceed 30,000 removals by 2003.

 <i>[holding answer 25 June 2001]:</i> The Government have no current plans to introduce legislation to extend charitable status to community sports clubs. However, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in his Budget statement the Government's intention to consult on the best way for a tax relief to help community amateur sports clubs that make a positive contribution to the local community. My officials and their Treasury and Inland Revenue colleagues are in discussions with sporting organisations including Sport England, the Central Council for Physical Recreation and the National Playing Fields Association on the detail of this relief. A consultation paper will be published later this year.

 Twenty three countries have now qualified for exceptional relief under the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative. Over $53 billion of debt relief has been agreed for these countries, which will reduce their debts by almost two-thirds on average. The money released is directly linked to poverty reduction. The impact of this debt reduction means that, after debt relief, social expenditures in these HIPC countries are projected to rise by an average of some US$1.7 billion per year during 2001&#150;02. We hope more countries will qualify for relief this year, but many of the remaining countries are affected by conflict or have yet to demonstrate their commitment to reform.
