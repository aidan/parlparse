 Within current policy the use of non-human primates from an overseas source in regulated procedures is authorised only when the centre in question has demonstrated that it provides appropriate standards of housing and care for animals likely to be bred and supplied to licensees in the United Kingdom.

 The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has responsibility for delivering official controls in all approved fresh meat establishments in Great Britain under EC Regulation 854/2004. It is not within the remit of the FSA to review its delivery responsibilities under this legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="101104w0001.htm_para23"><a name="10110456000133">In 2007 the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) implemented a number of efficiency programmes. As a result of these programmes the cost of delivering meat official controls in Great Britain has reduced significantly from £91.3 million in 2006-07 to £68.1 million at the end of 2009-10, and in Northern Ireland has reduced from £7.1 million in 2007-08 to £6.6 million at the end of 2009-10. Further savings of £0.6 million from the creation of the FSA's Integrated Corporate Services will be attributed to corporate support for meat official controls. Following the merger with the MHS, the FSA has launched an Operations Programme to review all official controls delivered on behalf of the FSA to maximise its efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

 Receivers fees are paid from the amounts recovered from criminals, therefore no amount is paid from the public purse.

 This issue was raised in consultation as part of the Heat and Energy Saving Strategy consultation. The analysis of responses in September 2009 indicated that there was no clear answer to the question of the degree to which combined heat and power powered by fossil fuel will be less advantageous as electricity generation overall becomes less carbon intensive, because this is likely to depend on a range of factors, particularly the overall energy mix, carbon intensity, and the nature of infrastructure and design. It will also depend on the kind of heating system the micro-CHP unit is replacing.</p>

 This year to date the OFT has imposed requirements on three licensees engaged in debt management activities, revoked one licence held by a licensee engaged in debt management activities and refused to grant a licence to one applicant that proposed to engage in debt management activities. The OFT has also made a determination to revoke the licence of one other licensee engaged in debt management activities, which is subject to an appeal to the First Tier Tribunal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="101104w0001.htm_para50"><a name="10110457000328">Adjudicators acting on behalf of the OFT also made three determinations favourable to the trader, which resulted in two licensees engaged in debt management activities being permitted to continue to retain their licences and one to be granted a licence. During the adjudication process one licensee engaged in debt management activities surrendered its licence and one applicant for a licence withdrew its application. One further minded to notice is yet to be determined. The OFT has also warned 63 traders about unlicensed trading or failing to adhere to the Debt Management Guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="101104w0001.htm_para51"><a name="10110457000329">The primary focus this year has been the OFT's review of compliance with its Debt Management Guidance, which was published on 28 September 2010, and subsequent enforcement action (additional to that detailed above) to warn 129 debt management firms about non-compliant business practices identified during the review. The firms were instructed to produce independently audited evidence confirming action that they have taken to address the identified areas of non-compliance by mid-December 2010. Of the 129 firms, 22 have already surrendered their licences, 92 firms have agreed to comply and the OFT has initiated revocation action against 15 traders, but this may well increase.</p>

We plan minimal changes to the underlying system for 2011-12 in order to ensure the transparent introduction of the premium. We also made clear our longer term intention to bring in a simpler and more transparent funding system to help reduce the funding differences between similar schools in different areas.

1. Estimates are derived from the Family Resources Survey and are based on a three year average to help take account of small sample sizes in certain deciles and statistical variation across the years.<br>
2. Estimates are rounded to the nearest percentage point, so the deciles may not sum to 100% due to rounding.<br>
3. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication 'Households Below Average Income' series.<br>
4. The income of single pensioners are divided by 0.58 to take account of their costs relative to a pensioner couple household who have shared costs-this is known as equivalisation. The quintiles and deciles are derived using OECD equivalisation factors.<br>
5. The Family Resources Survey is known to undercount receipt of certain benefits. This methodology assumes that this undercount is spread proportionally across deciles.<br>

This restructuring will take place alongside measures to reduce the size of the Army by approximately 7,000 by 2015. Detailed planning to determine exactly how and when this restructuring will be done is now under way. All infantry battalions will be incorporated into the new Army structure, while the reductions in personnel will be found from administrative and supporting elements such as headquarters staff and some combat support and combat service support force elements.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when he expects to enter into contractual arrangements for long-lead items on the Future Submarine Programme; what estimate he has made of the total cost of such items; what assessment he has made of the capability of such arrangements with arrangements for review by Parliament of all options of Main Gate, including cancellation; and what consideration he has given to ensuring that cancellation fees for long-lead item contracts do not restrict the consideration of alternatives.

 Contractual arrangements for long lead items for both the submarine platform and propulsion systems will be entered into as necessary during the programme's assessment phase to prevent unnecessary delays to the programme. Final decisions on the long lead items required during the assessment phase will be made as part of, and following, the initial gate approvals process. It is too early to state the costs of these items.</p>

The procurement of long lead items across Ministry of Defence projects does not constrain main gate decisions and any such early commitment takes into account the balance of risk of a project not securing main gate approval.</p>
