To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what assessment he has made of the programmes which it will be ultra vires for his Department to fund or have sole responsibility for after devolution; if he will list these programmes; and if he will make a statement.  [63298]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81210w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Social Security, Child Support and pension matters are reserved to the Westminster Parliament by virtue of Head F of Schedule 5 of the Scotland Act 1998. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security will therefore remain responsible for these matters in Scotland after devolution.
<P>
<P>
<a name="81210w01.html_wqn2"><B> Ms Roseanna Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how much is spent annually by his Department on research programmes in Scotland; and what proportion of this funding will be transferred to the Scottish Parliament after devolution.  [63296]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81210w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Social Security, Child Support and Pensions are reserved matters, and the research associated with them will also remain this Department's responsibility after devolution. Therefore none of the funding attributable to research in this Department will be transferred to the Scottish Parliament.
<P>

<a name="81210w01.html_para0">The cost of collecting data in relation to Scotland is an integral part of the cost of collecting data for Great Britain. The overhead costs of conducting the research are incurred on a Great Britain basis. It is not therefore possible to disaggregate the spending on research in Scotland from the total spending in Great Britain.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will list <i>(a)</i> by programme over &#163;50,000 and <i>(b)</i> the total of spending by his Department in Scotland on the identifiable spending areas detailed in Table 7.6A of the Public Expenditure Statistical Analysis 1997-98 (Cmnd 3601); which of these programmes will fall solely or jointly under the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament; and what arrangements are in place to transfer control of funds for these projects to the Scottish Executive or Parliament.

 I refer the hon. Member to the reply given by my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury to the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Swinney) on 4 November 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>615,</i> which sets out identifiable expenditure on Social Security benefits in Scotland. It does not include the costs of administration in or in respect of Scotland, or certain elements, e.g. benefits paid overseas which cannot be attributed separately.
<P>

<a name="81210w01.html_para1">Social Security is a reserved matter and expenditure on it will not therefore be the responsibility of the Scottish Executive or Parliament.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81210w01.html_wqn4"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will make a statement about the future of the funding arrangements for supported accommodation.  [63667]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81210w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 We are publishing today a consultation document "Supporting People" proposing new funding arrangements for support services. The proposals arise from the Inter-Departmental review of funding for supported accommodation.
<P>

<a name="81210w01.html_para2">Over the years Housing Benefit, which was designed to meet housing costs, has been used to meet other costs over which the Government have no control. As a result, Housing Benefit became the primary funding stream for support services that varied in standard from the very good to the very bad. There was no proper consideration of quality or standards.
<P>

<a name="81210w01.html_para3">Nor has there been an effective over-arching strategy of the work of the various government departments involved, or ownership of responsibility for ensuring that vulnerable people receive the support they require. This has resulted in a focus on dealing with problems once they emerge, sometimes pushing people into more acute services than they might have originally needed.
<P>

<a name="81210w01.html_para4">The new arrangements will enable many thousands of vulnerable people to get the cost-effective and high- quality services which they need.
<P>

<a name="81210w01.html_para5">We propose to replace the current complicated arrangements with one single budget targeted specifically at support services. This will ensure that the Government meet people's basic housing costs and at the same time that vulnerable people get the quality help they need to meet their requirements. This will be administered at the local level by Local Authorities. The new single budget will be preceded by a new, time-limited, transitional Housing Benefit scheme which will be implemented when current regulations expire; these regulations were introduced to protect many thousands of vulnerable people whose support services were jeopardised by a Court ruling in July 1997.
<P>

<a name="81210w01.html_para6">Our new proposals for delivering support to vulnerable people will operate in combination with community care, housing, and other existing policies to support vulnerable people in the community. Funding for support services will, for the first time, be clear and practical. This means that many vulnerable people--such as frail elderly people, people with mental health problems, and victims of domestic violence--will be able to remain independent within the community.




<P>
<P><I>10 Dec 1998 : Column: 245</I><P>

<P>

<a name="81210w01.html_para7">The proposals demonstrate the benefits of Inter- Departmental working, bringing together expertise across Government to develop policies that meet the needs of individuals. In carrying this work forward, the Government are keen to involve local government, the Housing Corporation, the providers and other stakeholders throughout the consultation process and beyond.
<P>

<a name="81210w01.html_para8">Copies will be placed in the Library.

<P>
<a name="81210w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 There are no plans to establish separate environmental courts. However, cases involving environmental issues will benefit, along with all other cases, from the regime of judicial case management to be introduced in April.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what progress has been made over the last five years <i>(a)</i> within his Department, <i>(b)</i> in conjunction with other Government departments and <i>(c)</i> in conjunction with European bodies towards developing systems involving the use of new technology for safety-related road traffic law enforcement and the administration of penalties.  [62544]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81210w01.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Road traffic law enforcement and the administration of penalties are mainly matters for my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. However, my department, in conjunction with his, is interested in the potential of new technology to support its road safety and environmental objectives. To that end it has an extensive research programme and is also supportive of a wide range of research in the UK and in Europe which seeks to develop practical applications of new technology for road traffic law enforcement and the administration of penalties. Examples of this are the research projects on vehicle speed control being conducted on behalf of the Department by the Motor Industry Research Association and the Institute for Transport Studies at the University of Leeds, and the field trials conducted in Sweden and the Netherlands evaluating different systems and technologies to control vehicle speeds externally.

<a name="81210w02.html_para2">In the longer term, a standard method of attaching child restraints to cars will make fitting more straightforward. The UK has taken a leading role in the development of the ISOFIX system, which would provide standard attachment points on both child restraints and cars.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he expects to announce the results of the audit of the UK safety oversight system carried out by the International Civil Aviation Safety Organisation in April 1998; and if he will make a statement.  [63665]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81210w03.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The United Kingdom was one of the leading nations in pressing the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) to set up, in 1995, a 



<P>
<P><I>10 Dec 1998 : Column: 251</I><P>
programme of voluntary safety assessments of its member states. The objective of this programme was to seek to ensure that ICAO Contracting States are adequately discharging their responsibilities for safety oversight in certain specific areas: aircraft operations, the licensing and training of personnel and aircraft airworthiness.
<P>

<a name="81210w03.html_para1">This Government took the initiative in December 1997--the first major aviation state to do so--of asking ICAO to assess the UK safety oversight system. The audit took place from 14-24 April, this year, and focused to a large extent on the role of the Civil Aviation Authority. The final Report, which was agreed with ICAO on 30 October, finds that the
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'CAA is an appropriately organised and funded organisation very effective and efficient for its purpose'.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="81210w03.html_para2">There are 28 recommendations, relatively few compared with audits of other, smaller authorities, and none questions the performance of the Authority's fundamental safety work. The Government have accepted all but two of the recommendations, which could not have been met within the current legislative structure. We have agreed an Action Plan, drawn up by the CAA, to meet the recommendations; the Plan is included in the Report.
<P>

<a name="81210w03.html_para3">We have also been firm advocates of the need to make the results of ICAO audits more transparent and widely available to the international aviation community and to the public at large. Today, we are happy to make the full ICAO report available on the Internet at the DETR web-site. Printed copies have been placed in the House Libraries.
<P>

<a name="81210w03.html_para4">The UK is one of the leaders in safety oversight, with an excellent reputation world wide. But aviation safety needs constant vigilance; that is why both the Government and the Authority were keen to open its doors to ICAO. The Government welcome the audit results and the CAA's positive response, and will be following closely the implementation of the Action Plan. I am confident that the CAA, and the UK aviation industry as a whole, has benefited from this audit.

<a name="81210w04.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 We intend the Right to Buy scheme to continue, and that eligible tenants should continue to buy at substantial discounts. The annual cost of the scheme to the taxpayer is currently around &#163;400 million a year at net present value. Tenants are, and will continue to be, eligible to claim up to 60 per cent. discount on a house and 70 per cent. discount on a flat, but we want to provide value for money to the taxpayer so the maximum cash limit of &#163;50,000 will be reduced.
<P>

<a name="81210w04.html_para0">We announced plans on 28 July 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>124-25</i>, to reduce the limit to a fairer level which reflected more closely the actual cost of buying a local authority home in each of the nine English regions.

<P>

<a name="81210w04.html_para3">The limits are based on 70 per cent. of the average value of local authority houses and flats in each region, and 65 per cent. in London where pressure on social housing is currently greatest.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The data are from the Prescription Cost Analysis system and cover all NHS prescriptions for methylphenidate hydrochloride dispensed by community pharmacists and dispensing doctors in England. Methylphenidate hydrochloride is the approved non-proprietary name for Ritalin.<P>

2. The net ingredient cost (NIC) is the basic cost of a drug. This cost does not take account of discounts, dispensing costs, fees or prescription charges income.<P>

3. Total NHS prescriptions include prescriptions originating not only from general practitioners but also from hospital doctors where these are dispensed in the community. Also included are prescriptions written in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man but dispensed in England.<P>

4. It is assumed that the majority of prescriptions for methylphenidate hydrochloride relate to the treatment of children with attention deficit disorder, which is currently the only licensed indication of this drug. However, a small number of prescriptions may relate to the treatment of patients with narcolepsy (a licensed indication of the drug in the 1980s). <P>

Delays in discharge can reflect a variety of factors and these will vary between health authorities, depending on a variety of factors.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what information is made available to doctors treating Gulf War veterans in relation to any exposure they may have had to materials which may have been toxic or hazardous, with particular reference to depleted uranium.  [63033]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81210w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 Any Gulf veteran who is concerned that his or her health has been adversely affected by Service during the Gulf conflict, including possible exposure to depleted uranium (DU), is entitled to seek a referral to the MOD's Medical Assessment Programme (MAP) for a full medical assessment. During this assessment, MAP patients receive a standard set of tests and are asked by the examining MAP physician to provide detailed information about possible factors, including DU, to which they may have been exposed during the Gulf conflict. Following the assessment, the examining physician will write to the doctor who referred the patient to the programme, to provide diagnostic information and recommend any appropriate treatment. It is then that doctor's responsibility to take forward and monitor the treatment as he or she would for any other patient. For veterans who have left the Armed Forces, their doctor will normally be a GP and any recommended treatment will therefore be carried out within the NHS.
<P>

<a name="81210w05.html_para3">In consultation with the Department of Health and the health departments of the Welsh, Scottish and Northern Ireland Offices, the Ministry of Defence has produced an information pack with the intention of providing General Practitioners and other health professionals with information which they may find useful in dealing with Gulf veterans' health concerns. This pack includes summaries of what is known about a number of possible factors to which veterans may have been exposed during their service in the Gulf, including DU. It also includes an overview of research which has been carried out in areas related to Gulf veterans' illnesses, together with a bibliography of key papers. The information pack has been placed on the MOD's internet site and is available in hard copy on request. My Department is currently considering how best to ensure further than this information reaches its target audience. A copy of the pack has been placed in the Library of the House.

<P>

<a name="81210w06.html_para0">Additionality is also a requirement of the structural funds regulations, and must be verified in respect of the whole territory covered by each Objective within each Member State. This means that UK expenditure on activities eligible for co-financing from the structural funds has to be maintained at least at the same level during the current programming period of 1994-99 as in the previous programming period.

<a name="81210w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 Under the terms of the Scotland Act 1998, the Scottish Ministers will assume responsibility for a range of devolved functions which will in part depend on secondary legislation which has yet to be passed. My Department is reviewing its programmes, including the research components, in the light of the Scotland Act. It is too early to say to what extent programme expenditure which is currently administered by the Department may relate to functions which will transfer to Scottish Ministers. Work is taking place to establish the extent of any such expenditure and to assess the need for any consequential transfer of funds to the Scottish Ministers. For the total spending by the Department in Scotland, I refer the hon. Member to the reply given by my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury to the hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Swinney) on 4 November 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>615</i>.

<a name="81210w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The statistical information about contracted-out prison costs shown on page 56 of the Prison Service Annual Report for 1997-98 was calculated by dividing the "net operating costs" by either the "average baseline certified normal accommodation" or the "average prisoner population". The data shown for individual prisons listed--Blakenhurst, Buckley Hall, Doncaster, and The Wolds--are correct. Unfortunately, the summary figures shown have been distorted by including the average Certified Normal Accommodation and average prisoner population data for the contracted prisons--Altcourse, Parc, and Lowdham Grange--which opened towards the end of the operational year. This error has also carried forward into the summary table shown on page 55 of the Report. I have arranged for corrected copies of these tables to be placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="81210w07.html_para11">Despite these errors, the contracted-out prisons continue to provide good value for money. But, perhaps more importantly, the figures shown that the gap between the contracted-out prisons' costs and public sector prisons' costs continues to reduce.

<a name="81210w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 does not specify what should be included in the crime and disorder reduction strategies. This is a matter for local decision by the local authority and police, in partnership with a wide range of other bodies and in consultation with the community as a whole, based upon the priorities to emerge from local crime and disorder audits. The Home Office has, therefore, made no recommendation in this respect, although guidance dealing inter alia with the process of strategy development was issued to partnerships and other interested parties in July 1998.

<P>
<a name="81210w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The assisted prison visits scheme exists to help prisoners maintain contact with their close relatives and partners. The scheme was established in 1988. To qualify for assistance in meeting the costs of travel to and from the prison, the visitor must be in receipt of a low income benefit as administered by the Benefits Agency.
<P>

<a name="81210w08.html_para3">The scheme does not distinguish between married and non-married partners, but financial assistance is extended to same-sex partners only at the expense of support for a prisoner's family members. In consequence, some prisoners, including young offenders, do not receive visits from parents or close relatives.
<P>

<a name="81210w08.html_para4">The Government are keen to encourage all prisoners to maintain family ties, and believe that same-sex partners should be treated fairly by the Prison Service. Therefore, both partners and relatives will, in future, be able to receive assistance with the cost of visiting, within the qualifying conditions of the scheme.

 The principal responsibilities of the Home Office in respect of the police, probation, fire and prison services, and in respect of the criminal justice system, relate only to England and Wales. Almost all the research conducted by the Home Office concerns, in one way or another, the operation in future of these services and systems in England and Wales.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what estimate she has made of the level of benefit fraud within the social security system; and what plans she has to tackle it.  [63176]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81210w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McFall: </B> 
 Responsibility for the subject in question has been delegated to the Social Security Agency under its Chief Executive, Mr. Chris Thompson, and I have asked him to arrange for a reply to be given.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question about the estimated levels of fraud within the social security system and plans to tackle such fraud.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Social Security Agency is in the process of estimating the levels of fraud in the benefit system. The Agency is using a methodology, known as Benefit Review, which as been successfully used by the Benefits Agency to estimate the levels of fraud in Great Britain.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As regards its plans to tackle fraud the Agency is committed to minimising opportunities for fraud and abuse within the social security system. In recent years the Agency has been working even more closely with a wide range of colleagues and other parties to provide a coherent and focused effort in combating fraud and abuse. These include the Benefits Agency in Great Britain, Child Support

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency is undertaking a wide range of initiatives, which mirror similar work in the Benefits Agency, designed to provide an estimate of the level of fraud within benefit systems, to secure the gateway to benefit systems and to detect and prosecute those who seek to defraud the system. This programme of initiatives is being closely monitored and updated on a regular basis to take account of new developments which may emanate from the Benefits Agency or from new Ministerial objectives. I have recently set up a new Benefit Security Directorate to provide a greater focus and to co-ordinate the programme of work.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I can assure you that the Agency will continue to seek new ways of ensuring that resources are targeted effectively at known areas of risk and that expenditure loss through fraud is kept to a minimum.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<P>
<a name="81210w10.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Brake: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what plans his Department has to contract with the armed services to provide emergency cover over the millennium period; and what estimate he has made of the cost of that cover.  [62574]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81210w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 The Scottish Office has no specific plans for involving the military over the millennium period. There are procedures in place, however, through the standing military aid arrangements, which would be invoked in the event of any requirement for assistance.
<P>

<a name="81210w10.html_para3">It is quite normal for military aid to be sought by local authorities, particularly over the winter, but as yet it is too early to identify any specific requirements which they or other bodies may have over the millennium period.

<a name="81210w10.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Swayne: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what estimate he has made of the cost of treatments for Aids-related conditions over the next financial year.  [62529]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81210w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 Health Boards in Scotland are expected to meet the cost of such treatments from within the general allocations of funds provided to them each year. In order to assist Boards in planning services for HIV/AIDS patients, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State recently set up an expert group to recommend treatment protocols and to estimate the numbers of HIV/AIDS patients likely to be eligible for treatment with the new anti-retroviral drugs in the next few years. The group's report should be available shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81210w10.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Russell Brown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he intends to prepare a strategy for forestry in Scotland.  [63808]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81210w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 Forestry is an important part of the rural scene in Scotland. Its importance will grow as timber production doubles over the next 15 years and Scotland's forests and woodlands become more valuable for recreation and wildlife. We believe that it is important to have a strategy for forestry in Scotland which will provide 



<P>
<P><I>10 Dec 1998 : Column: 277</I><P>
a context for forestry policies and programmes. This will ensure that forestry integrates well with other aspects of the rural economy and plays its full part in the future well-being of Scotland.
<P>

<a name="81210w10.html_para4">Clearly, the Scottish Executive will want to determine the form and content of a Scottish Forestry Strategy. Nevertheless, we consider that it would be helpful to prepare an issues paper which could form the basis for consultation on a strategy.
<P>

<a name="81210w10.html_para5">We have therefore asked the Forestry Commission to set this work in hand, in liaison with other relevant Government Departments and Agencies, with a view to publishing an issues paper early next year.

<a name="81210w10.html_wqn5"><B> Ms Roseanna Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what discussions he has had with his ministerial colleagues regarding the transfer of funding for United Kingdom programmes operating in Scotland where sole or joint responsibility transfers to the Scottish Parliament or Executive; if he will list the projects he has identified as being within the sole or joint competence of the Scottish Parliament; and if he will make a statement.  [63302]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81210w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 Under the Scotland Act 1998, Scottish Ministers will take over the delivery of public services that currently fall within the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Scotland. In addition, devolution will bring extra responsibilities to Scotland in areas such as transport and environment. Officials are currently discussing the details, including the issue of additional transfers of funding. There may also be cases where it is agreed by all concerned that the best course is a shared programme, which continues to be funded on a UK or GB basis.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what representations he has made to the Secretary of State for Defence concerning requests for regiments to participate in the ceremonies for the opening of the Scottish Parliament; and what steps he is taking to ensure prominence is given to Scottish regiments and bands based in Scotland.  [63303]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81210w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 I have made no such representations to the Secretary of State for Defence. However, the Services are represented on The Scottish Parliament Opening Ceremony Working Group which is taking forward the detailed planning of the event. In its deliberations, the Group will be considering to what extent military personnel, including Scottish regiments and bands based in Scotland, should be involved.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81210w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 Before exports of British beef can resume under the Date Based Export Scheme (DBES) the UK must slaughter all offspring born after 1 August 1996 to BSE cases confirmed before 25 November 1998 (the date of the Commission Decision on the DBES). When new cases of BSE occur any offspring born after 1 August 1996 must be slaughtered without delay.
<P>

<a name="81210w11.html_para0">We have known for some time that this cull would be necessary and started it on a voluntary basis in August. We have been waiting for formal adoption of the Commission Decision in order to make it compulsory and ensure that the cull is properly carried out. Regulations are being laid before the House today for this purpose.
<P>

<a name="81210w11.html_para1">Since the cull started on a voluntary basis in August we have, with the co-operation of the farming community, culled over 1,000 animals. The compulsory cull, which will come into force in January, will ensure that all remaining offspring animals are slaughtered and clear the way for the resumption of beef exports.

 When EU Ambassadors visited Drapchi prison on 4 May there was no evidence of any disturbances having occurred. Prisoners did not chant slogans. News of disturbances reached the Ambassadors only after their return to Beijing. We are very concerned about the reported deaths of prisoners and we have raised the incident with the Chinese authorities, both bilaterally and in conjunction with EU partners.

 Ministerial contacts with Belarus were suspended in 1997 by HMG and EU Partners following concerns about a constitutional referendum which failed to meet democratic norms, human rights abuses and lack of press freedom. EU member states have also withdrawn their Ambassadors from Minsk in response to the Belarusian Government's effective exclusion of certain Ambassadors from their residences. HMG are keen not to isolate Belarus. We continue to support the OSCE's Advisory and Monitoring Group's efforts to promote democracy in the country.

 We and the EU regard the 13th Supreme Soviet as the legitimate parliament. It was disbanded following the 1996 constitutional referendum which failed to meet democratic standards. In its place, the National Assembly was appointed which is not genuinely representative. However, National Assembly members are free to conduct their parliamentary duties. Together with our EU partners, HMG have regularly raised their concerns with Belarusian Ministers about the flawed constitutional situation and human rights abuses. The OSCE Advisory and Monitoring Group was set up in Minsk in February 1998. It helps Belarus to promote democracy and comply with OSCE commitments. HMG support its work and receive regular reports from the OSCE and the British Embassy in Minsk on the situation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81210w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jon Owen Jones: </B> 
 Government expenditure on agriculture in Wales was &#163;225.8 million, &#163;265.3 million and &#163;198.5 million in 1995-96, 1996-97 and 1997-98 respectively. The fall during 1997-98 is mainly accounted for by the reduction in expenditure on the EU's Sheep Annual Premium Scheme. This scheme provides for annual deficiency payments, measured in ECUs, on eligible breeding ewes. The reduced expenditure reflects both a strengthening of European sheep prices and the revaluation of the green pound.

 We shall include provisions to abolish the GP fundholding scheme in the Bill to modernise the NHS. Although a fundholding scheme must remain available until that Bill reaches Royal Assent, this need not take the form of the existing standard and community fundholding schemes. The Department is therefore about to consult the GP representative bodies on proposals to bring these existing arrangements to an end on 31 March 1999 and substitute a residual scheme. This residual scheme would meet the requirements of the current primary legislation, should that still be in force on 1 April 1999, while minimising any disruption to the development of Local Health Groups. No new primary legislation is needed to implement our plans to establish Local Health Groups as Committees of Health Authorities from 1 April 1999.

 The Department is presently in discussion with The Rebecca Trust concerning the condition of the retaining walls on either side of the cob at Porthmadog. Ownership of the walls above the A487 rests with the Trust. The Department's Agents, the North West Wales Trunk Road Agency, have been instructed to inspect the walls and consider possible strengthening schemes, which need to minimise traffic disruption. Some temporary closures may, however, be inevitable due to the narrowness of the A487 across the cob. Only on receipt of the strengthening proposals will the need for alternative routes be developed.

 <i>[holding answer 8 December 1998]:</i> First and foremost, the Government fund the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Commission for Racial Equality to advise all individuals on employment rights. More specifically, the DfEE has adopted a Race Equality Strategy committing it, in all its policies and programmes, actively to promote equality between all ethnic and racial groups. The key principles of the strategy are built into all Employment Service programmes, notably the New Deal. This programme is designed to take account of the particular needs of ethnic minorities, including Pakistani and Bangladeshi women, to ensure that ethnic minority young people have advice and support that meets their particular needs. The Employment Service issues multi-lingual publicity leaflets to publicise its programmes.
<P>

<a name="81210w13.html_para2">We also require Government-funded Training and Enterprise Councils to ensure that all sections (ie by ethnic group, gender and disability) of the eligible local population are fully represented on the programmes they run and the services they deliver. If not, the TEC must increase its participation by identifying and tackling whatever barriers exist to recruitment.
<P>

<a name="81210w13.html_para3">Following a recent Social Exclusion Unit report, the Government have set up an Action Team on jobs to look at the particular difficulties facing people from ethnic minorities looking for work and to identify better ways of helping into jobs people like Pakistani and Bangladeshi women, who face some of the toughest barriers to work. It will report to the SEU in July 1999.
<P>

<a name="81210w13.html_para4">Careers Services are also developing imaginative schemes to support ethnic minority women and prepare them to find suitable work. In Bradford, for example, Pakistani and Bangladeshi women are helped by the local Careers Service with information and advice, providing both reassurance and practical assistance, eg with language, to support entry for daughters onto work experience schemes. The local Careers Service also operates a mentoring scheme which draws upon the skills of experienced Pakistani and Bangladeshi community members to train and support young people into jobs.

 The Budget contained a number of measures to help ensure that work pays, including the Working Families Tax Credit and reform to National Insurance Contributions.

In addition, the Welfare to Work programme will, through the New Deal, help people to make the move from welfare into work.

However, unanimity amongst Member States is required and there was no consensus for change. The Government are continuing to consider the arrangements which should apply after 30 June 1999.

 <i>[holding answer 3 December 1998]:</i> The table shows estimated average gains arising from the introduction of Working Families Tax Credit for those eligible for the credit. The overall average gain including childcare costs is estimated to be &#163;17.20 per week. Individual decile gains do not include gains arising from the changes to the treatment of childcare costs in Working Families Tax Credit or other behavioural changes arising from the introduction of the credit, as they can not be reliably apportioned across deciles.

Section 14.20-24 from the <i>1998 National Accounts Concepts, Sources and Methods</i> describes these adjustments, and I enclose a copy of this.
