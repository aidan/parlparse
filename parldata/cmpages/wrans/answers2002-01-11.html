To ask the President of the Council what assessment he has made of the reasons for the difference between the final voted departmental expenditure limit and provisional outturn for financial year 2000&#150;01, as listed in the Treasury document, Public Expenditure 2000&#150;01: Provisional Outturn, for Vote XIII, subsection 4 House of Commons: Members' Salaries; and if he will make a statement.  [24117]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20111w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Robin Cook: </B> 
 The figure included in "Public Expenditure 2000&#150;01" was a misprint. Full details of outturn against 2000&#150;01 provision will be published in the appropriation accounts to be presented to the House by 31 January.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20111w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Robin Cook: </B> 
 The decision rests with the Prime Minister. The membership of the House of Lords, including that of non-party political peers, is kept under on-going review.

<P>
<a name="20111w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Robin Cook: </B> 
 I understand that all unsuccessful applicants were informed that they could renominate themselves, should they choose to do so. Their existing nomination is not carried forward, but there is nothing to stop someone reapplying.

<P>
<a name="20111w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Robin Cook: </B> 
 I understand that the report which the House of Lords Appointments Commission published alongside its first list of names in April 2001 made clear that they wanted to encourage more high-quality nominations from women, and from other regions of the country outside of the south-east. The commission has also made clear that its wishes to continue receiving outstanding nominations from ethnic minorities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20111w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Ian Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will bring forward measures to increase the severity of sentences of people convicted of serious sexual crimes.  [24131]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20111w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 Under the broad review of sentencing that began in July 2001, we are looking at tougher determinate sentences for sex offenders that will ensure they stay in prison, up to the full term if necessary, so long as they continue to present a risk of harm to our communities and that they are subject to strict and extended supervision on release. We are also looking at a requirement that where a life sentence is an option judges should not shy away from using it if the professional evidence shows that there is a clear risk that the offender will commit further sex offences. We want greater clarity and transparency, with indeterminate sentences given to serious offenders where appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20111w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Fallon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many complaints have been reported in his Department under paragraph 11 of the civil service code since 13 May 1999, and how many of them related to special advisers.  [25336]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20111w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Blunkett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 January 2002]:</i> In line with section 11 of the code, there are arrangements in place which allow civil servants in the main Home Office and its agencies to raise any matter of concern in confidence with their line managers, in the first instance, or thereafter with one of several nominated officials. It is not possible to provide a figure for the number of these complaints as there is no requirement for managers to report to the centre those which are resolved within the management line, nor is a central record kept of complaints raised direct with nominated officials.

<a name="20111w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Home Office Drug Strategy Directorate is currently developing, with partners, a strategy for tackling the issue of drug misuse in the workplace. One of the proposed outcomes is the production of definitive guidance to employers, in all sectors, of best practice in managing drug issues in workplace settings. The strategy will aim to include a balanced view on the comparative worth of drug testing as a tool for employers, and cover each of the drugs specified in the question. The current intention is to publish the guidance during the financial year 2002&#150;03 and make it widely available.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20111w01.html_spnew10"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 There are acute shortages of food and other basic supplies in Zimbabwe as a result of misgovernment. During the last six months DFID has provided &#163;4 million in essential drug supplies, and &#163;4 million for non-governmental supplementary feeding programmes&#151;targeting vulnerable children in particular. The UN has now developed a humanitarian assistance programme to help an estimated one million people. I have agreed to provide a further &#163;6 million for this programme, supporting World Food Programme feeding activities, and helping the World Health Organisation to maintain essential medical supplies. In all of these programmes, special consideration has been given to delivery mechanisms to ensure that those in need benefit regardless of their tribal or political affiliations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20111w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what estimate he has made of the annual cost of giving individual injections in place of the MMR vaccine; what the time interval required between such 



<P>
<P><I>11 Jan 2002 : Column: 1032W</I><P>
individual injections would be; and what estimate he has made of the vulnerability of children to particular diseases within the time gaps;  [7109]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many representations he has received from <i>(a)</i> members of the medical profession and <i>(b)</i> members of the public about the policy of the NHS in providing MMR as opposed to individual injections.  [7110]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20111w01.html_spnew11"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Separate measles, mumps and rubella vaccines in place of MMR have never been recommended by the Government's independent expert advisory committees on immunisation. As a result, no estimates have been made of the cost of giving separate vaccines. Cost is not an issue in decisions over MMR immunisation.
<P>

<a name="20111w01.html_para0">We are not aware of any studies that have looked at the relative merits of possible time gaps between separate measles, mumps and rubella vaccines. The researcher who first put this suggestion forward has stated that a gap of "at least a year" should be left between each vaccine. However, there is no scientific evidence to support this suggestion.
<P>

<a name="20111w01.html_para1">The risk to an individual child of contracting one or more of the diseases MMR protects against as a result of having separate vaccines rather than MMR will vary in different parts of the country. The risk will increase the longer a child is left unprotected. The unborn child of a pregnant women who is not immune to rubella will also be at increased risk from disease should the pregnant woman come into contact with an unimmunised individual.
<P>

<a name="20111w01.html_para2">There have been several hundred representations from members of the public about MMR. It is not possible to say how many are from the medical profession. The British Medical Association and the Royal Colleges who represent members of medical positions support our policy on MMR.

<a name="20111w02.html_para0">A special payment scheme (The Macfarlane Trust) for those infected with HIV through national health service blood products was set up in 1988. We have also set up a multi-disciplinary steering group to assist in the development of a strategic approach to hepatitis C as a public health issue. As a result, we will be publishing a consultation paper early this year.

 Figures for amounts of assessed and collectible tax as at the end of each accounting year (31 October) are available in the Inland Revenue's annual reports for years up to October 1998, in Table 1 of Appendix 1.
<P>

<a name="20111w02.html_para2">The figures for uncollected tax represent net tax charged but not paid as at the accounting date, and are a snapshot of the position at the date of the account. Most of the tax uncollected at the balance of each account is subsequently collected, and most of the amount outstanding attracts an interest charge.

Prior to hunting every participant has signed and dated a certificate of compliance with these conditions in the form required by DEFRA in respect of himself and any horse, quad bike, bicycle or other vehicle which he proposes to be used in the hunt and this certificate has been passed to the hunt chairman, master or other responsible person for the retention for at least six months after the expiry of the permit and that all such certificates shall be made available on demand to an inspector;

<a name="20111w05.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Andrew Turner: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what proportion of agricultural producer support in <i>(a)</i> the EU, <i>(b)</i> the UK and <i>(c)</i> England is met by (i) direct subsidy, (ii) price support, (iii) import charges, (iv) export refunds and (v) intervention.  [26648]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20111w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The OECD produces annual estimates of agricultural producer support in OECD countries, called Producer Support Estimate (PSE). Their most recent provisional estimate for the EU shows that in 2000 about 40 per cent. of agricultural producer support is derived from direct subsidies. The remainder of the producer support is a result of market support measures (import charges, export refunds and intervention) and it is not possible to estimate the effect of these measures separately.
<P>

<a name="20111w05.html_para5">My latest estimates for the UK for 2000 indicate that about 45 per cent. of UK agricultural producer support is a result of direct subsidies, with the remainder resulting from CAP market support measures. The estimates for England are similar to the UK figure.

<P>

<a name="20111w06.html_para0">The new definition establishes a common basis for declaring meat content of products within the European Community and will provide consumers with more transparent and consistent information about the meat products they buy.
<P>

<a name="20111w06.html_para1">The Food Standards Agency consulted the main stakeholders twice during the negotiation of the Commission directive. Although the new definition is more restrictive than the existing one in the United Kingdom, it is not intended that it should change current manufacturing practices of meat products. Some technical amendments will be required to the UK's Meat Products and Spreadable Fish Products Regulations, which lay down reserved descriptions and a minimum meat content in certain products such as sausages and burgers, to take account of the new definition. A consultation process on these amendments has already begun, and amended regulations will be prepared this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps she has taken to improve surveillance measures on imports of Belgian beef in order to ensure the prevention of specified risk material entering the UK.  [23058]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20111w06.html_spnew2"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20111w06.html_para2">Specified risk material, in the form of spinal cord, has been found in carcase beef imported from Belgium on two occasions, both during November 2001. The beef came from two different Belgian plants, and in each case only a small proportion of the total consignment of carcase beef was involved. The Food Standards Agency (FSA), which is responsible for food safety matters in the United Kingdom, informed the Belgian authorities promptly about these incidents, asking them to investigate and to notify the FSA of the action being taken to prevent a recurrence. On each occasion the FSA also notified the European Commission.
<P>

<a name="20111w06.html_para3">As meat is part of the single European market, beef from another European Union member state is not subject to border inspection controls. But it is subject to checks at the meat plant of destination within the United Kingdom. In April 2001, the FSA instructed the Meat Hygiene Service to check every consignment of imported carcase beef arriving at licensed meat plants in Great Britain. Similar advice was given to local authorities, and in Northern Ireland. This policy remains current practice.

 Redundancies can have a devastating effect on local economies, especially where they occur in an area of high unemployment or the local economy is largely dependent on one industry. We are introducing the rapid response service so as to reduce the impact of large-scale redundancy on the whole community. The service offers a coherent response tailored to need and will help those affected by redundancy to make the transition to sustainable new jobs offering opportunities for progression.
<P>

<a name="20111w06.html_para6">The service is already helping people who have lost their jobs at Viasystems. Following the announcement of redundancies, rapid response funding of &#163;202,000 was secured to provide help with training and resettlement. In the light of the company being placed in receivership additional measures were introduced to provide support for the redundant workers, including a telephone helpline for information on jobs, training and benefits. Additional staff from Employment Service, South Tyneside metropolitan borough council, Learning and Skills Council, North Tyneside council and local colleges ran sessions aimed at providing advice and counselling for redundant employees. Advice sessions have been held at local community centres which were attended by over 100 people. A further event with training providers and employers was held at Jarrow jobcentre on 20 October and attended by over 70 people and redundant workers were also invited to an employment fair at the South Shields families day on 23 October.

The 12 pilots are all fully operational and are due to run until 2002&#150;03.

 People who provide fostering services are not treated as being in full-time work for benefit purposes and are able to claim income support and jobseeker's allowance in the normal way. Payments received from the local authority in respect of fostering are fully disregarded in calculating entitlement to these benefits. Nor are such payments taxable if they just cover the basic cost of looking after the child. These arrangements are intended to act as incentives for people to provide this type of service.

 There are no plans at present to allow credit card payments due to the fact that finance companies levy about a 3 per cent. surcharge for such transactions. Neither the Concessionaire (Severn River Crossing plc) nor the Government are currently prepared to fund this surcharge. However, the Concessionaire and the Government will continue to review this position.

 Provision of information to consumers on the fuel economy and CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions performance of passenger cars is an important element of the Government's policy for reducing CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions. Provision of fuel economy labels on new passenger cars and of general information on fuel economy at the point of sale has been a requirement under UK law since the mid 1980's. From 21 November 2001 the UK implemented a new EU directive which, besides making changes to the format and content of information to be provided on cars at point of sale, also requires CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions to be displayed.

The figures for the number of supported residents are the actual numbers reported by authorities to the Department of Health rather than estimates. The figure for March 2001 is the latest available.

<a name="20111w09.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 The methodology underpinning the standard spending assessment (SSA) formulae has been unchanged since 1999&#150;2000. The formula for residential services was changed in 1999&#150;2000 so that it is based on the elderly population in private households (prior to this it was based on the total resident population). The population in private households excludes the population that is already in institutional care. Some residents that are in residential care in each authority area are funded by other authorities. If they were included in the formula, they would count towards the authority in which they are placed, even though another authority is bearing the cost.
<P>

<a name="20111w09.html_para8">Other arguments that have been made in favour of the change are that the research on which the formula is based considered the characteristics of those in private households about to enter care (and not those already in care), and that the formula should therefore be on the same basis. The number of people in residential care in an authority is also partly dependent on local policy variation, and an objective formula should not reflect this.
<P>

<a name="20111w09.html_para9">In estimating the relative number of potential supported residents in each area, the formula gives more weight to elderly people aged 85 plus and aged 75&#150;84 than those aged 65&#150;74. The formula also takes account of differences in deprivation between areas. The following indicators have been used since 1998&#150;99:

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20111w09.html_para10">In 1997&#150;98 the formula only used indicators of rented accommodation, limiting long-term illness, and a measure of independent sector provision.
<P>

<a name="20111w09.html_para11">The White Paper "Strong Local Leadership&#151;Quality Public Services" sets out our assessment of the effectiveness of the SSA system. Our assessment focuses on systemic weakness that apply to all authorities rather than issues for individual authorities or groupings of authorities. We have concluded that there are significant limitations, including complexity and the use of SSAs as a measure of "spending need". That is why we have decided to replace SSAs with a new formula-based approach that will be fairer and more intelligible. These new formulae will take effect in 2003&#150;04. We are actively working with local government to develop the new system, and a number of research projects have been set in hand in order to inform the work. This includes a project commissioned by the Department of Health from the University of Kent in order to look at the possibility of a single formula for elderly domiciliary and residential care.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what resources were allocated, per head, to meet the needs of the elderly population in each local authority area in England in the latest year for which figures are available.  [25851]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20111w09.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 DTLR allocates grant to local authorities based on the standard spending assessment (SSA) formulae. There are two SSA formulae focused on the needs of elderly people: the formula for elderly residential and the formula for domiciliary social services. Details of each authority's elderly domiciliary and residential SSA per person aged over 65 have been placed in the Libraries of the House. The figures are for the provisional local government finance settlement for 2002&#150;04.
<P>

<a name="20111w09.html_para12">There are other services provided by local government to elderly people, including cultural and leisure services. These other formulae are based on figures for the population as a whole, and it is not possible to identify an element specific to the elderly without making crude assumptions.
<P>

<a name="20111w09.html_para13">It should be noted that the SSAs are not equal to the actual level of grant provided to local authorities by central Government. This is a lower figure that recognises authorities ability to raise resources through council tax and their share of national non-domestic rates. The actual level of general grant support provided for individual services is not identified, and is a matter for individual authorities to decide.

 Our guidance to authorities on Local Transport Plans (LTPs) made clear that plans must include a set of indicators for measuring performance against targets and other outputs which can be used to assess whether the LTP is delivering its stated objectives. Local authorities determine the precise package of indicators and targets which best reflect their local circumstances and although such indicators are not formally agreed by the Department they should reflect relevant national targets where they exist. Authorities are required to provide annual progress reports (APRs) in which to report on how their LTPs are being implemented and the progress in working towards the locally established objectives, national and local targets and other outputs.
<P>

<a name="20111w10.html_para4">The allocation of capital resources is determined through an assessment of the LTPs and APRs which authorities submitted.

 No. The Department for Education and Skills does not recommend or endorse individual resources.

The Learning and Skills Act 2000 places a statutory responsibility on head teachers and governors in devising a school's sex education policy to protect their pupils from inappropriate teaching and materials.

 According to official figures from the Tribunal (ICTY), of those indictees currently in The Hague, 10, including Slobodan Milosevic, have been

<P><I>11 Jan 2002 : Column: 1070W</I><P>
arrested and transferred by governments and 15 have surrendered voluntarily. In addition, 18 individuals who were the subject of the NATO Stabilisation Force (SFOR)'s 26 operations to date (14 of which have involved British troops) remain in detention.
<P>

<a name="20111w12.html_para2">Full co-operation with the ICTY is an international obligation. The Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary raised this issue directly with FRY President Kostunica and Croatian President Mesic during official visits to London in late 2001, and we have also discussed it with the political leaders of Bosnia. We have made it clear that the transfer of all remaining indictees, including Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and Aute Gotovina must be accelerated in 2002.
