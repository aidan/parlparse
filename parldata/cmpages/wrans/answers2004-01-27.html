<P>
<P>
<a name="40127w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General how many cases the Crown Prosecution Service has prosecuted on Merseyside that concern domestic violence which have been pursued by the police as primary complainant without the corroboration of the individual assaulted.  [150145]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40127w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service does not routinely collect data that show the nature of the evidence on which a domestic violence case proceeds. CPS Policy Directorate is currently analysing the results of a national snapshot survey of cases finalised in December 2003. This will provide some information about the point raised by the hon. Member with regard to cases finalised in December 2003. Until CPS case-tracking systems are fully computerised, the detailed information requested could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<a name="40127w01.html_spmin1"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Serious Fraud Office's (SFO) statistical information is recorded by financial year (5 April to 4 April). Since 5 April 2003, the SFO has convicted 19 out of 29 defendants, a conviction rate of 66 per cent. The conviction rate since the inception of the SFO in April 1988 is 70 per cent. (403 convictions from 575 defendants).

<a name="40127w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Future Carrier (CVF) programme is currently in Stage 3 of the Assessment Phase, which is due to continue until spring 2004.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40127w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B>

<a name="40127w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Caplin  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 26 January 2004]:</i> The number of man training days available to the volunteer reserves varies by Service, category of reserve, unit role, level of readiness, and individual trade or specialism. In each of the last five years all volunteer reservists have had enough man training days available to qualify for bounty.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence whether Royal Navy Sea King helicopters engaged in military action in the Gulf in March 2003 were supplied with <i>(a)</i> night vision equipment and <i>(b)</i> night flying aids.  [150991]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40127w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 26 January 2004]:</i> Night Vision Goggles (NVG) can be operated only in aircraft that have been specifically modified for this role. Naval helicopters are fitted to allow operation with NVG according to their tactical role in operations. Of the 20 Royal Navy Sea King helicopters deployed to the Gulf, the 10 amphibious assault helicopters were fitted with NVG, as their operational role required.
<P>

<a name="40127w01.html_para1">Aircrews are fully trained to fly at night without NVG under normal operating procedures. Safety is provided by a variety of other aids and by individual action. These include: operating procedures such as, air traffic control, awareness of hazards through radar detection, communications, lighting and lookout.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40127w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence has no centralised system for monitoring and recording the health status of Service and ex-Service personnel. However, over 3,220 veterans of the 1990&#150;91 Gulf Conflict have been seen at the Gulf Veterans' Medical Assessment Programme (GVMAP) to date. At the time they were seen, none had been diagnosed with osteoporosis. There are currently no data relating to the incidence of osteoporosis in those who served in Operation Telic.

 I refer the hon. Member to the answer on 6 January 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> column 249W, and on 20 January 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1186W.
<P>

<a name="40127w01.html_para2">The Department's Veterinary Endemic Diseases and Zoonoses Division (VEDZD) advise the badger licensing authorities in Defra's Rural Development Service and in English Nature, on potential bovine tuberculosis disease transmission risks associated with badger relocations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the status is of <i>(a)</i> the Independent Science Group and <i>(b)</i> the TB Forum in relation to the control of TB; what requirement there is for her to (i) abide by and (ii) consider the advice of these organisations; and whether these organisations can veto proposals made by her Department.  [150543]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40127w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB is an advisory NDPB. Its primary objective is to oversee the design and analysis of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial. Its complete Terms of Reference can be accessed on the Defra website.
<P>

<a name="40127w01.html_para3">The TB Forum aims to bring together experts and organisations with an interest in the Government's policy on bovine TB, to consider new measures which might be taken to control the disease in cattle.

column 217W, how many closed herds where disease prevention measures have been judged by her officials to be adequate have suffered TB breakdowns in the last 10 years.  [150551]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40127w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Defra does not keep a record of which herds are closed and definitions of a 'closed' herd vary. Defra keeps a record of cattle births and deaths, and their movements from known locations in England, Scotland and Wales. Were a 'closed' herd to be very strictly defined, it would be possible to identify closed herds from records of holdings that only register births and deaths, but have no animal movements on. However, this could be done only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40127w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Badgers are known to excavate and eat the nests of bumble bees and have the potential to exert an influence on the abundance of the bees locally.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40127w02.html_spnew2"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Low farmgate prices for milk have caused considerable problems over the last few years and the dairy sector faces considerable problems in adjusting to the new conditions that will be created by a reformed common agricultural policy. The Government recognise these difficulties, but believe that the UK dairy sector has a sustainable future and will work alongside the industry to facilitate and support its development in line with its "Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food". The UK has a comparative advantage in terms of climate, farm efficiency and size over many of its competitors. If the dairy supply chain can work together to maximise this potential and address some of the difficulties it faces, then there is no reason why it should not succeed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the impact on imports of bananas from Commonwealth nations in islands around Jamaica arising from the decision of the Law Lords on the EU regulations relating to the shape of bananas.  [147013]<P>
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what difference there is in mortality rates in round fish escaping through diamond mesh compared with square mesh.  [149131]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40127w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Experiments to compare the mortality among fish escaping from diamond mesh codends, square mesh codends and diamond mesh codends fitted with square mesh panels have been inconclusive. This is because the techniques used were at an early stage in development. No significant difference in mortality for cod or any other gadoid was evident between the different gears.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40127w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Cod feed opportunistically on many species of invertebrates (e.g. worms, molluscs, brittle stars, crabs, shrimps and prawns) and fish (e.g. whiting, cod, haddock, Norway pout, plaice, dab, sprat, herring, and sandeel). Haddock feed similarly on a wide range of invertebrates and a rather narrower range of fish. In young gadoids, invertebrates predominate, but as fish become older the amount of fish in their diet increases. Diets vary very considerably in detail from one place, season or year to another. Cod and haddock may concentrate on one or two individual prey species when these are very abundant, but when such prey become scarce, cod in particular can move and switch from one species to another.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the scientific expectancy is of fish stock improvement in the North sea following the 10 per cent. cut in the sandeel quota.  [146681]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40127w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The provisions on North sea sandeels agreed at the December Council of Ministers include not only the reduced quota for 2004 but also new effort regulations to improve management of the stock. Sandeels are short-lived, and the state of the sandeel stock itself is very dependent upon this year's "recruitment" of young. Consequently we welcome both the quota and effort restrictions. We attach importance to the effective management of this fishery, and will continue to seek further improvements.
<P>

<a name="40127w02.html_para4">However, the sandeel fishery does affect other fisheries. It does this through the by-catch of other commercial fish (such as haddock and whiting), and through the removal of fish which are prey to other larger fish. Some by-catch is allowed for in the agreed quotas, and ICES reports that the remaining by-catch is small. A reduction in the sandeel fishery was also found to have little effect on the availability of prey to other fish. To sum up, the evidence does not suggest that the sandeel restrictions will have a significant effect on our roundfish stocks, but what effect there is should be to their benefit. However, we do not think that this is the last word on the subject and are continuing to undertake research on the effect of sandeel fisheries.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment her Department's scientists have made of the effect on cod fisheries in the North sea of heavy exploitation of sandeels.  [149136]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40127w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Exploiting sandeels could potentially affect cod through the food chain, or through the by-catch of cod in the sandeel fishery. Work is still in progress on these questions. On the food chain issue, 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jan 2004 : Column 251W</I><P>
large scale stomach sampling by ICES shows that cod feed on a wide range of prey species, and that for the North sea as a whole sandeels account for 5&#150;15 per cent. of the diet of cod aged two years and older. At the North sea level, sandeel shortages tend to be short lived, and have not yet been shown to be critical for cod, but the question of more local effects needs further study. On the by-catch issue, small-meshed sandeel fishing occurs in some areas where early stages of cod may settle onto the sea bed, but sampling results officially reported to ICES indicate that the cod by-catch in sandeel landings is very low.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40127w02.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The capacity of fishing vessels is measured both in terms of their tonnage and in terms of their engine power. Engine power is recorded as kilowatts. The ceilings on the overall size of the fleets of each EU member state are defined as separate limits on tonnage and engine power.
<P>

<a name="40127w02.html_para5">For the purpose of licence transfers in the UK the Vessel Capacity Unit is currently used. This is a measure of vessel capacity which is solely related to the physical dimensions of a vessel and its engine power:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>VCU = length (m) x breadth (m) + 0.45 x power (KW)</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="40127w02.html_para6">It is thus possible that two vessels of the same tonnage could have different capacities when calculated under this method if there are differences in length, breadth or engine power. The Fisheries Departments in the UK are reviewing the present capacity penalty arrangements with the intention of moving to a system based on tonnage and engine power rather than VCUs.

 Last year the Milk Development Council commissioned a study by KPMG on "Prices and Profitability in the British Dairy Chain" which highlighted a number of areas where the operation of the dairy supply chain might contribute to low farmgate prices in the UK, including the structure of the UK industry, the low value of the product mix and the low level of product innovation within the UK compared with some member states.

 The fluctuations in the farmgate price of milk over the last 20 years are caused by a number of factors, including the level of supplies, demand on EU and world markets and exchange rates. However, none of these factors are sufficient to explain why UK farmgate prices have been constantly below the EU average with the exception of a few years after deregulation of the milk market in 1994. This question was examined by KPMG in its report on "Prices and Profitability in the GB Supply Chain", which was commissioned by the Milk Development Council and published last year. The Report concluded that low farmgate prices in the UK were largely the product the structure of the UK industry, the low value of the product mix and the low level of product innovation within the UK compared with some Member States. The Report also identified a number of areas where farmgate prices could be improved by increasing supply chain efficiency, through rationalisation or through benchmarking.

In addition a proportion of the 313 tonnes of active ingredient sold in products authorised for use in more than one species may also have been used in poultry, although it is not possible at this time to quantify this proportion. The figures also show that 250 tonnes of active ingredient of coccidiostats and 27 tonnes of growth promoters were sold.

 We have already reduced the number of asylum applications by half since October 2002, meeting the ambitious target set by my right hon. Friend, the Prime Minister. Current policy initiatives, such as juxtaposed controls in France and the deployment of detection technology at continental ports, are designed to prevent those who seek to circumvent our controls at specific ports of entry from doing so. Measures in the Asylum and Immigration Bill currently before Parliament&#151;for example, measures aimed at those who deliberately destroy their documents to obstruct the processing of their case&#151;will help deter unfounded claims. Together, these measures will reduce overall numbers still further.

 Accommodation centres will be introduced on a trial basis with a total capacity of up to 3,000 places during the trial period.

 The current legislation requires that, with the exception of families including children under the age of 18, support for asylum seekers whose claims are unsuccessful must end once a final decision is made on the asylum claim. Families continue to receive support until they leave or fail to comply with directions for their removal. Unsuccessful asylum seekers are expected to leave the country but, where this is not possible due to circumstances entirely beyond the person's control, they may be provided with accommodation under section 4 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.

In addition, families whose asylum claims appear to be capable of being decided quickly may be detained as part of a fast-track process.
<P>

<a name="40127w05.html_para5">The detention of families with children is subject to rigorous and frequent review by a central unit within the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND). Where detention is for the purpose of effecting the removal of the family concerned its continuation will be authorised only where it is clear that there is a realistic prospect of removal within a reasonable period of time and that satisfactory progress is being made towards removal. If these criteria are not met, further detention is unlikely to be authorised. In the majority of such cases, detention will last for just a few days immediately prior to removal. For those cases where, exceptionally, detention for a longer period is necessary we have introduced a system whereby the detention of any family with children beyond 28 days is subject to Ministerial authority and review. In addition, a senior IND official has been appointed to oversee all detained family cases to ensure that there are no administrative barriers to speedy case progression.

 The general needs of children are considered when a decision to detain a family is made and when the family is taken into detention.

<P>

<a name="40127w05.html_para8">Families with children are currently detained at either Dungavel or Tinsley House Removal Centres or Oakington Reception Centre. In all cases they are accommodated in dedicated family rooms within the centre so as to ensure that family members are not separated and, so far as practicable within the constraints of detention, are able to maintain family life.

<P>

<a name="40127w05.html_para9">At Dungavel, where there is a well-established education provision for school-age children, all children are assessed when they arrive to establish their learning needs.

 Removal centres that may hold families with children for anything more than a few days are required to have arrangements in place to provide educational classes to the children concerned.

Classes run every day throughout the week for all school age children. A range of subjects is covered including English, maths, science, food technology and history. Music and art are also provided. The position at Oakington is different in that the need for educational provision has arisen only comparatively recently and is in the process of being developed.

 Recorded crime figures include statistics on drugs offences, such as possession, and on acquisitive crimes, such as burglary, but do not record whether the latter are related to an offender's drug habits.
<P>

<a name="40127w06.html_para3">The NEW-ADAM research programme of interviewing and drug testing those arrested by the police sheds some light on the links between drugs and crime, although the conclusions do not relate specifically to Lancashire and the North West region. Data from eight locations (1999&#150;2000) indicated that more than three-fifths (by value) of acquisitive crime was committed by users of both heroin and cocaine/crack.

<a name="40127w06.html_para5">Estimates of the costs of drug-related crime are not available annually or broken down by region. However, a recent study published by the Home Office provides estimates of the total economic and social costs of Class A drug use and puts these in the range of &#163;10.1 to &#163;17.4 billion for the year 2000. These costs include the costs of drug-related crime, which are estimated to fall in the range &#163;8.8 to &#163;15.8 billion. The costs of drug-related crime include victim costs and those accruing to courts, prisons and other parts of the criminal justice system.

<P>
<a name="40127w06.html_spnew6"><B> Beverley Hughes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 January 2004]</i>: Research conducted by University College London for the Home Office, published in June last year ("The impact of EU enlargement on migration flows", Home Office On-Line Report 25/03), estimates that the numbers of people expected to migrate to the UK from the new member states in the years following enlargement will not be significant. The research corroborates a number of other independent studies, which have been summarised in reports by the European Commission in 2000 and the former Department for Education and Employment in 1999. It is based in part 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jan 2004 : Column 265W</I><P>
on experience of previous EU enlargements, where the large increases in migration flows predicted before enlargement did not materialise.
<P>

<a name="40127w06.html_para7">None of this research has been able to predict exact numbers expected from specific countries or ethnic groups to the UK. However, Roma would have been included in the overall numbers.
<P>

<a name="40127w06.html_para8">Citizens of the new member states who come to the UK will work, contribute to the economy, and pay taxes. The Habitual Residence Test will ensure that no one can simply come here and claim benefits. Powers to deport are available where non-British EU citizens commit offences.
<P>

<a name="40127w06.html_para9">Enlargement should also improve the quality of life for all citizens in the new member states as their governments must enforce human rights and minority rights, including protection against racial discrimination, to EU standards before accession and subsequently. EU accession should also improve economic prospects in the new member states so reducing the incentive for economic migration.
<P>

<a name="40127w06.html_para10">If, contrary to the available evidence, there is a large influx of workers posing a real threat to UK jobs, we will be able to re-introduce restrictions. We will of course be monitoring the situation closely.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="40127w06.html_para11">There are a number of reasons why, in the past, the collection of fines has not been as effective as it should have been. They include: imposing fines that do not reflect the ability to pay due to lack of information on offenders' income/expenditure; lack of information on offenders' current whereabouts; and a lack of an alternative for those who genuinely cannot pay.
<P>

<a name="40127w06.html_para12">This is being addressed through the seven point action plan I announced in June last year, the Courts Act 2003 measures, and the overall enforcement programme being taken forward by the Department for Constitutional Affairs. These are specifically designed to tackle the root causes of non-collection and secure sustained improvement in fine enforcement performance.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many <i>(a)</i> prosecutions and <i>(b)</i> convictions there have been in the last five years for the offence of theft of <i>(a)</i> controlled drugs and <i>(b)</i> time-expired pharmaceuticals from sites disposing of NHS waste.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40127w07.html_spnew1"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 Where more than one offence involving obligatory endorsement is committed on the same occasion, the total number of penalty points to be attributed is the number that the most serious offence would attract. Two or more offences committed on the same day but not on the same occasion would attract points separately. It would be for the police, the Crown Prosecution Service and courts to decide whether the different offences amounted to separate incidents or whether they were part of the same continuing incident.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40127w07.html_spnew5"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The Home Office will monitor the use of risk of sexual harm orders (RSHOs) but, as was stated in the response to the Home Affairs Committee's report on the Sexual Offences Act 2003, we do not feel that there is any need for the number of such orders to be reported annually to Parliament. In common with the other civil preventative orders in Part 2 of the Act, statistics will be collected on the number of RSHOs taken out each year and this information will be available if requested.

 We have no plans to introduce a specific visa requirement for those seeking entry to engage in anti- trade union activities. However, the Immigration Rules contain provision for the refusal of entry to a person where it is judged that their presence in the United Kingdom is not conducive to the public good. This would allow for the refusal of a person where their character, conduct or associations made their entry undesirable.

 The information requested is as follows:
<P>

<a name="40127w09.html_para2"><i>Inland Revenue</i>
<P>

<a name="40127w09.html_para3">There is a full right of access for audit (including National Audit Office) and security interest across the whole of the Inland Revenue and the IT supplier. This enables the reviewing bodies to fully cover any area of risk as determined by their work planning processes.
<P>

<a name="40127w09.html_para4">All major new computer projects or enhancements have to provide an audit trail of all computer activity by users. IA monitors activity to detect potential fraud and misuse. There is a standard set of audit checks carried out over these developments in order to ensure compliance with all legal and departmental requirements and IA has a seat on the project steering committee to ensure appropriate consideration is given to audit findings.
<P>

<a name="40127w09.html_para5">IA has a specialised computer audit team of qualified professionals who carry out a programme of technical audits over the provision of IT services both hardware and software. They use an international computer audit standard (CoBIT) to risk assess the services and to measure provision against a set of detailed controls. All findings are reported to the responsible senior manager and followed up to ensure appropriate action.
<P>

<a name="40127w09.html_para6">Overall, IA and DSU have a direct reporting line to the Departmental Audit and Security Committee to raise issues that are high risk or that IA/DSU consider are not being addressed adequately by managers.
<P>

<a name="40127w09.html_para7">As already referred to, National Audit Office also carry out pieces of review activity across the Partnership and often work in joint teams with IA and/or DSU.
<P>

<a name="40127w09.html_para8"><i>HM Treasury</i>
<P>

<a name="40127w09.html_para9">The Treasury uses a combination of line management overview and procurement scrutiny to determine whether information technology hardware and software products are being used properly in the Department. These are supported by internal audit and security reviews wherever appropriate. Staff identified as making unacceptable use of IT will be subject to disciplinary procedures.




<P>
<P><I>27 Jan 2004 : Column 275W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40127w09.html_para10">There are two overarching controls over the use of IT in the Treasury: the Departmental IT strategy which sets the tone for the use of IT, and the annual Business Planning and Budget Planning round which subjects all proposals to high-level business scrutiny.
<P>

<a name="40127w09.html_para11">Further down the line, all IT purchases, whether hardware or software, are required to be supported by a business case to ensure that there is a formal requirement by the Department for the facilities. After implementation, the Treasury has guidelines (promulgated to all staff) on the acceptable use of information technology. Certain rules are enforced (e.g. construct and length of passwords and enforced screen savers) and firewalls are used to protect HMT systems from attack, to protect staff from unwanted correspondence (spam) and to disable unacceptable internet web access.
<P>

<a name="40127w09.html_para12">In general, line managers are responsible for enforcing the acceptable use of IT facilities provided to their staff. However, they have access to the resources of the departmental internal audit and security teams to investigate specific incidents. There are also more general internal audits of IT themes and running contract arrangements to ensure that processes are sound, efficient and effective. The Department is required to conform to Government security regulations and is subject to security audits to ensure that it remains compliant.
<P>

<a name="40127w09.html_para13"><i>HM Customs and Excise</i>
<P>

<a name="40127w09.html_para14">Guidance and standards are published covering the procurement, development and use of IT hardware and software. HM Customs and Excise has developed a single approach to the management of business change&#151;the Business Change Lifecycle. This covers all stages of IT system development and is aligned with the OGC Gateway Review process. It identifies the stages and products that must be produced to comply with the HMCE standards. Once implemented the use of hardware and software is controlled through security standards and acceptable use policy.
<P>

<a name="40127w09.html_para15">It is the responsibility of all managers to ensure that the IT systems provided to their staff are used in accordance with the guidance and standards, although additional assurance mechanisms are in place. Managers can call upon the services of our Internal Investigation Division to investigate specific incidents. Compliance is also monitored through an internal assurance programme which contributes to the annual Statement of Internal Control. Our Internal Audit Division also provides assurance over the operation of IT systems through their annual programme of audits. Systems are selected for examination based on a risk assessment, and take account of the significance and materiality to achieving the Department's business objectives. In addition, external audit is carried out by the NAO. Their audit programme includes IT security and specific controls for key systems.

 A Centre of Excellence was established within HM Treasury, Inland Revenue and HM Customs and Excise in June 2003 to integrate the essential functions which underpin the successful delivery of all types of acquisition based programmes and projects. As cost benefits will not accrue until improvements start to take effect, it is too early to measure cost savings. All Centres of Excellence are currently developing future plans and as part of this process measurement of savings will be defined.

In the meantime we are working closely with the MPS and have provided extra funding to establish from 1 April an MPS Operational Command Unit within the Parks to work alongside the RPC to ensure the Parks continue to be policed effectively.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40127w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 The rate of exchange for payments in overseas currency is determined by the UK banks responsible for the conversion. The rates offered on any one day may vary from bank to bank, and within each bank depending on the terms and conditions applicable to each customer. However, in view of the relative volume of payments to state pensioners resident overseas, it is unlikely that any bank would offer exactly the same terms and conditions to an occupational pension scheme as those agreed for the state scheme.
<P>

<a name="40127w10.html_para7">The bank responsible for converting overseas payments for occupational pension schemes administered by Capita Hartshead regularly monitors its rates against those offered by competitors, including those responsible for converting payments for other occupational pension schemes, to ensure it offers a competitive service.

We are currently in discussions with the Angolan Ministry of Finance on providing technical support so that Angola can develop and adopt legislation to implement the Initiative.
<P>

<a name="40127w10.html_para8">The UK is also supporting the World Bank's programme to promote greater transparency in the Angolan oil industry. Specifically, DFID is funding an oil expert to take part in the Bank's Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR). The results of this review should help clarify financial relationships between the Government, the Central Bank and the state oil company Sonangol. It will also make recommendations on how Angola can adopt transparent, internationally accepted practices in oil revenue management. Finally, the UK is demonstrating its commitment to strengthening Angolan civil society by supporting a coalition of national NGOs active in advocating on transparency issues including oil revenue management.
<P>

<a name="40127w10.html_para9">Greater fiscal transparency in Angola is only one element in ensuring that more public resources are spent on reducing poverty. With this in mind, DFID funded an economist to help prepare Angola's first ever three-year macro-economic framework which has since been incorporated into the recently published Angolan draft Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The macro-economic framework income is assisting the Government to plan spending increases in the social sectors.

 In recent months, reported numbers of malaria cases and malaria deaths have been close to the seasonal average.

 We have received a number of representations from MPs, Peers, non-governmental organisations and members of the public concerning restrictions on movement within and into the Occupied Territories for both Palestinians and foreign nationals. Palestinian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nabil Sha'ath, also raised his concerns about the impact of the fence, which contributes to curtailed freedom of movement, with the Foreign Secretary on 8 January.
<P>

<a name="40127w13.html_para1">We remain deeply concerned about the consequences for freedom of movement into and within the Occupied Territories for Palestinians and foreign nationals resulting from Israeli actions, including the imposition of curfews and closures, construction of the fence and introduction of access controls, including permits. We continue to call on the Government of Israel to do all it can to ease movement restrictions. We have raised the recently introduced entry regulations with the Israeli government and are exploring with our EU partners further avenues for doing so.

 We remain concerned about the political situation in Burma. Although the Burmese regime's plans for a National Convention are a step forward, the process needs to be inclusive and transparent, involving representatives from the democratic opposition and the ethnic groups. Convention participants must be allowed full freedom of speech, movement and political activity. As a first step Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and her NLD colleagues must be fully released and NLD offices re-opened.

 Under the EU Accession Treaty, nationals of Cyprus and Malta have the same rights to work in another member state as are currently enjoyed by nationals of the existing member states. However, nationals of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia ("the eight relevant states" are subject to transitional provisions.

<a name="40127w13.html_para4">Under the transitional arrangements, until 30 April 2006 member states are free to apply national measures or bilateral agreements restricting the rights of nationals from the eight relevant states to work in their country. From 1 May 2006, member states must either grant these nationals the right to move freely for the purpose of work in accordance with Community law, or continue to apply national measures or bilateral agreements. Any grant of this right may, however, be subject to suspensions if the member state undergoes or foresees disturbances to its labour market which could seriously threaten the standard of living or level of employment in a particular region or occupation Such suspensions may last, at the latest, until 30 April 2011.

<a name="40127w13.html_para5">In line with its announcement of December 2002, the Government intend to grant citizens of the eight relevant states the right to work freely in the UK labour market from 1 May 2004. Section 2 of the EU (Accessions) Act 2003 provides a power to make regulations to give effect to this decision. The Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000/2326), which currently implement Community law rights of European Economic Area (EEA) nationals to enter and reside in the UK, will be applied to nationals of the eight relevant states as they apply to nationals of the EEA.
<P>

<a name="40127w13.html_para6">From accession the Government will be monitoring the effect of their decision on the UK labour market. In the unexpected event of a large influx of workers to the UK, which seriously threaten the level of employment or standard of living in a particular region or occupation, there are safeguards available to re-impose restrictions on workers. The Government could, in the normal way, re-impose restrictions on some or all of the eight relevant states by repealing or suspending the application of any regulations made under the Act and could exclude nationals of one or more of the eight relevant states from the right to work in the UK under powers contained in the Act.

<P>
<a name="40127w14.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 We have made it clear that we are prepared to offer assistance with the dismantlement of Libyan programmes, but at this stage it is impossible to quantify what resources it may be necessary to commit. There are already a number of sources of funding for global co-operative threat reduction programmes. If it is necessary to allocate additional resources in order to assist Libya in the destruction of its weapons programmes we will do so, as we believe that money spent on reducing the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction is money well spent.

 We have had concerns for some time about Libya's nuclear programme and first raised the matter in the course of discussions with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in late 2001, and again in mid 2002. Libya is now in contact with the IAEA and it will be for Libya to make a national declaration providing the full details of its programme to the IAEA. The IAEA will then proceed to verify the extent and nature of Libya's covert nuclear activity. Only the IAEA, acting within its remit can underwrite Libya's commitment to stop this activity. We are working in close co-operation with both the Libyan authorities and the IAEA to move this process forward.

 All exports from least developed countries (LDCs), with the exception of arms, currently enjoy duty and quota free access to the European Union market under the Everything-but-Arms argument (EBA). Other G8 countries have similar but less extensive arrangements.

<a name="40127w16.html_para6">The Government fully support the commitment by the World Trade Organisation, made in the Doha Declaration in November 2001, to seek an agreement with 'the objective of duty-free, quota-free market access for products originating from LDCs', and the further commitment 'to consider additional measures for progressive improvements in market access for LDCs'. We encourage all members of the World Trade Organisation to deliver on that commitment.

<P>
<a name="40127w17.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 In order to consider public expenditure in the round, the Treasury does make projections of council tax yield for future years. These projections are based on a number of assumptions about changes in the council tax rate, the tax base, the collection rate and council tax benefit payments. It would be wrong for the Treasury to make a detailed forecast of council tax rates, as these are set by local authorities, not by the Government. The rate is therefore assumed to rise in line with past trend.

 The Government is acutely aware of the difficulties associated with shortages of good quality housing at an affordable price. A programme of action to address this, and to tackle poor condition housing and low demand and abandonment, was set out in "Sustainable Communities: Building for the Future", launched on 5 February 2003. The programme for affordable housing focuses on: improving the effectiveness of the planning system; the establishment of four growth areas to alleviate the overall housing pressures in London and surrounding areas; and targeted limitations on the right to buy. In addition Kate Barker, a member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, is carrying out a review of issues underlying the lack of supply and responsiveness of housing in the UK.

<a name="40127w18.html_para0">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has increased the funding for provision of additional affordable housing through the Housing Corporation's Approved Development Programme to around &#163;5 billion for the three years 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06; &#163;1 billion of this will be spent on housing for key workers.

 Ufi liaises with the 47 local Learning and Skills Councils to agree targets for the engagement through learndirect of different types of priority learners. This results in contracts between the local Learning and Skills Councils and their local learndirect hubs for the delivery of learndirect provision in their area. In year performance is monitored on a regular basis and a biannual review of hubs is undertaken to optimise the contribution of learndirect to local priorities.
<P>

<a name="40127w19.html_para5">There are also regular strategic reviews between Ufi Regional Directors and local Learning and Skills Councils (and other key local and regional partners) to assess and optimise the contribution of learndirect to the achievement of local skills development priorities.

A booking was taken for a boxing charity fund- raiser through the company Workham Marketing. Unfortunately the normal procedures for bookings were not followed in this case. When a senior official examined the detail of the booking it was found that Workham Marketing were representing the Countryside Alliance, a non- charitable campaigning organisation. Since finding this out the booking has been cancelled and all necessary refunds have been made. The only other dealings that the Royal Courts of Justice have had with Workham Marketing are enquiries about the availability of other dates. In operating the Wider Markets Initiative the Court Service is concerned to maintain the independence and neutrality of the courts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40127w20.html_spnew9"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Food Standards Agency advises that the risk to public health in the United Kingdom from BSE in third countries, including the United States, is minimised through the application of existing European Union rules. These require any such country exporting meat or live animals into the Community to have in place controls equivalent to those in the EU.
<P>

<a name="40127w20.html_para4">Imports of beef and beef products are permitted only if EU rules requiring the removal of specified risk material are met and veterinary certification of this is provided.
<P>

<a name="40127w20.html_para5">In recent years the UK has imported little beef from the US. This is because of unrelated controls designed to prevent exports from cattle that have been given growth-promoting hormones banned in the EU. Data from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs show that, since 2000, the UK has imported only around 80 tonnes of fresh or chilled bovine meat and around 1,800 tonnes of meat and offal preparations. In addition, since 1996 all meat and bone meal (MBM), a by-product of the rendering process, has been banned from use in feeding stuffs for all farmed livestock. It has also been banned as a fertiliser, except where used on non-agricultural land. Any MBM originating from the US could therefore not be used in the UK for this purpose.

<a name="40127w21.html_para9">The total number of suspected ADR reports received from UK sources between the start of 1999 and the end of 2003 in association with epoetin alfa was 44; the number associated with epoetin beta was 14. Both epoetin alfa and epoetin beta were implicated in 10 reports; therefore the total number of reports of red cell aplasia received in association with all epoetins was 48.
<P>

<a name="40127w21.html_para10">The cause of death was recorded as red cell aplasia in one case. This patient showed evidence of parvovirus B19 infection, which is a well-established cause of red cell aplasia. Therefore, there are reasonable grounds to doubt a causal association between the epoetin administered and the red cell aplasia that occurred in this case.
<P>

<a name="40127w21.html_para11">Two large studies are currently under way to investigate the apparent association between epoetins and red cell aplasia, including the incidence of red cell aplasia in patients treated with epoetins.
<P>

<a name="40127w21.html_para12">The epoetins available in the UK were authorised on the basis of data, including clinical trial data, that have demonstrated evidence of safety and efficacy in all licensed indications. All studies were assessed for evidence of potential unwanted effects that might be attributable to treatment. The number of patients exposed to treatment prior to grant of a Marketing Authorisation would not normally be large enough to permit the detection of very rare unwanted effects, which would usually only come to light as a result of post-marketing surveillance following the exposure of much larger numbers of patients, as was the case with red cell aplasia in association with epoetins.

 The proposals arising from the Darzi Review were referred to Ministers by the former South Durham and Weardale Community Health Council. These were subsequently approved for implementation in September 2002. To support the new model, the two trusts responsible for the management of the hospitals in Co. Durham and Darlington merged to form the County Durham and Darlington Acute Hospitals National Health Service Trust, with effect from 1 October 2002.

The guidance followed the publication, in March 2001, of the White Paper, 'Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century' (Cm 5086). 'Valuing People' set out our proposals for improving services for people with learning disabilities, their families and carers said that it would take a minimum of five years to make the changes it described.

 The Department of Health published "Improving Outcomes Guidance on Lung Cancer" in 1998. This guidance provides advice on how lung cancer services in the national health service should be organised to improve outcomes for lung cancer patients. It addresses the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer and recommends that a full range of diagnostic tests should be available within cancer services.
<P>

<a name="40127w23.html_para4">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence is also preparing clinical guidelines (advice on assessment and treatment of a condition) for the NHS on the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. The guideline will provide guidance on diagnosis including early diagnosis; key symptoms and signs upon which a patient should be referred; factors encouraging patients to present to healthcare services sooner; diagnostic methods; staging and the impact of lung cancer on a patient's activities, as well as the need to be referred to other health professionals if required. The guideline is expected to be published in November 2004.
<P>

<a name="40127w23.html_para5">In addition, in March 2000, Referral Guidelines for Suspected Cancer were published by the Department, and sent to all general practitioners in order to help them identify those patients who are most likely to have cancer, so that they can be referred urgently to a specialist. These guidelines include a chapter on lung cancer. NICE is in the process of updating these guidelines and the update is due to be published in February 2005.
<P>

<a name="40127w23.html_para6">The Department are aware of the potential benefits positron emission tomography (PET) scanning can offer patients with lung cancer, particularly in assessing the stage of the disease.

<a name="40127w25.html_para4">The Department and the FSA have jointly written to all public procurement bodies to help in achieving the reductions in salt intake as recommended by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition by focussing on the salt content of processed foods as part of their procurement processes.
<P>

<a name="40127w25.html_para5">The FSA has set salt targets&#151;to reduce average salt intake by 10 per cent., by 2005&#150;06 and in the long term, to reduce the average population intake by a third over the next five years&#151;bringing intakes down to the recommended six grams per day.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) for what reason sensory impairment does not feature on the list of priorities for research published on his Department's website;  [149704]
<P>
<UL>(2) for what reason none of the research and development work on assistive technology listed in his Department's statutory report that was laid before Parliament in November 2003 related to sensory impairment.  [149726]<P></UL>

<a name="40127w25.html_spnew4"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 January 2004]:</i> The report, published in November 2003, outlines a selection of the research and development activity relating to assistive technology funded by the Government in 2002. Full details of all the work funded are available on the Foundation for Assistive Technology website at www.fastuk.org. The website contains details of some twenty Government-funded projects related to sensory impairment that are current or were completed in 2003.
<P>

<a name="40127w25.html_para7">The report for 2001 contains sections on navigational aids for people with visual impairments and technologies to assist deaf and hearing-impaired people. 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jan 2004 : Column 334W</I><P>
Projects relating to sensory impairment will also be highlighted in the report for 2003. This will be laid before Parliament by July 2004.
<P>

<a name="40127w25.html_para8">The Department's website lists major strategic research developments in key Departmental priority areas, including cancer, mental health and coronary heart disease. In the national health service, research priorities are identified through widespread consultation with those using, delivering and managing services. They take account of the burden of disease, potential benefits and departmental objectives as well as the responsibilities and work of other funders&#151;including the charities. Current projects relating to sensory impairment include a &#163;0.3 million study of the acceptability, benefit and costs of early screening for hearing disability, and a &#163;0.8 million study of interventions for mild to moderate permanent childhood hearing impairments identified by neonatal hearing screening.

<i>Notes</i>:<P>

1. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) was created in June 2001. Due to the migration of businesses into and out of the newly forming Department, and differences in calculation methods, figures for the Department as a whole are only available from April 2002.<P>

2. The information in table 1 covers the years April 1999 to March 2002 relating to the former Department of Social Security (DSS), the main predecessor Department in place prior to the formation of DWP, and for DWP for April 2002 to March 2003.<P>

3. Figures have been provided for DSS and DWP for each full operational year since 1999. Sickness absence information for the current year, April 2003 to March 2004, will be available in spring 2004.<P>

4. The information in table 2 relates to the DWP businesses for the period April 2002 to March 2003.<P>

5. The number of working days lost and working days available recorded for the DWP businesses in table 2 do not match the total figures for DWP in table 1. This is because the figures in table 2 relate only to the current DWP businesses.<P>

<a name="40127w27.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what the cost would be of increasing the upper age limit on claiming disability living allowance to (i) 70, (ii) 75 and (iii) 80 years; what estimate he has made of the likely number of beneficiaries; and what take-up assumptions are made in this calculation.  [150450]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40127w27.html_spnew8"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 The requested information is not available. The effect of increasing the upper age limit for claims to Disability Living Allowance would be to enable people aged 65 and over to claim and qualify for the mobility component and the lowest rate care component of the allowance. Entitlement to these and the other components of the allowance can be reliably established after a claim has only been made and the mobility and care needs of the customer assessed. There are no reliable data available on which estimates could be made of the number of people aged 65 and over who might be entitled to either the mobility component or the lowest rate care component of Disability Living Allowance if they were to make a claim. The higher and middle rate care components of Disability Living Allowance have the same entitlement conditions as Attendance Allowance which is available to people aged 65 and over when they claim help with their disability-related extra costs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what entitlement to pension credit nationals of the EU accession countries will have if they come to live in the United Kingdom.  [151069]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40127w28.html_spnew0"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Under European law, a national of a member state must generally enjoy the same access to social security benefits as a national of the state of residence. Entitlement to income-related benefits and pension credit is subject to the habitual residence test, which nationals of the EU accession countries would need to satisfy. This acts as a deterrent to benefit tourism.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many people claimed incapacity benefit in each year since 1997, broken down by the condition that enables them to claim this benefit; and if he will make a statement on trends in claims.  [148639]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40127w28.html_spnew1"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 The overall number of people claiming Incapacity Benefit (IB) has risen from 2.37 million in August 1997 to 2.4 million in August 2003; this slight increase reflects a number of factors such as demography and changes in the characteristics of those claiming. The rate at which the caseload is increasing has been reduced dramatically and, in recent years, people with mental health disorders are the only broad category of diagnosis not to see a reduction in the numbers claiming.
<P>

<a name="40127w28.html_para0">"Pathways to Work&#151;Helping people into employment", published November 2002, set out a strategy for enabling people on IB to move into work. The first tranche of three pilot areas (Bridgend and Rhondda Cynon Taff; Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, Argyll and Bute; and Derbyshire) went live from October 2003; indications after the first seven weeks are very encouraging, with positive feedback from customers and over 150 people moving back into work. A further tranche of four areas (Gateshead and South Tyneside; Somerset; Essex; and East Lancashire) are on track to go live in April.

 An individual's entitlement to state pension depends on the national insurance contributions paid during his or her working life. however, for married couples, provision is made for a spouse to become entitled to a state pension based on the other spouse's national insurance contributions. There is no such thing as married persons' entitlements. Therefore, we are unable to provide the information requested.
