 The National Assembly for Wales's in-house staff provide accountancy services to the Wales Office. A notional charge is made for the services. In the financial year 2001&#150;02, the amounts were &#163;26,266 for financial services and &#163;7,897 for the internal audit service.

The figures reflect provisional funds allocated to DVLA for 2002&#150;03 to 2005&#150;06 from the Department of Transport's spending review settlements and other agreed changes. Income includes revenue from sale of registration marks and other income paid over to the Exchequer as Consolidated Fund Extra Receipts but excludes Vehicle Excise Duty collected by DVLA.<P>

DVLA's annual report shows unit cost efficiency gains in core activities averaging 3.4 per cent. a year. Transaction volumes have grown by an average of some 3 per cent. a year. From 1998 the Agency's core operations were extended by a number of major policy changes and business delivery improvements like photocard driving licences and graduated vehicle excise duty, which resulted in significant cost increases.<P>

In addition, 1998&#150;99 saw the introduction of a fee for vehicle first registrations and an increase in demand for personalised registration marks.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30312w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The number of staff employed by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency at the end of 2002&#150;03 is forecast to be 5,835 full time equivalent posts, which is 1,427 higher than at the end of 1998&#150;99. The main reasons for the increase are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) major new initiatives such as the Statutory Off-Road Notification scheme for unlicensed vehicles, photocard driving licences and Graduated Vehicle Excise Duty (577 posts);
<P>
<BR>
(b) other projects such as the implementation of the mandatory vehicle registration document scheme and to support London congestion charging; to safeguard delivery of the core business such as improving the accuracy of the database and the new strategic partnership to support DVLA's substantial change programme of service delivery improvements (550 posts);
<P>
<BR>
(c) increased workload involving initiatives to improve customer service delivery such as the introduction of extended hours in the Agency's call centre and growth in business volumes (23 per cent. higher than in 1998&#150;99). The full impact on staffing levels from workload growth has been offset by more efficient working practices and the increase in electronic business (300 posts).

 These are operational matters for London Underground who have provided the information set out in the tables relating to delays of at least two minutes resulting from problems with the relevant type of asset.
<P>

<a name="30312w02.html_para0">The number of delays is primarily a consequence of problems with ageing and life-expired assets following decades of under investment in the underground. This emphasises the urgent need for the major investment and maintenance, some &#163;16 billion over the next 15 years, which our tube modernisation plans will deliver.

<sup>(2)</sup> estimated outcome<P>

<P>

2. In addition to road safety, three further campaigns were run by the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions.<P>





<P>

(i) "Are You Doing Your Bit" campaign to promote awareness of actions which individuals could take to protect the local/global environment. Advertising began in March 1998 and continued until June 2001 when responsibility for the campaign transferred to DEFRA. Total advertising expenditure was &#163;12.85 million.<P>

(ii) Mayor and Assembly for London campaign to inform people about the voting process; explain responsibilities and encourage people to vote. It ran from February to May 2000. Advertising expenditure was &#163;2.3 million. Prior to this campaign, &#163;563k was committed over two years to raise awareness of the London Referendum and the consequences for the electorate.<P>

(iii) A Foot and Mouth public information campaign aimed at publicising simple rules to be followed when visiting the countryside during the FMD outbreak and giving sources of further information.<P>

It ran in March and April 2001. Advertising expenditure was &#163;12 million.<P>

3. The Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, also ran two further campaigns:<P>

(i) Fire Kills&#151;promoting fire safety messages, which in 2001&#150;02 focused on smoke alarms and smoking materials. For details of expenditure on fire safety campaigns in 2001&#150;02 and previous years I refer the hon. Member to the reply from my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie) to the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) on 28 November 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 380W.<P>

(ii) The Rough Sleepers Unit "Change a life" campaign encouraged the general public to volunteer their time, donate goods or give money to charities helping homeless people. It ran from November 2000 to January 2002 inclusive. Advertising expenditure was &#163;500,000. Responsibility for fire safety and homelessness now rest with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment he has made of the impact of the closure of RailMail on vehicle movements in London.  [102420]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30312w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Royal Mail Board has decided to review the future of the MailRail system for operational and commercial reasons. The company envisages only a handful of extra vehicles will be needed after MailRail is taken out of service, as a high proportion of the mail carried will be transported on existing vehicle routes.
<P>

<a name="30312w03.html_para2">Royal Mail is continually striving to reduce the impact of its vehicular traffic in London by contributing to reductions in congestion and CO2 emissions. The company has already seen a dramatic reduction in the number of miles and journeys undertaken by Royal Mail vehicles in the capital. For example, the switch of sorting NW postcode mail to Greenford from the London North Mail Centre, in Almeida Street, N1, cut the maximum journey time from 45 to just 25 minutes.

This is evidence of the effectiveness of the UK network of 243 Special Protection Areas (SPA) classified under the EC Wild Birds Directive; the UK series of 144 Ramsar sites; and the many Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) notified under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, for their wetland bird interests.

<P>
<a name="30312w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Drinking water must meet a regulatory standard for lead in the water supplied at consumers' taps. Water companies must treat plumbosolvent water where there is a risk that public water supplies might not comply with this standard.
<P>

<a name="30312w05.html_para4">We are required to take all appropriate measures to reduce as much as possible the concentration of lead in drinking water supplies in order to meet the standards for lead set by the European Drinking Water Directive. We are encouraged by the results of water companies' treatment programmes to reduce plumbosolvency. It is likely that these will reduce significantly the need to replace lead pipes to the benefit of all customers.
<P>

<a name="30312w05.html_para5">The need for water companies to replace lead pipes, mainly to meet the final lead standard that comes into force in 2013, is being considered as part of the next periodic review of water companies' prices.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30312w05.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 About 10 per cent. of drinking water is carried through white asbestos cement mains. There may be traces of blue asbestos in some white asbestos cement pipes. Water companies estimated in 1996 that about 35 per cent. of drinking water may be carried through lead connections between company mains and customers' supply pipes.
<P>

<a name="30312w05.html_para6">While use of new asbestos cement pipes is prohibited, this is because of health risks associated with inhalation when cutting and working with the dry material. However, the World Health Organisation considers that a health-based guideline value for asbestos in drinking water is unnecessary.

 Satellite services, like all other radio services, suffer degradation under adverse weather conditions, and this impairment is more pronounced at the higher frequencies often used by satellite services to provide services direct to and from businesses and homes.
<P>

<a name="30312w06.html_para0">When planning their satellite system, service providers take steps to overcome the effect that normally expected variations in weather conditions may have through careful system design and the use of appropriately sized satellite dishes. Taken together these measures provide a "protection margin" against the effect of weather variations.

<P>

<a name="30312w06.html_para7">The practice of some credit card providers of reducing the minimum required monthly repayment is one that I highlighted in my response in January this year to the Second Report of the Governments' Task Force on Tackling Overindebtedness.

 I have had no specific discussions with tour operators over the seating and pricing arrangements on aircrafts over the last 12 months.

<a name="30312w07.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 January 2003]:</i> As at 1 January 2003, 28 medical Reservists in the Territorial Army and, as at 28 February 2003,14 medical Reservists in the Royal Auxiliary Royal Air Force were medically unfit to deploy on military operations. The Royal Navy does not hold central records on the medical fitness of medical Volunteer Reservists and none of the Services holds central records on the medical fitness of medical ex-Regular Reservists. The medical fitness of these Reservists is only established on mobilisation when they are required to report to their mobilisation centre following receipt of their call-out notice.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what research he has commissioned on the prevalence of motor neurone disease among Gulf War veterans.  [101915]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30312w07.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Motor neurone disease (MND) is a rare disease and the Ministry of Defence has not specifically commissioned scientific research into the prevalence of it among United Kingdom veterans of the 1990&#150;91 Gulf Conflict. However, through the independent Medical Research Council (MRC), the Ministry of Defence has funded a controlled study of neuromuscular symptoms experienced by United Kingdom Servicemen. Some findings were published by the researchers in a paper entitled: "Neurophysiologic analysis of neuromuscular symptoms in UK Gulf war veterans" in the journal <i>Neurology</i> on 26 November 2002. The researchers reported that they had found no neurophysiologic evidence for a specific neuromuscular disorder that could be linked to previous deployment to the Gulf. At the Ministry of Defence's request, the MRC will shortly 



<P>
<P><I>12 Mar 2003 : Column 274W</I><P>
provide advice on appropriate areas for future research in the field of Gulf veterans illnesses. The MRC's advice will be published. The MRC is aware of the suggestion that United States Gulf veterans are at greater risk of developing MND than those who did not deploy but the underlying research has not yet been published in the scientific literature. The Ministry of Defence's future Gulf veterans' illnesses research programme will be firmly based on the MRC's recommendations.

 When not deployed on operations regular field hospitals exist with a basic unit establishment of 105 personnel. This enables the unit to function on an administrative and training basis only.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence whether an abatement was made to the salary of servicemen in each of the armed forces between 1973 and 1975; and if he will make a statement.  [102079]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30312w08.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 March 2003]</i>: No abatement was applied to the annual recommendations submitted to the Prime Minister by the Armed Forces Pay Review Body between 1973 and 1975, although the review body would have been obliged to observe the constraints imposed by the statutory controls on pay increases, in force between November 1972 and July 1974, as well as the subsequent guidelines of the Social Contract.
<P>

<a name="30312w08.html_para7">While not an abatement to service pay, in formulating its recommendations the review body would have applied an adjustment, where appropriate, to the comparator salaries used as the basis for officers' and warrant officers' pay during this period to take account of the relative benefits of the armed forces pension scheme. No similar adjustment was required to be made at that time in respect of comparator salaries for other ranks because most service personnel at this level did not complete the necessary 22 years' service then required to qualify for a pension.

 The Ministry of Defence's aim, in line with wider Government policy, is to create a non-smoking working environment in so far as it reflects the wishes of staff. This requires surveys to be undertaken and the wishes of staff to be established, unless smoking is prohibited, for operational reasons, in specific areas. Detailed guidance on this policy is promulgated in the Department's Health and Safety Handbook Joint Service Publication 375, a copy of which has been placed in the Library of the House.

 Two questions have arisen for consideration in recent months: first, whether the law as interpreted by the courts is sound, which includes the question of how the law operates in practice; and/or whether a review of the sentencing guidelines is needed.

Among the other observations in its judgment, in declining to increase the sentences imposed on these defendants the Court of Appeal held that it could not consider whether new guidelines were justified in this difficult area without advice from the Sentencing Advisory Panel.

<P>

<a name="30312w09.html_para8">In response to concerns raised by parents paying child care costs weekly, who may have short increases of child care costs during the school holidays, we are bringing forward regulations making a minor change to the system to allow parents to take account of changes in costs lasting less than four weeks. This will allow parents with fluctuating costs to have their tax credit based on their average child care costs, including any short-term fluctuations. The Inland Revenue will issue clear guidance for parents and child care providers on how the system will work from April.

<P>
<UL>(2) what discussions officials from his Department have had with representatives of <i>(a)</i> other developed countries, <i>(b)</i> the World bank, <i>(c)</i> the IMF and <i>(d)</i> the Ethiopian Government regarding (i) restructuring and (ii) suspending Ethiopia's debt repayments;  [102007]

<P>
<P>
<a name="30312w09.html_spnew6"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The UK takes a strong lead in the international debate on debt relief. The issue is discussed at most major international meetings, including the Annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World bank, which are attended by representatives from all member countries, including developing countries. The UK will use the forthcoming spring meetings of the IMF and World bank to push for increased efforts on debt relief.
<P>

<a name="30312w09.html_para9">The staffs of the IMF and World bank have prepared a paper on the options for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries to obtain technical assistance to facilitate the resolution of disputes, including those with commercial creditors. The UK will press for a full discussion of this issue at the spring meetings.
<P>

<a name="30312w09.html_para10">The UK also believes that where countries have to contend with external shocks, such as sharp falls in the price of key export commodities, we must form a broad consensus on the need for topping-up at completion point to ensure a lasting exit from unsustainable debt. We will work with our international partners to develop 



<P>
<P><I>12 Mar 2003 : Column 281W</I><P>
more realistic and generous rules for its provision, including agreement that the calculation of topping-up should exclude voluntary bilateral provision of additional 100 per cent. relief, to ensure that this functions as truly additional relief.
<P>

<a name="30312w09.html_para11">The UK has also been leading the debate on how to raise additional finance for development, including debt relief. The Chancellor and the Secretary of State for International Development have proposed an International Finance Facility (IFF) that will double the amount of development assistance in the years to 2015 from US$50 billion to $100 billion. This money will be disbursed mainly in the form of grants, including debt relief. This proposal is being worked up through the G7 and other forums in the run up to the G8 heads of state summit in June.
<P>

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will list the heavily indebted poor countries which have had full debt relief from the UK.  [102009]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30312w09.html_spnew7"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The UK always goes further than is required under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative (HIPC) and provides 100 per cent. debt relief. Under the HIPC initiative a country receives interim debt relief on payments due when it reaches Decision Point and subsequently the debt is irrevocably cancelled at Completion Point. To reach Decision Point and demonstrate their commitment to poverty reduction, a country must prepare an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), to get to Completion Point they need to develop a full PRSP, and usually make progress in implementing it for one year.
<P>

<a name="30312w09.html_para13">Of the 42 countries classified as HIPCs four are currently expected to have a sustainable burden of debt after traditional debt relief. Of the remaining 38 countries, 26 have now reached Decision Point with US$62 billion in debt relief committed compared with the $100 billion total. Six of these countries have reached Completion Point and have had the totality of their debts owed to the UK irrevocably cancelled. For the 20 countries still at Decision Point the UK provides 100 per cent. relief on debt service payments, and stands ready to irrevocably cancel their stock of debt at Completion Point. Out of 12 countries yet to reach Decision Point, eight are currently affected by conflict and this makes their progress in the HIPC initiative difficult. For these countries yet to reach Decision Point the UK holds in trust any debt service payments made until they can be returned to fund poverty reduction. The UK is the only creditor to operate this policy and has called on others to follow its lead.
<P>

<a name="30312w09.html_para14">The HIPCs that have reached completion point are: Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Mozambique, Tanzania and Uganda

 As a result of these changes, the 60,000 sick, elderly or disabled people who pay for home care services could see a reduction in costs of up to 13 per cent. No specific estimate has been made for the impact on state-regulated private welfare agencies. The impact of the changes on their revenue and profitability will depend upon the price charged for their services. In setting their prices, agencies will take a range of commercial factors into account, of which the exemption for welfare services is only one.

<a name="30312w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Diplomatic links with Libya were re-established in July 1999, and since then, our embassy has been active in developing links with various human rights organisations in the country. However, access for international human rights NGOs to visit has been rare, and it is difficult to obtain detailed information on the various human rights issues raised by the hon. Member. There have been some positive signs: in September 2002, the Libyan Government announced the release of all political prisoners other than those it has linked to al-Qaeda; in January 2003, they commuted the death sentence on three Ghanaians and one Nigerian; and earlier this year, the Qadhafi Foundation for Charitable Associations launched an anti-torture campaign. We are also encouraged by Colonel Qadhafi's reference, in a speech on 31 August 2002, to the need to discuss abolition of the political "People's" courts. However, we remain concerned about the overall human rights situation in Libya and encourage the Libyans to show they are committed to improving their record during their high-profile chairmanship of the forthcoming Commission on Human Rights (CHR). In the meantime, we are discussing with EU partners whether to make reference to Libya at this year's CHR.

 The Government appreciate that the cost of child care can be high, especially for parents with babies or young children needing full day care and that there are regional differences in the cost.

<a name="30312w13.html_para3">Working parents, subject to the level of their income, may receive support through the child care tax credit element of the Working Families Tax Credit or the Disabled Person's Tax Credit (Working Tax Credit from April 2003). Tax credit is rightly targeted at lower and middle income families who may use a range of types of child care.

<a name="30312w13.html_para4">The cost of child care reported in the Department for Education and Skills 2001&#150;02 audit shows an England average of &#163;101.01 a week for full day care and &#163;132.49 for London&#151;the region with the highest child care costs. The child care tax credit provides for up to 70 per cent. of costs of eligible child care. It can pay up to &#163;94.50 a week for one child (where the child care cost is &#163;135), and up to &#163;140 a week for two or more children (where the cost is &#163;200).

 No targets are set to measure educational aspiration. However, this Department has strategies that are aimed at helping to raise educational attainment in coalfield and other areas. In "14&#150;19: opportunity and excellence" (published 21 January 2003), we outlined our plans to transform the learning experience between 14 and 19 so that young people have a greater choice and flexibility to follow coherent learning pathways that reflect their individual strengths and aspirations. We believe that increased choice and flexibility, and improved coherence and quality of programmes, will help to raise young people's aspirations and those of their parents and wider communities. To support delivery and give focus to our proposals for 14&#150;19 reform, we have set ourselves targets to increase young people's participation and attainment in education. These are:

<sup>(8)</sup> The percentages refer to aptitude selection relating to the schools' specialist school designations, some schools may also select for aptitude in other specialisms.<P>

<i>Note</i>:<P>

This information was taken from progress reports submitted by 536 schools operational as at September 2000.<P>

The 1998 School Standards and Framework Act provides for schools with a specialism to select up to 10 per cent. of their intake on the basis of aptitude for a specialist subject prescribed in regulations. Prior to the 1998 Act schools had greater discretion over aptitude selection and this accounts for the percentages above 10 per cent.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30312w15.html_wqn0"><B> Chris Grayling: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the maximum student loan available for a medical student doing a six year course will be after the introduction of the measures outlined in the Government's White Paper; and what the maximum tuition fees are which such a student will be required to pay.  [100933]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30312w15.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 For English and Welsh domiciled students the maximum means tested loan in 2002&#150;03 is &#163;3,090 for a student residing at their parent's home; and otherwise &#163;3,905, unless for studying in London, where it is &#163;4,815. Eligible medical students from lower income families on a six year course will be entitled to these levels of loan, increased for inflation, for four years. Many will also be entitled to a further Higher Education Grant of &#163;1,000 for four years from October 2004. In year five medical students are entitled to a non means tested reduced rate loan (at 2002&#150;03 prices) of &#163;1,465 if they are living with a parent, &#163;1,915 otherwise, and &#163;2,365 if they are studying in London. In the final year these figures reduce to &#163;1,075, &#163;1,400 and &#163;1,725 respectively. In addition, in years five and six English domiciled medical students may receive non repayable annual means tested bursaries from the Department of Health, or if Welsh domiciled from the Welsh Assembly Government, of up to &#163;1,758 (living with parent), &#163;2,148 (otherwise) or &#163;2,640 (living in London).
<P>

<a name="30312w15.html_para0">After implementation of the White Paper proposals, the annual fee contribution for four years will vary from &#163;0-&#163;3,000 per year but the upfront cost to students and parents would be reduced from the current maximum of &#163;1,100 since fees would start to be repaid only after graduation (and achievement of an income threshold of &#163;15,000 per year). Students on lower incomes would continue as now to receive a grant for fees of &#163;1,100 (increased annually for inflation) and their loan for fees would not exceed &#163;1,900 a year. In cases where the Access Regulator agrees higher fee levels than &#163;1,100, university bursary schemes will further reduce the cost of fees to some students on low incomes.
<P>

<a name="30312w15.html_para1">Fee support for English domiciled medical students in years five and six is the responsibility of the Department of Health. Currently students pay no contributions to fees. Department of Health Ministers have indicated that, whatever the future levels of tuition fees, they will take measures to ensure that any increase in the cost of university courses will not have an adverse impact on the supply, retention, diversity or quality of students on health professional courses, including medicine.

<a name="30312w15.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Early retirement is available to teachers between the ages of 50 and 59. During 2001&#150;02, 3,450 teachers under the age of 60 who had been employed in the maintained schools sector in England were awarded early payment of retirement benefits. This represents around 3 per cent. of the teaching work force in the 50&#150;59 age range. In addition, 1,760 teachers in the 50&#150;59 age range and 580 teachers aged under 50 were awarded ill-health retirement benefits on the grounds of permanent incapacity.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30312w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 My Department recently completed a consultation on developing the role of school support staff, which included proposals for enhancing the role of support staff. These proposals included the development of a 'higher-level teaching assistant' role, for individuals who would have the skills and training to work with whole classes of pupils in the absence of, but under the supervision of, a qualified teacher. We have also recently completed a consultation on draft regulations and guidance under Section 133 of the Education Act 2002. These regulations outline the role of the qualified teacher and set out conditions under which individuals without qualified teacher status can undertake aspects of that role. This area was previously unregulated so the new regulations will strengthen the safeguards in place to protect the quality of pupils' education. My officials are currently considering the responses to the two consultations and the Department will be issuing revised regulations and further guidance in the near future, taking into account the consultation responses and the details set out in the recent National Agreement between the Government, school work force unions and the local government employers.

 The forthcoming Anti-Social Behaviour Bill will formally enable education welfare officers to ask parents who fail to secure their child's regular attendance at school to sign a parenting contract. This will mean agreeing to co-operate with support arranged by the local authority (typically a parenting course) and taking specified action to improve their child's attendance. Refusal to sign or breach of contract may result in a fixed penalty notice or prosecution.
<P>

<a name="30312w15.html_para3">The Bill will also enable education welfare officers to issue fixed penalty notices to parents who condone or ignore truancy. Failure to pay the penalty will result in prosecution.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what soft information is given to <i>(a)</i> employers and <i>(b)</i> employees who have requested an enhanced Criminal Records Bureau check.  [100167]

<i>[holding answer 10 March 2003]:</i> Enhanced disclosures differ from standard disclosures in that in addition to information about convictions, which is obtained from the Police National Computer, they may also contain information provided by a local police force. Most often, this will be a police force in whose area an applicant has lived for the five years preceding the date of application. This information is commonly referred to as "local information".
<P>

<a name="30312w16.html_para0">The Police Act 1997, which established the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB), sets out when such information should be released. Essentially, a local police force may release local information if it thinks it may be relevant to the position sought. The question of whether information is or may be relevant is solely a matter for the local police force, and over which the CRB has no control.
<P>

<a name="30312w16.html_para1">Local information can be released in two forms&#151;approved information and additional information. Decisions about the form in which information is released are again solely a matter for the local police force and over which the CRB has no control. The local police force decisions are based upon the nature of the information and the circumstances of particular cases. Approved and additional information have previously been termed 'soft' or 'non-conviction' information respectively.
<P>

<a name="30312w16.html_para2">Approved information is local police force information released under section 115 (7) of the Police Act and is information that has been approved to be included on an enhanced disclosure. This is printed on both copies of the disclosure, (i.e. which go to the employer and the employee). The applicant will normally be aware of the information already, which might for example be information about an impending prosecution. At present only some three in every 1,000 enhanced disclosures contain approved information.
<P>

<a name="30312w16.html_para3">Additional information is released under section 115 (8) of the Police Act and is information that has been authorised to be released to the registered body only in the interests of the prevention or detection of crime. This is released in the form of a separate letter sent to the registered body and arrives in a different envelope from the disclosure. The information is not made available to the applicant and does not appear on the disclosure. The disclosure issued to the registered body contains a box on the top right-hand side referring to the letter sent under separate cover. This warns the registered body that they should wait for the letter before reaching a recruitment decision. The information released by the police in these circumstances is highly confidential. Although CRB will know when such letters are released, they do not see the contents and are not sent a copy. At present only some four in every 10,000 enhanced disclosure applications end with the release of additional information.

 [<i>holding answer 10 March 2003</i>]: All disclosure applications are processed at the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) sites at Liverpool and Darwen, Blackburn. The work being undertaken at, Chennai (Madras) involves manual inputting of personal information such as name, date of birth and addresses during the past five years, provided by individuals on their application forms. This work is undertaken at the beginning of the process, and no information drawn from police sources or other data sources is involved.
<P>

<a name="30312w16.html_para4">This arrangement was introduced as part of a package of measures to improve the performance of the CRB. It has proved highly effective in enabling large numbers of paper application forms to be processed, with timely, cost effective and accurate data capture, and eliminating backlogs from this critical stage of the CRB process.
<P>

<a name="30312w16.html_para5">Due to the fact that the CRB is still receiving around 78 per cent. of applications on paper and that the current data entry system works well the CRB will continue to capture the information from hand-written forms in Chennai. When the CRB introduces an electronic application channel this situation will be reviewed. There is no additional cost to this Department in the work being carried out in Chennai for data inputting. The costs are borne entirely by Capita as part of their contractual arrangements with the CRB.
<P>

<a name="30312w16.html_para6">To ensure the data processed by Hays in India would be secure, senior members of CRB staff have conducted two extensive site inspections. The inspections were carried out in accordance with the Information Commissioners (1C) guidance relating to overseas transfer. On inspection, the site satisfied both the IC's and the CRB stringent requirements for security, data protection and data integrity.
<P>

<a name="30312w16.html_para7">The data transferred is that contained on the disclosure application form. The form is scanned, encrypted and then transferred via a secure link to the site in Chennai. On receipt of the scanned image, the data are entered on to a system compatible with those used by the CRB to process disclosure applications. On completion the data is again encrypted and transferred back to the United Kingdom via the secure link. Hays only retain the data for the duration of time taken to input and transfer to the United Kingdom. Thereafter, the data are destroyed.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his statement of 27 February 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 32&#150;36WS, on the Criminal Records Bureau, what additional resources he has given to Capita for each <i>(a)</i> standard disclosure and <i>(b)</i> enhanced disclosure following the indefinite postponement of basic disclosures.  [101016]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30312w16.html_spnew3"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 In his statement, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary said it would be inappropriate to launch basic disclosures until higher priority categories of applicant for higher level disclosures are seeing their needs fully accommodated. The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) is concentrating its resources on the standard and enhanced disclosures until the demand for higher level disclosures is fully met and that applicants for such disclosures receive a satisfactory service. Basic disclosures will not be introduced until these objectives have been achieved. In light of the operational difficulties that the CRB has experienced since the launch of the higher level disclosure service, the decision was taken to re-assess the anticipated demand for basic disclosures in conjunction with a review of the business process model. No additional resources have been directed towards Capita for standard and enhanced disclosures, following the decision to postpone the launch of basic disclosures.

 The research undertaken enabled a baseline demand figure to be agreed and confirmed and assumptions validated from a number of different sources. An assessment of the research indicates that the baseline figure produced for the first year of operations is reasonably close to actual demand. However, it now seems less certain that much higher levels of forecast future demand will be achieved, although this has yet to be proven.

 During the early part of 2001, as a major part of the Criminal Records Bureau's (CRB's) publicity campaign to raise awareness of the disclosure service and to encourage registration, the CRB held 22 seminars in nine venues throughout England and Wales. In all, over 8,000 organisations were invited to attend, including users of the existing police based arrangements. Around 4,687 delegates attended and the overall satisfaction rating was "very informative". The events proved very successful in raising awareness of the new service with over 3,557 organisations registered from the start. The total cost of this campaign was &#163;694,000. It was during the registration seminars that many organisations with significant stature and strong relevance to the CRB voiced their concerns over the proposed telephone only application channel.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether work permits can be issued to individuals who have entered the UK illegally.  [102466]<P>

<P>
<a name="30312w17.html_spnew3"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Illegal immigrants cannot apply for work permits, and it is an offence knowingly to employ an illegal entrant to the United Kingdom. Where an employer applies for a work permit for an overseas national who is already in the United Kingdom, Work Permits (UK) will first consider whether the application meets the criteria of the work permit arrangements before considering whether, under the Immigration Rules, the overseas national may be granted leave to remain for the purpose of work permit employment. Under the Immigration Rules, only those who were admitted to the United Kingdom as a work permit holder, as a student or student nurse or as a postgraduate doctor or dentist may be granted an extension of stay for the purpose of work permit employment. Granting such leave in any other circumstance can only be considered on a discretionary basis. Such discretion will not normally be exercised where the overseas national has had an adverse Immigration history.

 Following the film policy review in 1998, my Department established the Film Council in April 2000 as the Government's strategic lead body. The creation of the Film Council brought together, for the first time, responsibility for the film industry, film culture and education.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30312w19.html_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The risk that Iraqi forces may deploy chemical or biological weapons is a very grave one. Advice from the Department of Health and Ministry of Defence is that, given the unpredictable range of weapons that Saddam might use, only sophisticated protective suits and training would provide adequate protection to the threat. It is not possible for my Department to provide this training and protection to large numbers of Iraqi people.
<P>

<a name="30312w19.html_para4">In terms of response to any use of chemical or biological weapons, only highly skilled and well-equipped parts of the military or specialised agencies, who have been trained for such environments and on the use of protective suits, would have the capacity to operate. My Department is in continuing discussions with the Ministry of Defence about the provision of humanitarian response under a range of eventualities.

<P>
<a name="30312w19.html_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 60 per cent. of the Iraqi people are totally dependent on the UN Oil For Food Programme for essential supplies, including food. We are working to try to minimise the impact of any military action on this programme and, in the event of disruption to it, to helping re-establishing it as quickly as possible. We are also drawing up contingency plans to support the provision of relief by those best placed to do so, to cover any period during which the programme would not be able to function. We have so far committed &#163;10 million to support contingency planning by UN agencies and NGOs, which includes some prepositioning of supplies. There might be a phase when only military forces are fully able to operate in Iraq and thus would have primary responsibility for the initial delivery of humanitarian relief. My Department has been advising the Ministry of Defence on these issues for some time.

From April 2003 this becomes part of the Supporting People budget administered by local authorities.
<P>

<a name="30312w20.html_para1">Both local authorities and registered social landlords are encouraged in the Relationship Breakdown Guidance* to have clauses against domestic violence in their tenancy agreements. Increased safety measures and effective multi-agency working with the police are suggested as alternatives. Where a victim of domestic violence is a tenant of a local authority or registered social landlord it is possible for that person to be transferred to alternative accommodation via a management transfer, although there may be issues of tenancy rights to resolve. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is keen to improve the opportunities for mobility for all social tenants, particularly from high pressure areas to those where the demand for social rented accommodation is less. People who experience domestic violence could benefit from the opportunities for mobility for all social tenants.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30312w22.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not collect social housing rents data at ward level. Therefore no such assessment has been made. However, at a national average level, local authority and housing association rents are expected to go up over the 10 year rent restructuring period much more slowly than over the preceding 10 years. 30 per cent. of the Government's national rents formula is based on January 1999 relative property values, with the remaining 70 per cent. taking account of local earnings for affordability. The formula rent is therefore not affected by house price inflation since January 1999. In addition, absolute caps on formula rents, and limits on individual rent rises were introduced in autumn 2001 to address the concerns that formula rents would otherwise cause affordability problems for a small number of tenants. The housing benefit system forms an additional safeguard for those on the lowest incomes.

 The Supporting People programme will continue to pay for services that are currently paid for from the legacy funding streams that will go into the Supporting People pot.

<P>

<a name="30312w22.html_para5">Support which predominantly involves direct individual and group support work with children is not fundable under Supporting People.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will define the term key worker as used in "Sustainable Communities: Building for the Future".  [98576]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30312w23.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McNulty:  </B> 
For the purposes of "Sustainable Communities: Building for the Future", the Government has targeted key workers in the public sector. Wider housing policies to increase the supply of affordable homes, particularly in areas where demand is high, will benefit other key workers.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30312w23.html_wqn1"><B> Vera Baird: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what is intended by his statement that "We will work with partners in the Tees Valley who are tackling the issue of market failure, in the implementation of the Tees Valley Housing Strategy" in the document "Sustainable Communities in the North East".  [97213]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30312w23.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The North East Communities Plan recognises the valuable work currently under way across the region addressing housing and wider community issues. Among the examples selected to give a flavour of this activity is the important work of the stakeholders in the Tees Valley sub-region to address market failure. Furthermore, the problem of market failure has been recognised as a key issue in a draft regional housing strategy, prepared by the North East Housing Forum. It is likely therefore that this will be a priority for the new North East Housing Board to address.
<P>

<a name="30312w23.html_para0">The Board will address this and other housing issues through the Regional Housing Strategy which it has been tasked to submit to Ministers by July 2003. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will be looking to partners across the region, including Tees Valley, to come forward with proposals for the Board to consider.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30312w23.html_wqn2"><B> Vera Baird: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister in what way the announcements in the document "Sustainable Communities in the North East" support housing renewal in Redcar and Cleveland.  [97214]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30312w23.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 "Sustainable Communities in the North East" recognises that 20 per cent. of the housing stock in the region is at risk from low or changing patterns of demand, including Redcar and Cleveland in Teesside. One of the key announcements is the establishment of a Regional Housing Board. The North East Regional Housing Board will address the national priorities of bringing social housing into decent condition and to take action to tackle low demand. This is in line with the national priorities set out in "Sustainable Communities: Building for the Future".
<P>

<a name="30312w23.html_para1">Nationally we are making available &#163;2.8 billion to improve council housing and &#163;500 million to tackle low demand and abandonment over the next three years. As from 2004&#150;05 we will be bringing together the Housing Corporation's Approved Development Programme and local authority Housing Investment Programme into a new single pot for housing capital investment. The Board will advise Ministers on the allocation of this new single pot so that investment is targeted more effectively on regional and local priorities.
<P>

<a name="30312w23.html_para2">The national plan also identifies tools and actions to tackle low demand more widely, including: building on existing regeneration programmes such as 



<P>
<P><I>12 Mar 2003 : Column 330W</I><P>
Neighbourhood Renewal Fund and New Deal for Communities; proposals to speed up compulsory purchase of land and property; increasing the minimum payments made to people whose homes are compulsorily purchased under the 'Home Loss' scheme from &#163;1,500 to &#163;2,600; legislating to allow local authorities to license private landlords in low demand areas; and launching a new EU approved 'Gap Funding' housing scheme to pump prime regeneration in deprived areas.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30312w23.html_wqn3"><B> Vera Baird: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what extra resources the Department will make available in 2003&#150;04 for housing renewal in <i>(a)</i> Redcar and Cleveland and <i>(b)</i> Teesside.  [97217]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30312w23.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The bulk of Government support for local authorities housing capital spend is provided through the Major Repairs Allowance (MRA), which is ring-fenced for use on council housing, and the housing Annual Capital Guideline (ACG). The housing ACG, which is allocated as part of the Single Capital Pot, provides support for either improvements to existing housing (council or private sector) or provision of new affordable housing.
<P>

<a name="30312w23.html_para3">Redcar and Cleveland's housing ACG for 2003&#150;04 is &#163;2 million; the total for the five Tees Valley authorities (Redcar and Cleveland, Middlesbrough, Hartlepool, Darlington and Stockton on Tees) for 2003&#150;04 amounts to &#163;10.6 million. These figures are not directly comparable with allocations for 2002&#150;03 as they no longer include an element assumed to be funded from authorities useable capital receipts. After taking account of this change, resources going to Tees Valley are estimated to have increased by 5&#150;10 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30312w23.html_para4">Redcar and Cleveland no longer receives an MRA as the council housing stock transferred to Coast and County Housing in July 2002. The 2003&#150;04 MRA allocations for other Tees Valley authorities total &#163;21.3 million. These are formula-based allocations that depend on the number and type of dwellings owned by the council.
<P>

<a name="30312w23.html_para5">It should also be noted that the provisions of the Regulatory Reform Order on Housing Renewal, which came into force on 6 June 2002, gave local authorities much greater discretion on how they can provide assistance for housing renewal.
<P>

<a name="30312w23.html_para6">Lastly, HIP resources are only a part of the resources made available by Government to tackle issues of deprivation, including housing. Most notably &#163;35.3 million is available to Tees Valley authorities under the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund (including &#163;7.8 million for Redcar and Cleveland) and Hartlepool and Middlesbrough both benefit from New Deal for Communities moneys. The latter amounts to &#163;52 million in West Middlesbrough and &#163;54 million in Hartlepool, of which &#163;12.5 million and &#163;10.5 million respectively are earmarked for housing and environment spend.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30312w23.html_wqn4"><B> Ms Bridget Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on the impact of 



<P>
<P><I>12 Mar 2003 : Column 331W</I><P>
the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 on local authority and housing association tenancies.  [96592]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30312w23.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 We expect all local authorities and Registered Social Landlords (commonly known as housing associations) to take these regulations into account when issuing tenancy agreements to their tenants. I am not aware that the regulations have had any particular impact on these tenancies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30312w23.html_wqn5"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what plans he has under the new provisions to move travellers on immediately from unauthorised sites where authorised sites are provided by the local authority.  [98066]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30312w23.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Government are proposing to introduce new police powers to move on illegal Gypsy and Traveller camps. The details of how this will work are currently being worked up by the Home Office, and no legislative vehicle has yet been identified to take this forward.
<P>

<a name="30312w23.html_para7">This new power is not intended to replace existing legislation currently in place under sections 61 to 62 and 77 to 79 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which enables local authorities and police forces to move illegal encampments. This will remain alongside the new power.

<P>

<a name="30312w23.html_para8">The pilots are in their early stages and it is too soon to draw conclusions about their performance. However, initial indications are that there is a strong commitment from employers and training providers to making the programme a success.

<a name="30312w23.html_para10">The contracting timetable for Ambition Construction sought for delivery of contracts to begin on 24 June 2002. Extended contract negotiations led to delays in the Merseyside, and Coventry and Warwickshire pilots. In Paddington, a delay followed the withdrawal of the initial training provider and a re-tendering of the contract. Despite these delays, all pilots are successfully up and running and are contracted to run for a full three years.

<a name="30312w24.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 We have not conducted a comparative evaluation of outcomes between the New Deal for Young People and New Deal 25 plus. The client groups for the programmes have very different characteristics and the programmes themselves are not identical.

<P>
<P><I>12 Mar 2003 : Column 334W</I><P>
18 out of 21 months of unemployment. As New Deal 25 plus participants have faced longer terms of unemployment, and hence greater barriers to work, fewer job outcomes through subsidised employment are likely.

 The Social Services Inspectorate (SSI) assess the child and family social services in each council and categorise this performance by rating whether they are "serving people well" as "no", "some", "most" or "yes". There is no separate, explicit categorisation for child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS), but it is one of a number of service areas that feed into the overall children's services judgement. As a result, a council could receive the highest rated children's social services judgement ("serving people well", categorised as "yes"), without their CAMHS being considered good.
<P>

<a name="30312w25.html_para6">Inspections of child and family social services are carried out by SSI, with the results feeding into the overall assessment of performance.

 Influenza is a serious disease that can be fatal, particularly in the elderly, and influenza vaccines have a significant benefit in helping to reduce morbidity and mortality from the disease. As with any vaccine or medicine, influenza vaccines are not without possible side-effects in some recipients. The known side-effects of influenza vaccines are listed in the product information available to general practitioners and other health professionals and available in the Association of British Pharmaceutical Industries compendium of data sheets and summaries of product characteristics and the electronic medicines compendium.
<P>

<a name="30312w25.html_para7">The Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the Committee of Safety of Medicines keeps the safety of all vaccines under continual review.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30312w27.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Patients with muscular dystrophy (MD) can take advantage of a range of primary, secondary and tertiary services available. Children with MD form a considerable part of the caseload for children's community nursing services and many receive services from children's hospices. The children's national service framework will develop new national standards across the National Health Service and social services for children, including those with MD. The new standards will help to ensure better access and smoother progression in the provision of services for children, from initial contact with the NHS, via a general practitioner's surgery or NHS hospital, through to social services support.
<P>

<a name="30312w27.html_para1">Clinical and laboratory services for the diagnosis of MD are available through existing networks of regional genetics centres. In January 2002, my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Health, announced the spending of &#163;11 million to boost capacity in NHS genetics services. This should help patients with muscular dystrophy and other genetic diseases.
<P>

<a name="30312w27.html_para2">There is no specific treatment for any of the forms of MD. Physical therapy and corrective orthopaedic surgery may be needed to improve the quality of life in some cases.

<P>

<a name="30312w27.html_para3">Hydrotherapy is one form of treatment that a physiotherapist might choose for a patient's condition and access is through this route. However, hydrotherapy pools do not exist in all areas, so access could be limited

for this reason. Referral to physiotherapy is usually through the GP, consultant or, in some cases, through direct referral from the patient.
<P>

<a name="30312w27.html_para4">Access to orthopaedic services for elective care is through referral to an orthopaedic consultant by the patient's general practitioner. The Modernisation Agency is running two programmes, which aim to improve patient access to orthopaedic care. The "Action on Orthopaedics" programme has a number of pilot sites across the country and is gathering information on best practice with the objective of showing the improvements in patients' access that can be achieved through an integrated approach within health communities. The orthopaedic services collaborative is a quality improvement initiative and has the participation of nearly two thirds of the 177 orthopaedic services departments in England examining potential changes that might be made in their processes and systems to bring about optimal outcomes and improved patient care.

 Part <i>(a)</i> of this question will be addressed in a letter from Mr. Nick Matheson, Chief Executive of the Government Car and Despatch Agency to the hon. Member for Buckingham. As for part <i>(b)</i>, expenditure of &#163;40,407 was incurred against the departmental taxi service contract between 1 April 2002 and 28 February 2003. This figure excludes any amounts spent on taxi hire outside of the departmental contract and reclaimed by officials as travel and subsistence expenditure. That information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners 



<P>
<P><I>12 Mar 2003 : Column 352W</I><P>
pursuant to his oral statement of 3 February 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 20, on Church Repairs and VAT, when he expects the review of the sixth VAT directive to be completed.  [101642]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30312w28.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bell: </B> 
 I understand that work is ongoing between Commission officials and member states to finalise the details of the revision to the Sixth Directive. The aim is to get sufficient agreement in the Council for the 'Recast' Directive to be formally adopted before the next enlargement of the EU, scheduled for May-June 2004.
<P>

<a name="30312w28.html_para7">The 'recasting of the Sixth VAT Directive' is a separate exercise to other elements of the Sixth Directive being revised, such as the reduced rates review, scheduled to take place later this year, or the Labour Intensive Services Experiment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30312w28.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Ben Chapman: </B> 
To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners if he will make a statement on the pension rights of clergy.  [101436]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30312w28.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bell: </B> 
 Clergy in office receive a stipend and are housed. When they retire they make their own housing provision, but they receive a pension from the State as well as that provided by the Church's clergy pension scheme. The basis for determining the benefits provided by the latter&#151;a lump sum at retirement plus a pension&#151;was designed to take into account all of these factors. The full service pension (payable after 37 years of service) has since April 2002 been &#163;10,693 per annum and will increase by 3 per cent. from April 2003. The retirement lump sum is &#163;32,079.
<P>

<a name="30312w28.html_para8">Following a thorough consultation with interested parties in the Church, culminating in a General Synod debate last November, it was decided to retain the defined benefit scheme. The Church has resisted the increasingly common alternative of moving to money purchase schemes, thereby shifting risk onto the employee, in a demonstration of its commitment to adequate provision for the clergy in their retirement.
