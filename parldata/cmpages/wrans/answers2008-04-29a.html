 Abatement is a common feature of public service pension schemes. It affects all members of the NHS Pension Scheme who receive an enhanced national health service pension funded by the scheme or their employer if they return to NHS employment. It continues until they are aged 60 for members of the 1995 scheme, or age 65 for those members of the 2008 scheme. It does not affect those who have retired on voluntary grounds with an actuarial reduction in their pension. Abatement will usually only affect those who earn more than 50 per cent. of their previous salary.</p>

 The Department has commissioned two pieces of research to look at the impact of external labour markets on national health service staff costs. The first, a study on regional pay differentials in 2005 known as the &#145;Aberdeen Study&#146; found that private sector wage rates were correlated with the vacancy rate for qualified nurses. As part of its current work programme, the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation has carried out a review of the market forces factor. This work will be used to inform revenue allocations to primary care trusts for 2009-10 and 2010-11. The aim is to announce the revenue allocations by the summer.</p>

<i> [holding answer 28 April 2008]:</i> The A12 through Essex is considered to be primarily of regional importance. Decisions on such schemes are made on the basis of advice from regional bodies, including the Regional Assembly and the Regional Development Agency, on the priorities for funding within an indicative budget. The advice provided by the East of England regional bodies in 2006, which Ministers have accepted, did not prioritise any A12 schemes in the period to 2016.</p>

 A new ambient air quality directive, due to come into force in May 2008, consolidates existing EU legislation and includes new controls over very fine particulate matter (PM 2.5), where the World Health Organisation (WHO) advises that there is no safe level of exposure. The main elements are a 'backstop' limit value, to be met everywhere by 2015, and an 'exposure concentration obligation' to be met across urban background locations (as an average), also by 2015.

Diesel cars currently emit significantly higher levels of both particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen than petrol cars. However, the recently agreed Euro 5 and 6 emissions standards will reduce particulate emissions from new diesel cars to comparable levels to petrol cars by 2011 and substantially reduce the difference between petrol and diesel NOx emissions by 2015.</p>

 There are approximately 170 internal drainage boards (IDB) in England and Wales concentrated mainly in East Anglia, Yorkshire, Somerset and Lincolnshire.

 Local authorities have permissive powers (but no statutory obligation) to undertake works to manage flood risk from the sea and from watercourses for which the Environment Agency and internal drainage boards do not hold such powers.

A research survey published by the Department in April 2008 showed that average apprenticeship pay has risen in line with inflation since 2005, from a weekly average of &#163;137 to &#163;170 in 2008. A copy of the survey report will be placed in the Library. To ensure that apprenticeship pay remains at least on par with financial support for other learning routes, the Government have remitted the Low Pay Commission to report on apprenticeship pay by February 2009.

 In his written statement on 7 February 2008, <i> Official Report, </i>columns 85-86WS, on the Education (Student Support) Regulations, the Secretary of State announced that he was amending the student support regulations to disallow prisoners who were also full-time students from receiving financial support for maintenance, thereby removing the long-standing provision which had allowed prisoners to claim such support. In a further written statement on 25 March 208, <i> Official Report, </i>column 6WS, he announced that an investigation showed that 154 individual prisoners had received some form of maintenance payment while a full time student since 1998. In total, prisoners received &#163;570,000 in maintenance loans and &#163;160,000 in maintenance grants over that period. The investigation also showed that assessments for student support were carried out in accordance with the rules that applied at the time.

 Household waste has no role to play specifically in the definition of zero carbon, which is focused on the energy performance of the home in relation to energy use from cooking, washing and electronic appliances as well as space heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting and hot water. However, the Code for Sustainable Homes contains a minimum entry requirement on household waste which must be met in order to gain a star rating against the code at any level. This ensures that when developers are building to higher environmental standards, and ultimately zero carbon standards at level 6 of the code, waste is taken into account in the design, construction and occupation of the house.</p>

 In general, the conversion of a dwelling house to flats would involve a material change of use and therefore require planning permission. It would then be for the local authority to determine whether this is appropriate based on their local plans and policies and the need for such housing in the area. It is important for local authorities to strike a balance between the need to make efficient use of land by building at higher densities in accessible locations and making sure that satisfactory living conditions are either maintained or could be achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_480"><a name="80429w0013.htm_para5"><a name="08042994000292">I have no plans to give local authorities greater powers in relation to planning decisions on the conversion of dwelling houses to flats, as I consider that existing powers are sufficient. It would not be appropriate to restrict generally the opportunities that conversions can bring to overall housing stock, as these are decisions best taken locally after careful consideration of the merits and drawbacks of each particular case.</p>

 The Index of Multiple Deprivation 2000 (IMD 2000) is a ward level measure of multiple deprivation. For the geographical access sub-domain, average distance travelled to each service was calculated as the average distance that claimants in a particular ward would have to travel to that service, as the crow flies. The distances to post offices, doctors' surgeries and food shops were computed for claimants of means tested out-of-work benefits, while the distance to primary schools was computed for all children aged 5 to 8.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_484"><a name="80429w0014.htm_para0"><a name="08042994000440">The same four indicators were used in the IMD 2004 and 2007. However both these indices are based on Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) geography, rather than ward geography. The measurement of distance changed from ;as the crow flies' to measuring road distance, to each service. The distances were measured to the nearest 10 metres. In 2004 and 2007 distance was measured for all people rather than just for people claiming out-of-work benefits. In the case of primary schools, the population used is the relevant child population.</p>

Planning applications for development on sites of 1 hectare or greater in areas with low probability of flooding and all proposals in areas with medium and high probability of flooding should be accompanied by a site-specific Flood Risk Assessment. This will identify and assess the risks from all forms of flooding to and from the development, and demonstrate how these flood risks will be managed, so that the development will be safe and will not increase flood risk elsewhere.

Currently 25 DFID staff are members of the Partnership scheme and have varying contribution levels. A 1 per cent. increase will have a very minimal increase to DFID's overall expenditure.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) provides its humanitarian assistance through partner agencies such as the UN Relief Works Agency and the International Committee of the Red Cross. The UK also makes a substantial contribution to the World Food Programme's central budget. For these implementing agencies, the partial closure of Gaza's crossings has significantly increased the time and costs involved in importing humanitarian supplies into Gaza. Verified estimates are unavailable, although the World Food Programme has calculated that additional costs created by Israel's food clearance procedures will reach $6 million over the two years from September 2007 to August 2009. As the situation deteriorates, we expect these costs to rise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_523"><a name="80429w0017.htm_para8"><a name="080429105000268">There were no employer contributions for police pensions for the years prior to 2006-07 since until this point police authorities had to meet the cost of pensions in payment out of their operating accounts. However, the system for financing police pensions changed on 1 April 2006. Police authorities now have a separate pensions account, into which they pay officers&#146; contributions and a new employer&#146;s contribution. Any shortfall in an authority&#146;s pensions account each year is topped up with a grant from central Government; any surplus is recouped. The employer contribution rate is a combined one for both the Police Pension Scheme 1987 (PPS) and the New Police Pension Scheme 2006 (NPPS). In 2006-07 and 2007-08, the employer contribution rate was 24.6 per cent. of each officer&#146;s average pensionable pay, and was reduced to 24.2 per cent. with effect from 1 April 2008. Returns from individual authorities show a total employer contribution cost of &#163;1.108 billion for 2006-07 based on forces&#146; unaudited accounts, and &#163;1.151 billion for 2007-08 based on forces&#146; estimates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_524"><a name="80429w0017.htm_para9"><a name="080429105000269">The employee contribution rate for the PPS is currently 11 per cent. of pensionable pay, and 9.5 per cent. for the NPPS. The annual saving from increasing these rates for police officers in England and Wales would be &#163;47 million, based on 1 per cent. of the estimated annual pensionable payroll in 2007-08. Such a change would, in isolation, reduce the call made by police forces on the central Government top-up grant, although this may differ if other changes were introduced at the same time.</p>

<i> Note</i>:<br>
It should be noted that non-sanction detections that contribute to the overall detection rate have fallen In recent years reflecting a significant shift by many police forces away from recording detections of crime where no further action is taken. For this reason overall detection rates over time are not fully comparable. From 1 April 2007 the rules governing recording of non-sanction detections were revised to reduce the scope within which they can be claimed to a very limited set of circumstances.<br>

The FSS is also registered as compliant with the international quality standard IS09001 (Quality Management Systems). The FSS&#146; validation standards and the SWGDAM validation guidelines are similar; however as an additional measure since December 2007, the FSS has implemented a process that involves checking against the SWGDAM validation guidelines when implementing new DNA techniques into casework. The FSS has shared its standards for technique validation with the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes, who have adopted them in their own published guidelines for validation, with which the FSS are fully compliant.</p>

Of these 17, four individuals have been granted conditional bail by the court while awaiting trial.

 My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and my noble Friend Lord Malloch-Brown have held regular substantive and frank discussions with African and other leaders about the non-publication of the recent presidential election results and the unacceptable level of political violence in Zimbabwe. In addition our embassies and high commissions are engaging in dialogue with key interlocutors in the region and beyond. We have and will continue to seek out opportunities to raise the issue of the urgent situation in Zimbabwe through and in the margins of multilateral fora including the EU and the UN.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what information he has on the time taken to administer the registration of lasting powers of attorney by the Public Guardian Office (PGO); and what steps are being taken to improve the performance of the PGO in this respect. [201243]</p>

 The Mental Capacity Act 2005 was fully implemented on 1 October 2007. It also introduced new lasting powers of attorney (LPAs) to enable people to appoint someone to make decisions on their behalf in relation to their property and affairs and/or their health and welfare.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_625"><a name="80429w0033.htm_para10"><a name="08043010000275">In addition, enduring powers of attorney (EPAs) made prior to October 2007 remain valid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_626"><a name="80429w0033.htm_para11"><a name="08043010000276">All LPAs must be registered with the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) before they can be used. EPAs only need to be registered with the OPG once the person to whom they relate has lost capacity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_627"><a name="80429w0033.htm_para12"><a name="08043010000277">The total number of applications to register both types of power of attorney since the new legislation came into force in October has greatly exceeded forecasts. The last three months in particular have seen volumes again increase even more sharply. This has put a strain on resources and led to delays.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_628"><a name="80429w0033.htm_para13"><a name="08043010000278">It is currently taking staff around six weeks to process and check LPAs to ensure they are valid before other parties can be notified that an application has been made. Applications then enter a statutory waiting period of 42 days during which objections can be made against the application. This is an important safeguard to allow any concerns about the power to be aired. Where no objections are received, staff are registering the power and notifying the applicant within another week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_629"><a name="80429w0033.htm_para14"><a name="08043010000279">Steps have been taken to address the delays in this process which exist mainly at the point where applications are received and checked:</p>

 In response to consistent feedback received from children, young people and their families that there are not enough safe and stimulating places for them to play, we have made the biggest ever investment in play by Government. A total of &#163;235 million over the next three years (2008-09 to 2010-11) will be made available to all local authorities to provide a range of innovative play facilities, accessible to all children. A total of 30 &#145;Pathfinder&#146; authorities will each receive on average &#163;2 million capital and a substantial amount of revenue funding to develop public play areas and deliver 30 adventure playgrounds by 2011. By 2010 all the remaining authorities will each receive on average &#163;1 million capital and a contribution towards their revenue costs to deliver our aim of developing up to 3,500 public play areas by 2011. The development of all sites will be shaped by local children, parents and communities to help meet the clear demand from the public for improved play facilities that our Children's Plan consultations revealed.</p>

 Home to School transport is not arranged around the three age groups quoted in the question. local authorities (LAs) have to make transport arrangements where they consider it 'necessary', to secure a child's attendance at school. Where they consider transport 'necessary', it must be free of charge. LAs have wide discretion in deciding whether transport is necessary, but they must provide free home to school transport for pupils of compulsory school age who are attending their nearest suitable school, provided that the school is beyond the statutory walking distances (two miles for pupils below the age of eight years and three miles for those aged eight years and over).</p>

At secondary age (11 to 16), pupils attending one of their three nearest schools that is between two and six miles from the child's home, and those attending their nearest school preferred on grounds of religion or belief, between two and 15 miles, will be entitled to free transport from September 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_704"><a name="80429w0041.htm_para0"><a name="08043010001700">Until 2002/03, Ofsted recorded lessons observed during inspections as being set, streamed, mixed ability or otherwise organised. For clarity, 'setting' is the term used to describe the organisation of pupils in classes on the basis of their prior attainment in the particular subject being taught. The term 'banding', which is very similar to streaming, is used when the decision as to which pupils are included or not in a class is based on the prior attainment in a range of subjects.</p>

Juveniles are not held under Operation Safeguard itself although over this period our records indicate that 36 juveniles were held overnight on an ad hoc basis. It is not possible to break this figure down by age without incurring disproportionate cost. The Government's policy is that juveniles should be held overnight in police cells only in the most exceptional circumstances. It does not happen routinely.</p>

 I have been asked to reply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_709"><a name="80429w0041.htm_para5"><a name="08043010001722">In 2000 the Secretary of State issued guidance on matters to be taken into account by Ofwat, the industry's economic regulator, in agreeing companies' charges schemes, including charging non-household users that are not businesses. These include places of worship, community facilities, charities and voluntary bodies. The guidance stated that those making similar demands on a service should be charged on the same basis. It also made clear that where premises impose customer-related costs in line with or lower than those of typical households, they should be able to benefit from tariffs which reflect their small demand on the water system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_710"><a name="80429w0041.htm_para6"><a name="08043010001723">Churches were traditionally zero rated under the rateable value system of charging, meaning that they did not have to pay surface water drainage (SWD) charges. However the replacement of rateable value charges for SWD with a site area based charge means that churches will be required to pay surface water drainage charges and will no longer benefit from the cross subsidy that resulted from the rateable value system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_711"><a name="80429w0041.htm_para7"><a name="08043010001724">Ofwat reviewed companies' approaches to charging for SWD in 2003. In RD35/03, &#145;Surface water drainage&#151;charging policy&#146; (September 2003), Ofwat concluded that charging according to site area was the best method of charging for SWD. Ofwat recommended that water companies consider introducing site area-based charging for SWD&#151;particularly for non-household customers where the process is simpler to implement. However Ofwat also noted that, given that set up and administration costs of introducing this method were considerable, and would vary depending on customer base, it was for individual companies to decide if the benefits of implementing site area SWD charging outweighed the costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_712"><a name="80429w0041.htm_para8"><a name="08043010001725">For sewerage customers served by United Utilities the site area based SWD charge was introduced in 2007-08 for new and substantially altered properties. In 2008-09 it is being introduced for all non-household properties, including churches. The move to site area charging will be phased in over three years to reduce the year-on-year impact on those customers who will see an increase in their charges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_713"><a name="80429w0041.htm_para9"><a name="08043010001726">The most cost reflective way of charging non-household customers for SWD is by reference to the customer's site area, because the larger the site area, the more surface water will drain from it. SWD charges based on site area are only payable for areas which drain (directly or indirectly) into public sewers. Chargeable areas will be adjusted to take account of large grassy or gravelled areas, such as church yards or burial grounds that do not drain into a public sewer. Surface area based charging offers strong incentives to customers to reduce surface water drainage costs they impose on companies, for example by installing soakaways. Charges can therefore be mitigated by customers by installing such devices. The approach aligns with the Government's water strategy for fair, affordable and cost reflective water and sewerage charges which incentivise environmentally responsible behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_714"><a name="80429w0041.htm_para10"><a name="08043010001727">Companies are obliged under their licences to ensure that charges are neither unduly preferential or unduly discriminatory between groups of customers. Ofwat therefore considers that churches and other places of worship should be treated no differently to other non-household customers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_715"><a name="80429w0041.htm_para11"><a name="08043010001728">Ofwat has held discussions with the Consumer Council for Water which supports the proposal for all companies to charge surface water drainage by site area.</p>
