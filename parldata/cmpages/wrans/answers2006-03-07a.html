<p><a name="st_38"><a name="60307w04.html_spnew6"><b> Jane Kennedy  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 2 March 2006]:</i> The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency&#039;s (MHRA) Sentinel programme, began in 2002 following formal Government procurement processes. The expected life of the programme is 10 years and to date has cost around &#163;19 million, which incorporates enhancements to the scope of the original programme. The MHRA is currently using Sentinel to handle all applications for marketing authorisations and variations, for clinical trial certificates and for import and export licences, as well as a range of internal corporate functions, and will soon extend Sentinel to pharmacovigilence, including new capabilities for signal generation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60307w04.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_27">Recently assessment approval times have lengthened, mainly due to delays in validating applications, and assessment targets are not being met in a proportion of cases although urgent cases are being processed promptly. Some technical problems were encountered when parts of the Sentinel programme were implemented, which is not unusual for a project of this complexity, but those have been or are being resolved. Positive improvements have already been achieved and more are forecast. Sentinel&#039;s development is founded in its ability to handle electronic submissions and as industry increases its use of the external portal for this purpose, the workflow will be further streamlined.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60307w04.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_28">Sentinel completely revolutionises the MHRA&#039;s approach to information management and processing and will put the them in a leading position in its ability to handle electronic submissions, attract revenues from within and outside the United Kingdom and to remain a centre of excellence for medicines regulation. It will enable improved access to information to assist in the protection of public health and provide a better service to all its stakeholders.

As far as policy on forestry is concerned, the Government are working closely with the NGO Global Witness on how best to protect Burma&#039;s forests. Their recent report, &quot;A Choice for China&quot; calls for a ban on illegally logged timber. It did not, however, support a ban on all timber from Burma in recognition of the complexity of the problem. Instead, Global Witness called for timber companies not to import illegally logged timber, and for the Chinese Government to suspend importation of logs and processed timber across the China-Burma border. This is pending a review of the legality of all logging operations in Kachin state. Global Witness&#039;s work has had a significant impact in Burma, and as a result of their highlighting this problem, the State Peace and Development Council and the Chinese Government have taken steps to clamp down on the illegal trade. According to Global Witness, the destructive logging and vast timber trade on the China-Burma border have come to a near halt over the past four months although it is not clear how permanent such moves will be.

As no charges have been paid before, the Government decided to ease the transition towards full cost recovery, phasing in the charges gradually over a three-year period. The new affordability tariff in Northern Ireland will be based on income and set at a level equivalent to 3 per cent. of the single person&#039;s pension credit guarantee, as updated by Parliament each year.

<i>[holding answer 27 February 2006]:</i> The Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) is wholly owned by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). NERC science budget allocation has doubled since 1997 to 334 million for this year, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining the quality of environmental research in the UK. NERC is responsible for determining the details of how this funding is allocated to specific activities. NERC is currently considering the input from a wide consultation with stakeholders on proposals on how best CEH can contribute on a sustainable basis to UK environmental science in the future.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60307w16.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_125">NERC has set out the criteria used in developing the proposals in the CEH Business Plan (available on the NERC website). The proposals were informed by assessments by an international peer review and a moderating panel, leading to recommendations to NERC Council from NERC&#039;s Science and Innovation Strategy Board. This included assessment of the science quality, value for money and the fit of the CEH science proposal to NERC&#039;s strategy. In addition, there was input from a strategic review of CEH conducted by independent consultants in 2005, which enabled NERC to estimate the likely level of future commissioned research income that CEH could expect to win. NERC also factored in the necessary level of future investment in the facilities for the research carried out by CEH.

The tree at NPL is one of a number of similar descendants around the world. Public access to this tree is not possible but a similar, and perhaps more directly related, tree can be seen at Woolsthorpe Manor, which is in the care of the National Trust.

 Under UN Treaties, the Government are internationally responsible for activities in outer space carried on by its nationals, and assumes certain liabilities for damage caused to third parties as a result of those activities. The Department administers the Outer Space Act 1986, which requires that such space activities be licensed. Anyone who carries on a licensable activity gives an unlimited indemnity to the Government against claims. The Department seeks to secure indemnification in part by requiring &#163;100 million insurance cover. If the insurance policy proved insufficient to cover a particular claim, the licensee would be required to indemnify the Government of the excess. However, if the licensee were unable to meet this, the Government would have to fund the remainder from its own resources. Hence, there is a contingent liability.

 We keep under review the use of reduced rates for construction work where these could help support regeneration and renewal, and to date have targeted relief at areas of specific need, such as certain residential conversions (including converting a non-residential property into single household dwellings or converting a house into flats) and the renovation of housing that has been empty for more than three years. These measures have helped bring vacant homes back into use and create new homes through better use of the UK&#039;s existing housing stock. However, a blanket reduced rate for all household repairs is unlikely to be an efficient or well-targeted use of resources.

 The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) is working closely with the Department of Agriculture and Food (DAF) in the Republic of Ireland in taking measures to deal with the threat of avian influenza. Given the mutual interest in ensuring that any outbreak on the island is identified quickly as a first step to its eradication and recognising the importance of the poultry industry, DARD officials have had frequent contact with their counterparts in Dublin over recent months to exchange information and discuss the respective approaches. These discussions have covered such issues as wild bird surveillance, the assessment of risk, preventive actions taken to date in both jurisdictions, and contingency planning. DAF officials have participated as observers in the exercises DARD has held to test its contingency plan and DARD officials have participated as observers in the Republic of Ireland. DARD has been invited to send an observer to meetings of the recently convened Republic of Ireland&#039;s Avian Influenza Expert Advisory Group.

 The Department has issued guidance to schools indicating that wherever possible preference should be given to newly qualified teachers, or experienced teachers seeking to return to employment, rather than prematurely retired teachers, when filling vacancies. Schools have also been advised that they should recruit to vacancies on a permanent rather than temporary basis unless the vacancy is clearly of a temporary nature.

 It was disappointing that the European Court of Auditors (EGA) was unable last November to give a positive Statement of Assurance on the EC Budget for 2004. It is encouraging, however, that there have been noticeable improvements since 2003 with pre-accession expenditure once again being cleared, as it was in 2002, and, for the first time, certain areas of agricultural expenditure also gaining clearance. This has meant that around 35 per cent. of EC Budget expenditure was cleared in 2004 compared with only 6 per cent. in 2003. Much of the European Court of Auditors&#039; difficulty in giving a positive assurance on the EU budget payments as a whole arises in the budget sector managed by the member states, who are responsible for 80 per cent. of spending under the EU budget. That is why, during our Presidency, we encouraged member states to take on a greater share of the responsibility for signing off the accounts. We succeeded in securing an agreement that will contribute to bringing about a step change in the EU&#039;s financial management and control at a meeting of EU Economic and Finance Ministers on 8 November 2005. We hope that, over time, implementation of the action points in these conclusions will enable the EGA to give positive Statements of Assurance to the EC Budget in future years.

This will be a challenging task&#151;merging the two governments involves downsizing from 27 to 16 Ministries and reunifying some 400,000 civil servants from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and more than 500,000 civil servants from the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP).

 Our Welfare Reform Green Paper; &quot;A new deal for welfare, Empowering people for work&quot;; set out our proposals for the future of the welfare state and builds on the success of our welfare to work policies such as new deal and Pathways to Work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60307w34.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_257">The funding for welfare reform has been drawn from the budgets provided to the Department through the 2004 Spending Review settlement which covered the financial years 2005&#150;06 to 2007&#150;08. Details are available in The departmental report 2005 (Cm 6539) published in June 2005. The &#163;360 million funding is largely to be spent extending the Pathways to Work programme beyond the pilot areas and covers 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08, but may also be used to fund other measures dependent on responses to the consultation.

<a name="stpa_258">While we are still in the consultation phase a detailed costing of the various parts of our proposals is not possible. This is especially the case in relation to the costs for each Pathways to Work scheme as we are looking to the private and voluntary sector to deliver many of the Pathways schemes and it is not possible to provide detailed costs prior to contract negotiations. This is also the case when it comes to the need for additional medical professionals where we are consulting to develop the detail of the new personal capability assessment.

<p>
<a name="60307w34.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_259">However, I can tell you that if every current incapacity benefit recipient was given a work focussed interview at least once a year, we estimate the cost would be around &#163;80 million annually. The actual costs would be dependent on the numbers joining and leaving the benefit during any one year. But, although the cost savings from measures outlined in the Green Paper depend to a large extent on the final proposals following the consultation, we know that the existing Pathways pilots are already generating savings, and we expect further savings from further roll-out.

Where these checks produce doubt about the nature or extent of an individual&#039;s incapacity, a fresh personal capability assessment will be required.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister for what reason he has <i>(a)</i> reduced the funding and <i>(b)</i> proposed a new distribution formula model for the Supporting People programme in North Yorkshire. [56033]</p>




<p><a name="st_350"><a name="60307w36.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 The Government commissioned an Independent Review into the Supporting People programme following significant late growth in estimated costs from &#163;1.4 billion in December 2002 to &#163;1.8 billion by March 2003. The review reported in January 2004 that there are wide variations in unit costs between authorities and that &#163;1.8 billion was too much to pay for the services provided.

<a name="60307w36.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_275">Reductions in the Supporting People programme grant reflect the findings of the independent review and subsequent work carried out on value for money including work commissioned into the efficient use of legacy funding and the results of Audit Commission inspections. These studies demonstrate that there is significant potential for making efficiency savings in the current pattern of service provision whilst safeguarding valuable services.

<a name="stpa_276">The draft distribution formula is currently out for consultation and all responses have now been received (deadline 28 February). The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is currently going through the responses and a final decision on the Supporting People distribution formula will be made in the summer with the launch of the Supporting People strategy.

We continue to keep the impact of VAT on different types of building work under review, and have introduced reduced rates where they support our regeneration and renewal objectives. However, while agreements with our European partners allow us to keep our zero rates as they currently stand, we cannot extend them or introduce new ones. This means that in order to

harmonise the rates of VAT on new build housing and repair, we would first have to give up our current zero rate for construction of new housing. We have no current plans to give up any of our existing construction zero rates.
