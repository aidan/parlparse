 Before a non-European Union (EU) country is approved to export to the EU, the exporting country must have acceptable disease status, the recognised standard for relevant control authorities and guarantees from the country of origin with regard to compliance with EU import rules and results of EU missions to these countries. A list of those countries approved for export of beef can be found in Commission Regulation (EU) No. 206/2010. For countries which are regionalised for beef exports (certain countries in Southern Africa and South America) all exported meat is required to be deboned and matured in approved premises as a risk mitigation measure.</p>

This must confirm that the meat is derived from animals that have been subjected to a veterinary inspection during the 24 hours prior to slaughter and showed no signs of disease. Imports of products of animal origin (POAO) are checked at approved facilities at Border Inspection Posts (BIPS). All consignments of imported meat have a documentary check on the veterinary certification, and an identity check, to match the goods to the certification. A minimum of 20% of consignments of meat imported from non-EU countries undergoes a physical check by an official veterinary surgeon, and this rises to 50% for poultry and game.</p>

 We recognise the concerns of livestock and horse keepers about the risks Chinese (or sky) lanterns can present to their animals’ welfare. We are working with other Government Departments to see what action could be taken to reduce these risks and have had several meetings with the farming unions and the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) to discuss what could be done. We are working with them to build an evidence base of the problems caused and to help raise awareness among consumers and venues. BIS is also working with local authority trading standards to encourage importers, distributors and retailers to improve the safety of these products and to make them fully biodegradable.</p>

               <b>Mr Robathan:</b>
 The following table provides the number of claims awarded under the Armed Forces and Reserve Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) within the tariff of injury table for amputations for financial year 2009-10. The breakdown is by tariff level at which the amputation was awarded (for more than one condition the figure includes the condition awarded at the most serious tariff level only) and provides the lump sum amounts that are currently awarded at each tariff level. Claims are awarded under the AFCS based on 15 tariff levels, with a lump sum attached to each level. For the more severe injuries, tariffs one to 11, a further sum is paid in the form of a guaranteed income payment (GIP), which consists of regular payments to provide a continuous income stream.</p>

In Scotland they take account of the personal financial circumstances of the injured service person when assessing affordability.</p>

 The strategic defence and security review set out the long term plans for our armed forces and made clear that the future force structure will require fewer people. The combined size of the Royal Navy, the Army and the Royal Air Force will fall by some 17,000, by 31 March 2015. Some of this reduction will be achieved by slowing down recruitment and through natural wastage, and the Department has estimated that up to around 11,000 personnel will need to be made redundant.</p>

 The basing of British forces in Germany is largely a legacy of the cold war, when very different geo-strategic considerations prevailed. It now makes operational sense to consolidate British forces within the UK. This will enable us to generate capability and prepare for operations without the logistical and administrative difficulties presented by a field army split between two countries.</p>

For example, FCO, DECC, and MOD energy Ministers have all visited Norway since the SDSR; a State visit by the Emir of Qatar took place in October 2010; the Deputy Prime Minister visited Kazakhstan in December 2010. More regular ministerial contact has been established with UK-based International Oil Companies to support UK commercial energy interests. We are working through the EU, G20 and other international fora to increase price stability and mitigate risks to supply. A new International Energy Forum charter was agreed in February 2011 to enhance producer-consumer dialogue.</p>

 I refer the right hon. Member to the answer given to the hon. Member for Houghton and Sunderland South (Bridget Phillipson) on 2 March 2011, <i>Official Report,</i> column 453W. The Ministry of Defence announced significant reductions to both civilian and military personnel as part of the Strategic Defence and Security Review. Final savings figures on redundancies will depend on detailed implementation of these reductions, which will include early release and natural wastage, as well as redundancies. Estimates are subject to change and the MOD is therefore not prepared to release more detailed figures at this time.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 4 March 2011]:</i> The Secretary of State reports to Parliament on the exercise of her powers under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005—and on criminal proceedings for breaches of control orders—on a quarterly basis, and additionally on an ad hoc basis if required. At 10 December 2010, the end of the period covered by the most recent such report (16 December 2010, <i>Official Report</i>
               <i>,</i> columns 124-25WS), 48 individuals had ever been subject to a control order. Of these, 10 have been charged with breaching their control order, two have been convicted; one was acquitted; one absconded before trial; one foreign national left the UK voluntarily and charges remain on file; three cases were discontinued as the Crown Prosecution Service concluded it was not in the public interest to prosecute; and two are currently awaiting trial.</p>

               <a name="11031414000521"> All of the individuals currently subject to a control order, and most of those who have ever been subject to a control order, are also subject to a court-imposed anonymity order. This prevents the publication of information that would identify, or would tend to identify, an individual as being subject to a control order. Since clarifying any offences (other than breaching their control order) for which these individuals have been prosecuted—together with information already in the public domain about individuals who have been charged with offences, including in particular terrorism offences—would tend to breach the court imposed anonymity order, it is not possible to provide this information.</p>

 The Government recognise the challenges that are faced by Dyfed-Powys-police in covering a large geographical area with a single helicopter but also recognises the need to provide value for money for the taxpayer. The introduction of a National Police Air Service (NPAS) from 1 April 2012 will provide a mixed fleet of rotary and fixed-wing aircraft that will operate across borders. The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) believes that the replacement of the Dyfed-Powys helicopter with a fixed-wing aircraft is a more effective solution giving eight hours more coverage and greater resilience across the whole of Wales.</p>

 A number of international organisations, including Eurostat, have attempted to collate international homicide statistics. It is important to note that there are issues surrounding the comparability of international homicide data. There are different definitions of homicide between countries, although definitions vary less than for some other types of crimes. Furthermore, there are differing points in criminal justice systems at which homicides are recorded, i.e. when the offence is discovered or following further investigation.</p>

The Eurostat published rate for England and Wales is 13.5, for Scotland is 21.4 and for Northern Ireland is 15.2. Eurostat calculated the England and Wales rate using the recorded crime returns rather than the Homicide Index. If the Homicide Index had been used, the figure would be slightly lower.</p>

 World Bank Group lending to renewable energy projects (excluding large hydropower) has been steadily increasing, and reached $1.4 billion in 2009 and $1.5 billion in 2010. However, I believe all the multilateral development banks, including the World Bank, should be doing even more to support a shift to climate-smart investment and lending. I will be raising this when I visit the bank in April.</p>

Current commitments under the Clean Technology Fund (CTF), the largest of the CIFs, amount to $3.1 billion for over 12 gigawatts of new renewable energy capacity, sufficient to provide power to almost 16 million households. We also provide core funding to the World Bank's Energy Sector Management Assistance Program, which helps countries develop roadmaps for renewable energy deployment and better understand the costs and benefits of renewables when compared to fossil fuels.</p>

               <i> [holding answer 28 February 2011]:</i> The Government have made a clear commitment to raising the participation age to 17 in 2013 and 18 in 2015. This includes a major commitment in the spending review of October 2010 to fund sufficient education and training places. In addition, we are simplifying the post-16 commissioning system to free providers from red tape, introducing a funding system based on “lagged” student numbers that will ensure that funding follows students’ choices, and continuing the process of ensuring that all 16 to 17-year-olds receive a suitable offer of a place in education or training to help match supply and demand. The Government are also ending the disparity between post-16 funding between schools and colleges. We are giving schools responsibility for careers guidance at Key Stages 3 and 4 to ensure that it is fully tailored to young people’s needs. Local authorities retain their statutory duty to encourage and enable young people to participate in education and training.</p>

HET did commission the Institute of Education to carry out an evaluation of the LFA project in 2009, which sampled five LFA regions which took part in the project in the spring and summer of 2009. Among the key findings were that 98% of participants assessed the project as excellent and 2% as good, and 74% of teachers either agreed or strongly agreed that participation in the project had positively impacted on the school’s teaching and learning about the Holocaust. Over 6,200 students and 1,700 teachers in England have participated in the project since it began in 1999.</p>

This is why we have kept the number of core subjects in the English Baccalaureate small enough to allow wider study. Subjects, such as religious studies, philosophy, and economics, which do not count towards the English Baccalaureate, can and will play a part in a well rounded, rigorous education. Achievement in these subjects will continue to be recognised in the performance tables as part of the A*-C measure and the teaching of religious education remains compulsory throughout a pupil’s schooling. However we remain open to arguments about how we can further improve every measure in the performance tables—including the English Baccalaureate.</p>

 As part of our work to ensure that we are able to achieve the Department’s policy priorities and as part of the Public Bodies Review, we looked at the key functions and programmes carried out by the Training and Development Agency (TDA) and other departmental organisations. We tested the potential for strengthened accountability to Parliament, greater value for money and reduced bureaucracy, In the case of the TDA, and subject to legislation, we decided that the key functions will transfer to the Department for Education, where they will be exercised by an Executive agency that is directly accountable to Ministers.</p>

 Evidence suggests that Connexions services are not consistently providing high quality careers guidance to young people. The Ofsted report “Moving Through The System”, published in March 2010, reported that there was considerable variability in the quality of information, advice and guidance provided. In a 2010 survey by the Edge Foundation, 51% of young people reported that information, advice and guidance is not meeting their needs. The Government want to restore a focus on independent, professional careers guidance for young people and adults which is based on accurate labour market information and strong evidence about the impact of individuals’ decisions on their future prospects.</p>

 The National Health Service Blood and Transplant/Health Protection Agency joint surveillance programme monitors transfusion transmitted infections in blood and tissue donors and transfusion recipients, with the aim of protecting patient safety and public health.

               <a name="11031426000874"> Bacterial contamination of platelet components is a serious, potentially life threatening, hazard of transfusion and the most common transfusion transmitted infection. Since 2002, a number of measures have been introduced to minimise this risk, including arm-cleansing to reduce contamination from the blood donor’s skin at the time of donation and diversion of the first 20-30 millilitres of the donation. In addition, screening of donated platelets for evidence of bacterial infection should be in place in England and North Wales by April 2011.</p>

 The Department has made no such estimates. Seasonal allergic rhinitis is thought to affect about 10% of the United Kingdom population although the true prevalence may be higher. An analysis of the available epidemiological information, published with the Department's review of services for allergy in July 2006, estimated that the rates of general practitioner (GP) consultation for males and females by age group in 2004 were as in the following table. These figures will however understate the number of people suffering from hay fever, since many people with this condition do not consult a doctor.</p>

Foundation trusts must either comply with the code, or explain clearly the reasons why they do not do so.</p>

 Gift aid transitional relief was introduced as a temporary measure to give charities time to prepare their financial plans in response to a lower rate of relief from gift aid. By April 2011, when the relief ends, charities will have had four years since the announcement of the 20% basic rate of income tax to prepare for the change. In 2009-10 charities benefited by £105 million from this relief and it is forecast that they will benefit by £120 million in 2010-11. The Government believe the £100 million transition fund announced in the spending review will better target support on charities most in need.</p>

 European funding for transport schemes is not allocated by transport mode and so it is not possible to say what proportion of the budget is available for road improvements in an average year. In the current financial perspective (2007-13) the UK has been awarded over €95 million in funding from the TEN-T programme for road projects.</p>

 The Maritime and Coastguard Agency does not allocate its budget on an individual Maritime, Rescue and Co-ordination Centre basis. This reflects the fact that the Agency operates nationally, with only some costs attributable to individual centres by virtue of where they are domiciled, and others being part of the national infrastructure and thus not separately identifiable.</p>

 Between 2006 and 2010, the coastguard used the four emergency towing vessels (ETVs) on a total of 182 occasions. Of this, 134 were incidents where ETVs were sent to stand-by vessels, but where they were not required to render towage services.

 In 2007, the Department for Transport asked Network Rail to carry out preliminary work to assess the case for longer or double deck trains as a way of providing additional capacity on the rail network. Due to the infrastructure changes that would be required, the report concluded that lengthening trains is a more cost-effective solution.</p>

 The UK Renewable Energy Action Plan, published last summer, shows we expect the use of biomass in the UK heat and power sector to deliver around 6,085 ktoe (kilotonnes of oil equivalent) of renewable energy generation per year by 2020. This equates to biomass heat and electricity contributing around 30% of the renewable energy needed to meet the UK’s renewable energy target in 2020.</p>

 Forecasts of the late summer Arctic sea ice minimum can only be made a few months ahead, so will not be available until June at the earliest. In 2010 summer sea ice was the third lowest since satellite records began in 1979. So far in 2011 the sea ice extent has continued to be significantly lower than the 1979 to 2000 average.</p>

They are not a basis for deciding whether a particular proposal is acceptable or not on landscape and visual grounds. The final decision will take account of all relevant factors, and therefore we do not believe that further guidance is needed.</p>

 The Planning Act 2008 provides for applications for development consent in respect of nationally significant infrastructure projects (NSIPs) to be examined and decided by the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC), and for the Government to set out policy on the consenting of such projects in National Policy Statements. In the case of electricity network infrastructure, NSIPs are defined as overhead electricity lines whose nominal voltage is expected to be 132 kV or above. The Government intend to finalise and formally approve the energy National Policy Statements in spring 2011.</p>

In view of these permitted development rights there is generally no need for proposals for the underground cable elements of a project to be caught by the Planning Act regime, although (in England) it would be possible for the developer to include aspects of an underground scheme other than the cable itself (such as sealing end compounds) in a Planning Act application as associated development. If the installation of an underground cable would be likely to have a significant effect on a site protected by the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010, the developer would have to seek the approval of the local planning authority before proceeding to rely on general permitted development rights.</p>

 Much of the new low carbon electricity generation infrastructure (including many renewable technologies and nuclear generation) required to support the delivery of the UK’s climate change obligations and ensure energy security will need to be located in places where there is no existing transmission network infrastructure. Significant reinforcement of the electricity transmission network will therefore be required over the coming years to ensure this new generation can be connected, and the Government have taken this network expansion into account in the draft energy national policy statements. The impacts and costs of different connection methods, such as overhead lines and underground cables, will vary considerably from one project to another, and each project in England and Wales will therefore be assessed by the Infrastructure Planning Commission individually on the basis of its specific circumstances. The Government intend to finalise and formally approve the energy national policy statements in spring 2011.</p>

 In 2010, provisional figures show that liquefied natural gas (LNG) accounted for 35% of UK gas imports, or around 16% of gross demand. The majority (around three quarters) of LNG imports came from Qatar, with the remainder largely sourced from Trinidad and Tobago, Algeria, and Norway.</p>

LNG operations and shipping through the Suez canal have continued uninterrupted throughout the recent unrest in Egypt and Tunisia, and LNG infrastructure is well protected. The UK has low direct dependence for gas on countries in the middle east and north Africa (MENA) region, and any loss of LNG supplies from MENA countries could be replaced by alternate sources.

 Eligibility for disability living allowance is based on care and mobility needs. The current assessment for disability living allowance is subjective and inconsistent. We want to ensure support is targeted on those disabled people who are most impacted by their health condition or impairment. Personal independence payment will support disabled people to lead full, active and independent lives and the assessment will consider their ability to carry out a range of key day-to-day activities. We are developing the assessment with a group of independent specialists in health, social care and disability. It is still being developed and the detailed criteria will be set out in regulations.</p>

            <p>further detail on the reform is developed. The disability living allowance reform impact assessment, published on 16 February 2011, estimated approximate high level costs to be £675 million over five years (real terms, net present value). These include provision for making changes to the IT systems, training DWP staff, the administrative effort required to manage the transition of existing recipients to the new system and the cost of independent health care professionals undertaking the new assessment. As the new assessment for personal independence payment and the process for reassessing the existing DLA case load are still being developed, I am unable, at this stage, to provide a precise estimate for the cost of reassessment alone.</p>

 The independent living fund is a discretionary trust and payments from the fund do not take precedence over the responsibility of the local authority to make an assessment of a user's needs. Local authorities have the statutory responsibility to provide social care support to their residents and as part of this responsibility they will need to consider the requirements of people who may otherwise have received an additional package from the independent living fund. However, although there was no requirement for the Department to undertake an assessment, it did discuss the changes to the independent living fund with disability organisations, local government representatives and colleagues in the Department of Health.</p>

 Under the Domestic Violence Crime and Victims Act 2004, victims of certain serious violent and sexual offences, where the offender receives a custodial sentence of 12 months or more, may elect to receive information about key developments in the offender's sentence through the Victim Contact Scheme operated by probation trusts. Such key information will include where offenders are moved to open conditions, where they are granted a work placement in the community for rehabilitation and the month of release from prison.</p>

               <a name="11031440000376"> Eligible victims are able to make representations about conditions which may be attached to the offender's licence on release and under probation supervision. They can, for example, request that the offender is excluded from a particular area, such as where they (the victims) live.</p>

               <a name="11031440000377"> The scheme is flexible enough to allow probation trusts, in exceptional circumstances, to provide key information to victims who do not meet the statutory criteria. Such circumstances might include, for example, domestic violence cases where the offender was given a sentence of less than 12 months, but where the victim wishes to opt in, even though such an offender would not be subject to licensed supervision.</p>

 The Legal Services Commission's (LSC) costs for defending judicial reviews in the last financial year (2009-10) were £224,119. This represents the total costs of external legal advice for public law judicial reviews. The LSC does not hold a more detailed breakdown showing individual categories of law in an easily accessible format and therefore such a breakdown could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

 I met with the Association of British Insurers (ABI) on 29 July. During the consultation period for Proposals for Reform of Civil Litigation Funding and Costs in England and Wales—Implementation of Lord Justice Jackson’s Recommendations, I hosted three roundtable discussions with interested parties. The first, on 2 December 2010 aimed to include parties on all sides of the debate; claimant and defendant solicitors, insurers, after the event (ATE) insurers and other interested parties. I then held meetings with a group of claimant practitioners on 18 January 2011, and defendant practitioners, including insurers and the ABI on 19 January 2011.</p>

Training begins with an eight week (40 working days) Prison Officer Entry Level Training (POELT) course, which is mainly college- based.

                     <sup>(1)</sup> Includes all types of mortgage lenders.
<sup>(2)</sup> Includes all types of landlords whether social or private.
<sup>(3)</sup> Landlord actions include those made under both standard and accelerated procedures. Landlord actions via the accelerated procedure enables the orders to be made solely on the basis of written evidence for shorthold tenancies, when the fixed period of tenancy has come to an end.
<sup>(4)</sup> The number of claims that lead to an order includes all claims in which the first order, whether outright or suspended, is made during the period.
<sup>(5)</sup> The court, following a judicial hearing, may grant an order for possession immediately. This entitles the claimant to apply for a warrant to have the defendant evicted. However, even where a warrant for possession is issued, the parties can still negotiate a compromise to prevent eviction.
<sup>(6)</sup> Includes outright and suspended orders, the latter being where the court grants the claimant possession but suspends the operation of the order. Provided the defendant complies with the terms of suspension, which usually require the defendant to pay the current mortgage or rent instalments plus some of the accrued arrears, the possession order cannot be enforced.
<sup>(7)</sup> Due to constituency boundary changes which occurred at the recent general election on 6 May 2010, the constituency figures are based on boundaries defined prior to the election from 2000 up to and including the first quarter of 2010 (January-March) and on boundaries after the election for the remaining three quarters of 2010.
<sup>(8)</sup> Due to the lack of valid postcode data, counts for landlord possession cases are only available from 2003 onwards.
<sup>(9)</sup> All figures are rounded to the nearest 5.
<sup>(10)</sup> Figures for 2010 are provisional.

 An export licence is required to export arms and other military equipment from the United Kingdom. All export licence applications are rigorously assessed on a case-by-case basis against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria taking account of all prevailing circumstances at the time of the application. A licence will not be issued where to do so would be inconsistent with the criteria or other relevant announced commitments. In particular criterion two concerns the ‘respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the country of final destination’, and states that the Government will not issue an export licence if there is a clear risk that the proposed export might be used for internal repression. If a re-export of concern comes to light we can and do factor that into our assessment of subsequent licence applications for similar goods to that destination.</p>

 Standardisation of the prequalification process features frequently in my discussions with the construction industry, particularly with those bodies representing small firms in the sector. The National Specialist Contractors' Council estimate that completing multiple prequalification questionnaires costs the industry £250 million a year, much of which could be saved. The industry is very supportive of the PAS91 approach and is working with Government to ensure the standard is widely adopted. We would expect to review the standard early next year in the light of a year's experience of its use in the public sector and more widely.</p>

               <b>Mr Willetts:</b>
 It is for institutions themselves to determine the criteria they will use in making bursaries and other financial assistance available to their students. The Director of Fair Access has made clear in his guidance to institutions that he will normally expect such support to be targeted at the most disadvantaged students and that he will only take account in his assessment of access agreements of financial support directed at those entitled to state maintenance grants. In regard specifically to the new National Scholarship Programme, we have announced that only those with low family income below £25,000 a year should be considered, but institutions will decide who to help from this broad group according to their priorities for widening participation and access.</p>

 The Department has made no such assessment. However research published by the Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD) on 8 December 2010 stated that the UK grocery market was worth £150.8 billion for the calendar year 2010, an increase of 3.1% on 2009, and that 21p in every £1 spent on food and grocery is spent in convenience stores. The IGD also found that in 2009 there were 7,970 hypermarkets, supermarkets and superstores compared with 73,539 traditional retailers and convenience stores. Of the hypermarkets, supermarkets and superstores, 104 were independents. At the end of April 2010 there were 48,410 convenience stores in the UK, representing a year-on-year decrease of 0.5% over the latest 12 month period.</p>

I understand that as at the beginning of February 2011, the European Court of Human Rights had received approximately 3,500 claims from UK prisoners unable to vote in elections. The Court has suspended consideration of these claims on the basis that the Government will implement the Hirst and Greens and MT judgments. The Government have sought to refer the Greens and MT judgment against the UK to the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights. If the Grand Chamber agrees to the referral, they will look again at the case and issue their own judgment. How the suspended claims are dealt with may depend on whether the Grand Chamber decides to accept the referral.</p>
