To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what concessionary fare schemes for public transport are available to blind people.  [111974]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00303w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The most recent comprehensive information available to the Department comes from a survey of the position in 1995-96. Of the 331 local authorities which responded to that survey, 299 provided a concessionary travel scheme for blind people. The areas covered by these schemes included Greater London and all the six metropolitan areas. At least 32 of the schemes provided free travel; the remainder offered a range of different concessions.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the impact of the payment of Disability Living Allowance to blind people and the disabled on entitlement to local authority concessionary fare schemes.  [111975]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00303w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 A survey of the position in 1995-96 indicated some differences between local authorities as to eligibility for concessionary travel for people in receipt of Disability Living Allowance. Last year the Department of Social Security and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions issued a guidance note to local authorities suggesting that concessionary travel should not be refused to people on the grounds that they were in receipt of the mobility element of the Disability Living Allowance.

 Thameslink's initial proposals for additional capacity were set out in "Thameslink--A New Partnership for the Millennium" which they published in March 1999. Discussion of these and other proposals to enhance capacity on the Bedford to London section is continuing with the Franchising Director, who will make an announcement in due course, I have asked the Franchising Director to keep my hon. Friend directly informed of progress.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the funding schemes administered by his Department, indicating the total funds of each scheme and the administration costs of each scheme as a percentage of the total funds.  [112494]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00303w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 March 2000]:</i> Details of the schemes administered by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and information about the level of funding is given each year in the Departmental Annual Report. The 1999 Annual Report was presented to Parliament on 25 March 1999 (Cm 4204). The Department does not record its administration costs at the level of individual schemes.

<P>
<a name="00303w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions has not met the Chairman of the shadow Strategic Rail Authority to discuss redrawing the rail franchise for the North of England, but the Franchising Director will consider this together with other relevant matters when replacing the franchise in that area.

 Since 1990 my Department has allocated the following amounts to tackle single homelessness and rough sleeping.

<P>

<a name="00303w01.html_para0">The Rough Sleepers Unit was established in my Department in April 1999. This Unit has an integrated budget combining the separate single homelessness and rough sleeping programme budgets as well as budgets previously administered by other Departments.
<P>

<a name="00303w01.html_para1">Government implemented a special homelessness initiative in the early 1990s to tackle homelessness pressures in London and the South-East which was allocated partly to local authorities and partly to housing associations (through the Housing Corporation). The local authority allocations were &#163;112 million in 1990-91 and &#163;126.7 million in 1991-92.
<P>

<a name="00303w01.html_para2">Local housing authorities have statutory obligations to assist homeless persons under part VII of the Housing Act 1996 (and formerly under part III of the Housing Act 1985). This includes unintentionally homeless households with dependant children, and those who are vulnerable, totalling almost one million households between 1991-99. Funding for local authorities' activities under these provisions is provided as part of the annual local government finance settlement and is unhypothecated.

<P>
<a name="00303w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what arrangements he has made for protecting vulnerable customers under the Water Industry Act 1999.  [113477]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00303w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Water Industry (Charges) (Vulnerable Groups) Regulations 1999 were made under the Water Industry Act 1999 and laid on 22 December 1999. The regulations offer protection to customers who might face hardship affording their bills because they use large amounts of water for essential purposes and pay on a measured basis. Customers will qualify for assistance if they are in receipt of income related benefits or tax credits (Income Support, Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, Working Families Tax Credit, Disabled Person's Tax 



<P>

Credit, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit) and either <i>(a)</i> they have three dependent children under the age of 16; or <i>(b)</i> they have a medical condition requiring significant extra water use (these are defined as kidney failure requiring home dialysis, abdominal stomas, desquamation, weeping skin disease and incontinence).
<P>

<a name="00303w01.html_para3">Customers in these circumstances will be entitled to pay the average charge for the company that supplies them, rather than their actual measured charge. This represents a significant new step to tackle water poverty.
<P>

<a name="00303w01.html_para4">The wording of the 1999 Regulations could have been interpreted as excluding low income customers whose children have qualifying medical conditions. That was not the intention. Therefore the Government have today laid the Water Industry (Charges) (Vulnerable Groups) (Amendment) Regulations 2000 which ensure that low income customers can receive assistance if their children are suffering from a qualifying medical condition. This confirms the Government's commitment to helping families who might face hardship as a result of high essential water use.

 The annual Cabinet Office publication "Public Bodies" provides information on a range of public bodies. The 1997 edition lists those in existence prior to May 1997. The 1998 and 1999 editions list public bodies in existence in subsequent years. Copies of these publications have been placed in the Library of the House. Copies are also available on the Cabinet Office website (www.cabinet-office.gov.uk/quango).

<a name="00303w04.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Oaten: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what progress his Department is making in negotiations with the Greek Government on the verification of service to allow the award of Greek commemorative medals to British servicemen and women.  [112965]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00303w04.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 I presume that the medals referred to are the official campaign medals instituted by the Greek Government for service in Greece and Crete during the Second World War. In recent years the Greek Government have offered them to eligible British ex-Servicemen who have been invited to apply in writing 



<P>
<P><I>3 Mar 2000 : Column: 430W</I><P>
to the Greek Embassy in London. The Queen has granted permission for the medals to be accepted as souvenirs or keepsakes, but not to be worn.
<P>

<a name="00303w04.html_para1">The eligibility criteria, assessment of entitlement and distribution of these medals are entirely matters for the Greek Government. My Department do not directly assist the Greek authorities with the verification of eligibility. However, on request, we will provide any British veteran with an official Record of Service, which he can offer to the Greek authorities and may provide sufficient proof of participation in the campaigns in Greece and Crete, to enable the Greek Government to issue a medal.

 Today we have confirmed our plans to sell 150 tonnes of gold in 2000-01, a sum equivalent to the amount sold in 1999-2000 on a pro rata basis. These sales form part of the programme announced on 7 May 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 479W, to restructure the United Kingdom's reserves holdings. As in 1999-2000, the sales will be made through Bank of England auctions. There will be six auctions during 2000-01, which will be held every other month starting in May. As in 1999-2000, the auctions will be of approximately 25 tonnes each, and they will continue to be conducted on a single price basis.

Up-to-date information on the security situation as it affects travellers in Albania is provided in the FCO's travel advice.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00303w07.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what change in the UK's bilateral relations with Austria has resulted from the resignation of the Leader of the Freedom Party of Austria; and if he will make a statement.  [113015]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00303w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 Joerg Haider's resignation as Leader of the Freedom Party has not affected the measures introduced by the 14 members of the EU against Austria on 4 February. The issue has not been Haider's leadership of the Freedom Party, but the participation of the Freedom Party in the government of Austria. We will continue to judge the Austrian Government on how it lives up to its commitments in its Declaration.

<P>
<a name="00303w07.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the death sentences imposed on three Iranian Baha'is in the city of Mashad on 3 February; and what representations Her Majesty's Government have made to the Iranian Ambassador about them.  [113014]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00303w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 We remain concerned at reports of the death sentences passed on Mr. Najafabadi, Mr. Moghaddam and Mr. Khulusi in Mashad on 3 February. The picture has been somewhat confused by the recent statement by Mr. Sabeqi, spokesman for the Iranian Judiciary, that no such sentences had been passed. The Portuguese Presidency, on behalf of EU partners, presented a demarche to the Iranian authorities expressing our concern and seeking clarification as to the current status of these three gentlemen on 17 February. We took similar bilateral action with the Iranian Ambassador on 21 February.
<P>

<a name="00303w07.html_para0">We regularly raise with the Iranian authorities our serious concern about treatment of the Baha'is. Persecution of individuals on religious grounds is totally unacceptable.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00303w07.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Temple-Morris: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what reports he has received concerning the claims by the Iranian exile group, the National Council of Resistance, about the turnout for the recent Iranian Majles elections and falsification of results.  [113069]




<P>
<P><I>3 Mar 2000 : Column: 440W</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00303w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 I was aware of this attempt by the National Council for the Resistance of Iran (NCRI) to dismiss as a fraud the conduct and outcome of the recent Iranian elections. Their claims are not credible. The political choice made in the elections by the Iranian people is a matter for them, but our view, and that of all impartial observers, is that the election result in Iran has been a substantial vote of confidence in President Khatami's political and economic reforms, and a clear signal of the Iranian people's interest in modernisation.
<P>

<a name="00303w07.html_para1">For us, that is also a vindication of the policy of engagement with Iran pursued by this Government. That policy has attracted some criticism in the past, sometimes from the people who have accepted at face value the propaganda of the NCRI, which is an organisation dominated by the terrorist Mujahedin-e-Khalq (MKO). The MKO are based in Baghdad and are regarded by Saddam Hussein as some of his most trusted allies. They are despised by most Iranians within Iran for their support for Saddam during the Iran/Iraq war in the 1980s. They have been responsible for a series of terrorist attacks in Iran which we have condemned.
<P>

<a name="00303w07.html_para2">In our dealings with the Iranian Government we and our EU partners have regularly expressed our concern over a number of issues, particularly human rights, and we will continue to do so until those legitimate concerns are dealt with to our satisfaction. But in assessing those concerns, and the progress of events in Iran generally, we will pay little attention to the views of the MKO or NCRI, whose own background and methods do not permit them to speak with authority on democracy or human rights.
<P>

<a name="00303w07.html_para3">The outcome of the elections strengthens our optimism for the future of Iran, and for Britain's developing relationship with Iran.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00303w07.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what recent discussions he has had with the Government of Nigeria concerning the Christian-Muslim conflicts in the north of the country.  [112988]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00303w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 I discussed the situation in Northern Nigeria with Nigerian Foreign Minister Lamido on 14 February.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00303w07.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Gardiner: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs how many visa applications have been submitted to the Deputy High Commission in <i>(a)</i> Delhi, <i>(b)</i> Mumbai and <i>(c)</i> Calcutta during February 2000; and what were the figures for February 1999.  [112790]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00303w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The deadline for the submission of entry clearance statistics from overseas posts for the month of February is 15 March. I will write to my hon. Friend when the figures requested are available. I am glad that my hon. Friend was able to visit our entry clearance operations in New Delhi and Bombay recently.

<P>
<a name="00303w07.html_wqn5"><B> Dr. Marek: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what recent developments there have been in the revision of the St. Helena constitution.  [113019]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00303w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Following the publication of the White Paper "Partnership for Progress and Prosperity" we have asked the St. Helena Legislative Council what changes they would like to see in the Constitution. We have told them that we are prepared to consider specific, detailed and well argued recommendations for the amendment of the 1988 Constitutional Order.

Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle), on 14 December 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 139-40W, that Martin Narey, the Director-General of the Prison Service had selected Electronic Data Systems (EDS) as the preferred supplier for the Quantum project and that

<P><I>3 Mar 2000 : Column: 442W</I><P>
negotiations would be held with a view to award of contract. I am pleased to say that the preferred supplier negotiations with EDS have concluded successfully. Martin Narey has decided to award a contract to EDS for the provision of Information Technology services for the Prison Service.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many times in each <i>(a)</i> women's and <i>(b)</i> men's prison a prisoner has been strip-searched after a visit by an hon. Member since 1 January.  [111968]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00303w07.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Prisons are not required to maintain statistics of the number of strip searches carried out, nor records of visits by hon. Members to prisoners. I am, however, aware that a female prisoner at Highpoint prison was strip searched following a visit by her Member of Parliament on 3 February.
<P>

<a name="00303w07.html_para5">As I advised the hon. Member during the debate he raised on Tuesday 29 February, this strip search was purely a random search. All prisons are required to carry out random searches of prisoners on completion of visits; Highpoint prison has a set level of 10 per cent. for such random searches. Category A prisoners will always be strip searched following any visit in open conditions.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what surveys he undertook in 1999 in prisons in England and Wales to check the efficacy of the suicide awareness programmes.  [111978]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00303w07.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Prison Service has developed a set of auditable key performance baselines for policies and practices in prison establishments, including the suicide awareness strategy. The standards audit unit of the Prison Service visit establishments to conduct these audits.
<P>

<a name="00303w07.html_para6">In 1999, a total of 71 establishments were audited on the suicide awareness baseline. Of these, 13 achieved a rating of good; 27 acceptable; 24 deficient; and seven unacceptable.
<P>

<a name="00303w07.html_para7">The Director-General is personally committed to ensuring that the suicide awareness strategy works, as are the Director of Security, who has policy responsibility for suicide awareness, and the area managers responsible for establishments. All regularly visit establishments. Members of the suicide awareness support unit at Prison Service headquarters also visit establishments to provide support to those operating the strategy.
<P>

<a name="00303w07.html_para8">Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons also inspects prisons on a regular and unannounced basis during which he will look at the operation of the suicide awareness strategy. In addition to any recommendations that may arise from a visit to an individual prison, the Chief Inspector published a thematic review into the suicide awareness strategy in 1999. This contained a number of recommendations as to how the strategy could be improved; these recommendations are currently being acted upon.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department which prisons in England and Wales run a sex offenders treatment programme; and what was the number of prisoners attending such a programme on 15 February.  [112019]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00303w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Prison Service sex offenders treatment programme consists of four sub-programmes--core for all offenders, extended for those at high risk of re-offending, adapted for those with a low IQ, and a booster programme for all to reinforce the programme's lessons towards release from custody. A rolling programme is also being trialled for low risk offenders, and to provide a facility to enable those who have not done well on parts of the other programmes to revise elements rather than going through the whole programme again.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department who has the responsibility for the provision of foreign language newspapers or books for non-English speaking prison inmates held in prisons in England and Wales; and if he will make a statement.  [111985]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00303w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Foreign language materials are provided in prison establishments through the local public library authority, in accordance with 'Guidelines for Prison Libraries (1997)' which details the standards under which 



<P>
<P><I>3 Mar 2000 : Column: 444W</I><P>
prison libraries should operate. Each establishment has a local public authority librarian working to a joint service level agreement.
<P>

<a name="00303w08.html_para4">Governors of prisons in England and Wales will make arrangements to supply at least one newspaper for every ten prisoners, to be purchased out of prison funds They should provide as full a range of newspapers as possible, taking into account the preferences of those prisoners from ethnic minority groups. This is underpinned by the Prison Service race relations policy, which highlights the importance of prisons being aware of the needs of foreign prisoners and the materials that can be obtained to meet their needs. Subject to security considerations, prisoners are also allowed to receive newspapers, periodicals, magazines or books of their choice.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many secure remands to local authority accommodation were made since 1 June 1999 in relation to <i>(a)</i> children aged 12 to 14 years, broken down by age, gender and ethnicity, <i>(b)</i> females aged 15 to 16 years, broken down by age and ethnicity and <i>(c)</i> males aged 15 to 16 years declared vulnerable, broken down by age and ethnicity.

 The number of children and young people remanded or committed to local authority secure accommodation is recorded on the last day of each month by local authority secure units and sent to the Home Office. These returns break down the total number by age, gender and the statutory position under which the child or young person has been placed.

[112728]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00303w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Boateng </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 March 2000]:</i> As of 29 February 2000, 862 prisoners subject to home detention curfew have had their licences revoked by the Secretary of State following a breach of the curfew conditions of their licence or a breach of their non-curfew licence conditions. Fifty are currently unlawfully at large. Breaches of non-curfew related conditions by curfewees whose original offences were committed prior to 1 January 1999 are dealt with by the courts. Information on these cases is not held centrally.
<P>

<a name="00303w09.html_para3">The number of cases where a breach of curfew conditions has been reported is not readily available and I will write to the hon. Member with this information.
<P>

<a name="00303w09.html_para4">As of 29 February, the Prison Service had received notification of 194 curfewees who had been charged with an offence committed while subject to the home detention curfew scheme.
<P>

<a name="00303w09.html_para5">A breakdown of the offences committed by these curfewees is shown in the table. This breakdown has been prepared from information supplied by police forces and drawn from the police national computer. Further analysis of re-offending by those subject to home detention curfew, including the procedures for notification of further charges to the Prison Service by the police, is currently under way as part of a long-term evaluation of the scheme.
<P>

<a name="00303w09.html_para6">Information is not held centrally on the sentences received by prisoners for offences committed while subject to home detention curfew.
<P>

<a name="00303w09.html_para7">Overall, the home detention curfew scheme has an impressive success rate of 95 per cent. of curfewees completing their period of curfew licence. However, we are not complacent about any re-offending on curfew and the scheme is strictly enforced. Where a prisoner does commit a further offence while subject to curfew, he or she is in breach of their licence conditions and may be recalled to prison, in addition to the possibility of an additional sentence for the new offence.

The great majority of these have been generally supportive of the plans for modernising the service and accept the benefit of having a new name, but most expressed concern about the name "Community Punishment and Rehabilitation Service". The new name will be one of a range of measures in the forthcoming Criminal Justice and Court Services Bill, and I have said that I will listen carefully to the points raised when the Bill is considered by Parliament.

 Violence against women is one of the most shocking manifestations of women's inequality. We are working to ensure that women's empowerment and equality are actively pursued in the mainstream of all development activities.
<P>

<a name="00303w10.html_para0">Female genital mutilation is a serious health issue. It is also a violation of the rights of women to live free from violence. Our policy is to try to persuade countries where the practice occurs to take steps to reduce and eventually eliminate it. We encourage Governments to strengthen laws which prohibit female genital mutilation and other harmful traditional practices, such as dowry deaths. We also work with women's organisations to strengthen their capacity to address female genital mutilation and other harmful traditional practices.
