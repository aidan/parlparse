 The ONS has not yet published economic growth figures for local authorities for 2004&#150;05. However, the latest figures show the West Midlands was the second fastest growing region in the UK between 2003&#150;04 after the North East, and that between 1997 and 2003 the Shropshire economy has grown by 37 per cent. Unemployment levels are also close to record lows, and the employment rate well above the national average of 74.3 per cent.

 Since 1998, the new deal has helped over 1.6 million people into work, including 630,000 young people, 250,000 unemployed adults, and 500,000 lone parents. New deal for disabled people and pathways to work have now helped over 120,000 incapacity benefit claimants into work. Independent research has shown the effectiveness of welfare to work policies, with the new deal for young people alone having estimated benefits to the economy of up to &#163;500 million a year, and each additional job achieved through new deal for lone parents resulting in an economic gain to society of &#163;4,400.

 The Government&#039;s measure to achieve full employment in the three northern regions are built on a platform of macro-economic stability, continued investment in the new deal, investment in skills and training, and policies to make work pay.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">It is becoming increasingly difficult to estimate the size of the population because of changes in society, which include increased mobility and different living arrangements. The decennial Census provides a benchmark against which national and sub-national population estimates can be assessed. Substantial work has been done on the difference between mid-year population estimates and the 2001 Census. This work is summarised in the final report of the 2004 Local Authority Population Studies, which can be found here: http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme&#095;population/LAStudy&#095;FullReport.pdf</p>

This work, together with revised international migration estimates, accounted for a large proportion of the initial 1.1 million difference between mid year estimates and the Census; reducing the difference to a little over 0.2 million</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">In addition, extensive annual quality assurance is undertaken in order to ensure the accuracy of the annual mid-year estimates. Quality assurance starts with detailed checking of the source data used in the components of change (birth, deaths, etc.). Procedures are then in place to ensure that these data sources are correctly processed when deriving the estimates. The calculated national and sub-national estimates, for all 376 local authorities in England and Wales, are then subject to a further set of quality assurance procedures before they are published. These procedures include reviews of sex ratios and age profiles, comparisons of change over time, and comparisons of fertility and mortality rates. Substantial effort has already been undertaken, in recent years, to improve the quality assurance of population estimates.</p>

<a name="stpa_10">The Home Office introduced a National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) that all police forces across England and Wales were required to adopt from 1 April 2002. The NCRS had the effect of increasing the number of recorded crimes by an average of 22 per cent. in all forces in England and Wales. BTP adopted this standard on 1 April 2002. The principle of NCRS is that if, on the balance of probability, a crime has been committed it is recorded as a crime. The standard has made crime recording more victim-focused.

 Water companies are under a duty to develop and maintain an efficient and economical system of water supply.

This approach has resulted in a reduction in leakage of around 29 per cent. since its peak in 1994&#150;95. Most water companies are now at their economic level of leakage which is the level of leakage at which it would cost more to make further reductions than to produce water from another source.

 Clause 12 of the Childcare Bill, currently before Parliament, would place an extended duty on English local authorities to provide information on services, facilities or publications which may be of benefit to parents, prospective parents, children and young persons in their area. Children and young persons include all persons up to their 20th birthday. The Bill builds on the current duty in section 118A of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, as amended by section 149 of the 2002 Education Act, to provide information on the provision of child care and related services. Authorities fulfil the duty by running children&#039;s information services (CISs). Many CISs are already making good progress in extending their services. We will encourage local authorities to move towards ensuring their information services provide the facilities envisaged in the Bill, so that, subject to parliamentary approval, the full service is ready when the duty comes into force, which is planned for April 2008.

Their proposals, including those for simplifying funding and streamlining data collection and monitoring, have been well received by colleges and other providers in the sector. We have made significant progress by reducing the audit burden on colleges through abolishing the detailed end-year funding claim and reconciliation for most institutions.

<a name="stpa_13">We will be measuring efficiency gains from a range of specific initiatives which contribute to our Gershon efficiency target, including those in the children, young people and families sector. These are set out in our Efficiency Technical Note at www.dfes.gov.uk/publications/docs/DfES%20Efficiency%20Technical%20Note.doc. In most cases, the gains are recyclable at the frontline into other activities rather than being clawed back by the Department. The Department is reporting progress towards our overall efficiency target through existing departmental reporting processes. We reported progress towards our target in the Department&#039;s Autumn Performance Report and will report further progress in the Departmental Annual Report which we expect to publish in April.

 48 borrowers with publicly owned student loans, whose awarding local authority is in London, have so far informed the Student Loans Company that they became bankrupt in calendar year 2005. There may be delays between borrowers becoming bankrupt and notifying the Student Loans Company, therefore this figure could increase in future.

<a name="stpa_15">Overall national summary data for FSP was first published in 2003 as &#039;Experimental Statistics&#039; and in 2004 as &#039;National Statistics&#039;. However, a background of ongoing improvements to teacher assessment and moderation make it very difficult to draw meaningful statistical judgements about the progress made in Sure Start areas in the last three years. The dataset for 2005 is not strictly comparable with the results in earlier years. My Department considers that the 2005 figures represent the most robust baseline against which progress in Sure Start areas can be effectively monitored. The figures for 2005 are shown in the tables.

and Easter. The present pattern of bank holidays is well established and accepted, and we have no current plans to change the arrangements.

 Monitoring of the use of UK aid to the Democratic Republic of Congo is conducted in accordance with standard DFID procedures that apply across all of the Department&#039;s programmes. For our bilateral aid, organisations implementing projects on behalf of DFID are required to submit regular, usually quarterly, financial and narrative reports on their activities. In addition, projects over &#163;1 million require a full review to be undertaken at least annually with recommendations for actions to maximise impact and a final completion report, including the lessons learned to inform future work. Regular monitoring by DFID staff, who remain closely in touch with partner organisations throughout the duration of a project, is also an important part of the monitoring process.

 DFID supports the Government of South Africa in three priority areas: growth, jobs and equity; HIV/AIDS and vulnerability; and governance, democracy and service delivery.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60302w11.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_55">DFID&#039;s work on growth, jobs and equity helps to access poor people to South Africa&#039;s formal economy so that they can benefit from the resources which are already available (in areas such as land, and finance) but from which they are currently excluded. It also helps South Africa translate the growth in its economy into jobs. Secondly, work on HIV/AIDS and vulnerability helps South Africa to tackle its growing HIV/AIDS pandemic, through supporting a range of partners (National and Provincial Governments, civil society groups and the private sector) across a range of activities from prevention, through care, support and treatment to mitigating the impacts of HIV on communities and society. Following the crop failures and resulting hunger which hit Southern Africa in late 2002, and DFID&#039;s response of providing more than &#163;150 million in food aid, DFID SA took on a new role of developing a longer term regional response to food insecurity in Southern Africa. Work on this, along with work on social protection issues, has been incorporated into our work on HIV/AIDS, under a broader vulnerability theme. Thirdly, DFID&#039;s work on governance, democracy and service delivery helps South Africa deliver quality public services in an equitable way to all citizens. A particular focus has been reform and capacity building of provincial and local government to strengthen their delivery of basic services, including education and health. Our bilateral budget for South Africa in 2006&#150;07 is &#163;23 million.

Notes:<br>

1. An old scheme application is defined as cleared if the case is closed or a maintenance assessment has been carried out. In addition, an application is also counted as cleared if the parent with care (PWC) is identified as claiming good cause or the PWC is subject to a reduced benefit decision. This differs slightly to the definition of a new scheme clearance (see below) and figures from the two schemes will therefore only be broadly, and not directly, comparable.<br>

2. A new scheme application is defined as cleared if the case is closed or a maintenance assessment has been carried out and a maintenance collection schedule set up. In addition, an application is also counted as cleared if the parent with care (PWC) is identified as claiming good cause, or the PWC is subject to a reduced benefit decision, or is identified as being a change of circumstance to an existing application, as opposed to a new one.<br>

3. The figure for &quot;other&quot; clearances on the old scheme (July 2001 to March 2003) includes those cases cleared because the PWC has been identified as claiming good cause, or the case has been closed, or the case has been cleared for any other reason. It is not possible to identify figures for good cause separately.<br>

4. The figure for &quot;other&quot; clearances on the new scheme (April to December 2005) includes those cases cleared because the case has been closed, or the application has been identified as a change of circumstance to an existing application.<br>

5. Figures have been rounded to the nearest thousand, and percentages to the nearest 1 per cent. Components may not sum to totals due to rounding.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Cabinet Office mandate methodology excludes staff on nil pay, maternity leave and staff on reduced pay due to sickness.<br>

2. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has introduced standard definitions for use in the calculation of all public sector employment statistics. In line with other public sector organisations DWP has now implemented the ONS definitions. The ONS definition includes staff previously excluded, e.g. staff on maternity leave.<br>

3. Historical data using this definition is now available backdated to February 2004, the baseline for the Department&#039;s efficiency challenge.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if the Government will extend the final submission date for the public consultation on post-primary education to take account of the recent postal strike in Belfast.  [55103]</p>

 I have looked at this very carefully to ensure that no-one will be disadvantaged.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60302w14.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_86">Parts of Belfast and the rest of Northern Ireland were unaffected by the recent postal dispute. I understand that, following the end of the dispute, post is being delivered as normal, alongside the work to clear the backlog. If the backlog is not cleared by the closing date of 7 March, the Department of Education will accept postal responses received after that date until the backlog is cleared. The situation is being kept under review.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60302w14.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_87">During the dispute the Department of Education issued a number of response booklets to members of the public with addresses in the affected areas. As they were unlikely to have been delivered, the Department issued duplicates after the dispute ended so that those involved could return them by 7 March.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60302w14.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_88">I would encourage all who wish to respond to the consultation to submit their comments by the closing date.
