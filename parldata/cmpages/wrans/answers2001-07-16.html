 We commissioned RAND to do a study on a range of alternative procurement strategies for our future warship programmes over the next 15 to 20 years, with particular reference to options for the type 45 destroyers. The study is intended to help inform, not make, decisions by the Department within the context of obtaining value for money over the warship programme as a whole.

<P>
<a name="10716w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Caton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what provision, in the agreement with the Kenyan Government on military training is made for the British Army to clean up live bombs after operations. [3219]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 There is no agreement between the British Army and the Kenyan Government for the clearance of live ammunition after training. There is, however, a widely understood military protocol whereby the host nation is responsible for the clearance of military ranges and this is followed in Kenya. The British Army aims to destroy the ammunition it uses as soon as possible after it has been fired. In Kenya, destruction takes place while the units are conducting their training and at the end of the exercise period. Notwithstanding that, in the last two years the British Army has carried out clearance work in support of the Kenyan authorities.
<P>

<a name="10716w01.html_para11">The British Army is alone in that it also trains on privately owned land in Kenya in addition to using Kenyan Department of Defence facilities. The British Army clears any unexploded ordnance from privately owned land as required by their agreements with local landowners.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Caton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence at what point the military clearance operation in North Kenya was suspended after the unexploded ordnance specialist left the area.  [2795]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 I assume my hon. Friend is referring to the clearance operation which took place at Archer's Post earlier this year. The operation was not suspended. It was a planned activity that took place between 7 April and 16 May. The dates for the operation were agreed last year.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Caton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what the procedure is for the clearing of civilians before and after military training in the Archer's Post and Dol Dol training areas of north Kenya;  [2784]
<P>
<UL>(2) what provision his Department has made to stop civilian entry into the testing grounds that the British Army use in Archer's Post and Dol Dol in northern Kenya.  [2794]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The responsibility for ensuring that civilians are cleared from the Archer's Post and Dol Dol training areas rests with the Kenyan Department of Defence. Wherever the British Army trains with live ammunition it must confirm that the danger area is clear before commencing training. At Archer's Post this is achieved by using range wardens, a helicopter overflight of the danger area and the deployment of danger flags and 



<P>
<P><I>16 Jul 2001 : Column: 3W</I><P>
sentries. The sentries and range wardens act to stop civilians entering Archer's Post while training is in progress.
<P>

<a name="10716w01.html_para12">The British Army does not conduct live firing at the Dol Dol area.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Caton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if his Department will take responsibility for the deaths and injuries caused by unexploded ordnance in the Archer's Post and Dol Dol areas.  [2780]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence's position is that we take responsibility for deaths and injuries where we are shown to be legally liable.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Caton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if his Department will ensure that all signs outside training areas used by the British Army in Kenya are intelligible to people who cannot read.  [2791]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 There are large concrete signs outside live firing areas used by the British Army in Kenya, with words of warning written in English and Samburu. The nomadic tribesman have been grazing their animals in the area for a considerable number of years and are aware that some of the area is a Kenyan Department of Defence live firing military range as it has been for many years. We therefore believe that the signs are well understood by both the local population and nomadic tribesmen that transit the area. My hon. Friend may also wish to note that the range wardens employed throughout the year by the British Army instruct the local population about the dangers posed during live firing and from touching unexploded ordnance.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Caton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if any of the unexploded ordnance found in the Archer's Post and Dol Dol training areas were from the British Army.  [2792]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 I assume my hon. Friend is referring to recent activities where the British Army, in support of the Kenyan Department of Defence, conducted limited clearance operations at Archer's Post. During 2000 a total of 32 ammunition types were recovered, only two of which were found to be unique to the British Army. The Royal Engineers are continuing to analyse the ammunition found earlier this year.
<P>

<a name="10716w01.html_para13">We do not conduct live firing at the Dol Dol training area and have therefore not conducted an explosive ordnance clearance operation at the range. Any live unexploded ordnance found at Dol Dol is therefore a matter for the Kenyan authorities.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Caton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many square kilometres of the Archer's Post range were cleared in the operation from March to May.  [3208]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The clearance operation covered 64 square kilometres.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Caton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many live bombs were found in the recent clean-up operation of Archer's Post from March to May; how many were British made; and how many had batch numbers showing who had fired them; and of these how many had been fired by the British Army.  [3207]

<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 During the recent clearance operation at Archer's Post a total of 271 live ammunition types were found. Work is continuing to establish their provenance.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Caton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when the British Army first was informed that people were being <i>(a)</i> injured and <i>(b)</i> killed on the Archer's Post and Dol Dol range by live bombs.  [3220]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 In recent times, the British Army has been aware of three incidents where civilians were killed or injured at Archer's Post. The first of these incidents is believed to have taken place in May 1999.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Caton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when the British Army intends to clean up the live bombs about which they were informed by Osiligi representatives in late 2000.  [3209]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 I understand that the ordnance to which my hon. Friend refers was found at the Dol Dol training area. The British Army does not conduct live firing at Dol Dol, and any live ammunition found there is therefore a matter for the Kenyan authorities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the policy is for fast-tracking of service personnel for medical treatment <i>(a)</i> in Ministry of Defence hospital units and <i>(b)</i> elsewhere.  [2862]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w02.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Service patients are mainly treated in Ministry of Defence Hospitals Units (MDHUs), in other NHS hospitals as NHS patients, or in Defence Secondary Care Agency (DSCA) directly managed units (DMUs) in the UK and overseas. The British Forces Germany Health Service provides secondary care for service personnel in Germany where there are generally no waiting lists.
<P>

<a name="10716w02.html_para0">The DSCA has set waiting time targets for the treatment of patients from the armed forces in its DMUs and MDHUs. The contracts between MDHUs and their host NHS trusts include financial payments to encourage trusts to achieve these. The contracts also allow service personnel needed for operational deployment to receive a priority out-patient opinion. In addition, contracts were placed last year with independent sector health care providers to treat service personnel in shortage categories to relieve overstretch. Referrals under these contracts ceased in March 2001. Planning has recently been approved for another rapid treatment initiative.
<P>

<a name="10716w02.html_para1">Military personnel referred to NHS hospitals outwith MDHU arrangements are treated in accordance with NHS waiting times on the basis of clinical need.

 The total budget for purchasing the Merlin helicopter was &#163;4,931 million. The total forecast cost of purchasing the Merlin helicopter is &#163;4,903 million. This includes the UK element of the development costs. The development of the Merlin Mk1 was part of the

 <i>[holding answer 13 July 2001]:</i> No. The Manufacturing licence for the UK Apache Attack Helicopter is between Westland Helicopters Ltd. and the Boeing Company.

<a name="10716w02.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Problems with software integration have delayed the availability of the Full Mission Simulator for the UK WAH-64 Apache Attack Helicopter.

<P>
<a name="10716w02.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Exercise Roving Sands is an annual multinational Air Defence exercise hosted by the US Army at Fort Bliss, Texas, USA, involving UK, Dutch, German and Canadian Air Defence forces. The purpose is to exercise in a joint and combined integrated defence environment as part of a joint forces headquarters. This year, we planned to deploy 264 personnel from 7 Air Defence Brigade to participate in the exercise between 6 June and 1 July. Owing to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK, however, the US Department of Defense asked the UK not to import vehicle or heavy equipment into Texas for the exercise. The UK participation in the exercise Roving Sands 01, therefore, consisted of 22 personnel from 7 Air Defence Brigade deployed to Fort Bliss where they were integrated in the Headquarters of the 31 Air Defence Brigade, US Army.

 It is too early to know what caused the fatal accident on Salisbury Plain, but a full investigation has begun. Clearly all our thoughts are with the families and friends of the two soldiers who died in the accident.

<P>
<a name="10716w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 July 2001]:</i> The Mayor's congestion charging proposals are his responsibility, not the Government's. However, in 2000, before the Mayor was elected, a Government-sponsored report was published entitled "Road Charging Options for London: a Technical Assessment". This was a report by an independent group consisting of transport experts from the academic, professional and public sectors. Chapter 5 on "Impacts and Effects" discusses how the illustrative charging scenarios included in the report would affect different groups including retail businesses. The impacts on businesses are discussed at paragraphs 5.3.79 to 5.3.82. Copies of the report are available in the Library.

 No evaluations have been made by my Department or the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA). I understand that evaluations have been made by Stagecoach, the franchisee of South West Trains, and that the proposal is supported by the local authority. If funding were required from Government it may be available through the Rail Passenger Partnership scheme (RPP), administered by the SRA. The SRA will assess any bids on value for money grounds against their published planning criteria. Bidding guidance has been sent to all local authorities.

Our response to all such representations has been that the results of the full value for money analysis will be made publicly available once contracts have been signed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will publish the criteria under the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 governing the use by local authorities of housing investment programme allocations for social services staff redundancy packages; and if he will make a statement.  [3534]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w03.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Housing investment programme allocations, together with those for a number of other capital programmes, are issued in the form of Basic Credit Approvals. Authorities are free to use these for any capital purpose.
<P>

<a name="10716w03.html_para2">Expenditure for capital purposes is defined in the 1989 Act, but the Act also provides, in section 40(6), for the Secretary of State to make a direction that expenditure normally defined as revenue be treated by the authority concerned as expenditure for capital purposes. Directions are not normally issued unless the expenditure:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) is substantial in relation to the authority's revenue budget for the financial year concerned and was unforeseeable when that budget was adopted; or</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) cannot be met out of financial reserves but will result in revenue account savings in future years.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="10716w03.html_para3">Applications for capitalisation of redundancy costs, and similar lump-sum costs such as severance or premature retirement payments, are normally considered against test (b) as stated. In those cases, directions are not usually given unless the expenditure to be capitalised exceeds both:
<P>

<a name="10716w03.html_para4"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>5 per cent. of the authority's available reserves (excluding Local Management of Schools (LMS) reserves) and

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10716w03.html_para6">It is therefore possible, owing to the flexibility allowed to authorities in the use of BCAs, and following issue of a section 40(6) direction, for housing capital allocations to be used to fund redundancy costs. But this would only be in an exceptional case and the authority in question would still be expected to meet longer term targets for housing improvement.

 The Traffic Area Network (TAN) has embarked on a major change programme, called TAN 21, designed to modernise the way the organisation carries out its business. The programme includes complete renewal of all computer systems throughout the network. The ICT infrastructure&#151;the hardware, the links between the offices and the new e-mail systems&#151;was installed last year and is already operating nationally. The first phase of the new business system, which handles the processing of operator licences, is currently being piloted in the Scottish traffic area. Subject to satisfactory performance of the pilot, this phase of the system will be rolled out to the rest of the country shortly. We are aiming to complete implementation of all the new systems, which include new e-commerce services for the industry, computerisation of the compliance and local bus route registration systems and a new finance system, across the whole of Great Britain by the end of the year.

 Section 59 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 places an obligation on local highway authorities to co-ordinate the execution of utility street works and other works in their streets. This is intended to ensure safety, to minimise inconvenience to road users and to protect the structure of the street and any apparatus located in it. While we have no plans to review this requirement, we are looking at ways in which the co-ordination of works by authorities can be made easier and more effective.

 It is for local authorities to put forward proposals for light rail or guided bus schemes as part of their Local Transport Plan, or the Mayor's Transport Strategy in the case of London. Where Government funding is sought, we require a thorough appraisal of the scheme. Since 1997, five new light rail lines have opened: two extensions to the Manchester Metrolink, the Midland Metro line to Wolverhampton, the Croydon Tramlink and the Docklands Light Railway extension to Lewisham. No new guided bus schemes have been opened within this period. The charts set out those light rail and guided bus schemes that have been approved or given provisional approval with construction and approximate opening dates.

 The White Paper "Our Countryside: The Future" last November announced our intention to extend the eligibility criteria for Rural Bus Subsidy Grant to allow for the support of services operating in and around towns of up to 25,000 (compared with 10,000 previously). We have already implemented that change to the rules from 1 April this year. We have also increased the funding available this year to &#163;41.5 million, with further increases planned for the next two years. It is for the local authority to decide which particular services to support using these additional resources and we have given them some flexibility to fund existing as well as new services.

I very much hope that this is part of a continuing downward trend and that we achieve or better the target casualty reductions set for 2010 in the strategy: a 40 per cent. reduction in the number of deaths and serious injuries, a 50 per cent. reduction in the number of child deaths and serious injuries, and a 10 per cent. reduction in the rate (by vehicle mileage) of slight injuries&#151;all compared with the averages for 1994 to 1998.

 Information on cycling and walking provision is not available in the form requested. The Government have encouraged local traffic authorities in England to include strategies for increasing cycling and walking in their local transport plans (LTPs).

Local strategies to promote walking include pedestrian routes, pedestrianisation, safety measures, better facilities for the disabled and greater accessibility to transport interchanges and facilities. A number of authorities are likely to use LTP funding to make walking more accessible, by improving pavement and footway maintenance, and removing obstructions.

 We have forecast that, without the 10-year Plan for Transport, congestion will rise by 15 per cent. across the road network as a whole, and by 28 per cent. on the inter-urban trunk road network by the end of 2010.
<P>

<a name="10716w05.html_para6">With the plan, overall congestion is forecast to fall relative to 2000, as would congestion on the inter-urban trunk roads.

<P>

<a name="10716w05.html_para7">The implementation of the 10-year Plan as a whole rather than traffic measures alone, will deliver the planned reduction in congestion, The targets in the plan to increase passenger rail use by 50 per cent. and rail freight by 80 per cent. will be important contributions, as will better local road maintenance, road improvements, the introduction of better bus and light rail services and better facilities for cyclists and pedestrians.

 Planning Policy Guidance Note 3 (PPG3) was published in March 2000.

<P>
<a name="10716w06.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 PPG3 introduces a new approach to planning for housing which, for most authorities, will mean their development plan will require early review and alteration in respect of housing. The most effective way of removing greenfield allocations from a plan that does not reflect the policies in PPG3 is through a formal alteration to the plan.

 I have today laid before Parliament the Statement on the 2001 Community Budget, entitled "European Community Finances". This White Paper is the twenty-first in the series. As in the past, it covers annual budgetary matters and includes details of recent developments in European Community financial management and in countering fraud against the Community Budget. It also describes the Community Budget for 2001 as adopted by the European Parliament, and the United Kingdom's gross and net contributions to the Community Budget between 1996 and 2001.

 The available information on the expected cost/yield of capital gains measures introduced since 1997 is published in each "Financial Statement and Budget Report".

 <i>[holding answer 11 July 2001]:</i> Under the Financial Services Act 1986, the Personal Investment Authority regulates retail investment firms and the lead regulator, the Financial Services Authority, is responsible for ensuring that the Personal Investment Authority carries out its responsibilities under the Act. Therefore it is a matter for the Financial Services Authority.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w07.html_spnew9"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The FSA does not collect performance information direct from firms, but the Association of British Insurers collects data from its members on the proportion and numbers of letters in each of the red, amber and green, categories and passes this on to the FSA. However, the FSA is subject to constraints under Section 179 of the Financial Services Act 1986 on publication of firm data, even if it owns it.
<P>

<a name="10716w07.html_para4">In any case, the performance of individual company endowment policies is not an indication of mis-selling. Consumers should focus on what they are being told by their endowment provider and the information sent by, and available from, the FSA, and take a view and appropriate action if they believe the policy has been mis-sold. If compensation is due to consumers, the size of orphan assets is irrelevant.

 The Government's view is that, in principle, the costs of compensating victims of any endowment mis-selling should be shared and borne in the same proportion as profits arising from mis-selling would have been.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills to what extent, and according to what time scale, school budgets are reduced following the exclusion of pupils from schools.  [3644]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w08.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 We have significantly increased the standards fund grant available to schools and local education authorities to tackle poor behaviour and provide education to excluded pupils, from &#163;17 million in 1996&#150;97 to &#163;131 million in 2000&#150;01 and again to &#163;174 million this year&#151;a 10-fold increase. Before April 2000, most of this money was held centrally by local authorities to support authority-wide initiatives to tackle poor behaviour and provide education to excluded pupils. For the first time in April 2000 the majority of this funding was devolved directly to schools so that they could decide how best to tackle poor behaviour. Schools have, therefore, benefited by an additional &#163;100 million in 2000&#150;01 and &#163;126 million this year. Where a child has to be permanently excluded some of the money previously held by local authorities, which is now in schools, reverts back to the local authority. The exact amount of between &#163;3,000 and &#163;6,000 is agreed locally. This money can be used by the authority to provide education outside school or to support a reintegration package at a new school. By September 2002, all permanently excluded pupils must be offered full-time education and not the 2&#150;3 hours per week all too typical in the past.

 <i>[holding answer 9 July 2001]:</i> The SEU is responsible for taking forward key parts of the Government's agenda for raising standards in schools. Created in 1997, the unit's remit has expanded with the development of new policies. The unit has led on strategies for literacy and numeracy, for intervention in failing schools and LEAs, and for key stage 3. It is also responsible for new policies such as city academies, excellence in cities, education action zones and beacon schools. It has taken on responsibility for specialist schools and city technology colleges, and more recently, for dealings with local education authorities on a day- to-day basis across a wide range of the Department's business.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w09.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 At the Telecommunications Council on 27 June, member states and the Commission agreed to clarify that the proposed Communications data protection directive should not alter the existing balance between individual rights to privacy and the possibility for member states to take measures necessary for law enforcement. Recital 10 of the proposed directive now makes it clear that member states will be able, but will not be required, to introduce data retention requirements provided that these are proportionate and in accordance with the general principles of Community law. The position will therefore be essentially the same as it is under the existing telecommunications data protection directive.

Such a move could be considered only in the context of detailed consultation with all relevant law enforcement, industry and civil liberties interests.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w11.html_spnew2"><B> Alan Johnson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 July 2001]:</i> "Quarantine period" is a term used (though not in the regulations themselves) to describe the period following the ending of a hiring during which conditions (such as payment of a transfer fee) may be imposed when a temporary worker takes up permanent employment with the hirer or some other person. Under the current draft regulations, this period is 14 weeks from the start of the hire or eight weeks from the end, whichever is the later, where permanent employment is taken up with the hirer. Where the worker takes up work with another person (including another agency) the period is four weeks from the end of the hire. The Government believe that onerous restrictions on transfers, such as high transfer fees, restrict labour market flexibility and competition, and act as a disincentive to workers taking up permanent employment. The use of a "quarantine period" was suggested by the recruitment industry, as an alternative to restrictions on transfer fees as such.

They are monitored by my Department's employment agency standards inspectorate, which receives approximately 12,000 calls a year, and carries out full investigations in 1,200 cases.

 We supported UN Security Council Resolution 1359 which was passed unanimously on 29 June 2001 and which extended the mandate of the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) until 30 November 2001. This resolution reiterated full support for the ongoing efforts of MINURSO to implement the Settlement Plan and agreements by the parties to hold a free, fair and impartial referendum for the self-determination of the people of the western Sahara. It also reaffirmed our commitment to achieve a just and lasting solution to the question of western Sahara. We fully support the efforts of the UN Secretary-General to invite all the parties to meet directly or through proximity talks, under the auspices of his Personal Envoy James Baker, to discuss the draft Framework Agreement and to negotiate any specific changes they would like to see in this proposal, as well as to discuss any other proposal for a political solution, to arrive at a mutually acceptable agreement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 On 6 March, China announced a 17.7 per cent. increase in defence spending, bringing the total to US$17.07 billion. Two reasons were given: the need to improve pay and conditions, and the need to strengthen high technology capabilities. Chinese official figures give little indication of total military spending, though we estimate that spending remains low as a percentage of GDP. China is committed to military modernisation, but economic development remains the overriding national priority.

[3228]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 Figures provided by the Court's Registry indicate that the case load is 17,329 as of March 2001 and the average time between referral of a case and judgment is approximately three years. The Court aspires to reduce this to two years, but the set limit remains three years. This limit has been exceeded in about one third of the applications pending. The Court's budget is an integral part of the Council of Europe budget, of which the UK share is 12.7 per cent. In 2001, some &#163;2 million of the UK total contribution went to the Court. HMG are actively supporting the work of the Evaluation Group which has been established to consider all potential means to guarantee the Court's continued effectiveness in the face of rapid growth in the number of applications to it.

<P><I>16 Jul 2001 : Column: 47W</I><P>
on the level of police paperwork of the requirement to record all stops and searches; and if he will make a statement.  [1249]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Since the introduction of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, code of practice (A) on stop and search, all stops and searches carried out under any legislative provision have been recorded. In 1999&#150;2000, 818,203 such stops and searches were recorded.
<P>

<a name="10716w14.html_para3">Stops and searches under section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 are not included in the above figure and are recorded separately. There were 7,153 such searches in 1999&#150;2000.
<P>

<a name="10716w14.html_para4">Since code of practice (A) was last revised in 1999, the Lawrence steering group set up to take forward the Home Secretary's action plan in response to the Stephen Lawrence inquiry report, has agreed that all persons searched should be given a copy of the record at the time of the search together with information on police powers and public rights. This does not represent an extra recording requirement and simply means that the record is routinely made available at the time of the search rather than within 12 months as was previously the practice. The group agreed that this should also apply where stops are carried out without there being any subsequent search because grounds for suspicion are eliminated as a result of questioning the person detained. It is not possible to predict exactly how many extra records this might entail, but it is not likely to be significant in terms of the overall number of records. Chief constables were requested to implement those new arrangements from 1 April 2001.
<P>

<a name="10716w14.html_para5">We are also considering whether to accept recommendation 61 of the Lawrence inquiry that all stops should be recorded, whether or not a search takes place. A public consultation exercise on that by local police authorities, co-ordinated by the Association of Police Authorities, finished at the end of May. I expect the Lawrence steering group to consider the results of that consultation exercise in July.

 The report by Sir John Hoddinott was into the conduct of the chief officers in charge of the operation which led to the fatal shooting of James Ashley. The report is the property of Sussex police authority and it must be their decision to publish. I met my hon. Friend and members of the Ashley family on 4 July. At the meeting I said that we would use our best endeavours to encourage the police authority to publish as much as possible, bearing in mind that the report contains confidential information that will need to be subject to considered legal advice, and the need to ensure there is no adverse impact on other proceedings.

 The Home Office currently provides grant-in-aid under section 81 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 to three voluntary organisations: the immigration advisory service, the refugee legal centre, and the law centre (Northern Ireland). They provide free legal advice and representation to those with rights of appeal under the Act including asylum seekers. Additional funding for this purpose is also available in England and Wales in the form of franchised contracts awarded under the community legal scheme, which is administered by the Legal Services Commission (which replaced the Legal Aid Board).

 The current weekly unit cost of housing an asylum seeker at Oakington, based on an average occupancy of 229 in June, is estimated at &#163;1,203. This can be broken down into the immigration and nationality directorate (IND) staff and related costs of &#163;184 and supervisory, care and security staff and related costs of &#163;745. (The balance is attributable to other running costs, primarily the costs of interpreters and accommodation). The unit cost is subject to variation because of changes in occupancy.

Further checks are made if identity and nationality cannot be satisfactorily established from the evidence sent with the application. In addition, a random sample of examined applications is re-checked before the passport is issued, as part of the United Kingdom Passport Service's quality assurance procedures.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w17.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Government published their proposals for the future of radio broadcasting in the White Paper, "A New Future for Communications", last December. Those proposals included a firm commitment to maintain plurality in a period of media convergence&#151;allowing listeners a choice between different providers with different editorial styles and opinions. My Department, along with the Department of Trade and Industry, has consulted widely on the proposals and ideas set out in the White Paper; we are now carefully considering all the responses. A draft Bill will be available early next year for further consultation on more detailed proposals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w17.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 S4C's weekly reach is defined as the number of people estimated to have viewed at least three minutes or more uninterrupted of S4C's programmes during any given week. The figure is normally expressed as a percentage of the total number of people in Wales aged four or above able to receive S4C in their homes. The average weekly reach over the year as a whole provides the basis for the weekly viewing figures which are published in S4C's annual report.

 Decisions on funding priorities are a matter for the trustees of the heritage lottery fund, within the broad framework of their statutory powers and the policy directions set by the Government. The heritage lottery fund supports library collections and archives of historical importance but does not fund repairs or improvements to buildings that are normally the responsibility of local authorities. To date, the heritage lottery fund has awarded over &#163;109 million to library and archive projects.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w17.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 July 2001]:</i> On the 54 species of butterfly resident in the UK, more than half are undergoing declines in their populations and distributions. The recently published Millennium Atlas of Butterflies in Britain and Ireland gives fresh information on which to base new assessments of conservation priorities. The atlas gives us particular cause for concern over five species which have each suffered a more than 50 per cent. loss of range over the last twenty years. These are the High Brown Fritillary, Pearl-bordered Fritillary, Marsh Fritillary, Wood White and Large Heath Butterfly. No species have become extinct in the last decade.
<P>

<a name="10716w17.html_para0">Conservation action is underway through Biodiversity Action Plans for a number of butterfly and moth species that set objectives and targets to maintain and, where possible, enhance and restore populations. Six species of butterfly are also fully protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, with a further 19 species protected against trade.

[3988]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10716w17.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 July 2001]:</i> The Government's sustainable development strategy, "A better quality of life", (Cm 4345) makes clear that headline indicators will be used to measure progress towards sustainable development. There are fifteen headline indicators, covering economic, social and environmental factors. The Government's aim is for all the headline indicators to move in the right direction over time, or, where a satisfactory level has been reached, to prevent a reversal. Where a trend is unacceptable, the Government will adjust policies accordingly, and will look to others to join them in taking action.
<P>

<a name="10716w17.html_para1">The strategy commits the Government to report annually on the headline indicators and on action taken or proposed in priority areas. The first annual report&#151;"Achieving a better quality of life"&#151;was published in January 2001. The report makes clear that one year's data do not constitute a trend but that there was evidence of improvement in many of the indicators, across all three aspects of sustainable development.

 The proposed Farm Scale Evaluation site of Genetically Modified maize at Wolston was withdrawn by the farming and biotechnology industry body SCIMAC on 21 May 2001 in response to my request. I had asked them to reconsider the use of this site, as publicity surrounding its proximity to the Ryton Organic Gardens was potentially damaging to public confidence in the farm scale research programme as a whole.
<P>

<a name="10716w17.html_para3">In withdrawing the site, SCIMAC noted that the Soil Association had confirmed that, as the nearest boundary of Ryton Organic Gardens was 3km from the evaluation site, organic maize production at Ryton would not be in conflict with the separation distance set by the association as a trigger for the re-assessment of organic status.

<a name="10716w19.html_spnew12"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 We do not know how many women are currently tested for the HER-2 marker, either on the national health service or privately. Some research groups working in NHS trusts will measure HER-2 status for research purposes, or prior to entry of patients into clinical trials.
<P>

<a name="10716w19.html_para5">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) is currently assessing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of herceptin (a drug that specifically targets the HER-2 protein) and will publish guidance shortly. As part of that appraisal process we expect that NICE will be looking at the cost of HER-2 testing. Charities, patient groups, health professionals and the pharmaceutical industry will all have had the opportunity to submit evidence to NICE during this process.

<a name="10716w20.html_para0">Since 1998, &#163;10 million per year has been invested to implement "Improving Outcomes" guidance on colorectal cancer. Bowel cancer patients have also benefited from the &#163;6 million investment in nine cancer services collaborative (CSC) pilots which have been proven to reduce delays in diagnosis and treatment. The CSC is now being rolled out across all 34 cancer networks.

The FSA will shortly begin a review of the guidance notes on origin labelling, issued last year, to ensure that current legal requirements are interpreted in the way most likely to meet consumers' concerns.
