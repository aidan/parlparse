Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on the Pan-African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign.  [27759]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20118w01.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 DFID recognises that Trypanosomiasis is a major constraint to human health and to the livelihoods of poor livestock keepers throughout many parts of Africa. We have made considerable investments (over &#163;37 million) to develop methods to control the disease in livestock and we support the World Health Organisation in its efforts to control sleeping sickness in humans.
<P>

<a name="20118w01.html_para0">The long-term goal of the Pan-African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication (PATTEC) is to eradicate tsetse fly from the continent. It is a complex and ambitious programme that would require many billions of dollars to implement, and is founded on as yet unproven scientific and economic theory.
<P>

<a name="20118w01.html_para1">Our analysis&#151;shared also by the European Commission&#151;is that it will not be possible to eradicate tsetse flies from Africa. The aims of the campaign are laudable, but we do not believe that they are achievable.
<P>

<a name="20118w01.html_para2">Our strategy is to promote methods for controlling the tsetse fly and preventative and curative methods of treatment that can be readily implemented by poor people themselves. We have programmes of support with the Inter-African Bureau of Animal Resources of the African Union, and with the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, to promote the establishment of sustainable animal health services that provide poor people with the means to control tsetse fly and the disease it carries.
<P>

<a name="20118w01.html_para3">Where the political will for control exists, and where there are clear social benefits, a regional approach to tsetse control may be justified. Such large scale programmes would however be best handled through multilateral channels such as the EC, and not by bilateral agencies such as DFID.

<a name="20118w01.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Burkina Faso has the second highest HIV/AIDS infection rate in west Africa, the UN estimating the adult prevalence rate as being 6.4 per cent. at the end of 1999. The Burkinabe Government are strongly committed to tackling HIV/AIDS through a comprehensive national

<P>

<a name="20118w01.html_para4">DFID does not have a substantive aid programme to Burkina Faso, and has not provided direct support for any projects linked to HIV/AIDS over the last five years. However, we fund such work indirectly through our contributions to international agencies&#151;UNAIDS supports regional work to strengthen the response to HIV/AIDS throughout Africa, and the World bank's $500 million Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program for the Africa Region (MAP) includes $22 million for Burkina Faso to help the Government expand access, particularly for vulnerable groups, to prevention, care and treatment.

 DFID does not have a development programme in Burkina Faso. Small-scale funding has been available from the small grants scheme and the civil society challenge fund (and its forerunner). Details of DFID grants in aid and in kind are as follows:

 The prospect of food shortages in Zimbabwe has been clear for a long time. NGOs have planned ahead, including purchasing food, and have been operating supplementary feeding programmes since September 2001. DFID has committed &#163;4 million for food and logistics support for programmes run by NGOs. We are monitoring these activities carefully and working with the NGOs and other donors to help ensure their success. We are satisfied that, at present, they are still able to work effectively.

WFP will transport food within Zimbabwe, and will also work through NGOs to deliver food at the community level. DFID has pledged a further &#163;3.5 million to WFP for food and logistics support.

 Mr. Stonborough was engaged with effect from 20 December 2001 to provide the House of Commons Commission with advice on media relations generally, and on long-term information strategy. The commission chose him at its meeting on 18 December 2001. The need for a corporate approach to media matters was identified in the Braithwaite Review of Management and Services (HC745) published in July 1999. This led to the appointment of a communications adviser in the Office of the Clerk in 2000. Mr. Stonborough's engagement represents a further step in that direction.

 Data on levels of abandonment are not held by my Department. Abandonment arises where a property owner simply walks away or 'abandons' a property. The owner's intentions as well as their actions are therefore relevant and it is difficult to define objectively. However, we do have data reporting low demand, which I have placed in the Libraries of the House.

Each proposal is subject to environmental impact assessment that includes a coastal impact study prepared by HR Wallingford.

<P>
<a name="20118w03.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The HMCPSI report on North Yorkshire was published on 4 December 2001. The Attorney-General and I have considered the report and are pleased to note the positive picture that it presents.
<P>

<a name="20118w03.html_para9">The report identifies clear improvements since the last inspection of North Yorkshire in 1998. Inspectors found that the area had a very good sense of corporate identity supported by good communication, with an experienced, stable and committed staff and strong leadership. Good systems are in placed for monitoring and reporting on casework performance. The quality of the lawyers' decision-making is sound and cases are progressed well with on-going reviews. Some aspects of casework still require improvement but work is in hand to bring about the necessary improvements. The report commented positively on the quality of management of the area, standards of advocacy, relationships with other criminal justice agencies and the involvement of staff in community and specialist groups across the county.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20118w03.html_spmin1"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 When considering any allegation, Crown Prosecutors are guided by statutory provisions and the Code for Crown Prosecutors. It is the duty of Crown Prosecutors to make sure that the right person is prosecuted for the right offence. In doing so, they must always act in the interests of justice and not solely for the purpose of obtaining a conviction.
<P>

<a name="20118w03.html_para11">The code further advises that Crown Prosecutors should select charges which reflect the seriousness of the offending, give the court adequate sentencing powers and enable the case to be presented in a clear and simple way. 



<P>
<P><I>18 Jan 2002 : Column 496W</I><P>
This means that Crown Prosecutors may not always continue with the most serious charge where there is a choice.
<P>

<a name="20118w03.html_para12">There are two stages in the decision to prosecute. The first stage is the evidential test. If the case does not pass the evidential test, it must not go ahead. If the case does meet the evidential test, Crown Prosecutors must decide if a prosecution is needed in the public interest.
<P>

<a name="20118w03.html_para13">In addition to statutory provisions and the Code for Crown Prosecutors, the Crown Prosecution Service, Crown Prosecutors are guided by charging standards, nationally agreed with the police for a range of offences, including offences of violence.

<P>

<a name="20118w03.html_para14">CPS Essex has moved to a Criminal Justice Unit and Trial Unit structure. This move, together with the Narey reforms have meant that prosecutors are involved at a far earlier stage of the process and are able to provide advice.

 The staffing level for the Essex area of the Crown Prosecution Service on 1 April last year was 106.2 posts, comprising 37.6 prosecutor posts, and 68.6 administrative posts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20118w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 January 2002]:</i> Policy on the disbursement of the pooled budgets for conflict prevention is determined jointly by the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development, working together with the Cabinet Office and the Treasury.
<P>

<a name="20118w04.html_para0">The aim of the pooled budgets is to reduce the number of people whose lives are affected by violent conflict and the potential sources of future conflict. Strategies to achieve this are planned and reviewed through two sub-committees of the Cabinet Office Defence and Overseas Policy Committee, one for sub-Saharan Africa, the other for the rest of the world.
<P>

<a name="20118w04.html_para1">The strategy for sub-Saharan Africa includes, for example, assisting with building indigenous peacekeeping capacity, as well as conflict resolution and security sector reform in Sierra Leone. Strategies for the rest of the world include regional strategies in the Balkans, central and eastern Europe, South Asia and the middle east, and functional strategies like assisting UN peacekeeping reform and controlling small arms and light weapons.
<P>

<a name="20118w04.html_para2">The budgets also contribute to the additional costs of the UK's support to peacekeeping and peace-enforcement operations. In 2001&#150;02 these have included commitments in Sierra Leone, Macedonia, Bosnia, Kosovo, and the Iraqi no-fly zones. Conflict prevention priorities and strategies are reviewed annually.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20118w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Flying hours are not generally lost due to bad weather, as postponed flights will usually take place on a subsequent occasion. However weather conditions at RAF stations are assessed on an approximately hourly basis. Table 1 shows the percentage of occasions where weather conditions were assessed as 'red', ie the most severe conditions in terms of visibility and cloud cover. Table 2 shows the percentage of occasions when gusts of over 30 knots were registered. Not all flights are necessarily postponed in these conditions.

 The Ministry of Defence has a policy to assess each wind farm proposal on a case-by-case basis.

<P>

<a name="20118w04.html_para3">If the developer subsequently proceeds to seek formal planning permission from the local planning authority (LPA) and the site lies outside a formally safeguarded area then there is no statutory obligation on the authority to consult Defence Estates although most do so. In cases where the MOD does object to a proposal and the developer continues with the project then Defence Estates would seek to be formally consulted by the local authority.
<P>

<a name="20118w04.html_para4">As with all planning application consultations, Defence Estates Safeguarding strives to meet the response deadlines imposed by the planning process. Where we are unable to meet the deadline because the assessment is still being undertaken the LPA are advised to wait for our reply before consent is given.

 <i>[holding answer 17 January 2002]:</i> Eleven Antonov aircraft sorties have been flown to date in support of UK force deployments to Afghanistan. Six further sorties have been contracted. &#163;4 million has been spent to date.
<P>

<a name="20118w04.html_para5">The nature of airfields available in Afghanistan, together with the threat presented by surface-to-air missiles (SAM) had limited the RAF to the use of Hercules transport aircraft, which are fitted with a defensive aids suite. While the Hercules is a versatile and capable aircraft, the Antonov has a far greater payload, and has enabled the more rapid deployment of equipment, since the company operating the Antonovs has not restricted their use, even with the SAM threat.
<P>

<a name="20118w04.html_para6">A review of the threat to aircraft, and the re-opening of Kabul International airport, is likely to mean that use of the RAF's C-17 aircraft will soon be possible. However, the demanding timetable for the operation in Afghanistan is likely to mean that further Antonov charter will be required.

scheme of providing pensions, at a rate of one half the serving members' pension, to widows and widowers of personnel who retired before 1 April 1973.  [27193]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20118w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) increased the rate of widows' and widowers' pension from one third of the members pension to one half, from 31 March 1973. Individuals serving on or after this date were provided with the opportunity to make additional contributions so as to qualify former service for the half rate of widows' pension. On this basis, it would be difficult, in equity, to extend the half rate pension to widows whose husbands had left the service before that date and who had not, as a result, contributed financially towards the improvement. It has also been the long- standing policy of successive Governments that discretionary changes to improve the benefits offered by public service pension schemes should be implemented for future service only.
<P>

<a name="20118w05.html_para0">We do not know exactly how many people would be affected by such a change, but we estimate the cost for the Armed Forces Pension Scheme to be &#163;25&#150;30 million per year. The cost would be substantially higher if the improvement were extended to other public service pension schemes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will estimate the cost to the Armed Forces Pension Scheme of entitling servicemen and women who retired before 31 March 1973 to buy-in to the scheme's improved benefits in respect of providing widows and widowers a full half pension.  [27194]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20118w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 As such a change would be on a "buy-in" basis, we would expect the cost of extending the half rate pensions to pre-1973 widows and widowers to be covered by contributions. The Ministry of Defence would incur administration costs but these would be relatively small. However, such changes have been ruled out by the long-standing policy of successive Governments that scheme improvements should not be retrospective.

<P>
<a name="20118w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 January 2002]:</i> The UK's approach to providing support to UN training is through a flexible programme of training aimed at enhancing multinational co-operation and interoperability, and strengthening the integrated civil-military approach to peace support operations. This is achieved through conferences, seminars and workshops, expanding places on, or reorientating, existing courses and the development of bespoke UN courses. This is being carried out very successfully throughout locations within the UK and abroad. While a dedicated UN military staff college remains a possibility, we are not currently pursuing the establishment of one.

films the Film Council has financially supported in each year since its creation; what the total income for each of those films is; what estimate the Film Council has made of each film's total audience; and if she will make a statement.  [27754]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20118w05.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Film Council has directly or indirectly financially supported a total of 58 feature length films to date since its creation. Of these, 15 were directly funded from the Film Council Lottery funds which became operational in October 2000. The remainder were funded through the pre-existing Lottery film franchises or through the interim arrangements with the film production activities of its predecessor bodies&#151;the Arts Council of England (through Lottery funding) and British Screen Ltd. (through grant in aid funding).
<P>

<a name="20118w05.html_para1">The total cash received by the Film Council to 31 December 2001 against the 58 titles is &#163;2,091,739. A film is normally expected to generate income over several years and the income received to date against these titles is therefore only a small part of the expected return on investment.
<P>

<a name="20118w05.html_para2">The Film Council does not produce estimates of total audience for individual films. A film's earning potential spans a number of international markets or countries and a range of media platforms (including cinema, video, DVD, and television) and it is therefore unrealistic to attempt to estimate total audience.

[27753]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20118w05.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Film Council was allocated &#163;31.474 million in income from the National Lottery Distribution Fund during the 2000&#150;01 financial year. The Film Council allocated &#163;33.82 million of lottery funding to projects and paid out &#163;20.003 million in the same year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many schools will be granted specialist school status in the bidding rounds during 2002; what proportion this is of the total number of expected bids; and if she will make a statement.  [27052]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20118w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 It is difficult to estimate the number of bids we will receive this year but it is likely to be at least as many (both in March and October) as in the October 2001 competition, when 261 schools made applications. Our published target is to have at least 830 specialist schools by September 2002. There are 463 specialist schools at present.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what plans she has to establish nurture groups in primary schools in order to give special assistance to young children with social and educational problems; and if she will make a statement.  [27047]<P>

<a name="20118w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The Government recognise the benefit that nurture groups can provide for disaffected young children or those with emotional behavioural and other difficulties (EBD).
<P>

<a name="20118w10.html_para2">A number of LEAs and schools already use this approach for pupils with EBD. In June 2001, My Department published guidance on promoting children's mental health in early years and school settings, which includes the use of nurture groups as an effective early intervention strategy for young children in schools who have mental health difficulties. In co-operation with the Coram Foundation we will also be publishing guidance later this year on effective strategies for dealing with pupils with behavioural and other difficulties. This will include the use of nurture groups as one of a range of strategies primary schools might adopt. It is for individual schools to decide where it is appropriate for nurture groups to be used depending on the needs of the children and the school's circumstances.

 The aim is to include a broad cross- section of primary and secondary schools from across the country, together with a small number of special schools since it is vital that lessons learned from the project have credibility and wide application. We shall be taking into account factors such as school size and location, as well as securing participant schools showing a range of pupil attainment and teacher turnover. We shall want to include schools which are already developing innovative practice and we also plan to ensure there is representation of some in challenging circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20118w11.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Laws: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will make a statement on the level of schools' reserves; whether the present level of reserves is in excess of guidelines; and if she will make a statement.  [27050]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20118w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 At the end of the financial year 1999&#150;2000, balances held by maintained schools in England amounted in total to approximately &#163;723 million: this figure is derived from the outturn statements prepared by local education authorities under section 52 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, and represents surpluses net of deficits.
<P>

<a name="20118w11.html_para0">Prudent financial management will normally entail the retention by schools of reasonable reserves, whether on a contingency basis or by way of saving to meet large planned items of future expenditure. In view of the widely varying circumstances of individual schools, my right hon. Friend does not consider that the promulgation of specific guideline figures by the Department would be helpful. It is the responsibility of LEAs to monitor the level of balances in the schools which they maintain, and 



<P>
<P><I>18 Jan 2002 : Column 521W</I><P>
to challenge those schools whose balances appear, in all the circumstances, to be excessive. Where a school persistently retains a large balance for no clear reason, it is open to the LEA to consider whether delegation should be suspended under section 51 of the School Standards and Framework Act.

<a name="20118w11.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Wray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the average starting salary is for newly qualified teachers in <i>(a)</i> London and <i>(b)</i> the rest of the UK; after how long a newly qualified teacher will receive a pay rise; and if she will make a statement on teachers' pay with special reference to rises they have had since 1997, and pay rises they will receive.  [27673]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20118w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 A newly qualified teacher in England and Wales with a second class honours degree or above currently starts at point two of the main scale on &#163;17,001 pa. Others start on &#163;16,038 pa. Schools may start teachers higher up the scale to recognise any other experience they consider relevant. Teachers working in inner London receive an extra &#163;3,000 pa; those in outer London receive an extra &#163;1,974 pa and those on the fringe receive an extra &#163;765 pa. All teachers receive a pay increase in April of each year when the pay scales are revalorised. In the early part of their career, teachers will also receive an increment in September when, subject to satisfactory performance, they move up one point on the main qualified teachers' pay scale. Schools have discretion to advance excellent performers by two points in any year. Later in their career, any further pay advancement can be justified only by excellent performance or promotion.
<P>

<a name="20118w11.html_para1">As a result of the performance threshold system and other pay improvements, good experienced teachers in England and Wales have received an extra 25 per cent. in pay since 1997. This is 17 per cent. in real terms. We have established a new upper pay spine for teachers with a maximum of &#163;31,128. The maximum pay for the advanced skills teacher grade we have introduced is &#163;44,571. Our school leaders can now earn up to &#163;78,783.
<P>

<a name="20118w11.html_para2">Teachers' pay in England and Wales is based on recommendations made by the independent School Teachers' Review Body (STRB). They are shortly due to publish their report detailing their recommendations for 2002&#150;03. My right hon. Friend will consult key stakeholders before implementing any changes. Scotland and Northern Ireland are responsible for their own pay arrangements for their teachers.

 Promotion of human rights is at the heart of our foreign policy and we regard freedom of thought, conscience and religion as very important human rights.

 The use of the SNOMED system produced by the College of American Pathologists, and in particular SNOMED RT, has been assessed in other countries. The clinical details that it contained were weak in the area of primary care. However, because the Clinical Terms Version 3 (Read Codes) produced by the national health service were strong in the area of primary care the opportunity to have a collaborative project between the NHS and the College of American Pathologists was seized. The combined product, SNOMED CT (Clinical Terms) will contain over 400,000 clinical terms. Other countries and healthcare organisations who have SNOMED RT systems will be upgrading their systems to SNOMED CT when it has been tested and released.

<a name="20118w12.html_para6">Over the past two years the authority has rationalised its offices from 23 to 11. This has invariably caused a need to relocate some staff from one site to another.

Teenage parents are also eligible for the education maintenance allowance in areas where this is being piloted, two of which (Cornwall and Stoke) are testing additional flexibilities to meet the needs of teenage parents, including a longer period of eligibility for the allowance.

 The revenue allocations announced on 6 December represent the latest stage in the Government's programme of sustained investment and reform in the national health service set out in the NHS Plan last year. There is only limited earmarking of funds within allocations so that the NHS locally can flexibly manage all the resources available. This means it is not possible to break down the allocations by interventions or by drugs.

 We recognise this is a very important national service and good progress has been made in making it available to those who might benefit from the procedure.

 The list at Article 2(2) is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all the serious criminal offences under the national law of all member states. To answer this question in full would require listing all the offences in English law which might fall under one of the generic headings of offences in Article 2(2) of the Council Framework Decision on the European arrest warrant, and which are punishable by a maximum sentence of at least three years, and cross-referring them to all the offences in the penal codes of the other member states of the European Union (EU) which fall under these headings which are punishable by this sentence. The generic headings listed at Article 2(2) relate to conduct for which there are criminal sanctions in all the member states of the EU, even if the legal definitions of the offences do not precisely match.

 All arrangements for official travel are made in line with the guidance set out in Chapter 7 of the Ministerial Code, and the accompanying guidance document "Travel by Ministers", using the most efficient and cost effective mode of transport, and bearing in mind security considerations. My last official visit by train was on 11 December last year to address the Balsall Health Forum in the west midlands. For this visit I returned to London by rail from Birmingham New Street to London Euston. I intend to continue using the railway for official travel whenever this is practical.

 <i>[holding answer 17 January 2002]:</i> We have not assessed the motivation of child asylum seekers. All asylum applications, regardless of the applicant's age, will be considered in accordance with the criteria set out in the United Nations convention relating to the status of refugees.
<P>

<a name="20118w18.html_para3">There is no common motivation for those facilitating child asylum seekers. Some will act altruistically, others to improve the economic or educational prospects of family members. But there are many whose motivation is profit and the involvement of organised people smuggling gangs is becoming increasingly common.

 Information about the likely time scale for considering applications for leave to remain is quoted in the relevant application form and on the Immigration and Nationality Directorate website. The website is updated regularly. Since 1 January 2002, all new applications for leave to remain are being acknowledged. The acknowledgement letter indicates the likely time scale for the application to be considered. If, on initial consideration, the application cannot be decided for whatever reason, another letter giving a further indication of the likely time scale is sent to the applicant.

 We aim to decide 70 per cent. of all new general and settlement applications within three weeks but at present it is taking up to eight weeks to consider new straightforward applications. The reasons for this are (i) the exceptionally high number of new applications received this year, and especially, in recent months; and (ii) process changes that are being introduced. We are working to reduce this to three weeks or less as soon as possible.

 On 14 January the Passport Service introduced two new guaranteed services at its public counters. These are a same day service at &#163;75 for a standard passport and a one week service at &#163;60 for a standard passport. The standard two week service (non-guaranteed) remains available for postal application. The same day service is not available for first passport applications because of the time needed to complete checks on identity. Applications to replace lost or stolen passports are dealt with in the same way as first applications, because the high incidence of fraud makes it necessary to check identity and records of the previous issue. This means that the fastest service normally available for replacement of a lost or stolen passport is the guaranteed one week service.

 It is current policy to disperse asylum seekers away from London and the south-east. In his statement on 29 October last year my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary made it clear that the policy of dispersing asylum seekers away from London and the south-east would continue. I can confirm that to date the Immigration and Nationality Directorate has not identified any areas in Essex suitable for use as cluster areas for the dispersal of asylum seekers.
