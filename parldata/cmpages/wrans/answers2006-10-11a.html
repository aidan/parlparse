Government&#146;s (DCLG) principal areas of responsibility regarding
planning issues relating to casinos are planning legislation, planning
policy, development plans and planning applications. We are working
with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) to ensure that
the licensing and planning regimes, though separate, work well
together. </p><p><a name="06101336007904">The
Department has recently been responsible for introducing changes in
secondary legislation to tighten the controls in relation to changes of
use of existing premises. Prior to April 2006, casinos were classified
as part of Class D2: &#147;Assembly and Leisure&#148;. This meant
that any use within Class D2 could undergo a change of use to a casino
and would not be considered as development, and would not therefore
need planning permission. In April 2006, we amended the regulations for
casinos, removing them from class D2 of the &#147;Use Classes
Order&#148;, so that planning permission is needed for changes of use
to a casino.</p><p><a name="06101336007905">The
Department also has lead responsibility for developing national
planning policy. Relevant policy statements include Planning Policy
Statement 6 &#147;Planning for Town Centres&#148; and Planning
Policy Guidance Note 13: &#147;Transport&#148;, and the two joint
DCMS/DCLG policy statements of August 2003 and June

Cooper:</b> The Government&#146;s policy on altering Green
Belt boundaries remains as set out in Planning Policy Guidance note 2
(PPG2), Green Belts. PPG2 explains that once the general extent of a
Green Belt has been approved, it should be altered only in exceptional
circumstances. If such an alteration is proposed, the Secretary of
State will wish to be satisfied that all opportunities for development
within the urban areas contained by and beyond the Green Belt have been
considered. Similarly, detailed Green Belt boundaries defined in local
development plan documents or earlier approved development plans,
should be altered only
exceptionally.</p><p><a name="06101336007918">Any
proposals to alter the general extent of the Metropolitan Green Belt
must be brought forward through the London Plan or, for Green Belt land
outside London, the Regional Spatial Strategies (RSS) for the South
East and East of
England.</p><p><a name="06101336007919">There are no

draft RSS produced by the Regional
Assembly.</p><p><a name="06101336007921">The Panel
recommends that the general extent of the Metropolitan Green Belt in
Hertfordshire and Essex is appropriate and should be maintained.
However it recommends that strategic reviews of Green Belt boundaries
are needed at certain locations to ensure that development needs during
the period to 2021 and thereafter are provided at the most sustainable
locations. These reviews would remove only a very small proportion of
the total area currently designated as Green Belt. The Panel also
recommend that reviews consider the potential for compensating
extensions to the Green Belt. The implication is that areas proposed to
be added to the Green Belt would be larger than the sum of areas
removed.</p><p><a name="06101336007922">The

Healthy&#151;&#145;functional&#146;&#151;families create and
sustain an environment that promotes emotional and physical health and
psychological well-being for their members. The idea of
&#145;dysfunctional&#146; families refers to a broad and complex
range of different circumstances and processes which interfere with
healthy family functioning. Because of this complex interplay between
different factors, it is not possible to produce one simple statistical
&#145;measure&#146; of the number of dysfunctional families.
Equally, there is no simple measure of the number of lone-parent
families who might be categorised as
&#145;dysfunctional&#146;.</p><p><a name="06101336008010">What
is clear from research is that, while being a member of a lone-parent
family often brings additional challenges such as greater likelihood of
living in poverty, many lone parents are able to function very
effectively and to bring up their children to be happy, healthy and
productive members of society.</p><br>

removal of vertical column from cattle aged over 24 months at
slaughter, as specified risk material (SRM). The harmonisation of the
UK&#146;s SRM controls with those across the EU, was a direct
consequence of the EU&#146;s lifting of the ban on the export of beef
and live cattle from the UK. The lifting of the export ban, in May
2006, was very welcome news for the beef
industry.</p><p><a name="06101336008074">To address
industry concerns about the SRM changes, the Food Standards Agency
Board agreed to apply a derogation to allow the removal of vertical
column from cattle aged between 24 and 30 months at slaughter, in
authorised butcher&#146;s
shops.</p><p><a name="06101336008075">The application
of the 24-month age limit for bovine vertebral column as SRM, was the
subject of a joint DEFRA and Food Standards Agency public consultation,
launched on 12 October 2005, entitled: &#147;Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy: Consultation on lifting the export ban and harmonising
specified risk material controls applicable in the UK with those in
other member states&#148;. The consultation, which included a partial
regulatory impact assessment, is available on the DEFRA website at:

gamekeepers on their own premises, so falling into definition (2)

providing clean water and sanitation, and small loans. We believe that
doing this through the Government of Afghanistan provides a more
sustainable solution and may help mitigate some of the security risks.
We have also seen some impact in Helmand from the work undertaken
through the Research into Alternative Livelihoods Fund programme,

Medical conditions may be unknown because: Not all Pathways
participants claim IB (they may claim Income Support with a Disability
Premium) and medical condition is only recorded for those claiming IB;
or The National Benefits Database lags behind other Pathways to Work
Evaluation Database sources by some three to four months. This means
that the database does not contain information on the medical condition
of customers starting Pathways in later months; or IB data from the NBD
is based on a six-weekly snapshot, which means that some short-term IB
claims of less than six weeks never appear on the database. This means
that we do not have medical condition information for some customers
who have claimed IB for less than six weeks. 8. The National
Benefits Database only includes information on a customer's primary
medical condition despite the fact that often people will have more
than one medical
