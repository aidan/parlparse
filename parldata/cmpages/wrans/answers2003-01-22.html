<P>
<a name="30122w01.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The UK is committed to reducing global poverty as measured by progress towards achieving the MDGs. The Department for International Development has bilateral programmes in a number of coffee producing developing countries where poor people's livelihoods are significantly dependent on coffee production. These include Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda; and Guatemala and Nicaragua. The UK supports countries in the development and implementation of their poverty reduction strategies, including nationally owned agricultural diversification plans to deal with commodity dependency. In Uganda, DFID is supporting a feasibility analysis for coffee certification to help poor producers realise better prices for their production. DFID also supports research in several coffee producing countries aimed at improving the competitiveness of smallholder production.

 We are pleased with the outcome of the Fifth Asia and Pacific Population (ESCAP) Conference. The plan of action adopted at Bangkok represents a balanced, comprehensive and constructive framework for addressing reproductive health and poverty in the Asia/Pacific region and fully reaffirms the principles agreed at the 1994 Cairo International Conference on Population and Development. It will help the region to make progress on the millennium development goals especially maternal and infant mortality and tackling HIV/AIDS.

 HMG supports debt relief for Ethiopia within the framework of the internationally agreed Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Ethiopia qualified for interim debt relief from international creditors under HIPC at Decision Point in November 2001. This temporarily reduces the debt service payments Ethiopia has to pay. Ethiopia will qualify for irrevocable debt relief when it reaches Completion Point in the next year or two. Total HIPC debt relief over time will amount to $1.9 billion. These resources will be freed up for Government of Ethiopia to use for poverty reduction.

<P>

<a name="30122w01.html_para5">My Department published a revised strategy for improving the poor performance of the European Community development programme in August 2001. I welcome the positive steps that the reform process has taken, including establishment for the first time of an EC development policy which secured poverty reduction as the central objective. We continue to work for agreement that a much greater share of EC aid should be allocated to low income countries where it will have the greatest impact on poverty reduction. In 2000, only 38 per cent. of EC aid was spent in low income countries compared to 70 per cent. in 1990. Indications are that the 2001 figure shows an improvement. Our objective remains to reverse this decline in order to improve the focus and effectiveness of EC aid.

: My Department has provided financial support to the media campaigns of the Fairtrade Foundation designed specifically to raise both supermarket and consumer awareness of products carrying the Fairtrade Mark. In particular DFID has provided &pound;120,000 to the Fairtrade Foundation over three years (2001&#150;03) in support of its efforts to target new groups through its annual Fairtrade Fortnight campaigns.
<P>

<a name="30122w01.html_para6">In addition, last year DFID approved a project (at a total cost of &pound;300,000) designed to address a recognised bottleneck within Fair Trade&#151;namely the limited number of products for which international Fair Trade standards exist. The project aims to develop new Fair Trade product standards, secure the registration of new producer groups and help bring additional Fair Trade products to supermarket shelves over the next two years. The target is to increase the retail value of Fair Trade sales in the UK to over &pound;100 million per annum by 2004 and by so doing extend the benefits of Fair Trade to a greater number of producers in developing countries. By expanding the scale of Fair Trade activities, the project also aims to secure a sustainable future for the Fairtrade Foundation, so that its core operational costs (including the cost of subsequent promotional activities) can be fully funded from the income it receives from licensees.
<P>

<a name="30122w01.html_para7">Although a niche market, Fair Trade can play a catalytic role. In the UK and Europe, the activities of the Fair Trade movement have raised awareness of the positive impact our buying decisions can have on poverty. These activities have in turn contributed to the growing demand for ethical trading standards to be employed by multinational companies in their dealings with developing country suppliers.

 We have not so far been advised of arrangements for a donor conference on Angola, although I understand that the Angolan Government would like one to take place in Brussels within the next few months. Rather than a pledging conference, we and other donor countries see this as a timely opportunity for discussion between the donor community and the Government on their plans for economic and social reform and development, building on the base of last year's peace agreement, and on the status of their discussions with the international financial institutions. We hope to continue to provide support to Angola in economic and social reform, effective governance, demobilisation and reconciliation, and the development and implementation of a national poverty reduction strategy. We will also continue to respond to Angola'surgent humanitarian needs for as long as this is required.

DFID has also contributed US$ 50,000 in support of a mine action database. The United Kingdom contributed 19.7 per cent. of the 6 million euros which the EC has made available for mine action in Angola. This included 5 million euros to a variety of mine clearance agencies.

<P>

<a name="30122w02.html_para1">We recognise that this project raises a number of potential social and environmental concerns. My original approval to the World Bank contributing towards the project was based on the view that it had the potential significantly to reduce poverty in Chad, one of the poorest countries in the world. I also believe the project will take much fuller account of social and environmental considerations with World Bank involvement than without. Project approval followed extensive improvements to the design to ensure that the project met the bank's environmental and social safeguards, and the introduction of mechanisms to monitor such impacts and ensure that oil revenues would serve to finance mainly poverty expenditures. Significant changes were made to the proposed route of the pipeline to reduce the impact on the natural and human environments. Since the project was approved, the bank, and International Finance Corporation, have allocated exceptional resources to monitor and support

 Debt relief alone cannot deliver the resources needed to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and significant new resources will be required. Developing countries generally, not just heavily indebted poor countries face a financing gap in meeting the MDGs. Further debt relief to HIPCs would not be an effective way of generating additional resources. Most bilateral creditors, like the UK, have already written off all or nearly all of the debts from HIPCs, so further relief would have to come almost

<P><I>22 Jan 2003 : Column 311W</I><P>
entirely from existing resources provided by the multilaterals, such as the World bank. This would mean skewing money away from other equally poor non-HIPC countries, which might have better policy environments than some HIPCs. This is why we have focused on debt relief as a means of ensuring debt sustainability, and why additional donor resources will inevitably be needed to meet the MDGs.

 The UK is concerned about the issue of creditor participation in the HIPC Initiative. Debt relief from commercial creditors accounts for only 4.4 per cent. of HIPC relief, but the potential costs to HIPC countries in terms of administrative and legal costs are much higher. We have raised this with the World Bank and the IMF, and at the G7 Summit in Kananaskis in June 2002. Bank and fund staffs are increasing the pressure on non-participating creditors. We welcome the decision last September to publish details of creditor participation&#151;something we had pressed for&#151;and we hope that it will increase international pressure on all creditors to deliver their share of relief. We have also asked the World Bank and the IMF to come forward with more proposals to promote creditor participation, such as a donor-funded technical assistance facility to provide legal advice to HIPC countries facing litigation. Staff are currently preparing a paper.

<P>
<a name="30122w03.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The Government has been working to win greater international concern for the problems of debt sustainability facing some Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) as a result of falling commodity prices and I have raised these concerns at the Development Committee of the World Bank repeatedly over recent years. In Ottawa in November 2001, we asked Bank and Fund staff to revisit the debt sustainability analyses of all commodity dependent low-income countries, including HIPCs. The HIPC Initiative now has the flexibility to provide, when appropriate, additional debt relief at Completion Point, so called 'lopping up', to ensure that countries exit the HIPC process with sustainable levels of debt. However, this is not enough and the UK is pressing the World Bank and the IMF to widen their approach to topping up, so that any HIPC country facing unsustainable debts, that has demonstrated its commitment to poverty reduction and economic reform, should qualify for this additional relief. In April 2002, Burkina Faso became the first country to qualify for topping up. Debt relief alone, however, cannot guarantee future sustainability. This requires sound macroeconomic policies, strong growth and export bases, including access to markets of developed countries, access to adequate financing on highly concessional loan and grant terms, and prudent policies on new borrowing. The UK is co-financing a

<P>
<P>
<a name="30122w03.html_wqn4"><B> John Barrett </B> 
: To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what consideration is given to the costs associated with <i>(a)</i> the millennium development goals and <i>(b)</i> combating HIV/AIDS in the construction of poverty reduction strategy papers for countries wishing to enter the HIPC initiative.  [91162]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30122w03.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="30122w03.html_para2">In line with the principle of ownership and country-led processes which the UK has championed, Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) set national development targets which, in most cases, closely overlap with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The costings section of PRSPs provides an estimate of the cost of reaching these national development targets and how HIPC debit relief is to be allocated accordingly.
<P>

<a name="30122w03.html_para3">For many HIPC countries, HIV/AIDS is an important factor in the analysis of poverty trends for PRSPs and usually costed within the health sector plans. HIV/AIDS is a multi-sector issue, and we are working with developing country partners to strengthen the quality of these plans and costings.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on the impact of the failure of the Government of Mozambique to declare a national emergency on international efforts to assist in providing for the needs of people unable to meet their food needs up to the next harvest period in March 2003.  [92607]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30122w03.html_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The current situation in Mozambique should be seen in the context of the country's increased ability to meet its food needs and respond to such a crisis and the Government's legitimate caution about undermining coping strategies or risking donor fatigue.
<P>

<a name="30122w03.html_para4">Food production has recovered since the end of the long war in Mozambique, from 80 per cent. dependency on food aid in 1992 to now only importing about 20 per cent. of its food. The Government of Mozambique have been able to respond early to the threat of the current drought. For example the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development provided seeds 



<P>
<P><I>22 Jan 2003 : Column 314W</I><P>
and other agricultural inputs to drought-affected families, and has begun to rehabilitate small dams and irrigation schemes. The Government are conscious of the risks of large handouts of food aid contributing to weakening local self-help initiatives as people abandon traditional coping mechanisms.
<P>

<a name="30122w03.html_para5">Mozambique is subject to recurrent natural disasters and has frequently been forced to declare national emergencies, most recently in the floods of 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02. The current drought affects about 3 per cent. of the population, nearly all of them in sparsely populated, semi-arid areas of the country. In this context, the Government have not declared an emergency due to legitimate concerns about donor fatigue and a perception that the current crisis forms part of a long-term trend to increased vulnerability in the drought areas, which cannot be solved with short-term aid alone.
<P>

<a name="30122w03.html_para6">The lack of a formal declaration of emergency has made it difficult for some donors to mobilise emergency funds, and Mozambique has not been able to form part of the Consolidated Appeal Process or the regional appeal of the Federation of the Red Cross. UN efforts in providing co-ordination services to humanitarian stakeholders have been hampered and there has been limited mapping of humanitarian programmes, leading to poor information about gaps in the delivery of assistance and difficulties with the identification of sensible projects.
<P>

<a name="30122w03.html_para7">However, although the Government have not made a formal joint appeal, they have requested help from individual UN agencies, eg WFP (food aid), UNICEF (supplementary feeding) and FAO (seeds and other agricultural interventions). DFID has contributed to supporting these.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what steps her Department is taking to promote good governance and respect for human rights in Sudan.  [91684]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30122w04.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The only long-term answer to improving human rights situation in Sudan is a peace settlement. We believe the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) peace process offers the best chance to bring an end to the civil war through a negotiated settlement between the Government of Sudan and the SPLM/A. In 2002, the talks produced breakthroughs on the key issues of state and religion and self-determination for the south and a Memorandum of Understanding on a cessation of hostilities and unimpeded humanitarian access and agreement on aspects of power and wealth-sharing, as well as human rights.
<P>

<a name="30122w04.html_para3">The war in Sudan has prevented many donors, including the UK, from carrying out a development programme in Sudan over the past decade. Over $500 million of development funding will become available from the international community when there is peace: this is an important incentive for the warring parties to reach a comprehensive agreement. We are co-ordinating closely with other donor countries on all matters, including assessing support for good governance. Until there is a peace agreement, we will continue to support life-saving humanitarian work and peacebuilding activities such as personnel to monitor the ceasefire in the Nuba Mountains, support for anti-slavery work and for the IGAD secretariat.

United Kingdom Armed Forces personnel included in the voluntary immunisation programme against anthrax are encouraged to take advantage of the additional protection it provides. All personnel included in the programme are comprehensively briefed on the disease and on the vaccine, and given time to consider whether to accept it. The briefing includes an information leaflet, a video, a briefing from a commanding officer and an opportunity to speak to a doctor. All the briefing materials were drawn up with the assistance of expert medical advice. There is also a help-line, and copies of all the printed materials are available from the MOD web-site [www.mod.uk] along with links to additional information and answers to frequently asked questions.

<a name="30122w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The McKinsey report confirmed that the rationale for a fully integrated Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO) remains as persuasive now as it was at the time of the strategic defence review in 1998. The DLO has made real, demonstrable progress towards its strategic objectives, while continuing to provide a high level of support to operations and exercises. The McKinsey report identifies the key principles that will underpin the long-term strategy for 



<P>
<P><I>22 Jan 2003 : Column 322W</I><P>
logistics support, and proposes improvements in the three core logistics processes (procurement, engineering and asset management, and materiel flow), many of which build on existing good practice within the DLO. The key principles and performance targets are embedded in the new DLO strategic plan, and work to deliver against these objectives is being taken forward in the DLO change programme. McKinsey also identified a need for wider end-to-end review of the logistics processes in the land and air environments, and this is now the subject of a separate follow up study that will report in the summer.
<P>

<a name="30122w05.html_para1">Staff numbers in the DLO are reducing as a result of a number of initiatives and rationalisation measures already implemented, such as the warship support modernisation initiative. The McKinsey report suggested that more significant reductions in DLO staff numbers could be achieved. More study and testing will be required before any firm conclusions can be drawn. Any reduction in staff numbers will be as a consequence of changes to modernise logistic processes and any decisions to change how the DLO's current provider functions should be undertaken in the future.

 As my right hon.

<P>

<a name="30122w06.html_para0">The setting of Fairtrade criteria for the selection of suppliers would be contrary to the EC public procurement directives, which apply to this type of procurement. These rules prohibit both positive and negative forms of discrimination. The Ministry of Defence's approach is to publish its forthcoming, higher value, requirements for products that might have Fairtrade sources of supply in the Official Journal of the European Communities, and to set out in those advertisements the supplier selection and contract award criteria that will be applied. Fairtrade suppliers who satisfy the criteria and offer value for money solutions to MOD's requirements will always have every opportunity to be successful.

The RAF have trained personnel in the Gulf region to support long-term operations. No additional RAF personnel have been deployed.

All military ships have a management system for environmental compliance and this is audited on a regular basis. In addition, any pollution incident is reported and the appropriate steps taken to minimise the pollution potential.

In addition to the Helicopter Landing Platform (HMS Ocean) and the Landing Ship Logistic RFA Sir Bedivere, on current plans the Royal Navy will also have available two new Landing Platform Docks (HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark) and four new Bay Class Landing Ship Dock (Auxiliary). The Invincible Class Aircraft Carriers are also capable of operating in the amphibious assault role. There are no current plans to change the Royal Marines manning requirement. Table 31 of the Departmental Performance Report 2001&#150;02 provides details of Royal Marines units.

 The original target date for the completion of the National Flood and Coastal Defence Database (NFCDD) was 1 September 2000. However, early analysis indicated this was not achievable. Subsequently, the delivery has proved more complex than originally envisaged, and it is currently being installed at EA sites. The revised date for delivery of Phases One and Two is now June 2003. Positive steps have been taken to provide analysis and results required for other purposes in parallel with the database development to minimise the impacts of the delays.

 The Home Energy Conservation Act does not require Energy Conservation Authorities to report on specific energy efficiency measures or the numbers of buildings in which measures have been installed. They are required to report on the overall progress they have made in implementing measures they have identified as being practicable, cost-effective and likely to result in significant improvement in the energy efficiency of the residential accommodation in their area.

 The website is not the primary means of providing flood warning. The main flood warning systems operate effectively, including the Agency's Floodline telephone service, Automatic Voice Warning systems, news media information and direct manual warnings in flood warned areas.
<P>

<a name="30122w10.html_para0">However, the Environment Agency has recognised the problems that occurred on its website during the new year floods. It has acted to improve the reliability of its service by installing a new high volume service to provide flood warning information for up to 100,000 visitors an hour&#151;some 20 times more than the volume of visitors experienced during the peak of the new year floods.
<P>

<a name="30122w10.html_para1">In addition, the Agency has restructured its website so that the flood warning facility will be unaffected by other non-flood warning users, and updated the design and search facility to provide a more user-friendly service.

[91928]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30122w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department will seek to ensure that both human health and the ecosystems dependent upon groundwater are protected from the risks posed by mercury. We will be looking to ensure that the Water Framework Directive and the intended new &quot;daughter" Directive for Groundwater deliver the same high level of protection that is provided under the existing stringent regulatory regime covering mercury in groundwater.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30122w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Environment Agency has continued to receive significant grant-in-aid from the Department. This has increased from &pound;103.7 million in 1999&#150;2000 to &pound;116.7 million in 2002&#150;03 (figures in EA Corporate Plan for 2002&#150;03).
<P>

<a name="30122w10.html_para2">In total, the agency's budget (grant plus charges and levies) has increased from &pound;620 million in 1999&#150;2000 to just short of &pound;750 million in 2002&#150;03. These are substantial resources, and our view is that the agency is sufficiently funded to deliver its statutory responsibilities.

<P>
<a name="30122w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The information is as follows:
<P>

<a name="30122w10.html_para4"><i>(a)</i> The Water Framework Directive sets up a catchment-based system of managing water through the establishment of river basin districts. The Environment Agency, which the Government have proposed should be the competent authority for the directive, already manages water on a catchment basis. Therefore, although boundaries will be new, the principle will not.
<P>

<a name="30122w10.html_para5">In addition, England is well placed in legislative and institutional terms to implement the directive-in terms of the regulatory system, licence regimes and legal framework already in place. Our second consultation paper consults on what the gaps are and how they might be filled.
<P>

<a name="30122w10.html_para6">The activities required by the Water Framework Directive-such as review of human activity, economic analysis, co-ordination of river basin management plans and selection of programme(s) of measures-will enable water to be managed in a more holistic way which encourages interested parties to contribute more actively to how water is managed in their area.
<P>

<a name="30122w10.html_para7"><i>(b)</i> We are considering the implications of the Directive for land use planning at local government level in discussion with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Environment Agency and others.

 We are currently consulting on our proposals to give legal effect to the Directive. This includes proposals covering the public participation requirements of the Directive in Article 14. This is our second consultation and a third is planned for 2003. The Environment Agency have also, at our request, been carrying out consultation on various technical issues relating to the Directive.
<P>

<a name="30122w10.html_para11">In June 2001, we set up a forum for key stakeholders to discuss issues relating to the Water Framework Directive and water policy in general. Its membership covers a wide range of interests, including the environment, the water industry, agriculture, the countryside and industry. At its first meeting, the group agreed that it would have three main purposes: to provide input to Government thinking on transposition of the Water Framework Directive; raise issues of concern to the group relating to implementation of the WFD; and provide input into development of a long-term strategy for water.
<P>

<a name="30122w10.html_para12">In addition, Defra set up an interactive electronic stakeholder forum a year ago, with the aim of capturing a wider range of stakeholder views about the water environment.

 The Environment Agency warns people of flooding by at least two means. These usually are a direct warning using the EA's automatic voice messaging (AVM) system and local radio announcements when flood warnings are issued. The warnings are also posted on the EA's website. As part of the EA's flood awareness campaign, each householder in a flood risk area receives an annual mailing advising them what to do during a flood. The EA plans to increase coverage of direct warnings to each household as follows:

<P>
<P>
<a name="30122w11.html_spnew7"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 A property is designated as at risk from flooding from main rivers and the sea if it appears within the area shown at risk on the Environment Agency's Indicative Flood Maps (which are available on the internet). These maps show the best available information on flood risk. An extreme flood outline representing the 0.1 per cent. probability of flooding in any year is under development and will be published later in 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30122w11.html_spnew8"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 There are no plans to introduce a common 0.5 per cent, or other common standard and no national estimate of the costs of such a standard have beenmade. There could be as many as 10,000 separate flood risk areas in England covering a very wide variety of land uses from low grade agricultural land to major industrial sites. It would not be feasible or desirable to apply the same standards to all these areas. The exclusion of flood water from some areas, particularly from some agricultural and amenity land would significantly increase the flooding problems to be addressed elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="30122w11.html_para8">The Department does provide indicative standards, linked to guidance on project appraisal, which are designed to ensure that suitable standards for the relevant land use are adopted where it is technically feasible and economically worthwhile to do so.

[90179]<P>
<P>
<P>

 We understand from published information from UNMOVIC and the IAEA inspectors have visited all of the sites identified in the UK dossier. They have not reported uncovering any signs of weapons of mass destruction, or programmes for their production at the sites. Given that there had been considerable advance publicity about these sites, it is not entirely surprising that the inspectors failed to uncover any evidence of WMD programme at the sites. Compliance with the terms of UN Security Council Resolution 1441 must be more than simply allowing access to UN weapons inspectors. There must be full co-operation with the inspectors and complete openness about activities at all sites visited, as the Resolution requires.

 We support a UN-supported tribunal to bring to justice those Khmer Rouge leaders most responsible for the atrocities committed during their regime (1975&#150;79). The UK abstained in a vote on the Khmer Rouge Tribunal Resolution at the 2002 General Assembly because of our concerns that Cambodia's commitment to the process appeared in doubt when it failed to co-sponsor the Resolution; and the UN Secretary General had expressed reservations on the Resolution's implementation. These concerns were shared by a number of other states who also abstained. However, we welcome the recent resumption of talks between Cambodian and United Nations negotiators in New York and remain prepared to offer advice and financial support for a UN-supported tribunal.

<a name="30122w15.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport how many tests for erythropoietin and human growth hormones she expects to be conducted by UK Sport in each of the next three years; and if she will make a statement.  [91874]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30122w15.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The introduction to sport of testing for the detection of blood plasma expanders such as erythropoietin (EPO) is quite recent. The testing protocols are still being assessed to ensure that they are effective and at present there is not full agreement about the most appropriate testing regime for EPO. However, UK Sport, the national anti-doping organisation, is proposing to include EPO testing at several major events in the UK (both at and prior to the event) over the next 12 months. Previously, UK Sport has undertaken testing for EPO at the 2001 World Half Marathon, the 2002 London Marathon and the Commonwealth Games. UK Sport will continue to monitor the development of an agreed testing procedure.
<P>

<a name="30122w15.html_para2">As part of the 2002 Spending Review this government has allocated additional funds to UK Sport, which amounts to &pound;1.5 million in 2004&#150;05 and &pound;3.2 million in 2005&#150;06. Once testing protocols for EPO are agreed, this increase in funding will enable UK Sport to make a full assessment of the needs for this type of testing, to plan the delivery of testing in those sports that are at greatest risk from EPO abuse and to introduce EPO testing to the UK's on-going anti-doping programme.
<P>

<a name="30122w15.html_para3">There is no approved test for human growth hormones at present. However, UK Sport is regularly in touch with the leading experts on these substances who 



<P>
<P><I>22 Jan 2003 : Column 360W</I><P>
are based in the UK. Once a test is approved, UK Sport will be able to assess the need and the resources required to introduce human growth hormone testing to the UK's anti-doping programme.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what budget has been allocated for the education campaign due to be launched this spring on drug misuse; what assessment will take place of the effectiveness of the campaign; who will carry out the assessment; when the results will be published; and if he will make a statement.  [91673]<P>

<P>
<a name="30122w15.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The campaign is jointly funded by the Home Office and the Department for Health. &pound;3 million has been allocated in this year and a similar level of funding is anticipated over the following three years. The campaign will be fully evaluated, including a quantitative tracking survey which will be supplemented by qualitative surveys as appropriate. The evaluation contract is being commissioned through COI (Central Office of Information), the Government's communications agency, and we anticipate appointing a research agency in the near future. The tracking survey results will be placed in the Library when they become available.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30122w15.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 A number of legislative measures are in place to help tackle under-age drinking. The Licensing (Young Persons) Act 2000 made it an offence for any person to sell alcohol to a person under 18 on licensed premises, or knowingly to allow another person to do so. It also created the offence of buying, or attempting to buy, alcohol on licensed premises on behalf of a person under 18. Measures in the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 provided the police and local authorities with increased powers to tackle under-age drinking, including for example, measures to make it easier for local authorities to designate areas where restrictions on anti-social drinking will apply. It also created a positive duty on licensees and their staff not to sell alcohol to under 18s.
<P>

<a name="30122w15.html_para6">The Licensing Bill currently in the House of Lords contains proposals to amend the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 to reinstate the police power to

confiscate sealed containers (in addition to opened containers) from young people in public places, where a police officer reasonably believes that the young person is, or has been, or intends to, consume the alcohol in a public place.
<P>

<a name="30122w15.html_para7">In addition, the Home Office, together with other Departments, are working with the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit on their study into tackling the harm associated with alcohol misuse. This has involved a public consultation, run jointly with the Department of Health. The project will pay particular attention to issues such as alcohol-related crime and anti-social behaviour, problems faced by vulnerable groups such as children and what works best in tackling the problems of alcohol misuse.

 The capital spending on aerospace programmes, recorded in the departmental report (CM 5416), relates to the net capital requirement anticipated at the time the report was published taking account of the payments and receipts under the Government's portfolio of Launch Investment contracts. Through Launch Investment partnerships the Government support the design and development of civil aerospace projects in the UK.

 In July 2001 I announced a review of the Consumer Credit Act 1974.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30122w16.html_spnew4"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Companies providing debt management services, whether they charge or not, are required to be licensed under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Under the Act the Director General of Fair Trading (DGFT) has a duty to ensure applicants for a licence are fit to engage in the activities for which they are licensed.
<P>

<a name="30122w16.html_para5">In December 2001 the DGFT issued guidelines to debt management companies to ensure they deal fairly and openly with consumers&#151;the Debt Management Guidance (December 2001). A copy of the guidance can be found in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="30122w16.html_para6">The guidance requires that companies offering debt management services should comply with the best practice identified in it. Where the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has evidence of practices breaching the guidelines the DGFT can take action to refuse or revoke the consumer credit licence, or take such other action as appropriate under other legislation (e.g. Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations etc).
<P>

<a name="30122w16.html_para7">I am satisfied that the guidance ensures consumers a good level of protection; and I am looking forward with interest to the results of the Compliance Review which the OFT is currently undertaking.

<a name="30122w16.html_para8">Modifications P102, P103 and PI14 to the Balancing and Settlement Code (BSC) are currently in the assessment phase. Following the assessment phase, the BSC panel will make a recommendation to the authority on whether the modifications better achieve the BSC objectives. At the BSC Panel meeting on the 16th January 2003, the Panel rejected modification P95A and recommended that modification P100 be made. The authority will now make a final decision on their implementation on the basis of the BSC objectives and their wider statutory obligations.

<P>

<a name="30122w16.html_para9">The regulation places responsibility on the Commission to monitor its operation on a regular basis, and to report in May 2008.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>RE: Review and use of postcode information for the data processing, distribution and delivery of services.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You tabled a Parliamentary Question on 13 December 2002 to Patricia Hewitt, Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, concerning what use was made of post code areas for <i>(a)</i> the collection and publication of data, <i>(b)</i> devising of grants and awards and <i>(c)</i> the delivery of services; and when such usages were last reviewed. I have been asked to reply in respect of the Employment Tribunals Service (ETS), which is an executive agency of the DTI, providing the administrative support for the Employment Tribunals and the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) in Great Britain.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The ETS does not use postcode areas for the collection and publication of data. The agency's work does not involve devising formulae for the distribution of awards and grants, although the tribunals do make awards of compensation on the cases which they deal with, these are not determined according to postcode.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Prior to 1996, each office had a regional boundary which was defined, with some exceptions, along county borders. These borders were realigned along postcode area boundaries as a result of the de-centralisation of the applications process. This meant that applications were sent direct to the appropriate office, according to the post code of the place where the applicant either worked or applied to work. Since then, changes to the boundaries between offices have been made to accommodate changing workloads particularly the opening of a new tribunal office at Watford in July 2000, whose regional area was carved out of neighbouring regions by transferring post code areas to it.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Employment Tribunals in Scotland have retained their centralised system with all applications being sent to the Glasgow office, with cases then being generally assigned to a local office or hearing centre on the basis of the postcode of the applicant's home address. EAT has only two offices (London and Edinburgh) covering England & Wales and Scotland respectively, dealing with appeals split along the border between the two countries, not according to postcodes.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The agency is presently undertaking a review of the distribution of workloads with regards to the geographical match between the origin of tribunal cases and the present spread of its 33 offices and hearing centre around the country. This review was initiated as a result of a recommendation contained within 'Moving Forward: the report of the Employment Tribunal System Taskforce'. A full copy of the taskforce report can be accessed at www.employmenttribunalsystemtaskforce.gov.uk The work that is currently being done in support of the analysis of postcodes will also consider public transport links to our existing network of offices.</FONT></UL>

 Since 1997 in East Lancashire the Small Business Service (SBS) have made seven awards totalling &pound;167,000 to textile firms under the Enterprise Grant Scheme. SBS have also established an ethnic apparel support group to help companies market their products and assist with their production capacity. The North West Development Agency is working with North West &quot;TexNet", the Cluster Management Group for the textile industry, to identify further measures to sustain the industry and develop the cluster. NWDA will consider individual projects as they are brought forward and action as necessary.

 The national Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) scheme will be available from September 2004 across the whole of England.

<a name="30122w17.html_para1">In non-pilot areas such as Somerset, the first tranche of students who will be eligible to apply from that date will be those students who complete their compulsory education in the 2003&#150;04 academic year. In existing pilot areas, EMA will continue to be available to all students age 16&#150;19 (and in a small number of cases, age 20) in post-compulsory further education.

 Currently around 70 per cent. of three year-olds are able to access a free, part-time early education place. The 65 most deprived local education authorities already offer a free place to all three year-olds whose parents want one. The remaining authorities are responsible for devising eligibility criteria for the distribution of free places in their area according to social need.

<P>

<a name="30122w19.html_para1">The Waste and Emissions Trading Bill, currently before Parliament, sets the framework for the introduction of local authority landfill allowances schemes in each of the four territories of the UK to ensure that the BMW targets are met. The Bill permits allocating authorities (in the case of NI, the Department of the Environment) to make regulations setting the level of penalties and supplementary penalties where a local authority has breached its landfill allowance or has failed to maintain prescribed records, make prescribed returns etc. Penalties are automatic, but allocating authorities may extend the time for paying any penalty (including interest) or relieve a local authority, whether or not subject to conditions, from liability to the whole or any part of a penalty (including interest).

<a name="30122w19.html_para2">The Bill also provides for penalties to be imposed on landfill site operators who fail to maintain prescribed records, make prescribed returns etc The penalties are stated on the face of the Bill and include fines and/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.

 The performance of the 15 employment zones is encouraging, and they have already helped over 29,000 long-term unemployed people from deprived areas move into work.
<P>

<a name="30122w20.html_para0">From October 2003 we are extending the employment zone approach to lone parents and New Deal returners in existing zone areas.

: To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on the work of the Jobs Transition Service.  [89050]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30122w20.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 We have introduced the Rapid Response Service, formerly known as the Job Transition Service, to provide support for people affected by redundancies and help them make the transition into sustainable new jobs. The nature of the help provided by the service is tailored to the needs of the individuals, the employer and the local labour market. This can include offering information, advice and guidance to those affected, help with jobsearch, facilitating retraining where necessary or developing customised retraining programmes. People affected by redundancy can also have early access to Jobcentre Plus programmes such as the New Deals and Work Based Learning for Adults.
<P>

<a name="30122w20.html_para2">In Scotland the Rapid Response Service builds on and complements the work already undertaken by the Scottish Executive's Partnership Action for Continued Employment (PACE) initiative. Training provision for individuals involved in a large scale redundancy in Scotland is normally met by PACE partnerships or Training for Work (TfW). However, the Rapid Response Service can provide specific, job-focused training in cases where TfW or PACE partnership support is not appropriate. The Rapid Response Service also provides its full range of non-training services in cases of major redundancies in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="30122w20.html_para3">By December 2002, the Rapid Response Service nationally had provided support to over 200 companies and made its services available to over 67,000 people facing redundancy.

 Information on under spends and their re-allocation is not available for individual New Deal Options, because while records are kept on the annual expenditure on each New Deal for Young People Option, annual budgets are not allocated on that basis. The purpose of the New Deal is to help young people move into work by meeting their individual needs. Therefore, an overall budget is allocated to Jobcentre Plus districts, which is then used as required to meet this objective.
<P>

<a name="30122w20.html_para4">My answer of 19 December to the hon. Member, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1031W, refers to expenditure and under spends across the New Deal for Young People which have been re-allocated to support other welfare to work initiatives. For example, at the time of the 1998 Budget, it was estimated that &pound;2.620 billion Windfall Tax would be spent on the New Deal for Young People by March 2002. Actual expenditure on the programme during this period was &pound;1.190 billion, freeing funds for new initiatives such as Action Teams for Jobs and the permanent establishment of the New Deals.

<i>[holding answers 21 January 2003]:</i> The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recently published guidance on the organisation and delivery of services for people with urological cancers, including prostate cancer. The guidance states that the option of brachytherapy should be discussed with men with early prostate cancer.
<P>

<a name="30122w21.html_para1">However, the NICE guidance also acknowledges that the place of brachytherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer is uncertain and notes the importance of research to evaluate the effectiveness of brachytherapy for prostate cancer. The guidance refers to a randomised intergroup trial comparing brachytherapy with radical surgery that is being organised by the National Cancer Institute of Canada and the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group and strongly encourages United Kingdom participation in this study. As a result, the Department is making &pound;900,000 available through the National Cancer Research Network (NCRN) to enable national health service patients to enter this trial. The National Cancer Research Institute Prostate Cancer Clinical Studies Group and the NCRN are working closely together to take this trial forward in the NHS.

<a name="30122w21.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 January 2003]:</i> The decision on whether or not to commission brachytherapy for local patients is currently a matter for individual primary care trusts (PCTs). Brachytheraphy is a comparatively new therapy, for which there is currently a limited evidence base which many clinicians regard as inconclusive.
<P>

<a name="30122w21.html_para5">Local PCTs recognise the need to consider very carefully whether to provide a treatment for which the National Institute for Clinical Excellence has asserted that more research on effectiveness is needed.
<P>

<a name="30122w21.html_para6">In view of this, and the understandable desire of patients for brachytherapy, concerted work is currently underway through the central south coast cancer network to review this treatment and agree a way forward for local health services. This process of review is currently underway and is expected to conclude before the end of the financial year.

 In February 2002, the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Nursing Officer published a letter Carbon Monoxide: The Forgotten Killer. This letter pulled together the most current information available on carbon monoxide and was forwarded to community nurses, midwives, health visitors and general practitioners. The letter gives instruction on how to diagnose carbon monoxide poisoning as well as how to manage patients who may display symptoms of poisoning.
<P>

<a name="30122w21.html_para10">The Department has also forwarded a videotape, prepared for the Health and Safety Executive, to all GP surgeries. This tape again highlights the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning and gives advice to medical practitioners on how to diagnose possible poisoning cases.
<P>

<a name="30122w21.html_para11">The Department has supported and continues to support voluntary organisations through the Section 64 Grants to Voluntary Organisations Scheme. These organisations provide support and advice for people and their families who have been affected by carbon monoxide poisoning.
<P>

<a name="30122w21.html_para12">Officials in the Department have also published two papers in scientific journals that discuss carbon monoxide poisoning and in particular how exposure to long-term, low concentrations of carbon monoxide can affect health. The Department has also included a research project on carbon monoxide in its most recent programme of research in the air pollution field. The results of this project will be made available to the public on completion.

 The development of practice-based registers of people with coronary heart disease (CHD) is a milestone under the national service framework (NSF) for coronary heart disease.

Progress towards the milestones is being monitored locally by strategic health authorities.

 In the case of residential rehabilitation, places are often purchased at a residential centre that may be outside the drug misuser's area of residence. Some social services agree to fund long distance placements with the agreement of the drug misusers so that he or she can be removed from the area where they are involved in drug using. Purchasing decisions are entirely a matter for agreement between the drug misusers and the local agencies.

 The information requested is not available, as compliance is measured on a trust by trust basis and not at individual ward level.
<P>

<a name="30122w23.html_para9">Hospital wards generally care for both men and women. Guidance issued to the national health service for new mental health accommodation recommends that patient privacy is maintained through providing single bedrooms, preferably with en-suite facilities.
<P>

<a name="30122w23.html_para10">In existing facilities it is the responsibility of each NHS trust to determine the most appropriate configuration to meet their specific requirements. Wards may be split into single sex bays or single rooms, or otherwise configured to provide adequate segregation of gender.

 The General Dental Council (GDC) may only register dentists who have satisfied the GDC that they have the requisite knowledge and skills to practise safely.
<P>

<a name="30122w23.html_para11">Accordingly, section 15 (1) of the Dental Act 1984 empowers the GDC to register as dentists graduates of a university dental school in the United Kingdom or any person who is a national of a member state of the European Economic Area and holds an appropriate European diploma.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if his Department will check that each NHS trust has instituted a Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) before community health councils are abolished; where a suitable PALS has not been implemented in an area, if he will extend the life of the local community health council to maintain cover; and whose responsibility it is to ensure a PALS is instituted before the relevant community health council is abolished.  [91862]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30122w23.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Patient advice and liaison services (PALS) are not linked to the abolition of Community Health Councils (CHCs). CHCs will be replaced by a new system of patient and public involvement, based on local authority scrutiny of health services and the establishment of the Commission of Patient and Public Involvement in Health and Patients' Forums.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30122w24.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The national health service prostate cancer programme stated that an education programme for the public, patients and professionals on the risks associated with individual testing for prostate cancer will be introduced.
<P>

<a name="30122w24.html_para0">This has been achieved through the prostate cancer risk management programme, which sent out evidence-based primary care resource packs to all general practitioners in England from 23 September 2002 to aid them in counselling men who are worried about prostate cancer. This ensures that men make an informed choice about whether or not to have a prostate specific antigen (PSA) test based on an information leaflet developed specifically for men about the advantages and disadvantages of having a PSA test.
<P>

<a name="30122w24.html_para1">The Department is funding a Section 64 grant to the Prostate Cancer Charity to increase further information about prostate cancer. This is supporting the creation, review, provision and dissemination of a range of awareness material, supported by &pound;135,000 over three years.

<a name="30122w25.html_para0">Defra provides grant to local authorities for flood defence and coast protection capital works which satisfy essential criteria. Authorities may claim grant on eligible expenditure during the construction of works. Details are provided in the table for the grant paid to each authority for each of the last five years. For 2002&#150;03 the amount shown is that paid to date. Allocations to all operating authorities for 2003&#150;04 are still being considered.

 National Savings and Investments' Annual Report includes information on &quot;value added". This is a measure of how cost-effective they are at raising finance for government from the retail sector. It is a measure of the difference in the cost of raising funds through NS&I (after taking account of administrative costs and, where appropriate, tax-foregone) and the cost of raising the same amount through similar (ie variable, fixed-rate or index-linked) gilts. By raising cost-effective finance, NS&I help to reduce the overall cost of government borrowing.
<P>

<a name="30122w27.html_para3">The value added figure for 2001&#150;02 was &pound;76.3 million. If administrative costs had been omitted (gross) the figure would have been &pound;232.1 million.

<sup>(26)</sup> The Office for National Statistics' principal activities are the collection, analysis and dissemination of business, economic, socio-economic, health and population statistics, the production of social surveys, the census of population for England and Wales, maintenance of the National Health Service Central Register and the register of births, deaths and marriages.<P>

<P>

<sup>(27)</sup> Figures are in real terms (2002&#150;03 prices). Expenditure is calculated as the total of the resource budget plus the capital budget less depreciation. Figures are actual expenditure to 2001&#150;02 and planned expenditure thereafter.<P>

<P>

<sup>(28)</sup> The Office for National Statistics was created as a Government Department and an Executive Agency on 1 April 1996 by merging the Central Statistical Office (CSO) and the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS). During 1996&#150;97, ONS moved most of its London staff from four existing sites to a complex of building at Drummond Gate Pimlico. Most of the cost of refurbishment and fitting out of those buildings fell in 1996&#150;97.<P>





<sup>(29)</sup> Figures from 1998&#150;99 to 2002&#150;03 include additional provision for planning, fieldwork and initial processing of the 2001 Census of Population in England Wales.<P>

<P>

<sup>(30)</sup> Figures from 2003&#150;04 include additional provision in the Spending Review 2002 settlement for ONS to invest in a programme of modernisation to improve the quality of official statistics.<P>

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if the estimated cost of income tax relief for approved pension schemes as stated in table 7 of the November 2002 'Tax Ready Reckoner and Tax Reliefs' includes tax paid on all pension payments including the state retirement pension; what the tax take was from pension income netted off in the total cost given in the row; and if he will make a statement.

 The estimated net cost of relief for approved pension schemes is the sum of the front-end contributions to these schemes plus the relief on the investment income of funds, net of the tax paid on current private pensions in payment. Since income tax relief is not given on an accruing entitlement to the state retirement pension it would not be appropriate to include current payments from these in the net cost of relief to private schemes.
