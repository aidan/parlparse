 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what representations he has received from drivers and operators of heavy vehicles about the implementation of EU Regulation 3821/85.  [17521]</p>








<p><a name="st_24"><a name="51013w02.html_spnew11"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The Department for Transport and its agencies receive a large number of queries each year about the application of this 1985 European regulation (which requires many heavy vehicles to be fitted with a 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>13 Oct 2005 : Column 562W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
device to record driving hours and specifies how records should be used). These queries are largely of a technical nature.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what steps have been taken to advise heavy vehicle drivers and operators that the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency uses the French text of EU Regulation 3821/85 (as amended), in preference to the English text, when enforcing the requirement for coach and lorry drivers to produce tachograph discs at roadside checks.  [17713]</p>








<p><a name="st_25"><a name="51013w02.html_spnew12"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 Discrepancies between the English and French texts of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3821/85 (as amended) occurred during translation. The resulting English text suggested, incorrectly, that requirements for drivers to be able to produce records were less stringent than had previously been the case. However, the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) and DfT have consistently taken the line that, in fact, there has been no change in this requirement. This interpretation is reflected in DfT/VOSA guidance.

 The Department has a &#163;6.9 million contract with the UK Resource Centre for Women (UKRC), to promote SET (science, engineering, technology) skills for women. The UKRC is affiliated with, and provides guidance to, (Joint Innovation) JIVE Partners, an organisation which has delivered staff training to over 400 careers professionals and is now working with teachers. The importance of involvement with parents is stressed within this training. JIVE&#039;s newly published How To Guide on Careers Advice (SET for Girls) also stresses the involvement of parents in careers events and organised activities.

<a name="stpa_12">DTI is supporting the science, engineering, technology and maths network (SETNET) for the next three years with funding in excess of &#163;10 million. Through its work with schools, SETNET comes into regular contact with parents, for example through family learning days and careers roadshows. SETNET runs the Science Engineering Ambassadors (SEAs) scheme, in which young scientists act as role models for school students.
</p>


<p>

<a name="stpa_14">The computer club for girls initiative (CC4G) is supported by DfES. It is run within schools and aims to transform the attitudes of girls towards technology-related careers.

DTI also sponsors the Royal Academy of Engineering (RAEng) and the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BA). The RAEng is currently extending its extra-curricula support for girls in science and engineering. The HEADSTART scheme creates opportunities for girls to attend summer schools at universities. Making these all-girls events removes a potential barrier to access for some faith groups. Parents are directly involved at the start and finish of this scheme. Another new scheme (the London Engineering Project (LEP)) will take curriculum enrichment into inner-city schools where care will be taken to make all events gender appropriate in terms of choice of engineering theme, approaches and materials. Encouraging active parent participation will be a key element for LEP. The BA CREST Award scheme offers girls (and boys) opportunities to take part directly in scientific research and engineering projects. This scheme includes a range of presentations and events through which parents are encouraged to keep up-to-date with their children&#039;s work.

WISE have produced a booklet entitled &quot;Engineering Equals&quot; which includes advice for parents, and includes action lists, places to visit, and reading material to encourage girls into science, engineering and technology. WISE&#039;s work with girls also brings them into direct contact with parents, e.g. through residential courses where the parents are invited in on the last day to hear what their daughters have learned.

 It will be affordable to set a charge of &#163;30 at current prices for a stand-alone ID card which is valid for 10 years. This will be affordable within current Home Office spending plans.

<a name="51013w04.html_para6">

<a name="stpa_27">We are unable to release the precise costs for individual aspects of the scheme because this information is commercially sensitive and could affect the Department&#039;s ability to secure value for money from the market.

<a name="stpa_28">We are also developing plans to roll the scheme out faster using registration with the criminal records bureau as well as passport application to enrol people into the ID cards scheme.

<a name="stpa_29">We remain confident that further significant savings to Government and the private sector will be identified as plans are developed.

<a name="stpa_30">Our current best estimate of the average unit cost of the combined passport and ID card package is &#163;93; around 70 per cent. of these costs would be incurred anyway because of the worldwide move to biometric passports. We expect that most people will still choose to get their ID card alongside their new biometric passport as this will be the most convenient way to participate in the scheme and will give people the full benefits of having the most secure travel documentation.

 Every child has an entitlement to structured phonics teaching as part of the literacy curriculum. The Primary National Strategy (PNS) promotes an approach to phonics that is fundamentally synthetic, and has provided materials and training to support teachers and early years practitioners in delivering this. Schools are free to select the phonics programme that best suits their needs. However, we expect that the selected programme would at least match the quality, standards and expectations in PNS materials.

<a name="stpa_53">Jim Rose, a former senior Ofsted inspector with significant expertise in primary education, is currently carrying out an independent review of best practice in the teaching of early reading, including the place of phonics. His findings, expected in early 2006, will further inform PNS approaches. The Department has also instigated Early Reading Development Pilots aimed at examining how children&#039;s learning outcomes can be enhanced through a systematic and fast paced approach to the teaching of phonics, and to identify effective models of support to schools and ways of enhancing parental involvement. These pilots begin in 200 schools and early years settings this autumn and use a programme of phonics based on the PNS &quot;Playing with Sounds&quot; materials. Findings will complement Jim Rose&#039;s work, with early findings informing his review, and will feed into a review of the PNS framework for teaching literacy and the Early Development and Learning Framework.

 The Learning and Skills Council in England conducts a National Employers Skills Survey to identify skill shortages and skill gaps to inform their planning and public funding of post 16 education and training.

Each SSC is tasked with producing a wide-ranging Sector Skills Agreement beginning with an assessment of the sector&#039;s long-term, medium and short-term needs and progressing to a final agreement with key partners and agencies signed up to secure the necessary skills supply. Regional Skills Partnerships bring together the planning and funding agencies within a region to address identified priorities. Although separate training arrangements apply in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, all three devolved administrations will work to implement Sector Skills Agreements.

Also included is the funding delegated to primary and secondary schools identified as &quot;notional SEN&quot; and the individual schools budget (ISB) for special schools.<br>

<sup>(8)</sup> The ISB for special schools will include some general education costs for pupils with SEN in addition to those costs specifically for SEN while the figures recorded against &quot;notional SEN&quot; are only indicative of the amount that might be spent by schools on SEN and, from 2004&#150;05 onwards, &quot;notional SEN&quot; delegated to nursery schools was reported on Section 52 for the first time and this accounts for &#163;2.7million and &#163;3.3million of the 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 London totals respectively. In 2005&#150;06, local authorities in London also budgeted &#163;90million for SEN transport expenditure but this is not included in the above table as figures are not available prior to 2005&#150;06.<br>





Notes:<br>

1. Figures are as reported by the LEA in cash terms as at 10 October 2005 and are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds and may not sum due to rounding.<br>

<p><a name="st_77"><a name="51013w11.html_spnew0"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The World Health Organisation (WHO) has advised that there is a continuing and potentially growing threat that a human influenza pandemic could emerge from the avian influenza (bird flu) currently circulating in South East Asia. The WHO has recognised the United Kingdom as one of the countries with the most developed preparedness plans. We published the UK influenza pandemic contingency plan in March 2005. The plan is currently being revised in light of comments received and an updated version will be published soon. The national health service is putting in place plans to cope with a pandemic as part of general emergency preparedness planning. We have published operational guidance to help NHS planners in this task.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51013w11.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_66">When a pandemic starts, antiviral drugs will be the first line medical intervention. We have purchased 14.6 million courses, enough to treat the 25 per cent, of the UK population anticipated to be affected in a pandemic. The first of these deliveries was received in August and the stockpile will be complete by December 2006. Guidelines on local planning for the distribution of these drugs were published in mid-September 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51013w11.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_67">A specific vaccine for pandemic flu will not start to be available until at least four to six months after the strain causing the pandemic has been identified. However, we are working closely with other countries, the WHO, the European Commission and manufacturers to ensure that a vaccine can be developed as quickly as possible once a pandemic flu strain emerges and to put arrangements in place to ensure production of vaccine for the UK population.

 As a member state of the World Health Organisation (WHO), the United Kingdom is a full and active participant in the work taken forward by the WHO on seasonal, pandemic and avian influenza. The UK cooperates not only on a global basis with the central coordination of the WHO, but also on a regional basis through WHO Euro.

<p>

<a name="stpa_68">The UK strongly encourages the development and implementation of national contingency plans in line with advice from the WHO and works closely with them, as well as others such as the European Union (EU), to achieve this. UK preparedness plans have been informed by the material available from the WHO. During our presidency of the EU, the UK will be organising a joint WHO/EU presidency meeting on pandemic influenza preparedness in October.

<p><a name="st_79"><a name="51013w11.html_spnew2"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The United Kingdom supports efforts to increase South East Asia&#039;s avian influenza pandemic preparedness through the coordination of international organisations such as the World Health Organisation (WHO), Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) and the World Animal Health Organisation. These agencies, notably the WHO and FAO, have the lead role in the co-ordinating the international response and developing coherent plans to address the key issues in the region. The Department therefore works closely with the WHO, and through them other countries, to share information and plans for pandemic flu preparedness.

In our White Paper, &quot;Choosing Health&quot;, we set out proposals to bring in new measures to combat underage sales of tobacco products, and increased enforcement of existing regulations.

 The NDPB Accounting Officer Memorandum in Government Accounting Northern Ireland (GANI) makes clear that, where the Board or Chairperson of any non-departmental public body, including an Education and Library Board, is contemplating a course of action which the Chief Executive as the main Accounting Officer considers would infringe the requirements of propriety or regularity, including the requirement to deliver services within the budget allocated by the Department and voted by Parliament, he/she should set out in writing his/her objection to the proposal; the reasons for this objection and his/her duty to notify the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) should his/her advice be overruled. If the Board decides nonetheless to proceed, the Accounting Officer should seek a written instruction from the Board to take the action in question. He/she should also inform the departmental Accounting Officer of the position, if possible, before the Board takes its decision so that the Department can intervene with the Board. If the outcome is that the Chief Executive is overruled, the Board&#039;s instruction should be communicated without undue delay to the Board&#039;s external auditors and C&AG.

 Enzyme deficiency disorders result in a very wide spectrum of clinical consequences depending on the enzyme involved.

There is a well established weekly clinic at the Royal Belfast hospital for sick children which cares for children with a wide variety of inherited metabolic disorders from all over Northern Ireland.
