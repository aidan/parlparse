 Based on data from the World Trade Organisation for 2004, the value of total world trade in both goods and services was $11 trillion. Therefore any group of countries, whether they are the least developed countries or the wider group of developing countries, would capture an extra $110 billion of exports by value if they increased their share of world trade by 1 per cent.

This encouragement includes the use of the Government&#039;s discretion under Article 11 of the waste framework directive to provide exemptions from waste management licensing.

 The increase in the average number of full time equivalents from 2003&#150;04 to 2004&#150;05 was due to a temporary increase in the number of permanent and casual civilian staff and an increase in the number of locally employed civilians in Iraq and Sierra Leone.

Since April 2004, the total number of civilians employed by the Department (including its trading funds) has reduced from 109,050 full time equivalents to 106,270 (1 October 2005).

Since 1997 our work has included conferences and events to disseminate good practice, alongside the development of guidance and resources for schools. The anti-bullying Charter for Action has fostered a wide consensus among schools, the voluntary sector, and professional associations. We have supported an award scheme to share and celebrate the excellent work of schools and children and young people in this area. We have given funding to the voluntary sector to embed effective practice and offer training and support to schools, children and young people and their parents. We have run a number of public information campaigns encouraging children to &#039;tell someone&#039; and to support their friends.

 The target for tackling basic skills in England is to &#039;Improve the basic skills levels of 1.5 million adults by 2007 and 2.25 by 2010&#039; (since the launch of the Skills for Life Strategy in 2001). The 40 per cent. target refers to the Government&#039;s ambitions for &#039;Level 2&#039;: to reduce by at least 40 per cent. the number of adults in the workforce who lack NVQ2 or equivalent qualifications.

<a name="51114w20.html_para0">
In 2001 the Government published the Skills for Life Strategy to tackle basic skills needs across England. Basic skills are a long term priority for this Government and basic literacy and numeracy learning is free to learners with skills below Level 2. Since 2001, we have put in place national standards and core curricula. We are continuing to focus on driving up quality of provision and are professionalising the workforce and extending the reach of the strategy. Since the strategy was launched in 2001, we have helped 1,130,000 adults achieve first qualifications in literacy, language or numeracy. In total, 3.7 million adults have taken up 7.8 million learning opportunities. Tackling basic skills underpins our Skills Strategy, 14&#150;19 reforms, primary and secondary strategies, and our agenda set out in Every Child Matters.

<a name="51114w20.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_182">On 31 January this year, we introduced new &#039;Gateway forms&#039; designed to ensure that any issues of domestic violence can more readily be raised at the very start of Children Act 1989 private law court proceedings. We have also commenced section 120 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002, which clarified the definition of &#039;harm&#039; in the Children Act 1989, which now makes explicit that it includes any impairment suffered as a result of seeing or hearing the ill treatment of another. In addition, section 1 of the Children Act 1989, which applies whenever the court is considering an application for a contact order, requires the court to have the welfare of the child as its paramount consideration. This is reinforced by the welfare checklist at section 1(3) of that Act, which requires the court to have regard to any harm the child has suffered, or is at risk of suffering.

 The National Employer Training programme (NETP) will be funded through the Learning and Skills Council and will be rolled out across the country from 2006&#150;07. The programme will be a powerful, demand-led mechanism for changing the way in which training for adults is delivered. Employers will have greater choice of high quality provision, and colleges and providers will need to deliver high quality training programmes at a time, place and pace determined by the employer. A sum of &#163;230 million has been made available for the programme for 2006&#150;07 and &#163;399 million for 2007&#150;08.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment she has made of the adequacy of the allocation to the Geography Development Fund in improving continuing professional development for non-specialist primary teachers.  [26780]</p>

 The Geography Development Fund was established in 2004, to improve the teaching, learning and status of geography in schools. We judge the allocation to be sufficient to lay the foundations for subject development. The Fund is targeting strategic priorities identified by the subject community. In 2004/05 a significant part of the Fund was devoted to supporting primary teachers. The &#039;Geography from Square One&#039; project provides accessible teaching ideas, particularly for non-specialists and the pilot &#039;Primary Geography Quality Mark&#039; helps schools deliver quality geography and be recognised for doing so. These developments have been well received by teachers and will be built on through further work supported by the Geography Development Fund in 2005/06.

 The Department allocates funds for education and training in the post-16 learning and skills sector to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) to meet agreed national priorities and targets. We do not agree specific regional budgets with the LSC for adult learning. It is for the LSC to determine for itself the most appropriate balance of investment in adult learning provision, within the funds allocated to it and within the overall framework set by Government. The LSC works closely with Regional Skills Partnerships, whose role is to bring together key partners including the regional development agencies, the Skills for Business Network, Jobcentre Plus, local authorities, and the LSC, to ensure that emerging skills needs are identified and addressed.

 We are broadly maintaining the overall public funding that the LSC will be able to allocate to support adult learning on average through to 2007&#150;08. But the pattern of that learning will change. To meet our national priorities, we need to shift the pattern so that we provide a greater number of longer and more expensive courses for adults, to equip them with the range of skills they need for employability and further progression to higher levels of training.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51114w23.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_198">As a consequence, the number of publicly funded places on shorter courses which do not lead to national qualifications is likely to fall by around 500,000. But set against this, there will be some 400,000 places available through the National Employer Training Programme and over 260,000 places for adults taking full Level 2 programmes in mainstream further education&#151;which is a total increase of 274,000 full Level 2 places compared with 2005&#150;06. So while maintaining the overall volume of adult training, we estimate there will be a net reduction in publicly-funded places of around 230,000 (about 6 per cent.). That will result in a total of some 3.5 million places available for adults by 2007&#150;08. We expect that this reduction can be offset by colleges and other providers offering a wider range of programmes at full cost. In addition, public funding will support an expected additional 46,000 16 to 19-year-olds in learning in FE colleges and schools by 2007/08 compared with 2005/06, and maintain the numbers on apprenticeships while increasing the numbers successfully completing the full apprenticeship framework.

 Research shows that there are significant benefits for young people participating in study support (out of school hours learning) activities. In June 2001, my Department published &quot;The Impact of Study Support&quot;, which set out the findings of a three-year longitudinal study of around 8,000 pupils in 52 secondary schools. The research found that pupils participating in study support do better than their peers who do not in three key areas&#151;attainment, attitudes to school and attendance at school. The study also indicated that minority ethnic pupils and pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds gain most benefit, and that participation increases the likelihood of subsequent participation.

<p><a name="st_240"><a name="51114w25.html_spnew9"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 There are a range of factors, in both the home and school, which are shown to influence a positive learning environment. Many of these factors are shown to particularly focus on supporting low achieving children, who disproportionately tend to be from lower socio-economic backgrounds.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51114w25.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_214">Research shows that the quality of the home environment in the pre-school years has the strongest impact on child development at start of school and beyond, and is therefore the most important influence on child development in the pre-school period. The Department&#039;s effective provision of pre-school education (EPPE) study has shown that, for all children, the type and range of learning activities that parents undertake with their pre-school children (for example, reading, singing nursery rhymes and playing with numbers) are more important for intellectual and social development than parental occupation, education or income.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51114w25.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_215">Research also highlights that school related factors such as, personalisation of learning, mentoring and tailoring the curriculum for pupils who are gifted and talented all contribute to a positive learning environment. Early findings from the excellence in cities programme and pupil learning credits pilot suggest an impact on attitudes, attendance and key stage 3 mathematics results.

 The Department has made no formal assessment of the impact of low level classroom disruption on under-achievement However, research evidence indicates that there is a complex relationship between behaviour, attainment and social class. Research shows that being in a school where there are high levels of disruption can impact negatively on pupils&#039; learning and there is some evidence that it may have more of an impact on pupils from low socio-economic groups. In addition the Department&#039;s data shows that schools with higher levels of permanent exclusions tend to have lower levels of attainment as do young people who have been excluded.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51114w25.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_217">Evidence also suggests that there is a link between social class and behaviour both at an individual and a school level.

 We know that the way schools currently involve parents is varied. For example, we know that in primary schools there is a much more inclusive approach to parents, resulting in parents of primary school children feeling more confident about engaging with their child&#039;s school. However, we know this is not always the case with secondary schools, where establishing such a relationship is more difficult. Further, we know that some parents, due to the complexities of their own lives or their own educational history, are more reluctant to engage with their children&#039;s school.

<a name="stpa_222">We want to help parents and schools to work well together and raise children&#039;s achievement. We know that the key to improving parental involvement in children&#039;s education is changing attitudes and moving towards a situation where parents are accepted as co-educators and partners in their children&#039;s learning, not only in schools but also in local authorities. It is crucial we ensure that the importance of parental involvement is embedded throughout the education chain to establish a culture of parental involvement and encourage a positive, two-way partnership.

<a name="stpa_223">To enable this, we are actively encouraging parents to become more closely involved in their children&#039;s education and learning at home and at school. Since 1997, we have sought to enhance parental involvement through a range of measures.

 Diagnostic testing for HIV, and any associated counselling is free to all.

This has always been the case since the NHS (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations were introduced in 1989.

<p><a name="st_83"><a name="51114w35.html_spnew1"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 Given that there is no physical security to prevent prisoners leaving Springhill, prisoners abscond rather than escape from the open estate. In the last three years the trend for absconds from Springhill has reduced significantly. During 2003&#150;04, 64 prisoners absconded, during 2004&#150;05 42 prisoners absconded and so far this year 28 prisoners have absconded.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51114w35.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_45">During the last two years, management at Springhill has taken a number of measures to seek to reduce absconds. For instance, all prisoners are seen on induction by a governor who warns them about the implications of absconding. In addition, a protocol has been introduced with Thames Valley Police to prosecute through the courts all prisoners who abscond. Moreover, significant improvements have been made to the regime with the opening of a job club and two vocational learning centres offering industrial based qualifications in computing and bricklaying. Vocational qualifications have been introduced in catering and horticulture.

 There are approximately 5,000 prisoners held in open conditions or resettlement prisons where a significant number of prisoners spend time outside the prison.

Their findings were published in the report &quot;The Decision to Imprison, Sentencing and the Prison Population&quot; in 2003 by the Prison Reform Trust. It also supports a three year longitudinal study being undertaken by RDS section of the Home Office, using court records to explore the factors influencing sentencing decisions within both adult and youth courts.

 Clause 23 of the Electoral Administration Bill states that it would be a matter for the returning officer, having regard to any guidance issued by the Electoral Commission, to decide whether a description proposed by an independent candidate would be permissible. However, it should be noted that clause 23 specifies that the description must not be the same as the name or description of a registered political party, nor be so similar as to confuse with or lead an elector to associate the candidate with a registered political party. The intention therefore is that names such as those suggested would not be permissible.

Consequently we plan to widen the Belfast-bound carriageway of the M2 motorway to create an additional southbound lane between the Sandyknowes and Greencastle junctions.

 Following a review of public procurement, the new procurement policy was announced in the Northern Ireland Assembly in May 2002. The overall aim of the policy is to achieve &quot;best value for money&quot; in the procurement of goods, works and services over the lifetime of a contract. Best value for money does not mean the lowest initial cost. It means securing a procurement that meets the user&#039;s needs and achieves a balance between quality and cost throughout the life of the asset. Within this definition the policy allows for the consideration of wider policy objectives into procurement, that meet the tests of need, affordability and cost-effectiveness and comply with the UK&#039;s EC and international obligations.
