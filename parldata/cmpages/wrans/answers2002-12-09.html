To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners if he will make a statement on the number of church employees who are covered by employment legislation.  [85197]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bell: </B> 
 The National Church Institutions employ 487 people. No records are held centrally about the numbers of people employed by dioceses and parishes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w01.html_wqn1"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, what assessment the Commissioners have made of the cost of the new licensing provisions to churches and chapels; and if he will make a statement.  [84507]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bell: </B> 
 Final figures for complying with the proposed provisions of the current Licensing Bill, which has had a second reading in Another Place, will depend upon the level of fees set by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, as well as on the extent to which church buildings apply for licenses to cover the proposed provision of Xregulated entertainment". The figures provided in the Regulatory Impact Assessment would, however, suggest that under the Bill's proposals churches or other places of worship seeking to provide entertainment five times a year would pay #100 each year. If more events than this were required, a full licence would be needed and annual inspections would be necessary, each of which would attract a fee.
<P>

<a name="21209w01.html_para0">There are 16,250 church buildings belonging to the Church of England alone: many other denominations and faiths will also be covered by the proposals as they stand.

: To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement of the developing role of DARA in Wales.  [83974]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Defence Aviation Repair Agency is creating centres of excellence as the focus for its business development. In Wales, there are two centres of excellence, St Athan in South Wales which carries out fixed wing aircraft maintenance, and Sealand in North Wales that now does all the Agency's electronic business. The two sites represent nearly 70 per cent. of the DARA's business.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 A number of Challenger 2 tanks are being modified to improve their performance in desert conditions in line with continuing contingency planning. I do not intend to compromise operational security by revealing the exact number of tanks involved.

<P>
21. <a name="21209w01.html_wqn4"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of Defence if he will make a statement on recent activities of the Royal Navy in the Gulf.  [83976]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Royal Navy maintains a permanent presence in the Gulf. For over 10 years it has made a valuable contribution to the Multinational Interception Force deployed in the Gulf to enforce Iraqi compliance with UN sanctions. The Royal Navy deployed in the Gulf also plays its part in the international campaign against terrorism. Beyond these ongoing commitments, a Mine Countermeasure Group deployed to the Gulf during November. This is a long-planned, routine deployment, to conduct bilateral exercises with a number of Gulf States, building on the successful bilateral training conducted in the region in the wake of last year's Saif Sareea II in Oman.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, what British military units are deployed in the Gulf region.  [83968]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Units from the UK armed forces are regularly deployed in the Gulf region.
<P>

<a name="21209w01.html_para1">For example, the RAF continues to patrol the no-fly zones over Iraq in support of UN SCR 688 which demanded that Saddam Hussein cease repression of his own people. The Royal Navy maintains a permanent presence in the Gulf to enforce sanctions on Iraq and as part of our contribution to the campaign against international terrorism. Two RAF Nimrod aircraft are also deployed to the Gulf region for the same purpose.
<P>

<a name="21209w01.html_para2">In addition to those continuing commitments, we have deployed 400 personnel to take part in a long planned United States-led biennial command post exercise in Qatar. A Mine Countermeasure Group is also currently undertaking a routine deployment to the Gulf in order to conduct bilateral exercises with a number of Gulf States.
<P>

<a name="21209w01.html_para3">A wide range of personnel are deployed throughout the region, from all three services, in support of defence diplomacy.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what potential security threat remnants of al-Qaeda pose to the security of <i>(a)</i> Afghanistan and <i>(b)</i> other countries.  [83977]



<P>
<P><I>9 Dec 2002 : Column 3W</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The al-Qaeda network in Afghanistan has been severely weakened by coalition military action. Isolated remnants of al-Qaeda and Taleban forces continue to pose a limited threat to the security of Afghanistan, and coalition operations to defeat them continue.
<P>

<a name="21209w01.html_para4">More widely, al-Qaeda has a global reach. Despite important arrests in the past month, many of the organisation's leaders are still at large, and pose a significant threat to international security. That is why we, together with our coalition partners, shall continue to hunt down the al-Qaeda leadership until they are brought to account for their crimes.

<P>
23. <a name="21209w01.html_wqn7"><B> Simon Hughes: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what steps he is taking to reduce the number of non-combatant deaths of armed forces personnel. [83978]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w01.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 In the last five years there have been 770 deaths in the Services: 246 from natural causes, 255 from road traffic accidents, 93 from suicide or with an open coroner's verdict and 176 from other causes. The Services recognise and stress the importance of welfare support, health education and good safety practices, especially since the nature of work in the Armed Forces inevitably involves an element of risk. Procedures are reviewed regularly.

: To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the enlargement of NATO following the Prague summit.  [83979]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 At the Prague summit NATO issued invitations to begin accession talks to Bulgaria. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. This enlargement is a major step forward for European security. I know the invitees have made great efforts over the past three years to prepare themselves under the Membership Action Plan, and they must continue to do so during the accession process. I am pleased that the United Kingdom will continue its significant contribution to helping with those preparations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Coalition operations against the remnants of al-Qaeda continue. The United Kingdom provides Airborne Early Warning and Air-to-Air Refuelling aircraft for coalition air operations, as well as support to the coalition headquarters.
<P>

<a name="21209w01.html_para5">We currently contribute some 300 British troops to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Kabul. ISAF has helped the Afghan authorities to restore and maintain stability within Kabul and there is a continuing need for its presence to support President Karzai's transitional Administration.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 We intend to maintain a modern and capable force in the Falkland Islands, consisting of air and land as well as naval elements. The Atlantic Patrol Task (South) is generally deployed to the South Atlantic on a year-round basis, subject to operational availability; it is currently not deployed as the crew of HMS Lancaster are engaged in fire-fighting duties. The Governor of the Falkland Islands was informed in advance of this unavoidable temporary gap in cover. APT(S) is only one element of the United Kingdom's maritime presence in the region. HMS Leeds Castle, the permanent Falkland Islands patrol vessel, is currently in Falkland Islands waters, and the ice patrol ship HMS Endurance is currently deployed to the South Atlantic region, which includes time spent in Falkland Islands waters. RFA Grey Rover, the South Atlantic tanker, is on passage to the Falkland Islands following her participation in EXPO NAVALE, Valpariso.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what steps he has taken to help those made redundant by QinetiQ restructuring to acquire new jobs.  [83984]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w02.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 QinetiQ has been a commercial organisation since its creation in July 2001, at which point its employees ceased to be civil servants. Redundancies which result from restmcturing within the company are based purely on its business requirements and the Ministry of Defence does not have direct involvement in QinetiQ5 s decisions concerning its staff. I understand that QinetiQ has a range of

<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w02.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 We do not believe that the Army is overstretched. However, they are currently very busy in light of firelighters' industrial action. The Ministry of Defence keeps all operational commitments under review and reduces the numbers deployed where possible.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The proposed NATO Response Force (NRF) was discussed by Defence Ministers at their informal meeting in Warsaw in late September and again at the NATO Summit in Prague last month. I have also discussed the NRF in bilateral meetings with NATO counterparts. The discussions focused on the need for a technologically advanced, flexible, deployable, interoperable and sustainable force, ready to move quickly to wherever needed. The NRF should also be a catalyst for improving the Alliance's military capabilities. At Prague, Heads of State and Government agreed to the creation of the NRF and work is now underway to take the concept forward within the Alliance. We expect that a report on the NRF will be submitted to Defence Ministers in June 2003 and that the NRF to have an initial operating capability no later than October 2004.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Government understands the role that missile defences could play as part of a comprehensive strategy to respond to the potential threat from ballistic missiles. We are currently examining whether the range of responses we have now would be enhanced by participation in active missile defence. I have today placed further analytical and discussion material in the Library of the House which I hope will contribute to the debate on the issues involved.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w02.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 In accordance with United Kingdom Health and Safety legislation, it is Ministry of Defence policy that the risks associated with any equipment shall be as low as reasonably practicable.
<P>

<a name="21209w02.html_para0">Responsibility for the acquisition of new equipment is vested in the Defence Procurement Agency (DPA). Safety Management is an integral part of the DPA's Acquisition Management System, beginning at the requirement definition stage and being carried forward through service to disposal.
<P>

<a name="21209w02.html_para1">The basic principle that underpins the equipment safety process is the management of through-life hazards: their identification, evaluation, elimination, mitigation and control.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w02.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Although no specific measures have been taken since 1990 to enable Army officers to discuss bullying with their counterparts in other countries, welfare issues are often discussed in a number of fora which may include, on occasion, members of the armed forces from other countries.

A small building to accommodate the control console has been positioned at the rear of the range. Work was completed in October 2002 and the range was formally brought into use on 30 November 2002. There are currently no plans to upgrade the remaining 23 lanes.

 There have been three recorded complaints of alleged bullying/harassment within the Army Welfare Service in the last five years. Due to the small numbers involved, I am not prepared to disclose the locations of these incidents in the event that this leads to the identification of those concerned.

<a name="21209w03.html_para8">For the individual service person, the effects of the firefighters' dispute on training and deployment are interlinked. Some training is being disrupted with consequential effects on drafting, career progression and promotion. The Royal Navy is making appropriately trained personnel to the fleet. The effect on individuals will be minimised by giving them priority on future courses; and there are existing safeguards for those whose career progression may be adversely affected.

 The United Kingdom already has close access to US research and development work on missile defence, taking part in collaborative research and information exchange on ballistic missile defence technologies. UK industry is also playing an active role. UK expertise in such areas will enable us to consider and make informed assessments about technical advances in missile defences. This will contribute significantly to our ability to judge the potential benefits to the UK of possible participation in further US development of missile defences.

The radar at RAF Fylingdales could, if upgraded, provide a useful asset to such a system depending on the architecture chosen. No improvements have been made relating to any potential future role, although there is a continuing programme of maintenance and life extension at RAF Fylingdales to ensure that it can continue to fulfil its current functions.
<P>

<a name="21209w04.html_para3">A decision was taken in 1997 to base the European relay ground station for the Space Based Infra-Red System (SBIRS) project at RAF Menwith Hill. SBIRS is a satellite system designed to give early warning of the launch of ballistic missiles anywhere in the world. It updates the existing but ageing defence support programme (DSP) satellites and is needed irrespective of any decision on missile defence.

 Direct contributions to NATO's Security Investment Programme (NSEP) and Military Budget (MB) are paid from the United Kingdom Defence Budget. Currently, the UK's share of the NSIP is 10.2 per cent. and of the MB is 16.0 per cent. From January 2003, this will be amended to 12.5 per cent. for both, with no overall increase in cost to UK.

 The regular United Kingdom armed Forces maintain a balanced nuclear, biological and chemical force protection capability founded upon five components: detection and identification; warning and reporting; physical protection; hazard management; medical countermeasures and support. These rest on a range of specialised and other equipment, procedures and countermeasures, including those operated by the Joint NEC Regiment, are described in more detail in the Department's July 1999 public paper XDefending Against the Threat from Biological and Chemical Weapons".

<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w06.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Letwin: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department under what circumstances it is possible for a person earning #90,000 per year to obtain legal aid.  [82570]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w06.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Such a decision would be very rare. Under the Access to Justice Act 1999, public funding (formerly called legal aid) is provided under the Community Legal Service (CLS) and the Criminal Defence Service (CDS). CLS funding, which covers civil proceedings, is only available for cases within the scope of the scheme subject to a statutory means test and funding assessment. Under the present system a person with an income of #90,000 per year would rarely qualify for civil public funding. It could be possible in cases involving public family law, such as care and supervision orders, child assessment orders, emergency child protection orders; and Mental Health Review Tribunals.
<P>

<a name="21209w06.html_para1">Any individual charged with an offence and appearing before the courts can receive publicly funded representation without reference to their means where it is in the interests of justice for help to be granted. When the CDS was introduced in April 2001, the means test for criminal legal aid was abolished. It was replaced with a power for judges in the Crown Court to order a convicted defendant to pay some, or all, of the costs incurred in defending him, by way of a Recovery of Defence Costs Order.
<P>

<a name="21209w06.html_para2">Thus a person with a high income might receive public assistance, but can be required to repay that support. Typically a court will exercise that power if the defendant is found guilty. A defendant found not guilty will almost certainly not have to repay legal aid costs. But this represents no effective change on the position before April 2001. It has always been, and remains, the case that a defendant found not guilty, who pays for his own defence, will almost certainly have the costs of his defence repaid by Government to the extent that such costs accord with legal aid rates.

 On 2 December I met a group of Iraqi women who had suffered human rights violations by Saddam Hussein's regime. All the women had had direct experience of Saddam Hussein's brutality.
<P>

<a name="21209w06.html_para4">Some of the women present gave a press briefing on 21 November which highlighted the brutality of the Iraqi regime and drew attention to the plight of Iraqi women who have witnessed killings and other atrocities under Saddam's dictatorship. They also gave details on the circumstances under which they left Iraq. These were Safia Al Souhail, Fatima Bahr Al Ulum, Ala Talabani, Berivan Doski and Melina Bakoos. Because of the risk of reprisals against their families and friends in Iraq, it would be wrong to name those women who have not made their names public.

 The provisional map of access land for the lower north-west was issued on 18 November. There is now a three-month period when anyone with a legal interest in the land may lodge an appeal with the Planning Inspectorate against the inclusion of their land as access land on the provisional map. We expect a conclusive map to be issued at the end of 2003, but this depends on the number of appeals. On current plans, I intend to open the new statutory right of access in the lower north-west and upper north-west together during the autumn of 2004. This will be followed by the north-east and the south-west in the first six months of 2005, with all access land opened by the end of 2005.

<P>
<a name="21209w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The principle of a junction between the A12 and the Colchester Northern Approach Road has been agreed for some time, but the Highways Agency is not yet able to fully assess the impact of the proposed new junction on the safety and operation of the A12. Despite several meetings and requests, a number of issues remain outstanding with the developer. No decision can be made until the Highways Agency is in possession of all necessary information to determine the application.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment has been made by his Department of the success of the International Maritime Organisation's Quality Shipping Campaign.  [86104]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has a key role in the international Quality Shipping Campaign, which is designed to rid the seas of substandard shipping. Progress is being made, not least in terms of the growing acceptance that there is a real need for more effective and consistent implementation of convention requirements by owners and flag States, reinforced through targeted Port State Control. But there is still a long way to go before we achieve the Campaign's objectives.
<P>

<a name="21209w09.html_para10">One tangible initiative to arise from the Campaign has been the setting up of the EQUASIS database. This provides the industry with freely accessible safety-related information on the quality of the world's merchant fleet, answering calls for greater transparency. Charterers can no longer justifiably claim ignorance as an excuse for engaging in business with substandard ships.

 We believe that it is vital to reduce the unnecessary disruption which works on roads cause to road users, and are taking a range of measures to achieve this. The use of trenchless techniques can help reduce this disruption, although there will be many occasions when&#151;for technical reasons&#151;these will not be suitable. My Department has recently set up a working party, involving representatives of local authorities and utility companies, to look at ways in which greater use can be made of trenchless techniques when works are carried out in the street.

 As part of the TAN21 Programme an Invitation to Tender (ITT) was issued through the European Journal (OJEC Ref: S251 (1999/S251&#150; 207302)) for the procurement of TAN's core operational systems. The specification attached to the ITT was based on the requirement to develop the core business applications of licensing, enforcement and bus route registration which would be integrated with support and management systems. This requirement was incorporated as Schedules to the final contract and has not changed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what changes have been made to the rules on the <i>(a)</i> environmental, <i>(b)</i> safety and <i>(c)</i> security standards of cars and light vehicles imported from outside the EU since 1 January 2000; what assessment of the effect of the changes has been made; and what further changes are planned.  [86114]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w11.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Most of the vehicles that are not the subject of a European or National type approval are subject to The Motor Vehicles (Approval) Regulations 2001. Those regulations came into force on 1 February that year and replaced the Motor Vehicles (Approval) Regulations 1996 as amended. The regulations prescribe the technical standards the vehicle must meet before it can be licensed and registered for use on public roads. Compliance is determined by individual inspection of the vehicle. The main change was to replace the earlier single-tier set of technical standards with a two-tier system. The first tier&#151;standard Single Vehicle Approval&#151;set technical standards appropriate for vehicles entering service in very low numbers, such as amateur builds. The second tier&#151;Enhanced Single Vehicle Approval (ESVA)&#151;applied higher standards for vehicles being sold or entering service in competition with the mainstream supply of mass-produced cars and light goods vehicles in Britain. ESVA is much closer to the European or British type-approval standards for key safety, environmental and anti-theft items required of the mainstream manufacturers. It thus ensures a consistent level of consumer protection relative to the numbers of vehicles involved.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how many hours of additional training are required to enable PSNI personnel to discharge a Baton Gun to be fired in situations other than public disorder; what the minimum distance is at which a baton round may be discharged at a human target; what level of authorisation is required for this use of the baton gun; and what the reporting requirements are.  [80634]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w12.html_spnew1"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The Chief Constable has advised me that in situations where it may be necessary to deploy personnel with baton guns other than public disorder, the preferred option of the PSNI is to deploy Tactical Firearms Teams. Officers within such teams who are trained in the use of the baton gun will, in addition to the initial three-day classification course in respect of the weapon, receive an additional 16 hours of training in the tactical use of the baton gun.
<P>

<a name="21209w12.html_para0">With regard to the minimum distance in relation to baton round discharge I would refer my hon. Friend to the written reply of the Minister for Policing, Crime Reduction and Community Safety on 6 November 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 312W.
<P>

<a name="21209w12.html_para1">In situations other than public order situations authorisation to deploy Tactical Firearms Teams to carry baton guns lies with an officer of the rank of Assistant Chief Constable. Authority to deploy the baton gun lies with the senior officer in charge of the non-public order incident. The actual firing of the weapon (if such is felt justified) is self-authorised by the individual officer provided that the officer is satisfied that to do so is both lawful and proportionate in the circumstances.
<P>

<a name="21209w12.html_para2">The firing of a baton gun whether in non-public order or in public order circumstances is classified as the discharge of a firearm. All discharges of firearms by the PSNI are subject to immediate report to the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland for investigation. In addition, when a baton round is discharged a report is sent to the Policing Board for information.

<P>

<a name="21209w12.html_para3">I understand that the police ombudsman for Northern Ireland does make inquiries of local hospitals after the discharge of rounds by the PSNI. The purpose of such inquiries is to establish whether anyone has suffered injury which may be attributable to a baton round and also to facilitate any necessary evidence gathering. The research report that the ombudsman published in May 2002 summarised the findings of seven reports : 86 per cent. of the 28 rounds that struck persons were observed to have struck the person's legs. While patient confidentiality is an important factor, the ombudsman is looking at ways that might facilitate inquiries.

 On 20 October 2002, the Ministry of Health, Democratic Republic of the Congo reported 394 cases of cholera including 41 deaths in Kasai Oriental. Cholera is reported in Congo most years. This year DRC reports the third highest number of cases, and the highest death rate from the disease. The surveillance committee (Ministry of Health, WHO, UNICEF and Health Net International) which was established to control the outbreak has set up five cholera centres and is reinforcing surveillance and community health activities.
<P>

<a name="21209w16.html_para2">Unfortunately it is not only cholera that is a problem in DRC. Almost all indicators demonstrate evidence of an appalling health situation. DFID does not directly support any cholera interventions. However a significant part of our humanitarian programme is aimed at improving general health. Specific projects deliver improved water and sanitation to poor urban communities. Other support provided through the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross is not earmarked and can also be used for such work.

 On 26 November the Minister of Health of the Government of Democratic Republic of Congo reported that eight people had died from a haemorrhagic disease at three widely spread locations in Oriental Province, in the north east of the country. The outbreak has not yet been reported by the Communicable Disease Surveillance and Response Unit of the World Health Organisation.

<a name="21209w16.html_para3">This area is blighted by continuing fighting between groups that have not signed the peace agreement that continues to hold between the main warring parties.

 Ethiopia qualified for interim debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC) at Decision Point (DP) in November 2001. Irrevocable relief will be provided at HIPC Completion Point, which is expected within the next two years. Savings resulting from HIPC assistance will amount to around US$ 96 million per year on average until 2021. These resources will be freed up for the Ethiopian Government to use for poverty reduction. Poverty-targeted public expenditure increased by over 1 per cent. of GDP in the current year as a result of HIPC relief.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps she has taken to encourage trade between Commonwealth countries.  [85811]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w18.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government have acted on specific commitments in the Edinburgh Commonwealth Economic Declaration of 1997 by vigorously supporting: the EU's stance on multilateral liberalisation, notably through the launch of the WTO Round at Doha; the full opening of the EU's market to the least developed countries, 14 of whom are in the Commonwealth; the launch and work programme of the Commonwealth Business Council, whose task is to promote Commonwealth trade and investment. DTI Ministers have also encouraged effective Commonwealth networking on trade through informal discussions with their counterparts and in an ongoing series of seminars with High Commissions in London. Trade Partners UK is responsible for helping UK companies export and invest overseas, including to our Commonwealth partners.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what action she has taken to encourage a healthy and efficient construction and building industry in the last 12 months.  [85825]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w18.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 I attach considerable importance to the health and efficiency of the UK construction industry. Construction represents 8 per cent. of GDP and employs almost two million people. Construction is central to the delivery and maintenance of the national infrastructure and therefore to all our public service, including health care, transportation, housing and education. The Government's Rethinking Construction initiative aims to work with the industry improve its productivity and competitiveness by addressing issues such as the efficiency of processes and the quality of the end product.

[82191]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w18.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 <i>(a)</i> Information on the Department's grant-making schemes together with funding for 2001&#150;02 is available in Annex Bl and in the text of my 2002 Expenditure Plans Report (Cm 5416), a copy of which is in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="21209w18.html_para1"><i>(b)</i> Information on numbers of awards is not held centrally by the Department and to provide it would entail disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="21209w18.html_para2"><i>(c)</i> It is not possible to provide an accurate estimate of related administrative costs as a large number of different units within the Department are involved with a wide range of staff making a contribution.

 <i>[holding answer 28 November 2002]:</i> We have no current plans to hold a manufacturing summit in the UK or elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="21209w18.html_para3">We meet industrial partners frequently to share views on the key manufacturing issues, and to focus on the practical steps of taking forward the Government's Manufacturing Strategy. For example, my colleague the Minister for Small Business met Chairs of the Regional Development Agencies, together with Digby Jones of the CBI, Brendan Barber of the TUC, and Martin Temple of the EEF on 3 December to discuss the publication of the Regional Development Agencies' reports on manufacturing which set out specific achievements to date and key strategic initiatives for the delivery of the Manufacturing Strategy at the regional level.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent questions on weekly earnings for workers in Great Britain, Scotland and the unitary authorities in Scotland. (86276, 86277)</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I attach tables showing average weekly earnings, both including and excluding overtime, (Table 1) and the proportion of people earning below the different thresholds you listed, both including overtime (Table 2) and excluding overtime (Table 3).</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The New Earnings Survey (NES) can provide earnings data for small geographical areas. The release of NES data is restricted to figures that are derived from a sufficiently large sample of employees, and have an acceptable level of accuracy and I have provided the available data for Scotland, the unitary authorities in Scotland and Great Britain only for those areas where the samples are large enough. These are based on the 2002 NES, the latest survey for which data are available.</FONT></UL>

But whether the current cycle started in 1997 or 1999 does not affect the judgement that the Government remains firmly on track to meet the fiscal rules over the cycle: the average current surplus since both 1997&#150;98 and 1999&#150;2000 is positive in every year of the projection period."

 The Government established the Financial Services Compensation Scheme as part of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The Scheme became operational on 1 December 2001 and acts as an industry financed 'safety net' for customers of finance sector companies which become insolvent. The Scheme would first seek to take measures to safeguard policyholders, for example by trying to ensure that policies are transferred to another company. If this is not possible, compensation may be payable subject to the rules of the Scheme.

The Government looks forward to receiving Lord Penrose's report as soon as he is able to complete it. In addition, the Government published a report by the Financial Services Authority in October 2001 which reviewed the regulation of Equitable Life from 1 January 1999 to 8 December 2000 and which has been submitted as evidence to the inquiry conducted by Lord Penrose.

For this reason, an adjustment has been made equivalent to the average annual overestimation of net migration since 1991. This is approximately 76,000 each year.

 The National Literacy Strategy (NLS) is raising literacy standards in primary schools. In this year's national tests, 84 per cent. of 7-year-olds achieved the level expected for their age&#151;level 2 or above&#151;in reading compared to 80 per cent. in 1998; and 69 per cent. achieved at the upper end of level 2&#151;level 2B or above&#151;compared to 62 per cent. in 1998.

<a name="21209w26.html_para0">We remain committed to making further improvements in standards. We have introduced a new intervention programme, Early Literacy Support, to help those children in Year 1 who are already struggling with literacy or at risk of developing literacy difficulties later on. We will also continue to review and refine the literacy strategy in response to the latest research and evidence from our most successful schools.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w26.html_spnew1"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 We have greatly increased the financial support available to mature students. Nearly a quarter of a billion pounds is now spent on support for students with particular financial needs, including mature students, compared to #124 million five years ago. In the academic year 2002&#150;03, in addition to means tested student loans (up to #4,815 in London, #3,905 elsewhere), and tuition fee grants (up to #1,100), full-time mature students can apply for dependants grants (up to #2,225 for an adult or otherwise for an eldest child, more for additional children), an additional dependants grant (#255), child care grant (up to #8,480 for two or more children), school meals grant (up to #275 per child) and travel, books and equipment grant (#510). They can also apply for discretionary support through their HE institution, in the form of #500 access bursaries, hardship funds and hardship loans. A single parent with two children in receipt of the full student loan and maximum child care grant could receive about #15,800 each year, plus discretionary support.
<P>

<a name="21209w26.html_para1">Part-time HE students studying on at least 50 per cent. (or more) of a full-time equivalent course are eligible for means tested fee waivers, student loans of #500 and discretionary help from the hardship funds. There are also generous non means-tested allowances for both full-time and part-time disabled students.
<P>

<a name="21209w26.html_para2">These arrangements are generous but overly complicated. From 2003&#150;04 they will be simplified. A new grant (the Parents Learning Allowance worth up to #1,300) will replace the access bursary, the additional dependants grant and the travel, books and equipment grant and child dependants grant and school meals grant will be replaced by child tax credits and passported free school meals from the Inland Revenue. From 2004&#150;05, hardship funds and loans will be replaced by grants from a new Access to Learning Fund. These streamlined arrangements will in some cases provide students with more help than they currently receive.

 <i>[holding answer 21 November 2002]:</i> The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) is responsible for determining the allocation of grants to higher education institutions. In general, the HEFCE fund similar courses at similar rates irrespective of which higher education institution is providing the course. However, in the case of specialist institutions, additional funding is provided to reflect the nature of the institution and the characteristics of the courses provided. Guidance on the general funding methodology for specialist institutions was published in HEFCE circular 98/10 following advice from the Specialist Institutions Advisory Panel. Criteria for the funding of specialist performing arts institutions were published in HEFCE circular 99/41 and were based on detailed analysis of the costs and characteristics of the provision. The council does not distinguish between the different art forms in its funding methodology, and the amount of additional funding for these institutions varies according to how closely they meet the criteria set out in the guidance. HEFCE have also made public criteria for the funding of very high cost institutions specialising in music, dance and drama. The supplementary funding for specialist institutions is kept under review to ensure that the levels remain appropriate.

For school closures, the factors include the effect on standards of educational provision, the need to preserve access to a local school for rural communities and access to community facilities, particularly in areas of social deprivation. The Department has not commissioned any research into the impact of school closures. However, where a failing school is closed, it is usual for the former pupils to show greatly increased attainment or better rates of progress at their new schools.

 Information in the following table has been taken from the annual activity survey of all school leavers in the autumn of the year they complete compulsory education undertaken by Careers Services and Connexions Partnerships. This data relates to all school leavers from the 2000&#150;2001 academic year. It has not been possible to match the data exactly to the coalfield areas; data is collected by Education Authority and has been aggregated to provide the closest match possible. Details of areas included are given in the footnote to the table.
<P>

<a name="21209w27.html_para0">The table shows that in the coalfield areas, young people are less likely to be settled in full time education, or training and rely more heavily on government supported training than in non- coalfield areas. The table also shows a higher rate of unemployment for young people living in these areas.

 I welcome the European Commission's proposal to establish XErasmus World", which should provide UK universities and colleges with opportunities to attract overseas students, and will enable UK universities to forge useful partnerships with their counterparts in other EU countries. The UK and other member states have expressed some reservations about the funding of the proposal. The Danish Presidency of the European Union has recently circulated a revised version of the proposal. We are considering our position in the light of this.

<P>
<a name="21209w27.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Hodge </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 November 2002]:</i> We have regular discussions with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) about specific student support and benefits issues. Social security is available to certain students in DWP vulnerable groups such as the disabled and lone parents but the general principle is that support for higher education students comes from the education system. There are no plans to change this.
<P>

<a name="21209w27.html_para2">Student support is taken into account in deciding upon the level of benefit payable, but much of the additional financial support for such vulnerable students, for example child care grant, is disregarded for benefit purposes.

<P>
<a name="21209w27.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Miliband </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 December 2002]:</i> Surplus places can represent poor use of resources. This is why the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister sets annual Best Value Performance Indicators for the percentage of surplus places in an LEA each year. Decisions on whether to close schools are taken by the local School Organisation Committee or, if the Committee cannot agree unanimously, by the independent Schools Adjudicator. Guidance issued by the Secretary of State requires both bodies to consider a range of factors, including standards and access.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w27.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Miliband </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 December 2002]:</i> Local education authorities receive funding based on pupil numbers and there are no financial penalties for having surplus school places. While resources devoted to maintaining surplus school places can sometimes be more effectively used to support schools in raising standards, we recognise that in some cases it may not be possible to remove all surplus places due to demographic changes and falling rolls.

 In the judgement of our independent assessors, these schools did not meet the published criteria set out in the XGuide for Schools" available to all schools applying for specialist college designation in 2002&#150;03. Both schools received written feedback from the Department on their individual applications. The feedback should provide a helpful basis on which to make a stronger revised application.

 <i>[holding answer 3 December 2002]:</i> Figures for the number of school leavers who go on to higher education are not collated centrally on a constituency basis. The available figures for Great Britain, showing the proportion of under 21-year-olds who enter higher education for the first time from either sixth forms or FE colleges, are given in the table. There was an increase in the index in 1997&#150;98 related partly to changes in the funding arrangements for higher education, with students choosing to enter HE rather than wait until 1998&#150;99. There was a corresponding reduction in 1998&#150;99 before the entry rates started to increase again in 1999&#150;2000. Between 1997&#150;98 and 2000&#150;01, total HE students in English universities and colleges rose by 83,000.

 Clearsprings Management Ltd has a contract with the National Asylum Support Services (MASS) to provide accommodation for destitute asylum seekers. The contract is due to expire in March 2005. I am unable to give details about payments to Clearsprings under the terms of this contract since this information is commercial in confidence. Clearsprings Management Ltd is required to operate within the conditions of their contract with NASS. All properties supplied under contract must comply with all planning and other regulations set by the relevant local authority. NASS is responsible for monitoring the performance of Clearsprings Management Ltd. In particular all properties supplied by the company under contract to NASS will be inspected to ensure they meet the specification laid down in the contract.

 The Home Office was not a party to this action, which was brought against the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA).

<a name="21209w29.html_para1">In modelling the potential impact of the new sentences, it has been assumed that the number of offenders receiving custody plus under the new framework will be broadly similar to the numbers of offenders sentenced to imprisonment of under 12 months now but that a small number of those offenders currently receiving sentences of under 12 months would receive sentences of over 12 months in the new framework, while some would receive community sentences. In addition we have assumed that a quarter of those currently receiving sentences of between one and three months would receive custody minus. The Government will encourage sentencers to use penalties other than custody wherever appropriate.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to propose amendments to the law to increase the maximum sentence for paedophiles convicted of abusing children; what measures are in place to ensure that police have the details of known paedophiles in an area where a child has gone missing; what proposals he has to ensure that internet service providers that allow paedophile web sites to operate on their systems are prosecuted; how much has been spent on combating internet child exploitation since 1997; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="21209w30.html_spnew4"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The criminal law is a devolved matter for Scotland and recent proposals for changes to the law in England and Wales are different from those in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="21209w30.html_para1">For offences committed in Scotland, the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill will increase the maximum penalties available to the courts to 10 years for taking and distributing indecent images of children and to five years for possession, (which are both offences under-the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982). The Bill will also implement certain of the recommendations arising out of the recent report of the Expert Panel on Sex Offending, chaired by Lady Cosgrove. The Executive is committed to tackling all forms of child abuse and keeps this area of the law under review.
<P>

<a name="21209w30.html_para2">In England and Wales, recent proposals in the Government command paper XProtecting the Public" outlined our plans for comprehensive legislative reform of sex offences. Protection for children will be strengthened by proposed new offences of unlawful adult sexual activity with a child, familial sexual abuse of a child, sexual grooming and commercial sexual exploitation of a child, alongside the non-consensual offences of rape and sexual assault, among others. The proposed penalties for these offences, which in many cases are higher than penalties for existing offences, will clearly demonstrate the abhorrence with which society views sexual activity with children. Legislation to implement these proposals is planned for the New Year.
<P>

<a name="21209w30.html_para3">In answer to your second point, the Sex Offenders Act 1997, which applies to the whole of the UK, places requirements on sex offenders who have been cautioned, convicted or found guilty by reason of insanity in respect of sex offences against children and other serious sex offences. Offenders convicted of a relevant offence must report to a police station prescribed by regulations within three days of the date of their conviction, caution etc. or their release from prison, and notify the police of their name (and any aliases), home address and date of birth. They are also required to notify any changes to their details within 14 days. Failure to comply is a criminal offence with a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment.




<P>
<P><I>9 Dec 2002 : Column 118W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21209w30.html_para4">The Sex Offenders Act applies to sex offenders cautioned, convicted or found guilty by reason of insanity after 1997. Under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, when the police consider that a sex offender has behaved in a way that gives reasonable cause to believe that it is necessary to protect the public from serious harm from him, they can apply to a court for a Sex Offender Order to be made. The order will place restrictions upon his behaviour and activities and requires the offender to 'register' with the police for the duration of the order. An order lasts a minimum of five years and can be indefinite.
<P>

<a name="21209w30.html_para5">In the event that a child is abducted, the Government welcomes the pilot scheme based on the Amber Alert system used by some states in America, to try and ensure the safe return of the child. It was launched on 14 November and is known as 'Child Rescue&#151;Sussex Police'. It involves a joint effort by police, the media and the public. Its intention is to notify the general public that a child has been taken, so they look out for the child, the abductor or any vehicle used in the abduction. They then report any relevant information to the police.
<P>

<a name="21209w30.html_para6">Decisions on taking prosecutions against internet service providers are a matter for the police and the Crown Prosecution Service. An internet service provider (ISP) which knows of the presence of an indecent image of a child on their system and does not remove or disable access to it expeditiously on becoming aware of it, would be at risk of prosecution under the Protection of Children Act 1978. The internet industry funds the Internet Watch Foundation to assess images which have been referred to it and notify ISPs and the police of those that are illegal. The Foundation also provides its members with a list of newsgroups which should not be carried because they contain or appear to offer indecent images of children. These arrangements apply across the UK as a whole.
<P>

<a name="21209w30.html_para7">Operational decisions on allocation of police resources to combating child exploitation rest with police authorities and chief officers and no central records exist to determine how many cases have been investigated or the resources allocated to them. The new National Policing Plan reinforces the recommendation in the Joint Chief Inspectors' Report on Arrangements to Safeguard Children that police forces and authorities should review the role, remit, location and status of child protection units to ensure that child protection is dealt with to a consistently high standard. We have also set up a National High Tech Crime Unit within the National Crime Squad to provide additional support to local forces in investigating the most technically sophisticated crimes, including internet child protection. As well as policing resources we have worked with industry and child protection organisations through our Task Force on Child Protection on the Internet to tackle this issue, for example producing Codes of Practice and running public awareness campaigns targeting children and their parents.
<P>

<a name="21209w30.html_para8">Combating the exploitation of children by offenders who use the internet to facilitate the abuse, is an integral part of the work of the police in tackling child sexual exploitation. The Government have provided specific

 <i>[holding answer 2 December 2002]:</i> There has already been considerable progress towards the co-location of the police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in criminal justice units. Our aim is that all criminal justice areas should have co-located units by April 2004. Such co-location means improvements to the way in which cases are prepared for court, and have led to good working relationships; in which advice can be sought quickly on more difficult cases, and have also resulted in considerable savings in casefile preparation. Such a set-up will also support the new arrangements in which the CPS take over from the police responsibility for charging. The evidence of piloting these arrangements is that there are improved working relationships between the police and the CPS and more focused investigations. Ready access to legal advice and improved understanding means that cases, which previously would not have resulted in a charge, will now be taken to court. The outcome is fewer discontinued cases and earlier guilty pleas. The Criminal Justice Bill contains provision to put these arrangements on a statutory basis.

 <i>[holding answer 2 December 2002]:</i> As at 27 November 2002, the useable operational capacity of the Prison Service was 72,684; the total prison population was 72,500 (excluding 160 prisoners held in police cells) and the in use certified normal accommodation was 64,608.
<P>

<a name="21209w31.html_para1">Following the unexpected rise in the prison population, the Prison Service is using police cells for keeping both remand and sentenced prisoners in safe custody. The number of police cells used in this way (under Operation Safeguard) peaked at 448 on the night of 29 October 2002. Since then, new accommodation has been brought into operation, which has enabled the Prison Service to reduce its use of police cells.

 Consultation with the Judicial Studies Board has confirmed our view that it would be inappropriate to incorporate a standard direction on consent in statute because the exact direction in any particular case will need to vary according to the individual circumstances.

 The list of circumstances in which it will be presumed that consent is most unlikely to have been present will be exhaustive and will be clearly defined in the Sex Offences Bill. It will not be possible to amend it other than by means of further primary legislation.

<a name="21209w31.html_para7">However there are clearly numerous other situations in which consent will not be present and the alleged offence will be proveable in court.

: To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many women are in prison for <i>(a)</i> drug offences, <i>(b)</i> drug trafficking offences and <i>(c)</i> supply offences; and of these groups of women, what percentage (i) have dependent children, (ii) are UK nationals and (iii) are non-UK nationals giving countries of nationality.

 Information on the number of women in prison for drug supply offences, unlawful import/export and other drugs offences, and the nationality of these prisoners, is contained in the table.
<P>

<a name="21209w32.html_para0">Statistics on whether women currently in prison for drugs offences have dependent children is not available.
<P>

<a name="21209w32.html_para1">Previous Home Office research (Caddie & Crisp, Imprisoned women and mothers, 1994, Home Office Research Study 162), found that 61 per cent. of women in prison were mothers of children aged under 18 and/or were pregnant. 28 per cent. of sentenced mothers in this study were in prison for drugs offences.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what action his Department will take following the High Court decision that the Children Act 1989 applies to children held in prison; what assessment his Department has made of the <i>(a)</i> additional training required of prison officers and <i>(b)</i> additional costs to the Prison Service; what time schedule his Department is working towards to implement the High Court ruling in prisons and young offender institutions across England and Wales; and if he will make a statement.

 The Court upheld and endorsed the Prison Service's policy in relation to juveniles in custody. One sentence in its policy, which was to be changed regardless of the outcome of the judgment, has been found to be wrong. This will now be changed in the context of the judgment. There is undoubtedly a need for more consistency in the provision for young people across the prison estate and work is under way to ensure that this happens. There has been considerable investment across the juvenile estate and resources have been put into all establishments; however, these funds must be allocated according to specific needs and priorities.
<P>

<a name="21209w32.html_para4">The Prison Service has already in place a Child Protection Protocol through which Governors have been required to introduce arrangements to protect children from significant harm, in line with its wish to reflect the principles of the Children Act 1989 and safeguard the welfare of those in its custody. The Court's judgment has found that it is for local authorities to co-operate with the Prison Service in carrying out their duties, subject to the necessary requirements of imprisonment.

<a name="21209w33.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 As a result of the offer set out in the Fire Brigades Employer Circular of the 12 November the local government employers estimate that all firefighters, wholetime and retained, would have received an increase of 4 per cent. in November 2002. This would have been followed by an increase in the pay bill of 7 per cent. in November 2003, although the amount firefighters actually received would have depended on how much of the pay bill increase was used to reward some staff, for example, with special allowances. Due to changes in their allowances retained firefighters would have typically received 6.4 per cent. more than wholetime firefighters under the arrangements proposed.

<a name="21209w33.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The level of the assumed national council tax is determined by the national total for formula spending, the total of revenue support grant, the distributable amount of business rates and the council tax base.
<P>

<a name="21209w33.html_para3">The increases from year to year in these figures, rather than any inflation assumption, are therefore what determine the increase in the assumed national council tax. Assumed national council tax is simply an assumption used in the distribution of grant; it is not a prediction of actual council tax.

 Elected regional assemblies will be responsible for strategic priorities rather than for direct service delivery. But they will add value to service delivery by bringing coherence to, and improving the delivery of, the large number of strategies and partnerships that have developed at the regional level. Assemblies will set the framework for their region and co-ordinate activity on issues such as economic development, planning, housing and transport. An assembly's block grant will allow it to allocate spending according to what it considers as priorities for that region.

 Chapter 4 of the White Paper, XYour Region, Your Choice" makes clear that improving the economic performance of its region will be at the heart of an elected regional assembly's objectives. This is reflected in the range of powers and functions for which elected assemblies will be responsible. In particular, they will be responsible for the Regional Development Agency in their region. They will also have a range of other responsibilities for regional economic development relating to business support, training and skills, and European programmes.
<P>

<a name="21209w33.html_para5">Assemblies will be able to spend their block grant as they judge best, subject to agreeing a small number of targets covering their key responsibilities. Some additional funds will be available if an assembly meets or exceeds these targets. Elected assemblies will also be able to raise additional funds from a precept on the council tax and will have powers to borrow money, subject to certain limits.

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 2 December 2002]:</i> The main informal barriers relate to such problems as language or culture and are therefore not readily solved. However, the UK Government take up individual cases where any barriers seem to be unreasonable, and intervenes where appropriate when cases come before the European Court of Justice.

<a name="21209w34.html_para8">Free movement of people is one of the four freedoms within the internal market of the European Union. Within the free movement title of the EC Treaty, Article 39 states that free movement of workers Xshall be secured within the Community".

However, Article 39 does not apply to employment in the public service.

 My noble Friend quoted an illustrative example comparing what a married woman would have paid in full and reduced rate National Insurance contributions if she had earned around #4,000 in 1977 rising evenly to around #27,000 in 2002. The saving of #18,000 in this case is the total cash saving and has not been adjusted upward to take account of inflation over the period. The exact amount of savings any married woman will enjoy depends on her level of earnings because the amount of National Insurance contributions is calculated based on earnings.

<a name="21209w35.html_para0">Between January 1998 and September 2002, 64,106 sanctions, to withdraw any Jobseeker's Allowance in payment, had been imposed under the New Deal for Young People.

Clients who need help with their literacy and/or numeracy can access job focused training to ensure they are able to develop the skills they need to find and retain work. From April 2001 to January 2002, more than 4,400 young people received basic skills help in the New Deal for Young People.

<a name="21209w36.html_spnew5"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 DWP confirmed its commitment to sustainable development by publishing a sustainable development policy statement in July this year. The 2nd DWP annual sustainable development report, published on 25 November, also introduces the departmental strategy for sustainable development that has been developed. This contains targets for improvement and sets out how the Department will continue to contribute to sustainable development. Both of these documents have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="21209w36.html_para9">WSSD outcomes and first views on follow-up will be reflected in the annual report on UK progress on sustainable development for 2002. The DWP Strategy will be reviewed regularly to ensure that it continues to meet the aims and objectives of the UK strategy for sustainable development. The Introduction to the DWP strategy contains specific information on the World Summit on Sustainable Development. This will be updated to reflect the outcomes and as each element of the Strategy is reviewed outcomes from WSSD will be reflected as appropriate.

<P>
<a name="21209w37.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Austin Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health whether he will make it his policy to seek an amendment to the Food Supplements Directive prior to its full implementation to allow member states to permit onto their own national markets those products which fall outside the technical restrictions of that Directive but which the competent authority accepts as safe and appropriately labelled; and if he will make a statement.  [84523]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w37.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Government has no plans to seek any amendments to the Food Supplements Directive. It has already secured provisions which enable Member States to allow the continued sale of products which do not comply with the compositional requirements up to 31 December 2009.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many nutrients and nutrient sources on the United Kingdom market are absent from the list of permitted nutrients included in the annexes to the Food Supplements Directive; and what estimate he has made of the cost of <i>(a)</i> commissioning the research and <i>(b)</i> producing a dossier to the standards required by the European Scientific Committee for Foods for consideration for approval to be given for the addition of such missing nutrients to the annexes in the future.  [84525]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w37.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 According to information provided by industry, the list of permitted nutrients included in the annexes to the Food Supplements Directive excludes six nutrients (six minerals) and some 270 individual nutrient sources used in food supplements currently on the United Kingdom food supplements market. The costs of producing dossiers will largely depend upon the amount of new safety data that needs to be gathered, and will vary between individual cases.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health whether he has received from <i>(a)</i> industry and <i>(b)</i> the Food Standards Agency a list of those nutrients missing from the lists of approved nutrients and nutrient sources contained within the annexes of the Food Supplements Directive; what information he has received from industry as to which of those nutrients are the subject of projects to prepare adequate dossiers for consideration by the European Union Standing Committee for Foods; and what steps he intends to take to ensure the remaining nutrients are added to those annexes in the future.

 United Kingdom industry representatives have sent to the Food Standards Agency a list of those nutrients missing from the lists of approved nutrients and nutrient sources in the annexes to the Food Supplements Directive. The same representatives have also sent to the Agency a list of dossiers being considered by industry for preparation and submission to the EU Scientific Committee for Foods (SCF). These dossiers cover 51 sources of 17 vitamins and minerals. As required by the Directive, the Food Standards Agency will forward to the Commission any such dossiers submitted to the Agency by industry for submission to the SCF.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w37.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Department has not undertaken research into the effects of radio waves on leukaemia cells.
<P>

<a name="21209w37.html_para0">The independent expert group on mobile phones examined exposures from both mobile phones and base stations and experimental and epidemiological studies on possible health effects. It concluded that the balance of evidence to date suggests that exposures to radio waves below national and international guidelines do not cause adverse health effects to the general population.
<P>

<a name="21209w37.html_para1">The expert group also proposed that gaps in knowledge were sufficient to justify a precautionary approach to the development of this technology and made recommendations for further research. A comprehensive research programme has now been established in this country under an independent programme management committee (PMC). Out of more than 120 submitted applications the PMC has approved 1 5 research proposals to date. This research includes studies of the effects of radio waves on cells and studies of the incidence of leukaemia and other cancers in populations. Information can be found on the mobile telecommunications and health research web site (www.mthr.org.uk). The World Health Organisation's international electromagnetic fields project lists the research being carried out in a number of other countries (see www.who.int/emf )

<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w37.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Food Standards Agency is providing an independent contribution to the Government's debate on genetically modified (GM) foods. The Agency's contribution will consist of several elements including a citizen's jury and surveys on attitudes of young people and those on low incomes to GM foods, the details of which have yet to be finalised. The Agency has estimated that this will cost approximately

 This information is not held centrally.

 Children with ADHD normally receive help and support from within the spectrum of child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) which range from primary care, including school and social services interventions, to specialist and inpatient services. Child and adolescent psychiatrists, and increasingly paediatricians, provide specialist diagnostic and treatment services for children with ADHD, supported by members of multidisciplinary teams.

<i>[holding answer 3 December 2002]:</i> The NHS Cancer Plan pledged that the national health service contribution to the costs of specialist palliative care, including hospices, would increase by #50 million by 2004. Funding for specialist palliative care is included in the overall increased NHS investment for implementing the Cancer Plan and is, therefore, included in baseline allocations to health authorities (HAs) and primary care trusts (PCT).

<P>
<a name="21209w39.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The law governing assault is the same for adults and children, except only in respect of the Xreasonable chastisement" defence of the physical punishment of children. Use of this defence is now governed by the outcome of the European Court of Human Rights ruling in the case of A.<i> v.</i> United Kingdom, which was heard on appeal from the domestic courts. Since the Human Rights Act 1998 came into force in the UK in October 2000, the Courts have been obliged to take note of the outcome of the European Court of Human Rights ruling. Following the A. <i>v.</i> UK case, certain factors must be taken into account by the Courts when considering whether a punishment may be described as reasonable chastisement. These factors include the nature and duration of punishment, its physical and mental effects and the state of health and age of the child. The Government believe that parents have the right to decide for themselves whether or not they wish to use physical punishment in bringing up their children. The law is therefore formulated to allow

<P>
<a name="21209w39.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing in children in England. No exact figures on how many children are obese are available, although analyses of the Health Survey for England (1999) showed the prevalence of obesity was 10 per cent., at age six rising to 17 per cent., at age 15. There are also no figures available on the numbers of children who are obese and have Type 2 diabetes. There is however evidence to suggest that the rise in the number of children with Type 2 diabetes is in proportion to the number who are obese.
<P>

<a name="21209w39.html_para1">The Government are committed to tackling the rising trend in childhood obesity and have put in place cross-Government programmes of work to improve eating habits and increase physical activity levels.

<P>
<a name="21209w39.html_spnew6"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 We do not hold central information on how many children in care have access to the internet. However, #20 million has been made available from the capital modernisation fund to increase access to information and communication technology (ICT) for children in and leaving care. The majority of this money is being paid to local councils over this year and next as part of the Quality Protects programme (details in the circular LAC(2001 )28). The remainder is supporting the development of XCareZone" by the Who Cares? Trust. XCareZone" will provide a range of interactive, secure, on-line services for children in care.
<P>

<a name="21209w39.html_para4">Local authorities' Quality Protects management action plans, submitted in January 2002, included details of their plans for increasing access to ICT. The average position reported by councils was that just under half of their looked after children had access to a computer where they lived. This was projected to rise to three-quarters by 2004.

The Government are determined to tackle the problem of delayed discharges and that is why we have brought legislation forward to deal in line with it. This is in line with the commitment in the NHS Plan to end widespread delayed discharges by 2004.

<a name="21209w40.html_para0">There is currently no requirement for the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) to be notified of unlicensed herbal remedies placed on the market under section 12(2) of the Medicines Act 1968 and therefore there is no information available on the number of products placed on the market under this provision and which may fall within the terms of the proposed Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products.

<P>

<a name="21209w40.html_para1">There is no provision within the Directive for grandfather rights to be given as such. However, in the MCA's consultation on the proposed Directive earlier this year, the herbal sector was invited to submit examples of products which are currently legal but which may fall outside the terms of the proposed Directive. Analysis to date of the responses suggest that there will be few existing herbal medicine on the United Kingdom market which, while having 30 years use, are unable to meet the proposed requirement that at least 15 years use should have been within the European Union. This assessment also takes account of the proposed five year transitional period for products already on the market, during which time evidence of traditional use can continue to be accumulated.
<P>

<a name="21209w40.html_para2">A recent proposed amendment from the European Parliament, which we will support, would reduce the required minimum period of EU usage from 15 years to 10 years.

 Directive 2002/46/EC on Food Supplements came into force on 12 July 2002 and must be transposed into member states' national legislation by 31 July 2003. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is currently consulting on draft implementing Regulations.

<a name="21209w40.html_para7">The position of representatives of United Kingdom manufacturers of herbal remedies was set out in a letter from the Herbal Forum to my noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (The Lord Hunt of Kings Heath) on 18 November. The membership of the Forum, which covers small, medium and large businesses operating in the sector, comprises the Health Food Manufacturers' Association, the Proprietary Association of Great Britain, the British Herbal Medicine Association, the Council for Responsible Nutrition, the Natural Medicines Manufacturers' Association, the Ayurvedic Trade Association, the Trade Association of Producers and Suppliers of Ayurvedic Products from India, the Chinese Medicine Association of Suppliers, the European Herbal Practitioners Association, the Aromatherapy Trade Council, and the Small Growers and Producers Association.
<P>

<a name="21209w40.html_para8">The Forum indicates its view that the traditional medicines sector needs appropriate regulation in order to ensure that the public is properly protected against inferior quality products which the current system can allow on the market. The Forum also says that its members appreciate the need for the proposed Directive, while outlining a number of areas of specific concern that it wishes to be addressed through the continuing European negotiations or at national level. We welcome the stated intention of the Forum to continue to work constructively with the Government and the MCA in particular, to address the various issues identified.
<P>

<a name="21209w40.html_para9">We have received a wide range of representations from stakeholder interest groups in herbal sector in the form of letters and through points made in discussions with Ministers and with the MCA. The stakeholders cover many interests including, manufacturing, retailing, consumers, herbal practitioners, other complementary and alternative medicine groups, pharmacists, doctors, other health care professionals and academics. Some have been supportive of the Directive or have been supportive subject to the resolution of specific concerns. Others have raised specific points without indicating an overall view of the Directive. A minority has indicated strong opposition. Among representative groups wholly or broadly supportive of the Directive are the British Herbal Medicine Association, Consumers Association, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain and the European Herbal Practitioners Association. Representative groups expressing strongest opposition to the Directive include Consumers for Health Choice (CMC) and the National Association of Health Stores (NAHS).
<P>

<a name="21209w40.html_para10">In a number of meetings Ministers have held with a wide range of stakeholders directly involved in the sector the position taken by the majority of interest groups has been that the UK should support the Directive as being in the interests both of the sector and of consumers, while arguing for additional flexibility on a number of issues; and that the Directive should be 



<P>
<P><I>9 Dec 2002 : Column 160W</I><P>
interpreted and implemented in a way which minimised regulatory impact, consistent with the protection of public health. A minority of stakeholder groups has expressed strong opposition, citing fears in particular that the Directive would have an adverse effect on specialist health food retailers and consumer choice.
<P>

<a name="21209w40.html_para11">Representations from individual companies also express a wide variety of positions, ranging from strong support to concern or opposition.
<P>

<a name="21209w40.html_para12">We have received around 1,300 letters, mainly from the public, opposing the Directive. Many of these express the fear that large numbers of herbal remedies would no longer be available as a result of the Directive. A significant proportion specifically indicate support for the position against the Directive taken by CHC or the NAHS. We have received a number of petitions expressing a similar point of view. A number of these representations from the public also express opposition to the Food Supplements Directive.
<P>

<a name="21209w40.html_para13">We have in addition received around 400 letters from the public opposing the possibility of traditional use registration applying to flower essences. This followed a statement by the MCA, in response to a request from a company, that it might be possible in principle for a company to secure a traditional use registration for a product. Nearly all those writing were concerned that the possibility of a company making a successful application implied a requirement that all flower essences should be registered under the Directive. This however is not the case.

 No formal assessment of the proportion of patients with mental health problems attending general practitioner clinics has been undertaken by the Department. However, the NHS plan refers to evidence from independent research suggesting that as many as one in four consultations are with people with mental health problems. More detail about this evidence is presented in guidance published recently for primary care and other services on XGateway" workers. It is available on the mental health website at www.doh.gov.uk/mentalhealth.

 The Department does not hold this information centrally. Assessments are the gateway to carers receiving help. The assessment is the responsibility of the statutory sector to arrange and agencies should work together to ensure that a carer has one assessment which will enable them to access all services. The recently issued guidance, XDeveloping Services for Carers and Families of People with Mental Illness", will help local mental health services ensure that this is achieved.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what support and advice is given to mental health service users to become advocates for other mental health service users.  [86153]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21209w42.html_spnew9"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The national service framework states that specific arrangements should be in place to ensure both service user and carer involvement and advocacy arrangements. Decisions about the involvement of mental health service users as advocates remains the responsibility of local services. However, the NHS plan testifies to the emphasis that the Government are keen to place on the involvement of patients at all levels in the national health service. Furthermore, a proposal in the draft Mental Health Bill provides that where someone is subject to the powers in the Bill they have a right of access to a specialist mental health advocate.
<P>

<a name="21209w42.html_para9">The Department is also providing three year funding for the United Kingdom advocacy network to develop standards in independent advocacy whereby they are establishing programmes of regional training courses for advocates which includes service users.

<P>
<a name="21209w44.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The NHS Cancer Plan set out new goals to reduce waiting times for cancer treatment. The first step in reducing cancer waiting times was the introduction of the two week waiting time standard from urgent general practitioner referral to outpatient appointment for cases of suspected breast cancer from April 1999 and for all urgent cases of suspected cancer from 2000.
<P>

<a name="21209w44.html_para11">From December 2001 targets of a one month maximum wait from diagnosis to first treatment for breast cancer and a one month maximum wait from urgent general practitioner referral to first treatment for children's cancers, testicular cancer and acute leukaemia were introduced. From December 2002, there will be a maximum two month wait from urgent general practitioner referral to first treatment for patients with breast cancer. By 2005 there will be a maximum two month wait from urgent general practitioner referral to first treatment and a one-month wait from diagnosis to first treatment for all cancers.
<P>

<a name="21209w44.html_para12">Existing monitoring arrangements and published data cover the two week standard and the December 2001 targets. Data will be published on further Cancer Plan targets as data collection is rolled out. Data are published on the Department website.

 #10 million was made available for each of the financial years 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01 to support implementation of the two week outpatient waiting time standard. From 2001&#150;02 the additional #10 million was put into health authority baseline financial allocations. An additional #30 million was also made available for each of the financial years 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02 to further support the two week standard and the modernisation of cancer services.
