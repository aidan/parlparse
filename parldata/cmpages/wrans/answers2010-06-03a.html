The figures reflect the mean number of weeks from application to order. This means that the numbers of weeks taken for each order have been added up and the total has then been divided by the number of orders. 4.

However, some state pensioners also receive additional benefits or allowances.

 Speed limiters are already required on all goods vehicles of over 3.5 tonnes maximum gross weight in the interests of road safety and environmental protection. If there were to be any proposal for limiters to be required on lighter goods vehicles we would want to review the supporting evidence from the EU on costs and benefits carefully before determining what the UK response would be.</p>

The general principle applied by each of the services is that any unspent convictions will be a bar to recruitment.

1. Duration to Departure: The time (expressed as a whole number of minutes) between the patient's arrival and the time the A and E attendance has concluded and the department is no longer responsible for the care of the patient.<br>
2. A and E Data Quality: Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by a number of NHS providers across England. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seek to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. The A and E HES publications addresses some of the key data quality and coverage issues. These are available on HESonline at:<br>

 The Skills Funding Agency became fully operational on 1 April 2010, and is responsible for funding adult education and skills training, including apprenticeships for people aged 16 and over. In fulfilling this role, it is vital that the Skills Funding Agency works closely with learners, employers, and the further education sector more widely. An external advisory board is therefore being established which will consist of representatives from learners, employers and their representative bodies. Separate arrangements for a national advisory group have been agreed with colleges and training organisations, which will provide a forum for sharing information between the Chief Executive of Skills Funding and further education colleges and training organisations.</p>
