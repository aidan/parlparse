However, the current instructions issued to suppliers of fresh and frozen fish expressly stipulate that &#147;all fish supplied must come from approved sustainable sources&#148; and provide specific provenance requirements in the case of cod, haddock and other fish regarded as over-exploited by the Marine Stewardship Council or Marine Conservation Society. Furthermore, the House is currently in the process of letting a new contract for the supply of fish. Both the Marine Stewardship Council and the Seafish Industry Authority had input into the specification of requirements regarding environmental sustainability standards, and the relevant clauses were developed using the toolkit provided by DEFRA under the Public Sector Food Procurement Initiative.</p>

The centre was established as a part of the response to Sir Kevin Tebbit&#146;s review of the management and services of the House. It is intended to help provide a more integrated and responsive service to hon. Members and to their staff across the range of the services provided by House Departments. Benefits were assessed against costs before the centre was commissioned, though no formal cost/benefit analysis was conducted. The extent of the centre's use, and the support it has received from hon. Members and their staff, albeit after just one week of operation, suggests that the centre will fully justify its costs.</p>

The pay gap perpetuates the unequal division of labour in the home and prevents fathers from playing a more active role in their children's early years and women fulfilling their opportunities to work. Closing the pay gap is now one of the indicators in the new Equalities Public Service Agreement. This will help to build on other practical measures we have introduced, such as giving the parents of young, or disabled, children and the carers of adults the right to request flexible working, and providing more access to child care.</p>

It will provide practitioners with training and materials to enable them to support children&#146;s speaking and listening skills more effectively and free up time for practitioners to spend working with parents to enrich the home environment and networking with each other to share good practice. This will complement the materials delivered through the Inclusion Development Programme, which is focusing in its first year on SLCN, along with dyslexia.</p>

 The Department has been informed by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) that it expects to have to grant an indemnity against uninsurable claims arising from a nuclear incident that fall outside the protections offered by the Nuclear Installations Act and the Paris/Brussels Convention to whichever of the four bidders for the Sellafield contract is successful. The NDA is conducting the Sellafield parent body organisation competition under the EU Competitive Dialogue procedure, evaluating the four bids received against agreed evaluation criteria. Within that process bidders were invited to make proposals for a nuclear indemnity under competitive tension against an established framework. It would not be viable for any of the bidders to proceed without an indemnity because any fee earning benefits of the contract would be overwhelmed by the potential liabilities. The NDA has assessed that the benefits of engaging a new contractor far outweigh the remote risk that an indemnity might be called upon.

 The Government are developing the Qualifications and Credit Framework (QCF) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland to enable new unit and credit-based qualifications to be recognised. The distinction between informal, non-formal and formal learning in respect of this EU document is defined by the context (e.g. formal learning takes place in an institution), or by the process of learning (e.g. e-learning is non-formal learning) or by the content (e.g. basic literacy is informal learning). The QCF is concerned with the outcomes of learning, rather than context, process or delivery institution. It can recognise achievements through any of these definitions. Provided the outcomes of learning are organised into a unit format, they can be given a level and a credit value and count towards a qualification irrespective of the process of learning that leads to these outcomes.</p>

<i> [holding answer 23 June 2008]:</i> On each of the five occasions where international passengers were misdirected, the UK Border Agency was immediately notified and took appropriate remedial action. All of the incidents were a result of errors made by either British Airways or the British Airports Authority staff. UKBA staff worked closely with the airport operator to redirect passengers to the appropriate area in order to complete all of the necessary immigration checks. This was successful on two occasions, although on the other three, a number of passengers had already left the domestic area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="80714w0024.htm_para1"><a name="08071435001947">In these instances, further checks were made which satisfied UKBA staff that the individuals who had entered did not present a known risk to UK security. These checks included cross checking the details of all those who had been on board the aircraft against Home Office databases. In addition, passengers&#146; details were also passed on to the Metropolitan Police Service who carried out additional security checks.</p>

Guidance for the Providers of Social Networking and Other Interactive Services 2008. This was produced by members of the Taskforce including representatives from social networking sites. This Guidance asks companies to consider a risk assessment approach to their services and considering putting in place a range of potential safeguards where risks to children do occur. It also identifies to both the providers of interactive services and parents, teachers and carers how these sites can be used to exploit children and gives advice on how to keep children safe while using social networking tools.</p>

The review also assessed the effectiveness and adequacy of existing measures to help prevent children from being exposed to such material and help parents understand and manage the risks of access to inappropriate content.</p>

 No. We have always been clear that in order to benefit from the experience of the private and voluntary sectors in providing help to incapacity benefit claimants, delivery of Pathways to Work in phases two and three of the national roll out was to be provider led. Operational arrangements had been made on this basis both by providers and by Jobcentre Plus. The entry into administration of the chosen contractor did not affect these decisions or our ability to deliver Pathways to Work to customers in the relevant geographical areas.</p>

 We do not comment on the detail of intelligence assessments but the Ministry of Defence continually analyses how the Taliban and other extremists operate in support of the insurgency in Afghanistan. International cooperation is central to our efforts and we welcome the Government of Pakistan's commitment to countering terrorism as a top priority. We continue to press them to ensure that the Afghanistan insurgency cannot draw support from within their own borders.</p>

<i> [holding answer 10 July 2008]:</i> The presence of UK and other ISAF troops has already contributed significantly in transforming Afghanistan from a pariah state that harboured international terrorists, into a functioning democracy with a legitimate Government and Parliament. Security conditions are broadly stable if fragile in places, particularly in the South and East of the country. Overall in 2007, 70 per cent. of security incidents were confined to 10 per cent. of Afghanistan&#146;s 398 districts, which together contain less than 6 per cent. of the Afghan population.</p>

For example the daily HTD (Public) rate claimable for a distance of 30 miles each way from the place of duty is &#163;9.94.</p>

 Over the past two years the Ministry of Defence has undertaken a series of actions to reduce the amount of waste it produces and sends to landfill. These include: conducting a series of site waste audits to determine the processes that generate waste; implementing site waste minimisation schemes; and commissioning a Waste Management Improvement Project. This examined waste management activities carried out throughout the defence estate and how these could be improved to reduce the amount of waste generated in the first instance and to increase the amount of waste that remained to recycling and recovery operations. The recommendations from this report are in the process of being actioned.</p>

 The MOD will need to be content with all relevant arrangements pertaining to the Metrix Consortium and its subcontractors as a precursor to entering into a contract for DTR Package 1. The DTR contract is not yet let but Nord Anglia are envisaged as a lower-tier sub-contractor to Metrix. MOD will therefore be assuring itself that this change in ownership does not in any way preclude the inclusion of Nord Anglia under the terms of the proposed DTR contract, which includes specific provisions to protect the national interest. If these subcontracting conditions cannot be met, the requirements of the contract to provide the DTR services nonetheless persist and it will be for Metrix, as the prime contractor, to deliver against those requirements.</p>

assesses the performance of care homes against the Care Homes Regulations 2001, taking account of the relevant national minimum standards (NMS). Inspectors also assess how care homes comply with other regulations, such as those relating to health and safety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_453"><a name="80714w0038.htm_para0"><a name="0807158000113">CSCI uses key lines of regulatory assessment (KLORA) to help in making judgments about each NMS outcome group. These guidance documents provide inspectors with examples of evidence that may be found in an excellent, good, adequate or poor service. The KLORA are a description of what the standards might look like in practice, not an additional set of standards that have to be met. They help to translate evidence into a judgement of either excellent, good, adequate or poor, to assist in assessing how well a care service is performing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_454"><a name="80714w0038.htm_para1"><a name="0807158000114">The following tables show the information held centrally with regard to the cancellation of registration of providers of care homes and care homes with nursing in Southend, Essex and England during the operational years from 2003-04 to 2007-08. The data cover both cancellation of registration under section 17 &#145;normal&#146; cancellations following the set Notice of Proposal procedure and section 20 &#145;urgent applications to a Justice of the Peace&#146;, of the Care Standards Act 2000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_455"><a name="80714w0038.htm_para2"><a name="0807158000115">It should be noted that all care homes are residential. CSCI distinguishes between those that provide personal care only, nursing homes and non-medical nursing homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_456"><a name="80714w0038.htm_para3"><a name="0807158000116">In Southend, three care homes underwent cancellation of registration during the period. These cancellations were due to continuous failure on the part of the providers in question to meet regulations and an unacceptable degree of risk to people living in the services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_457"><a name="80714w0038.htm_para4"><a name="0807158000117">In Essex, one care home underwent cancellation of registration during the period. The home, which was deregistered in 2004-05, provided a poor physical environment and had issues regarding staffing. This provider subsequently applied for a voluntary cancellation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_458"><a name="80714w0038.htm_para5"><a name="0807158000118">We have been informed by CSCI that to provide the reasons for all cancellations in England since 2003-04 would involve disproportionate cost.</p>

 We have been informed by the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) that The Commission for Social Care Inspection (Fees and Frequency of Inspections) (Amendment) Regulations 2006 require CSCI to make arrangements to inspect care homes, domiciliary care agencies and adult placement schemes at least in every three-year period. The Regulations permit CSCI to take a proportionate approach to inspection, based on an assessment of the quality, risk and outcomes for the people who use services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_459"><a name="80714w0038.htm_para6"><a name="0807158000187">In order to make these assessments, CSCI carries out key inspections of all registered services. Key inspections, which are usually unannounced, are a thorough examination of how well a service is performing. Inspections take into account information provided by the owner or manager, the views and experiences of people living there, their relatives, staff and visiting professionals, as well as information CSCI finds when it visits the service. CSCI also considers any relevant information it has received about the service since the last inspection, for example, concerns that may have been raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_460"><a name="80714w0038.htm_para7"><a name="0807158000188">CSCI uses all information collected to measure how far the experiences of people using a service meet their expectations in areas that are important to them. Inspecting in this way helps CSCI to put residents at the heart of how it judges the quality of services. From these judgments, CSCI awards quality ratings, which help it to plan how often the service should be inspected in future. The frequencies are:</p>
<a name="80714w0038.htm_brev0"><a name="0807158002164"><ul><p class="tabletext">a three star&#151;excellent&#151;service will receive at least one key inspection every three years;</p>
</ul><a name="80714w0038.htm_brev1"><a name="0807158002165"><ul><p class="tabletext">a two star&#151;good&#151;service will receive at least one key inspection every two years;</p>
</ul><a name="80714w0038.htm_brev2"><a name="0807158002166"><ul><p class="tabletext">a one star&#151;adequate&#151;service will receive at least one key inspection every year; and</p>
</ul><a name="80714w0038.htm_brev3"><a name="0807158002167"><ul><p class="tabletext">a zero star&#151;poor&#151;service will receive two key inspections every year.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_461"><a name="80714w0038.htm_para8"><a name="0807158000189">This does not mean that a service will not be inspected more often if necessary. CSCI also carries out shorter, targeted, random inspections. These are usually unannounced and can take place at any time of the day or night. CSCI may undertake a random inspection because it has received information that suggests people using the service might be at risk, or to check on improvements that should have been made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_462"><a name="80714w0038.htm_para9"><a name="0807158000190">During each year in which services rated excellent or good are not inspected, CSCI carries out an annual service review. During a review, CSCI analyses all the information received about the service during the last 12 months, including any complaints or notifications. It also surveys people using the service and other interested parties. If, as a result of the review, CSCI considers the quality of the service may have changed, it may decide to bring forward the next key inspection or to carry out a random inspection visit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_463"><a name="80714w0038.htm_para10"><a name="0807158000191">To provide information on the standard of care in every care home inspected in each of the last three years would incur disproportionate cost. CSCI inspects homes against the National Minimum Standards (NMS) for Care Homes for Older People or the NMS for Care Homes for Adults. The decision as to which set of NMS should be used is made by the inspector at the time of the inspection and is based on the current age profile of the residents of the home. The following tables show the percentages of homes meeting or exceeding the individual NMS during the last three years for which information is available.</p>

 The new general practitioner (GP)-led health centres will provide the public with access to primary care services from 8 am to 8 pm seven days a week. Patients can either book an appointment or use the centres on a walk-in basis, and can do so while remaining registered with their existing GP practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_490"><a name="80714w0042.htm_para0"><a name="0807158001694">Analysis of NHS Choices data of practices currently delivering extended opening hours, shows that where a practice's closest neighbour is not currently open on evenings or weekends, there is only a one in five chance of a practice delivering extended opening. However, where the immediately neighbouring practice is delivering extended opening to their patients, a practice is twice as likely to also provide extended opening. Therefore, by securing a new GP-led health centre and new GP practices in poorly served areas, other patients will also directly benefit from extended opening and better access for patients from their own practice.</p>

It is, ultimately, for PCTs to identify the best location for these new services following consultation with patients, GPs and others to reflect local needs and preferences.</p>

 Wherever possible surveillance and information gathering during a pandemic will be based on existing data collection mechanisms. The attack rate will be estimated by modellers, principally those at the Health Protection Agency, through clinical data emerging from the United Kingdom and other affected countries. Disease pattern and severity will also be based on this information and that from national seasonal influenza surveillance systems, coordinated through the Health Protection Agency and mortality will be monitored through death registration data from the Office of National Statistics. This data is already monitored routinely as part of national seasonal influenza surveillance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_498"><a name="80714w0043.htm_para3"><a name="0807158001839">Work is under way to ensure that information obtained from all these sources will be robust during a pandemic and appropriate to the needs of modellers and others who will use them.</p>

Evidence from seasonal influenza and the 1957 pandemic suggest that of these between 50 per cent. and 67 per cent. will show clinical symptoms. This is consistent with a worst case clinical attack rate of around 50 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_500"><a name="80714w0043.htm_para5"><a name="0807158001841">The increase in the antiviral stockpile from 25 per cent. to 50 per cent. will ensure treatment is available for all symptomatic patients under the maximum clinical attack rate assumption of 50 per cent. There is thus much less chance that the dynamic targeting referred to will be needed. Flexibility in antiviral distribution via the Flu Line will be achieved by adjusting the clinical algorithm based on the clinical information obtained as the pandemic unfolds, as well as stock management and policy decisions. Plans for separate distribution channels are being developed to assist the hard to reach groups and others for whom the Flu Line will not be suited.</p>

 National health service trusts develop and manage their own capital financing plans, to which the proceeds from property disposals may make a contribution.

In general, a more significant contribution is made from the cash they receive in their income for the depreciation charge in their accounts, through loans from the Department and, under certain circumstances, allocations of public dividend capital.

 Commissioning for local health services in England is the core responsibility of primary care trusts (PCTs). It is a complex process with responsibilities ranging from assessing population needs and prioritising health outcomes to procuring products and services, and managing service providers. As such, commissioners are required to possess a wide range of skills, including robust analysis, effective stakeholder engagement and communication, financial management, strategic planning and performance management skills. The joint Department of Health and Prime Minister's Deliver Unit review of commissioning capabilities in May 2007 suggested that some PCTs perform better in some areas than others. However, there is not yet any comprehensive evidence about commissioning strengths and weaknesses nationally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_517"><a name="80714w0044.htm_para4"><a name="0807158001890">In June this year, a national commissioning assurance system was launched to hold commissioners to account through assessing their performance and rewarding development. PCTs will be assessed against commissioning skill sets, or competencies, organisational governance and health outcomes. By publishing and assessing against the competencies that make commissioning for health services world class, a clearer national picture will emerge. PCTs will also be better able to understand where their commissioning strengths and weaknesses lie and will be incentivised to access support and development resources in order to improve.</p>

 1. Median waiting times are calculated from aggregate data, rather than patient level data, and therefore are only estimates of the position on average waits. This should be taken into account when interpreting the data.<br>
 2. The inpatient figures show the median waiting times for patients still waiting for admission at the end of the period stated. Inpatient waiting times are measured from decision to admit by the consultant to admission to hospital.<br>
 3. The outpatient figures show the median waiting times for patients still waiting for a first outpatient appointment following a general practitioner (GP) referral at the end of the period stated. Outpatient waiting times are measured from a GP referral to a first outpatient appointment with the consultant.<br>

 Pedaciel, Repevax, Infanrix-IPV and Menitorix have been put on an allocation system. The allocation system aims to ensure general practitioner contractors receive doses based on their historic vaccine requirements so every child should be immunised with no need to delay immunisations. Where surgeries are concerned that they may not have sufficient stocks for a clinic they have contacted the Department's vaccine supply team who are working to ensure additional doses have been made available.</p>
