<a name="00503w01.html_wqn0"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, what progress has been made in respect of repairs to churches under the EC Directive adopted by the Council of Ministers on 22 October 1999 authorising member states to apply a reduced rate of VAT on a temporary basis for certain labour-intensive services.  [119828]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00503w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 Originally there was a suggestion that the directive might be applied to allow a lower rate of VAT on repairs to all historic and listed buildings including churches. Unfortunately the list adopted did not extend to these and the Churches will continue to press for this to be reviewed at the earliest opportunity.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00503w01.html_wqn1"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, what plans he has to seek to ensure that VAT costs are reduced for repairs to existing church buildings and to ensure that VAT is charged exclusively on the construction of new church buildings.  [119846]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00503w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 The Churches continue to press the case for VAT relief on repairs to church buildings. The hon. Lady will know that I raised this at a recent meeting with my hon. Friend the Minister for the Arts in the context of the current review of policies relating to the historic environment.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to provide a statutory framework for the UK biodiversity action plans.  [120210]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00503w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Biodiversity Action Plan is part of the Government's response to the Convention on Biological Diversity which, as an international treaty, does not require national legislation to give effect to it. Article VI of the Convention specifically requires the preparation of a national strategy. However, the Government are reviewing the need for a statutory basis for the Plan process in the light of representations they have received.
<P>

<a name="00503w01.html_para0">They would in any case wish to avoid breaking down the current highly successful delivery partnerships of statutory, business and voluntary sectors.

 The Civil Aviation (Route Charges for Navigation Services) Regulations 1998 (S.I. 1998/1537 and 2999) made under section 73 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 require the operator, and on notice the owner, of any aircraft in the Flight Information Regions of Eurocontrol Member States to pay Eurocontrol a charge for air traffic services.
<P>

<a name="00503w01.html_para1">These are collected by Eurocontrol and a sum in respect of the services provided by the service provider in each Contracting State is paid by Eurocontrol to the Contracting State. Under article 20 of the Multilateral Agreement, National Air Traffic Services Ltd. (NATS) has been nominated by the UK as being entitled to receive the United Kingdom's share of the route charges.
<P>

<a name="00503w01.html_para2">By directions made by the Civil Aviation Authority under Article 79 of the Air Navigation Order (No.2) 1995 it is the responsibility of the owners or operators of specified aerodromes to procure appropriate services for the control of air traffic in their vicinity. Usually the owner or operator of the aerodrome would include the costs incurred in acquiring these services in his charges to the owners or operators of aircraft using the airport. In some cases, however, contracts have been negotiated by NATS that specify that they will charge the aircraft owners and operators direct.
<P>

<a name="00503w01.html_para3">The duty on the owners and operators to pay the charges is set out in the Civil Aviation (Navigation Service Charges) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000/599).

 NATS employs 5,372 people as at 31 March 1999. The final form of the employee share scheme, including the allocation to NATS' staff, and any restrictions on sale will be worked up in due course following consultation with NATS' employee representatives and, when selected, the Strategic Partner.
<P>

<a name="00503w01.html_para5">However, the Government are keen to ensure that the share scheme is designed to ensure that NATS' employees hold a long-term equity stake in their company and that all employees are entitled to participate on an equal basis.

 <i>[holding answer 2 May 2000]:</i> The Government are aware of the potential health risks of simian herpes B virus. Under health and safety legislation, as well as ensuring the health and safety of employees, employers also have to ensure that others, eg members of the public, are not exposed to risks arising from the work. Local authorities are responsible for health and safety in zoos and safari parks. The Health and Safety Executive has alerted local authority enforcement officers to the potential health risks and has given guidance on action to take should any subsequent cases arise.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00503w01.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 I announced on 6 December 1999 that the Government accepted the key recommendations of the final report produced by the Cowboy Builders Working Group, including the requirement that all quality marked builders must provide an approved third-party warranty to protect the consumer in the event that he/she experiences difficulties with the completion of the job or standard of workmanship.
<P>

<a name="00503w01.html_para8">Pilots of the quality mark scheme are being run in Birmingham and Somerset. The Birmingham pilot was opened to applications from builders last month, and will open to the public in June or July. The Somerset pilot will be opened to builders later this month and to the public in September or October. The aim of the pilots is to test and develop the arrangements before we take a decision on a national scheme.

 A "Bellwin" scheme of emergency financial assistance may be activated to help a local authority with uninsurable clear-up costs following a disaster or emergency that involves destruction of, or danger to, life or property. Grant is normally paid at a rate of 85 per cent. of an authority's qualifying expenditure above a threshold. The threshold is the provision that a prudent authority might reasonably be expected to make for contingencies and emergencies (approximately 0.2 per cent. of its revenue budget).
<P>

<a name="00503w02.html_para1">In the financial years 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000, Worcestershire County Council did not incur qualifying expenditure above its threshold. Grant was paid to Worcestershire City Council as follows:

<P>
<a name="00503w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 May 2000]:</i> HSE has recently initiated a research project entitled "Proving Inspection Works".

<P>

<a name="00503w02.html_para2">It is hoped that "Proving Inspection Works" will demonstrate the value of unannounced preventive inspections, but it may be optimistic to say that a direct link can be proved between such an inspection and a reduction in accidents at a particular workplace. The project is looking to measure the promotion of positive risk management behaviours as well as reducing specific hazards and risks.

under the homelessness provisions of the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977, and subsequent legislation. 57,850 such households were accepted in 1980 and 104,770 in 1999. These figures are not comparable because of legislative changes since 1977.

<BR>
I am replying to your parliamentary question about the study undertaken by the Chemical and Biological Defence (CBD) sector of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) at HMS Phoenix.
<BR>
The purpose of this study was to determine whether existing or proposed control methods were effective in preventing nuclear contamination of a designated toxic free area (TFA). Subjects wearing full individual protective equipment were exposed to harmless particles to simulate nuclear fallout. They were then processed through the entry system under evaluation into the TFA, replicating the undressing and decontamination procedures appropriate to that system. The effectiveness of the entry system was tested using air sampling techniques in the TFA. None of the volunteers who took part in the trial experienced adverse effects. The results will be used to revise entry and exit procedures to reduce the potential for the transfer of nuclear contaminated material.
<BR>
I hope the above is helpful.

 The Defence Housing Executive (DHE) is the MOD agency responsible for managing Service housing in England, Wales and Scotland and, as a Tri-Service organisation, it does not build properties specifically for any one Service.
<P>

<a name="00503w05.html_para0">53 officers' quarters were built in Putney between 1995 and 1997 at a cost of &#163;4.6 million, a small majority of which are occupied by Naval officers. At Taranto Hill, Ilchester, 34 officers' quarters are in course of 



<P>
<P><I>3 May 2000 : Column: 115W</I><P>
construction as part of a larger project, at an approximate cost of &#163;2.7 million. The majority of occupants will be Naval officers based at RNAS Yeovilton.
<P>

<a name="00503w05.html_para1">Four Private Finance Initiative contracts have been placed by DHE covering requirements for new officers' accommodation for Lossiemouth, Shawbury, Glasgow (at Paisley) and Yeovilton, of which only those at Yeovilton will be mainly occupied by Naval officers. These PFI houses will not be owned by DHE and the cost will be paid through a monthly payment by DHE to the owners for the properties required. Payment will be dependent on the quality of service provided.
<P>

<a name="00503w05.html_para2">Two further PFI contracts are planned, one to cover accommodation requirements at Waddington and one to cover requirements at Bristol, Bath, Shrivenham and Portsmouth, of which the 70 houses for Portsmouth will be mainly occupied by Naval officers' families.

 The Government are committed to being as open as possible about Britain's nuclear forces.

 When DCTA was formed in November 1994, the intention from the outset was that the different elements would collocate to Caversfield. This would generate efficiencies by rationalising technical facilities at the Agency's Didcot and Colchester sites and by reducing the number of staff required to run one site as compared to three. However, it was not until July 1996 that a firm date of November 1998 was decided for the transfer of the Colchester Science & Technology Department (S&TD) element. At that time, the establishment of S&TD comprised a total of 147 staff was expected to increase by 1998 to 156. The current estimate of the number of staff from Colchester intending to transfer to the Caversfield site is 84, although all staff at Colchester still have the offer of a job at Caversfield, should they decide to move.
<P>

<a name="00503w06.html_para2">The original date for the transfer has been affected by a number of studies into the future of DCTA. However, none of these studies raised any point which significantly altered the original plan and the then Minister for the Armed Forces, my hon.

<P>

<P>
<a name="00503w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 Article 228(2) applies if a member state fails to respond to a Court judgment. The vast majority of cases is settled well before this stage. Over the last three years, the Annual Report on monitoring the application of Community law records that the Commission has referred 14 cases to the European Court of Justice for a second time, recommending fines in each case. The fact that no penalties have yet been imposed by the Court does not indicate that the system is not working. On the contrary, it shows that member states have responded to the possibility of a fine by rapidly coming into line with EC law, either before the case is referred to the ECJ for a second time or shortly afterwards.

<BR>
The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking when residents in Gosport will receive their winter fuel payments (WFP).
<BR>
Our records show that 10.2 million WFPs were issued in November 1999. Of these, around 5 million were issued directly to Post Offices, the remainder were issued to customers home address or direct to their bank accounts. For security reasons, Post Offices were advised to return any uncollected girocheques to the Benefits Agency by 21st December 1999. Approximately 85,000 were returned by the Post Office. My staff have been contacting customers whose payments were returned to ascertain the reason for non-collection and re-issue payments where possible. All payments were made before the end of March with the exception of those where the customer has still not responded to our enquiries.




<P>
<P><I>3 May 2000 : Column: 123W</I><P>

<BR>
Following the ruling in the case of Taylor, the age at which Winter Fuel Payments can be made was to be equalised at 60, and the need to be in receipt of a qualifying benefit is removed. As before, these payments are intended for people who are ordinarily resident in Great Britain.
<BR>
In order to meet the requirements of the European Court of Justice ruling it was necessary to identify the new beneficiaries from people aged 60 and over and build processes to ensure that this year's payments, and payments for past winters, could be made as soon as possible.
<BR>
The Secretary of State for Social Security wrote to all MPs on 11 April setting out the planned delivery arrangements to make these payments. As he indicated, the current plan is to begin making payments for past winters from the end of June onwards and to make this coming winter's payments before Christmas.

 DFID assistance to developing countries in the last financial year is estimated at &#163;2.212 billion, an increase of 8.5 per cent. in real terms over the expenditure of &#163;1.987 billion in 1998-99. This increase reflects the first year of the Comprehensive Spending Round settlement in 1998, as part of which an extra &#163;1.6 billion was allocated for development spending. Under this, DFID's budget will increase by &#163;365 million in the current financial year and by a further &#163;307 million in 2001-02.
<P>

<a name="00503w08.html_para10">I should also inform the House that we have today submitted to the OECD our provisional figures for official development assistance for the 1999 calendar year. We estimate that net ODA for the calendar year will be &#163;2.03 billion. This results from the different time-frame of our financial year and the Development Assistance Committee's use of the calendar year and is largely the consequence of the timing of the deposit of promissory notes in respect of IDA and the African. Development Fund, lower than predicted spending by the EC, and the timing of bringing to book expenditure on Kosovo. This will produce an anomalous calendar year ODA/GNP ratio of 0.23 per cent. We expect that ODA in 2000 will be 0.29 per cent. of GNP, rising in 2001 to 0.30 per cent. of GNP.

 The effectiveness of development assistance to Zimbabwe is kept under regular review. Projects are professionally appraised, monitored and evaluated to assess their impact on poverty. We also review the impact of the wider political and economic environment on progress. Our present assessment is that our portfolio so far has been broadly effective, but that new government-led projects would not be less effective until current governance and economic management issues are resolved. New projects are therefore channelled largely through civil society organisations.

 We are continuing to monitor events in Zimbabwe very closely, and are keeping programme activities under review to ensure that they can still be effective. We are particularly concerned about the failure of the police to uphold court orders against farm invaders; to provide protection under the law; and to act impartially in policing demonstrations. I have therefore suspended DFID support to an Aid and Trade Provision project supplying Land Rovers to the Zimbabwe Republic Police.

 In the DTI and some of its agencies a birth certificate is one of a variety of documents which applicants for jobs may choose to offer as proof of identity and of age, for pension purposes, prior to or at recruitment. In the event of the death of a departmental employee in service, his or her children's full birth certificates are required in order to verify dates of birth for dependants' benefits under the relevant pensions arrangements. Contractors are responsible for establishing proof of the identity of their employees. Birth certificates are not required routinely for any other departmental purposes, although they can be offered by claimants under the Empty Property Compensation Scheme to help establish the validity of such claims in particular lines of inheritance, and they may, in very limited circumstances, be demanded under a number of statutory powers of investigation, for example under Section 434 of the Companies Act 1985.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced on 17 April that he intends to lift the stricter consents policy as soon as the new electricity trading arrangements are in place, which he expects to be by October this year. The lifting of the stricter consents policy will mean that the existing presumption against new gas-fired power generation will no longer apply. The initiative for proposals for new power stations will remain with private sector companies to consider, to meet the evolving needs of the energy market. That market will be influenced by measures such as exemption from the climate change levy for CHP and enhanced capital allowances. It will also be influenced by the implementation of the Integrated Pollution Prevention Control (IPPC) Directive which emphasises that installations are operated in such a way that energy is used efficiently, and by the draft Large Combustion Plants Directive, which if adopted in its present form will

require the technical and economic feasibility of providing for the combined generation of heat and power to be examined.
<P>

<a name="00503w11.html_para0">The Government strongly support CHP and, consistent with the above measures, will expect developers to be able to show that they have explored opportunities to use CHP, providing heat for business and the community, although it is recognised that that may not always be practical. The Department will be discussing with developers the information which needs to be submitted as part of the notification under section 14 of the Energy Act and applications under section 36 of the Electricity Act.
<P>

<a name="00503w11.html_para1">The Department will also be contacting the promoters of the 15 proposals put on hold since October 1998, with a view to seeing whether those developers wish to proceed with their proposals and what updating of information is required of them.

 The Department of Trade and Industry publishes estimates of remaining recoverable reserves of gas on the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) in its annual "Brown Book", the next edition of which is due for publication in May 2000. The UKCS includes the Irish Sea and Atlantic Margin as well as the North Sea. The lower and upper ends of the ranges of the Department's estimates of remaining recoverable reserves of natural gas, in billion cubic metres, at the end of 1999 are given in the table in cubic metres:

<a name="00503w11.html_para3">The impact on remaining recoverable reserves of the proposed lifting of the stricter consents policy from October 2000 is not likely to be significant. Higher demand for gas could advance the pace of reserve depletion or it could increase the reserve base if it leads to an increase in exploration activity.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00503w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The date on which the UK will revert to being a net importer of natural gas will depend on a number of variables, such as the timing of commencement and cessation of production from particular fields and the rate of growth of demand (which can influence the pace of exploration and development of discoveries). It is likely that the UK will again become a net importer of gas during the present decade. There is, however, infrastructure in place to permit imports as and when they are needed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what actions are being taken to promote the development of a UK manufacturing, supply, installation and maintenance industry relating to wind energy, with particular reference to offshore wind energy; and if he will make a statement.  [119923]

 Support provided under the Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO), the Scottish Renewables Obligation (SRO), and my Department's research and development programme for renewable energy has contributed to the development of the wind industry. The first two UK offshore wind turbines are to be installed this year and developers are now looking to see how wind energy can be deployed more widely offshore.
<P>

<a name="00503w11.html_para17">The Government are taking powers in the Utilities Bill currently before Parliament to promote the development of renewable energy through a new Obligation on electricity suppliers. The intention is that this would include both onshore and offshore wind and would create a market for renewable energy until 2025. Support under existing NFFO and SRO contracts will be maintained. There will be no new rounds of NFFO and SRO contracts
<P>

<a name="00503w11.html_para18">The Government are also looking at the possibility of some limited additional support for offshore wind and energy crops. However, Government acting alone will not be sufficient to meet the challenge ahead and industry is expected to play an important part.

 Between January and March 1999, brain tissue was collected from approximately 4,163 randomly selected cattle, over five-years-old, passing through the Over Thirty Month Scheme (OTMS) and examined for the presence of BSE infection. The purpose of the study was to assess if cattle carry any detectable BSE infection before clinical symptoms are seen.
<P>

<a name="00503w12.html_para3">Of the brains removed, a total of 3,951 were in a suitable condition for examination and initial results showed that 18 cattle had signs of BSE infection. The remaining 3,933 were negative and showed no signs of infection. Taken in isolation these results could indicate that approximately 0.5 per cent. of the remaining cattle over five years and older may be infected. It will not be possible fully to interpret the data until the results from other diagnostic tests and a statistical analysis of the age structure of cattle slaughtered under the OTM Scheme is complete.
<P>

<a name="00503w12.html_para4">A similar study of cattle under thirty months of age has not been undertaken because it would be very unlikely that brain pathology would have developed in such young animals if they were infected. In experimental conditions when calves were orally challenged with relatively high doses of BSE infected cattle brain, the first stage at which signs of BSE infection could be detected in the brains of these challenged cattle was at 32 months after dosing. No signs were seen prior to this at 26 months post challenge.

 Council Regulation 3760/92 is the basic framework regulation for the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and is due to be reviewed before the end of 2002. The Government are seeking to maintain highly valued features of the present arrangements, such as the national quota system based on relative stability and restrictions on access within national 6 and 12 mile limits, and believe that this will be achieved. At the same time, we will want to explore opportunities to improve the CFP to make it a more effective instrument for conserving fish stocks.

The Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been asked to reply to your recent question on the number of people in the lower quartile of earners who had no educational qualifications. I am replying in the Director's absence.
<BR>
The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is the ONS's main source of labour market data on individuals. It can provide information on the earnings and qualifications of employees. However, no LFS data on earnings are available prior to winter (December-February) 1992/3.
<BR>
In Great Britain in autumn (September to November) 1993, 1,611,000 employees aged 16 and over in the lower quartile earnings group (based on gross weekly earnings) had no qualifications. This was 30.2 per cent. of all employees aged 16 and over in this earnings group. In autumn 1999, the corresponding figures were 1,140,000 and 91.4 per cent. The figures are not seasonally adjusted.

<BR>
The Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been asked to reply to your recent question on long-term unemployed people with no educational qualifications. I am replying in the Director's absence.
<BR>
Estimates of economic status and educational qualifications are available from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). Non-seasonally adjusted estimates from the spring (March-May) 1999 quarter for the UK show that 33 per cent. (170 thousand) of long-term unemployed people of working age had no educational qualifications. This compares with 59 per cent. (882 thousand) in the same period in 1984 (the earliest date for which a comparable estimate can be provided.).

The measure of unemployment derived from the LFS is defined on a consistent and internationally recognised basis set out by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). It counts as unemployed people who are a) without a paid job, b) available to start work within the next two weeks and c) have either looked for work in the last four weeks or are waiting to start a job already obtained.

The Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been asked to reply to your recent question on teenage suicides in <i>(a)</i> 1970, <i>(b)</i> 1980 and <i>(c)</i> 1999; and the percentage of teenage suicides occurring in homes at a time when (i) one parent and (ii) both parents were present. I am replying in the Director's absence.
<BR>
Figures for the number of suicides for 1970, 1980 and 1998, the latest year for which figures are currently available, are given in the attached table.
<BR>
For adult deaths our usual practice is to define suicides as including both suicides and deaths from injury and poisoning undetermined whether accidentally or purposely inflicted. It is likely that most undetermined deaths (open verdicts) among adults are cases where the harm was self-inflicted but there was insufficient evidence to prove that the deceased deliberately intended to commit suicide. This is not necessarily the case for children and the categories are therefore separately presented here.
<BR>
Information is routinely collected on the place of death, but not on the place of occurrence of the suicide attempt. In many cases where the initial attempt was at home, the patient would ultimately die in hospital. Any statistics on suicide deaths at home would therefore understate the real level. Information on persons present at a death is not routinely recorded.

The ONS does not make estimates of this kind. One non-government source that allows this type of analysis is the British Household Panel Study, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC). This survey has followed a sample of households each year since 1991 and has information about the incomes and marital status of household members in each of these years. The Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER, formerly the ESRC Research Centre on Micro-Social Change) published an analysis showing the effect of marital splits on income between 1991 and 1994. This was published in 1997 as 'Marital splits and income changes: evidence for Britain' (Working Paper 97-4). You can obtain a copy from the information officer at the ISER, tel: 01206 872938.

Estimates of economic and marital status are available from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). The table gives non-seasonally adjusted LFS estimates of the unemployed who were divorced in the spring (March-May) quarter of 1999 and the same period in 1984 (the earliest date for which a comparable estimate can be provided).

<a name="00503w16.html_para0">Two recently approved applications are for programmes that do not test the effects of tobacco smoke, which are already widely known, but enable the development of treatments for chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases such as bronchitis and emphysema which seriously debilitate many people. These health problems derive mainly from smoking, including passive smoking, as well as occupation-related lung diseases, such as those caused by the inhalation of coal dust. Tobacco smoke is the only test material to model reliably the effects that will enable a better understanding of the disease processes and improved medical treatments. The licensed research programmes are to investigate medical treatments, not the safety of tobacco products.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the breakdown was by percentage of stop and searches for each police borough in the Metropolitan police area under section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 by <i>(a)</i> ethnic appearance and <i>(b)</i> reason for search, in 1998-99.  [119830]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00503w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis has provided the information requested which I have placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="00503w16.html_para2">These statistics update those published by the Home Office, under section 95 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, in 'Statistics on Race and the Criminal Justice System', in December 1999.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department on what date Quayyum Raja, currently detained at HMP Long Lartin, was convicted; what was his sentence; how long he has been detained at Long Lartin; and when he is due to be released.  [120035]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00503w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Quayyum Raja was sentenced to life imprisonment on 7 February 1985. He was given a tariff of 25 years which expires on 1 February 2009. His readiness for release or transfer to open conditions will be considered by the Parole Board for the first time in 2006. He has been detained at Long Lartin prison since 17 February 1992.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00503w16.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Gerrard: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many prisoners detained at HMP Long Lartin were offered progressive moves to other prisons in each of the last three years, and in the current year to date, and of those how many <i>(a)</i> accepted and <i>(b)</i> declined the transfer; and of those who declined the transfer, how many were placed in segregation.  [120004]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00503w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 This information is not readily available and cannot be provided in the form requested except at disproportionate cost. It is known, however, that during the last 30 months Long Lartin prison has offered progressive moves to approximately 50 category B life sentence prisoners.
<P>

<a name="00503w16.html_para3">A minority of prisoners do indicate a reluctance to comply with initial transfer instructions, but in almost all cases do move following representations to Prison Service headquarters.
<P>

<a name="00503w16.html_para4">Prisoners are not placed in segregation for refusing a progressive move.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if prisoners who undertake a progressive move normally become eligible for home leave or parole prior to release.  [120036]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00503w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Life sentence prisoners become eligible for escorted absences to towns near their establishments after having completed six months in category C conditions. They are not eligible for any form of unsupervised home leave or any other form of temporary release until they have reached open conditions.
<P>

<a name="00503w16.html_para5">All prisoners sentenced to determinate sentences of four years or more are eligible to be considered for parole once they reach the halfway point of their sentence. Moves between prisons and recategorisation do not affect their eligibility for parole.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00503w16.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Gerrard: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department for what reason Mr. Quayyum Raja was placed in segregation at HMP Long Lartin after refusing a progressive move to HMP Swaleside; and whether <i>(a)</i> he and <i>(b)</i> his officials were informed of this prior to the segregation taking place.  [120037]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00503w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Mr. Quayyum Raja has never been placed in segregation as a result of refusing a progressive move from Long Lartin to Swaleside prison.
<P>

<a name="00503w16.html_para6">Mr. Raja's refusal to move to Swaleside was in contravention of his sentence plan, a crucial part of his progress towards eventual release. This led to him being downgraded to basic level on the Prison Service incentives and earned privileges scheme and moved to the basic regime wing at Long Lartin prison.
<P>

<a name="00503w16.html_para7">The Prison Service has now re-considered Mr. Raja's case in the light of recent changes in the availability of accommodation at Gartree prison and Mr. Raja has now accepted a move to Gartree.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if women prisoners who have been employed inside prisons and give birth are paid maternity pay.  [120620]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00503w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Women prisoners who have been employed within prisons and give birth are paid an allowance under regulations set out in the Prisoner Pay Manual 1992 and Standing Order 6 regulations 1993. Under these regulations, scope exists for establishments to set their own rates of pay in addition to the prescribed minima. Women prisoners are entitled to child benefit if their babies remain with them. Consideration is currently being given to introducing specific maternity pay where a woman prisoner is unable to work as a consequence of pregnancy, childbirth or caring for a child.

Some closures and openings are for the same location where the practice has reopened under a different name. Also, a number of dental practices did cease to treat some or all of their patients as National Health Service patients during this period.<P>

 The Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment have considered the carcinogenicity of those man made mineral fibres (glass, rock and slag wool) used for insulation purposes on a number of occasions since 1984. Their advice is that domestic exposures arising from infrequent or short-term do-it-yourself installation do not pose a carcinogenic risk. It was their view that these materials do not meet the European Union's criteria for classification of compounds as carcinogens. However there was limited evidence that occupational exposure was associated with lung cancer, although no definite conclusions could be drawn because there was a lack of information about confounding factors, such as tobacco smoking. It would be prudent, however, to act on the basis that sufficient occupational exposure may increase the risk of lung cancer.

 Patients may have their prescriptions dispensed by their general practitioner if they live in controlled localities (that is to say, rural areas), more than one mile from the nearest pharmacy and the practitioners have been granted permission by their health authority to dispense prescriptions. Other patients may also apply to the health authority for their doctor to dispense their prescriptions if the patients experience serious difficulty in obtaining their medicines from a pharmacy due to the distance involved or lack of transport.

 The White Paper "The new NHS--Modern, Dependable" set the standard that everyone with suspected cancer will be able to see a specialist within two weeks of their GP deciding that they need to be seen urgently and requesting an appointment.

The standard will be introduced for prostate cancer in December. We have published referral guidelines to assist GPs in determining those patients who need to be referred urgently within two weeks to see a specialist.

 The latest figure available for annual Government expenditure (Department of Health/National Health Service, Medical Research Council and other Government Departments--principally devolved health departments) on prostate cancer is &#163;1.55 million. This figure underestimates the total Government research and development expenditure in this area, as detailed estimates of NHS support funding are not collected routinely.

At the Department's request, the Forum considered the issue of prostate cancer at its first meeting on 10 January. They agreed to set up an expert group on prostate cancer, which will identify gaps in current research and suggest ways of filling them. The expert group met for the first time on 25 February, and expects to report within months.

 The epidemiological study published in <i>The Lancet</i> in June 1999 was an independent study commissioned by the Medicines Control Agency. This study was designed to investigate a possible association between measles, mumps and rubella vaccination and autism and found no evidence for a causal association. A copy has been placed in the Library. The study was accepted for publication in <i>The Lancet</i> following a process of rigorous independent peer review in the normal manner. It is not usual for peer-reviewed data to be subject to reanalysis by third parties. The Department therefore does not propose to ask the independent investigators to release their data.

 Early retirement falls into two categories: ill-health and premature retirement. Full-time teachers taking early retirement from the maintained nursery, primary, secondary and special sector in England in 1980, 1990, 1997 and 1999 are as follows:

<a name="00503w23.html_para1">Retirement data are not available for 1970; premature retirement was not introduced until 1977. The number of teachers taking ill-health and premature retirement was much higher during the 1990s than in previous years. The conditions for awarding an ill-health or premature retirement were changed during 1997 and as a result the numbers of early retirements had fallen by 1999.
<P>

<a name="00503w23.html_para2">Premature retirement can be awarded because of redundancy or employer efficiency gains; ill-health retirement includes reasons of injury or illness (physical and mental).
<P>

<a name="00503w23.html_para3">The capitalised additional cost of an ill-health retirement was recently estimated to be on average in the order of &#163;50,000-&#163;60,000 when compared with preserved benefits if the individual had simply resigned. The figure for premature retirements is estimated to be in the order of &#163;30,000-&#163;40,000.
