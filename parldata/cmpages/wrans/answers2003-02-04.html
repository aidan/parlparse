<a name="30204w01.html_para0">Access to broadband services in rural communities and the remote areas of Scotland is a strategic priority for the Scottish Executive. The Executive represents Scottish interests on the UK Broadband Taskforce and has already announced a &#163;24 million economic development initiative to accelerate and extend the reach of broadband services.

<a name="30204w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. McGuire: </B> 
 The Government are committed to ensuring the rural dimension is taken into account when developing policy and sets specific targets to measure progress on rural issues. Policy on rural development in Scotland is a devolved responsibility.

As announced in my statement to Parliament on 18 December 2002, I expect that the new commission to consider issues caused by different boundaries for Westminster and Holyrood constituencies will be established after the 2007 Scottish Parliament elections.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30204w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. McGuire: </B> 
 This Government is spending around &#163;6 billion extra in real terms on pensioners in 2002/03 as a result of policies introduced since 1997. We have introduced the Minimum Income Guarantee for poorer pensioners; Winter Fuel Payments for people aged 60 and over; free TV licences for the over 75s; and are introducing the new Pension Credit later this year, rewarding pensioners who save.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what her policy is on how many Scottish honourable Members should be returned at the next general election.  [94197]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30204w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Future representation for parliamentary constituencies in Scotland is dealt with in the Scotland Act 1998, which repealed the guarantee of 71 Scottish seats at Westminster and requires the Boundary Commission for Scotland to determine the level of Scottish representation by applying the same electoral quota as in England. The Commission is required to submit its report to me before December 2006. It is a matter for the Commission when, within that time scale, it does so.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30204w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. McGuire: </B> 
 For winter 2001&#150;02, around 996,000 people in Scotland received Winter Fuel Payments, producing a total payout of &#163;152 million.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30204w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mrs. McGuire: </B> 
 I met Citizens Advice Scotland yesterday. The Government greatly values the work they and individual Citizens Advice Bureaux carry out in major areas such as debt, welfare rights and employment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30204w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mrs. McGuire: </B> 
 The Government has emphasised its commitment to the UK rural post office network by making 450 million available to Post Office Ltd over the next three years. The funding will directly support rural post offices and give the company freedom to pilot new and innovative ways of providing rural services. Post Office Ltd will administer the fund within guidelines and parameters set by the Government and, as such, no specific figures in relation to Scotland are available at this time.

35. <a name="30204w01.html_wqn12"><B> Sir Nicholas Winterton: </B> 
 To ask the President of the Council what further changes to the standard timetable of the House he plans in 2003.  [95360]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30204w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Robin Cook: </B> 
 I have no plans for further changes. I shall, of course, give careful consideration to any recommendations which the Procedure Committee may make following its current wide-ranging inquiry.
<P>

<a name="30204w01.html_para1">The House will not need to review the changes before the end of the Parliament. The resolution lapses at the end of this Parliament, but it would surely be right to leave the decision on the hours of the next Parliament to its Members.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30204w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend's assessment is that the House's new sitting hours, taken with other modernisation changes (opportunities for debate and cross-cutting questions in Westminster Hall, for 



<P>
<P><I>4 Feb 2003 : Column 134W</I><P>
example, and more topical questions in the main Chamber) have had a positive impact on the scrutiny of Government business.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30204w01.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 In the course of discussions on the legislative programme, my right hon. Friend has encouraged ministerial colleagues to proceed on the presumption that Bills will be published in draft for pre-legislative scrutiny unless there is good reason otherwise.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30204w01.html_spnew14"><B> Sir Archy Kirkwood: </B> 
 As the House will be aware, following the Modernisation Committee's recommendation, the Commission asked for a feasibility study from specialist consultants. We are well aware of the sensitivities about the option off Westminster Hall which they recommended, and have asked that sites outside the precincts should be examined as well. We are consulting widely, and hope to consider the matter again in April in the light of the views expressed. The way forward will need to be agreed with the authorities of the House of Lords.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30204w01.html_spnew15"><B> Sir Archy Kirkwood: </B> 
 Special provision for schoolchildren to visit Parliament for educational programmes, including a tour, can be made through the Parliamentary Education Unit which represents both Houses of Parliament. Last year the unit sponsored about 10,000 students taking part in three different visits programmes and a number of special events. However, the majority of schoolchildren visit Westminster as constituents on tours sponsored by Members.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30204w02.html_spnew1"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The level and type of crime in each MCC differs and it is for each committee to determine and provide training to suit their local needs. Information is available centrally from the Home Office, which has published a business and retail crime toolkit on the Crime Reduction Website. This provides an overview of the problem, statistical information about the nature and extent of retail crime, examples of best practice and tools to help reduce it. The toolkit also contains links to other useful sources of information on retail crime.

 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department how long on average the delay was between lodging an appeal against the grant of asylum and the hearing of the appeal in the last quarter for which figures are available; and what his assessment is of the cause of these delays.  [95369]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30204w02.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 During the period October-December 2002 there were 19,343 substantive asylum hearings by adjudicators and the average length of time between lodging an appeal and substantive hearing was 34.09 weeks.
<P>

<a name="30204w02.html_para0">Of those cases heard substantively during the period 12,240 related to an appeal lodged after 1 April 2002. For these cases the average length of time between lodging an appeal and the substantive hearing of that appeal was 17.12 weeks.
<P>

<a name="30204w02.html_para1">The primary reason for delays has been the need to manage a significant backlog of work through the appeal system. However, these figures demonstrate that the recent streamlining and increased capacity of the asylum appeals system are already delivering a significant reduction in waiting times.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30204w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 31 January 2003]:</i> The traffic capacity through the Channel Tunnel is calculated as the number of trains running at a nominal 140 kph (the speed of Eurotunnel's Shuttles) that can pass through the Channel Tunnel per hour. On this basis, at present, the capacity of the Channel Tunnel is 20 standard train paths per hour in each direction.
<P>

<a name="30204w03.html_para0">The 20 standard train paths are available at all times, with the exception of a few hours on the three low demand nights at each weekend when part of the Channel Tunnel structure is closed for essential maintenance.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30204w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 31 January 2003]:</i> A Tourist Shuttle releases about 9 MW of heat, which is more than any other train using the Channel Tunnel system. About 15 per cent. to 20 per cent. of heat dissipates naturally, and the remainder is removed by a cooling system based on chilled water.

<P>
<P>

<i>[holding answer 31 January 2003]:</i> The Channel Tunnel traction electrical network is fed from four 75 MVA transformers on the French side, and four

 The Government are committed to seeing an increase in cycling.
<P>

<a name="30204w03.html_para1">The National Cycling Strategy Board for England, chaired by Steve Norris, has been established to advise on how to increase cycling. It combines unrivalled expertise on transport engineering, marketing, local government and research. The Board has established an English Regions Cycling Development Team responsible for promoting and monitoring cycling to bring about an improvement in conditions for cycling. Their work includes an audit of local authority provision for cycling; assessment of local authority cycling strategies in Local Transport Plans; and monitoring Cycling Project Fund schemes.
<P>

<a name="30204w03.html_para2">We have just launched the second round of the Cycling Projects Fund. The Fund is open to any organisation, with the exception of local highway authorities, for projects that will increase cycling. More than &#163;3 million has been made available in total. Any project that could be expected to lead to an increase in cycling, such as cycle parking, routes, cycle training or elements within a travel plan may be eligible.
<P>

<a name="30204w03.html_para3">Improved facilities for cyclists are largely funded through Local Transport Plan funds. Highway authorities are asked to develop a local cycling strategy as part of these plans. This must identify gaps in the local infrastructure and potential improvements to the cycling network.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30204w03.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The original purpose of establishing no fly zones over nuclear sites was to secure the safety of aviation by ensuring that an aircraft suffering engine failure had sufficient height to land clear of the site. A no fly zone does not, on its own, make a significant contribution to the security of the site.
<P>

<a name="30204w03.html_para6">The overflying restrictions imposed on 3 November 2001 over a number of nuclear installations were part of a review of the measures designed to maintain safety and security.
<P>

<a name="30204w03.html_para7">In determining whether and where a no fly zone may be needed on security grounds, the Government would consider whether a specific threat had been made, the nature of such a threat, the most effective response to it, and the part&#151;if any&#151;which a no fly zone could play in that response.

 In its 1994 guidelines on the application of state aid rules to the aviation sector (94/C 350/07), the European Commission has stated that direct operational subsidisation of air routes can in principle be accepted in the case of public service obligations (as defined in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92). The Commission considers that compensation for public service obligations does not involve aid, provided that the carrier has been correctly selected through a call to tender, on the basis of the limitation of access to the route to one single carrier, and the maximum level of compensation does not exceed the amount of deficit as laid down in the bid.

 My hon. Friends the Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State (Lords) and (Commons) and I represented the United Kingdom at the meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 27&#150;28 January 2003. Ministers with agriculture and fisheries responsibilities in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales also attended.

<a name="30204w05.html_para0">The Greek Presidency outlined its priorities and planned work programme for the period ahead.
<P>

<a name="30204w05.html_para1">The Commission formally presented draft legislative proposals that would give effect to the Common Agricultural Policy reforms outlined in its paper of July 2002; member states gave their initial reactions. I emphasised the need for a sustainable CAP and welcomed the general direction of the proposals and the benefits they would bring EU farmers. I noted, however, that the current proposals for modulation of direct payments to farmers put a disproportionate burden on larger and more efficient farms. I argued for a simpler and more equitable model. I also urged a faster and more substantial transfer of funds to rural development spending than the Commission had proposed. Detailed consideration of the proposals will now take place at official level.
<P>

<a name="30204w05.html_para2">Over dinner, Ministers discussed the WTO agriculture negotiations.

<P>

<a name="30204w05.html_para7">Under other business, several delegations urged the Commission to keep the case of processed poultry imports under review to ensure that there was no unfair exploitation of the discounted duty rates that apply. On GMOs, there was an exchange of views regarding the co-existence of GM and non-GM agriculture. We supported the case for fuller discussion but warned against attempts to impose a de facto moratorium on GM approvals. Separately the Commission indicated that existing rules would continue to govern the approval of new GM products. New rules, following Council agreement of principle last November, were still under preparation and could not apply immediately.
<P>

<a name="30204w05.html_para8">On fisheries, the Council adopted conclusions welcoming the Commission's communication on the integration of environmental protection with the common fisheries policy and the future actions envisaged in it. We underlined in particular the importance of taking forward action to minimise the by-catch of cetaceans in fishing nets.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what help is being given to rural areas to deliver energy efficiency in <i>(a)</i> homes and <i>(b)</i> offices.  [93129]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30204w05.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Since the publication of the UK's Climate Change Programme in November 2000, the following key actions have been taken to help deliver energy efficiency in both homes and offices across the whole of the country, in both urban and rural areas:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Climate Change Levy, a levy on the business use of fuel, was introduced in April 2001. Receipts, forecast at &#163;1 billion a year, are recycled back to business&#151;including &#163;50 million for business energy efficiency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Carbon Trust was launched in April 2001, and it receives two thirds of its annual budget from recycled receipts from the Climate Change Levy. It encourages and promotes the development of low carbon technologies to support the transition to a low carbon economy. It offers an interest free loan scheme for small and medium sized businesses and provides funding for the development of low carbon technologies through the Low Carbon Innovation Programme.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Enhanced Capital Allowances Scheme enables businesses to claim 100 per cent. first year capital allowances on investments in a range of approved energy saving technologies.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Energy Efficiency Commitment for 2002&#150;05 (EEC) places a challenging but realistic obligation on electricity and gas suppliers to promote improvements in domestic energy efficiency. Suppliers will achieve individual EEC targets by encouraging and assisting consumers to take up energy efficiency measures. It is expected to save 0.4 million tonnes of carbon a year by 2005. It will also help those on lower incomes-who spend a larger proportion of their incomes on energy-by focusing at least 50 per cent. of energy savings on consumers in receipt of benefits or tax credits.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Since its launch in June 2000, the new Home Energy Efficiency Scheme-which is now marketed as Warm Front-has helped over 400,000 households through the installation of a range of insulation and heating measures. Warm Front is the Government's main programme for tackling fuel poverty, aimed at the most vulnerable groups in the private sector in England. Fuel poverty can occur in both urban and rural areas. We have recently received a scoping study looking at alternative technologies to help tackle fuel poverty, which may be of particular benefit to those in rural areas and a working group has reported on the potential to extend the gas network.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Community Energy Programme is a &#163;50 million grant programme operational from 2002&#150;04 aiming to promote community heating in the UK, primarily through the use of CHP. It will install and refurbish community heating schemes, benefiting people on low incomes while contributing to the Climate Change Programme by reducing carbon emissions by an estimated 0.15 million tonnes of carbon a year.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Part L of the Building Regulations covering energy efficiency provisions was revised in October 2001 and the changes came into effect in 2002. These require work on new buildings and the refurbishment of the existing stock to conform to higher energy efficiency standards including those relating to building insulation, air tightness, lighting, space heating, hot water, boiler performance and replacement glazing. It is estimated that the package of measures introduced in October will reduce carbon emissions from the domestic sector by 0.8 million tonnes per year by 2010.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Treasury has recently introduced a VAT reduction on certain energy saving materials installed under grant schemes.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government have provided funding for the Energy Saving Trust (EST) to help individual households, local authorities and others improve domestic energy efficiency. Since 2000, EST has created the Practical Help advisory service, expanded its local authority support programme providing dedicated staff to 23 areas across the UK, introduced a new grant scheme for innovative projects and expanded its network of Energy Efficiency Advice Centres providing households with advice and support. EST has developed the Energy Efficiency Recommended (EER) labelling scheme (with energy efficiency manufacturers, retailers and installers) to provide easy identification of energy efficient products. EST has also developed EEI-the network of accredited installers in the insulation and heating industries.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the outcome was of the Environment Council on 10 December; what the Government's stance was on the issues discussed, including its voting record; and if she will make a statement.  [87183]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30204w06.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 I represented the UK at Environment Council on 9 December, accompanied by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment. This was the final Environment Council of the Danish Presidency. The Council reached agreement on four proposals and also considered a number of other important issues.
<P>

<a name="30204w06.html_para0">Political approval was given to a Regulation implementing the Rotterdam Convention on establishing a system of Prior Informed Consent for trade in hazardous substances, and also to a Decision to ratify the Convention.
<P>

<a name="30204w06.html_para1">The Council reached unanimous political agreement on the greenhouse gas Emissions Trading Directive. In negotiation the UK had secured a number of changes to meet our key requirements and I strongly supported this proposal, which gives further effect to the EU's strong commitment to action on climate change. The agreement includes an opt-out for the first phase in 2005&#150;07, which will assist the transition from established national emissions trading schemes such as we have in the UK into the EU scheme.
<P>

<a name="30204w06.html_para2">Political agreement was reached, by a qualified majority, on a Regulation on traceability and labelling of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). The package included elements already agreed in Agriculture and Fisheries Council (such as the inclusion of products derived from GMOs but including no detectable GM material and a 0.9 per cent. labelling threshold) for the parallel Regulation on food and feed, which I had voted against. Debate at Environment Council principally concerned the identification requirements for bulk shipments of GMOs in agricultural commodities. I argued that the requirement should be aligned to the language in the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, which creates an obligation to 



<P>
<P><I>4 Feb 2003 : Column 151W</I><P>
identify the GMOs a shipment "may contain". Most other member states were able to accept a wording requiring the identification of GMOs that "have been used" in shipments, which I regarded as unduly restrictive and impractical, and an insufficient reflection of the requirements of the Cartagena Protocol. My view was that the final package did not provide a sound basis for consumer choice, and was unworkable. I therefore voted against, as did the Netherlands, Denmark and Luxembourg, on different grounds.
<P>

<a name="30204w06.html_para3">Council Conclusions were adopted on the Community's Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides. The Conclusions recognised the importance of reducing the environmental impacts of pesticides and emphasised the principle of subsidiarity, calling for Community action to complement action at member state level.
<P>

<a name="30204w06.html_para4">The Council adopted Conclusions in advance of the UNEP Governing Council in February 2003. These highlighted the need for a strategic approach to international chemicals management.
<P>

<a name="30204w06.html_para5">Member states and other interested parties have been waiting for some time for firm proposals from the Commission for a legislative package on Chemicals. The Danish Presidency called a debate at Council around what it regarded as four key areas of the future chemicals strategy&#151;scope, sanctions, dealing with chemicals in products and handling small and medium sized enterprises and downstream users. There was a useful discussion and the Commission confirmed that it planned, as urged by the member states, to bring forward proposals as quickly as possible. The residency adopted Conclusions summarising the debate.
<P>

<a name="30204w06.html_para6">The Council also took note of progress reports on a proposal for a Regulation concerning monitoring of forests ("Forest Focus"), and on the draft Environmental Liability Directive. There were several difficult outstanding issues on the latter, which would be taken forward under the Greek Presidency.
<P>

<a name="30204w06.html_para7">The Council noted a Commission Communication entitled "Towards a strategy to protect and conserve the marine environment", advocating an ecosystem approach to managing the marine environment. The Danish Presidency gave a report of a marine environment conference held in Denmark in early December.
<P>

<a name="30204w06.html_para8">The Council also noted a presentation by the Commission on its proposal to amend the Bathing Water Directive, and a written presentation by the Commission of the recently adopted nuclear package, covering safety of facilities and management of radioactive waste.
<P>

<a name="30204w06.html_para9">Spain made a statement on the situation of the sunken oil tanker "Prestige" and its environmental impact on the Galician coast.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the impact which the proposed new EU public procurement directive would have on the Government's ability to choose between procurement bids offering timber from <i>(a)</i> legal and sustainable sources, <i>(b)</i> legal and progressing to sustainable sources and <i>(c)</i> legal sources.  [83931]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30204w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The use of three distinct variant specifications for timber and wood products was recommended in the report on the timber scoping study that was commissioned by Defra in October 2001 and is currently under consideration. The rationale for this proposal is: <i>(a)</i> to allow poor producer countries some opportunities to compete for UK Government business and <i>(b)</i> to guard against any shortfall in supply that might jeopardise essential Government operations. The use of variants is permitted by the existing EU public procurement supply directive and the position is not changed by the new procurement directive as currently drafted.
<P>

<a name="30204w06.html_para13">What the report commissioned by Defra proposes is that bids based on the variant specification for "legal and progressing towards sustainable" would only be considered in the absence of an acceptable bid based on the higher standard variant specification. Similarly bids based on "legal" timber would only be considered in the absence of acceptable offers based on either of the two higher standard variant specifications.
<P>

<a name="30204w06.html_para14">Contracting Authorities would have the option of declining all bids if they believe that inviting fresh tenders would result in acceptable bids for legal and sustainable timber. However, where operational demands rule out such a course of action, it is practicable to include a fall back position that allows buyers to consider bids against the lower variants. Central Government Departments will be advised that whenever they receive acceptable offers to supply legal and sustainable products they should reject bids based on lower standard variant specifications.




<P>
<P><I>4 Feb 2003 : Column 153W</I><P>

<a name="30204w06.html_para15">Public procurement directives require that contracts be awarded either to the lowest bid or to the bid that is most economically advantageous to the Contracting Authority. UK Government procurement policy is to select the most economically advantageous bid criterion because that provides true value for money in terms of quality and whole life costs. Quality in the context of timber procurement includes the standard of forest management. This means that preferring bids based on the top variant for "legal and sustainable" is consistent with both UK Government policy and EC Directives.

A notice was published in the <i>Official Journal</i> of the European Commission on 19 December announcing our intention to establish a contract for setting up a centre of procurement expertise to develop the practical implementation of variant specifications in line with those recommendations.(OJEC Ref (02/S246&#150;196464/EN).

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has to establish a Fair Price Commission to examine the distribution of profits in the agri-food sector; and if this can be brought about within existing legislative frameworks.  [88864]<P>

<P>
<a name="30204w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Director General of Fair Trading has powers under the Competition Act 1998 to investigate allegations of anti-competitive practice. But new legislation would be necessary to establish a statutory Price Commission, with powers to compel the industry to provide information, to undertake studies into the distribution of profits in the agri-food sector. The Government have no plans to establish a Fair Price Commission to examine the facts relating to the distribution of profits in the agri-food sector. The Government can commission less formal studies into such issues; for example, this is already being done in the milk sector by KPMG as part of a Milk Development Council (a Defra non-departmental public body) sponsored examination of UK milk prices and returns.

 Since the Environment Agency's report on High Level Target 1 was published in May 2002, a further 10 statements have been received by Defra. A number of statements were only sent to the Environment Agency and these are shown as received from EA. Also listed are a number of statements received by the Environment Agency but not yet copied to Defra. The Agency is due to provide a further update on the receipt of policy statements in spring 2003 and I will publish the report once it has been received.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps she plans to take to prevent a repeat of the recent floods in the lower Thames Valley.  [94612]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30204w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 31 January 2003]:</i> Operational responsibility for flood management measures rests with the local operating authorities, normally the Environment Agency (EA) and local councils, who decide which projects to promote and their timing.
<P>

<a name="30204w08.html_para3">I understand that the EA is already reviewing short-term actions such as encouraging residents to take up the flood warning service, providing advice on practical measures for people to protect themselves and their property, and ensuring that the Agency's Floodline service gives accurate and timely advice.

<P>

<a name="30204w08.html_para4">In addition, the EA will continue to promote a Flood Risk Management Plan for the area in partnership with local authorities and other organisations. Through the plan, the EA will seek to manage and reduce flood risk through the control of development in the flood plain, provide an enhanced flood warning strategy and deal with the longer term impacts of climate change. The EA is also reappraising options for flood alleviation measures in areas at risk of flooding.

<a name="30204w08.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Wilshire: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the role the Jubilee River scheme played in this month's floods in the lower Thames Valley.  [94614]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30204w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 31 January 2003]:</i> The Environment Agency's (EA) initial findings from measurements made from weir gauges is that there is no evidence that the Jubilee River has caused downstream

<P><I>4 Feb 2003 : Column 159W</I><P>
water levels to rise, and that in the recent flooding event, the rates of rise upstream and downstream of the Jubilee River were very comparable.
<P>

<a name="30204w08.html_para5">The EA has commissioned independent engineering consultants to rerun an updated hydraulic model using 2003 flood data to determine the impact on downstream flood levels. Their preliminary findings show no significant difference between downstream levels, with or without the flood alleviation channel, in the River Thames just downstream of where the Jubilee River rejoins it. I understand the EA plans to make this data and the analysis available to the public.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30204w08.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Wilshire: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what percentage of key flood defence systems in urban areas were in <i>(a)</i> good condition, or better and <i>(b)</i> poor condition, or worse on (i) 1 January 2001, (ii) 1 January 2002 and (iii) 1 January 2003.  [95345]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30204w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 3 February 2003]:</i> Flood defence assets are defined as one of two types, defences or structures and each type has been assessed separately. Defences are generally linear barriers such as embankments or walls etc. between the river (or sea) and the area defended while structures include outfalls, sluices, weirs or pumping stations.
<P>

<a name="30204w08.html_para6">Currently, the Environment Agency does not differentiate between urban and rural communities in line with Defra High Level Targets.
<P>

<a name="30204w08.html_para7">Tables 1 and 2 show the condition of the defences and structures respectively, assessed during the financial years 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02. There is no comparative data available at present from the inspections carried out during the current financial year, that data will be available by April 2003 to allow reporting of High Level Target 5 to Defra.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

The method used to identify the number of assets is flexible, allowing them to be classified as either a complete structure or as a number of components, this leads to apparent anomalies in the data reported. Work is being undertaken to ensure that by April 2003 reporting is fully consistent.<P>

The duration covered by the data set is too short to allow any meaningful analysis of any trends in changes to the condition of assets. In addition, there are variations in the way that the data has been collected that are still being resolved, in effect the data set is still being "bedded down" and any apparent trends are as likely to 



be as a result of changes to the data as to changes to the defences and structures. It could be a number of years before meaningful trends start to emerge from the data.<P>

 Following the new year floods the Environment Agency have conducted numerous internal reviews concerning their flood warning and operational roles. The agency have also attended reviews held and have meetings programmed with other operating authorities to take supervisory duty matters further. The outcomes of and actions from these meetings will, where appropriate, be taken forward and used to improve the service offered during a flood event.
<P>

<a name="30204w09.html_para0">In terms of post event activity, the Environment Agency have had aerial photography and level survey returned, this will feed into mapping and flood defence improvements studies, as well as help review flood warning trigger levels.

<a name="30204w09.html_para1">The agency have also requested (and are in the process of receiving back) information from affected parish councils and professional partners (police, IDBs etc.).

<P>
<P>
<a name="30204w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 It has long been recognised that traditional urban development has an impact on downstream flood flows, typically reducing the time between the rainfall event and the peak flow in the river. This is, for example, incorporated in standard procedures for flood risk assessment set out in the Flood Estimation Handbook produced by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology with the support of extensive research funded by the Department. It is for this reason that PPG25 promotes the use of sustainable drainage systems for new development that aim to mitigate such impacts. The Environment Agency, as a statutory consultee to the planning authorities, is committed to ensuring that new development adopts such measures, where appropriate, to minimise impact on river levels and flood risk.
<P>

<a name="30204w09.html_para2">In Bedfordshire, the Environment Agency in conjunction with partner organisations is actively involved in the Milton Keynes surface water drainage strategy (River Great Ouse and tributaries, upstream of Bedfordshire). It has also been in partnership with other

<P>
<a name="30204w09.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 3 February 2003]:</i> The Environment Agency's maps show that 11,694 properties fall within the 1 per cent. probability or 1 in 100 years flood return period in the Spelthorne flood plain. These maps show the indicative floodplain area, not flood risk or definitive flood boundaries, and are based on land topography taking noaccount of the defences which are in place. The Environment Agency, with Defra funding, is creating more refined maps which will take account of likely depth of flooding and also current and planned flood defences. Pilot maps for four areas should be available soon with complete coverage planned for later in the year. To support this improved understanding of flood risk on a national basis, the EA are also developing a National Flood and Coastal Defence Database, again with funding from Defra. The aim of the project is to provide a single, easily accessible definitive store for all data on flood and coastal defences.
<P>

<a name="30204w09.html_para4">The Flood Warning service provides 100 per cent. coverage in Spelthorne, through Floodline, the internet and the media. At present 99 properties in Spelthorne Borough have been offered the Environment Agency's automatic voice messaging service to receive flood warnings direct to their telephones.

 The assessment is in progress. The UK is the lead competent authority for this application from Monsanto under Directive 2001/18 on the release of GMOs to the environment. Monsanto has applied for consent to import into the European Community this GM maize grain for use as or in food and feed products. The application is for import only and does not cover proposed cultivation uses. The UK authorities are required to assess whether the GMO in question should be placed on the European Community market and, if so, under what conditions. If the UK authorities form the view that the application does comply with Directive 2001/18, other member states and the European Commission will then have the opportunity to comment on the assessment or raise reasoned objections as regards possible risks to the environment or human health. The assessment will be made available to the public. No decision on the placing of the product on the market can be made until other member states and the Commission have given their views.

 I announced on 17 October 2002 that there would be no change to the packaging waste recycling targets in the UK for 2003. Before the decision was taken to leave the targets unchanged, we consulted with other departments, including the DTI, Cabinet Office and the Treasury. We are required to hold a public consultation only if changes are being proposed to the Regulations. The decision to make no changes to the targets was taken largely because we did not know what targets the new EC Directive is going to set, nor to what deadline. Under these circumstances, I was unwilling to go into a consultation which would have meant 2003 targets being announced well into 2003.
<P>

<a name="30204w10.html_para5">We have received a number of letters from British Glass regarding the effects of leaving the targets unchanged on the PRN market. Concern was also voiced at the December meeting of the compliance scheme body (CoSWiG) which I attended.
<P>

<a name="30204w10.html_para6">We expect the level of recycling to rise slightly in 2003, consistent with the increase in the amount of packaging in the waste stream, but it could be greater if additional obligated businesses are identified. Estimates of available capacity, and of PRN prices, are affected, too, by an ongoing examination of whether reprocessing claimed so far in 2002 relates exclusively to packaging waste, and as to how far other factors have a significant influence. It is also expected that industry will be focussing in 2003 on starting the process necessary to have the requisite collection capacity in place in 2004&#150;05. Inaction now will make the period 2004&#150;08 more difficult. We expect to consult later this year on business targets in the packaging Regulations for the period 2004&#150;08, or at least on targets for three years, to be rolled forward. It will be important for industry to set action in hand now if they are to have the necessary infrastructure in place to meet what are certainly higher targets in this period.

<a name="30204w11.html_para2">Several studies have been published which attempt to value the environmental costs and benefits of different waste management options. It is difficult to make comparison between these studies, as they adopt different assumptions about technology used, emissions factors, environmental impact of emissions and economic values of environmental impacts. They do not all have the same coverage of environmental impact and some emissions and impacts are omitted due to absent data. Some studies do not adequately report the uncertainty in their estimates of environmental costs, and these are likely to be significant.
<P>

<a name="30204w11.html_para3">Most of the work done so far looks at single waste management options (ETU 1996), single materials (BNMA 1995), or compares the environmental costs of incineration and landfill (CSERGE 1993). Only one major study (Coopers and Lybrand 1997) compares incineration, landfill and recycling the different fractions of MSW. The result of these studies generally support the view that recycling has net environmental benefits over incineration and landfill (with the possible exception of certain materials, such as plastic film). The results of the Coopers and Lybrand (1997) study are shown in the table (Table C4, options with negative external cost have net environmental benefits). However, these estimates seem to omit the costs of leachate from landfills, all disamenity costs and some of the environmental costs of processing for recycling.

<a name="30204w11.html_para5">CSERGE (1993) suggests that existing rural landfill sites without energy recovery may have net external costs of between &#163;1.09 and &#163;10.90 per tonne (1999 prices). These estimates exclude disamenity costs which the study suggests could be significant. The same study suggests that urban incinerators with energy recovery may have net external benefits up to &#163;15.20 per tonne, through to a net environmental cost &#163;4.10 per tonne (1999 prices). However, this does not reflect potential disamenity impacts and it assumes that the electricity generated displaces in that of a coal-fired power station.
<P>

<a name="30204w11.html_para6">These estimates of external costs should be viewed with caution, due to the level of uncertainty in quantifying and valuing impacts, particularly those on human health. However they do provide an indication of the relative impacts of different waste management options&#151;while recognising that the external costs per tonne of waste may vary according to location and the quantity of waste sent to each option.

 As disclosed in the departmental minute of 17 December 2002, there is a group of warranties for which Ministry of Defence has a maximum liability equivalent to the cash proceeds received in relation to the transaction. The precise value of these proceeds will not be confirmed until after the completion accounts have been finalised, but is currently forecast to be &#163;140 to &#163;150 million. In setting MOD's maximum liability to the purchaser, we have deducted the &#163;50 million already received as part of the PPP process, as this was a previous payment made directly to MOD by QinetiQ.
<P>

<a name="30204w11.html_para8">In addition, as set out in the departmental minute, MOD has given further indemnities for which the maximum possible exposure is as follows:

 It is standard practice, when deploying with the United States or other allied forces, to engage in thorough consultation and planning to ensure that clear and reliable Combat Identification measures are prepared. The House of Commons Committee of Public Accounts published a report in 2002 on Combat Identification in which they said in relation to our deployment last year to Afghanistan with US forces:
<P>

<a name="30204w12.html_para4">"The Ministry of Defence has taken care when deploying troops to Afghanistan to ensure that the risk of fratricide was minimised through dialogue with American forces regarding tactics, techniques and procedures. Liaison through the two countries enables the respective chains of command to define areas where respective forces operate and to determine how the global positioning system is operated. There is scope for similar dialogue with countries other than the United States for other operations." (56th Report 2001&#150;02 para 14).
<P>

<a name="30204w12.html_para5">In relation to possible operations in the Gulf, we are working closely with allies to establish robust arrangements on Combat Identification that maximise interoperability and we will acquire additional equipment in time for any potential conflict to enable our forces to operate effectively alongside coalition forces.

 Ministry of Defence officials have frequent contact with their counterparts in the US Department of Defense on combat identification, which serves, to improve combat effectiveness and minimise the risk of fratricide. Discussions on combat identification have also recently taken place with the US and with other NATO allies in NATO's Identification Sub-Committee 7, which last met on 15&#150;17 January 2003, and in the context of the 5-Power National Armament Directors International Co-operative Opportunities Group (comprising France, Germany, Italy, UK, US), which last met on 13&#150;14 January 2003.

In addition, during 1992 HMS Sheffield underwent a planned docking period for routine repair work. While the exact cost of the period is no longer available, it is estimated that it would have cost some &#163;5 million to &#163;6 million, based on other similar work at the time. In 1996, HMS Sheffield underwent a major refit at a cost of about &#163;15.9 million. This was her last major upkeep period.

<a name="30204w13.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 All members of the Territorial Army may be called out when a call-out order made under the Reserve Forces Act 1996 is in force. However, it is Ministry of Defence policy that members of the Territorial Army whose reserve liabilities predate the Reserve Forces Act 1996 are only called out if they had a liability under a corresponding power in the Reserve Forces Act 1980 unless they voluntarily elected to assume the liabilities of the 1996 Act.
<P>

<a name="30204w13.html_para0">Five call-out orders are currently in force. Of these, three were made under Section 54 of the Reserve Forces Act 1996 and two were made under Section 56 of that Act. The corresponding power to Section 54 was Section of the 11 Reserve Forces Act 1980. The majority of members of the Territorial Army had a liability under that section and are therefore liable to be called out. However, there is no call-out power in the 1980 Act which corresponds to section 56 of the 1996 Act. Therefore reservists whose liabilities predate the Reserve Forces Act 1996 and who did not voluntarily elect to assume the liabilities under that Act are not called out under that section.

 The European Commission published in November 2001 a notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities, alerting EC importers of the ineligibility of products originating from settlements in the occupied territories for preferences provided for by the EU/lsrael Association Agreement. Along with customs authorities in other Community member states, Customs and Excise are selecting for verification those imports where preference has been claimed under the terms of the Agreement but where there is evidence that the goods are likely to have been produced in the Occupied Territories. Security for duty is being taken on such imports while verification enquiries are undertaken. Customs require payment of duty if they do not receive adequate confirmation that goods originated in Israel itself.

 Ministers have made a clear commitment to a fair tax system, and they keep all aspects of it, including stamp duty rates and thresholds, under regular review.

He also noted that the composition of a board sends important signals about the values of the company. A commitment to equal opportunities is inevitably undermined, he argued, if the board itself does not follow the same guiding principles. He recommended that there should be a formal, rigorous and transparent process for the appointment of new directors to the boards of listed companies. Companies would need to set out the process used, and explain if external advice or open advertising has not been used. At the start of an appointment process, the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the board should be evaluated and a description of the role and capabilities prepared for a particular appointment. These will be incorporated in a revised combined code applying to listed companies.

<a name="30204w16.html_para1">He also made various proposals to widen the pool from which non-executive directors are drawn, which in many cases would bring in more women. These include more executive directors and senior executives from other companies and directors of private companies, as well as advisers and those from other backgrounds. A small group of business leaders and others will be set up, led by Laura Tyson, Dean of London Business School, to bring to greater prominence candidates from the non-commercial sector. This will describe the profile of relevant skills and experience that make an effective non-executive director with such a background and a list will be developed of around 100 individuals. As women are more strongly represented at senior levels in the non-commercial sector, the expected outcome would be that a significant proportion would be female. The group will report to me in May.
<P>

<a name="30204w16.html_para2">He also noted that areas where women tend to be more strongly represented are in roles such as human resources, change management and customer care which are not regarded as traditional routes to the board. Yet the issues dealt with in such roles, and the skills needed, are important ones for the board, and he hoped that in future boards would draw more actively from these groups.
<P>

<a name="30204w16.html_para3">The Government welcomed Derek Higgs' recommendations. We will be looking to listed companies to put them into early effect as they make changes to their boards. I also hope that shareholders will play their part in pressing to ensure meritocracy and diversity in appointments to boards.

We are also investing in teachers' personal access to computers&#151;the total budget has risen from &#163;100 million to &#163;300 million, and the programme's duration from two years to four years, providing over 300,000 laptops.

<a name="30204w20.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 Respect for human rights and democratic principles constitute an essential element of the EU-Israel Association Agreement, and all other such agreements between the EU and Mediterranean countries, including the Palestinian Authority. The EU has used this as a vehicle to raise human rights as part of its political dialogue with Israel. The UK joined with other member states at the EU-Israel Association Council on 21 October 2002 in making clear its concerns about human rights and the deteriorating situation in the Palestinian territories and has continued to raise human rights issues in bilateral contacts with Israel.

 We are raising the attack on Beam, in Liberia, with the UN Secretariat. The main aim of the attack seems to have been looting connected to the conflict in Cote d'lvoire. It is unclear who orchestrated the attack but Liberian and Ivorian groups have been accused of involvement. We remain concerned about reports of Liberian involvement in the rebellion in Cote d'lvoire and at the ease with which armed groups can pass across the border.

<a name="30204w20.html_para0">The Government of Liberia continues to ignore the demands of the UN Security Council by sponsoring armed groups in the region. Our aim remains to contain these activities by maintaining effective UN sanctions against Liberia.

 The term "Rogue State" was first used by the Clinton Administration in the US to describe states which were pursuing illicit programmes to develop weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and those which the US Administration considered posed a threat to the US.

<a name="30204w21.html_para4">The reform of the licensing laws that the Licensing Bill will introduce were the subject of a White Paper consultation in 2000. The White Paper was published following a review of current licensing laws that involved all key stakeholders including the licensed trade, the police and local authorities. 1,215 individuals and organisations responded to the White Paper, including many members of the public. The majority of responses were in favour of the proposed reforms.
<P>

<a name="30204w21.html_para5">In addition to publishing Explanatory Notes with the Licensing Bill, the Government will be issuing guidance to licensing authorities and the police when the Bill receives Royal Assent. A draft version of the guidance will be made available before the Bill reaches Report Stage in the House of Lords. The guidance will explain in clear terms how the new licensing system will work and, like the Bill, is being prepared in consultation with other Government Departments, executive agencies and an Advisory Group comprising representatives of the following organisations:

<P>
<a name="30204w22.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 In developing the proposals in the Licensing Bill the Government were careful to ensure that it included appropriate exemptions in relation to the provision of entertainment, including live music, for any faith when they are engaged in worship or any form of religious meeting. The Bill as drafted draws a distinction, however, between the provision of secular entertainment in a place of public religious worship and entertainment which is provided there for, or incidental to, a religious service or meeting. The Government are aware of the concerns that have been expressed about the licensing of secular entertainment in places of public religious worship and we have discussed possible solutions with faith organisations. An amendment extending the exemption to the provision of any entertainment or entertainment facilities at a place of public religious worship has been tabled for consideration at Report stage in another place.
<P>

<a name="30204w22.html_para0">Under the Bill as presently drafted, carol singing as part of, or incidental to, a religious service or meeting would not be licensable as the exemption in paragraph 9 of Schedule 1 to the Bill would apply. This exemption relates to the activity, not the place, and therefore applies irrespective of the venue. However, if a carol concert were held not as part of, or incidental to, a religious service or meeting it would be licensable and authorisation would be needed either under a premises licence or a temporary event notice. As noted above, an amendment has been tabled for consideration at Report stage in another place.
<P>

<a name="30204w22.html_para1">Bell ringing would not be licensable under the Bill if it were part of, or incidental to, a religious service or meeting. Further, if bell ringing is undertaken as a hobby or for practice, it would not be licensable because it would not be being provided for the public. However, if a bell ringing concert is put on for the public and it is not part of a religious meeting or service, then it would be licensable under the Bill as drafted. As already noted, an amendment has been tabled for consideration at Report stage in another place.
<P>

<a name="30204w22.html_para2">Under the current law, live music is licensable in community centres and village and parish halls.Outside Greater London these venues enjoy an exemption from fees in respect of public entertainment. Under the Bill, fees will be set centrally by the Secretary of State in regulations and the Government have announced their intention to exempt church halls, chapel halls or other similar buildings occupied in connection with a place of public religious worship, and village halls, parish or community halls or other similar buildings from the fees associated with the provision of entertainment under the licensing regime.
<P>

<a name="30204w22.html_para3">The Government do not anticipate that the Licensing Bill will cause any adverse impact on the ability of churches and village halls to host community events involving live music, and in fact believe that the new system of premises licences and temporary event notices will be simpler for applicants than the current regime. No specific estimates were made of the costs that would be incurred by churches and village halls in North Yorkshire. However, a Regulatory Impact Assessment was published with the Bill.




<P>

<P>

<a name="30204w22.html_para4">As the Bill is currently drafted, a Christian musical staged in a church or a church hall would not be licensable if it were provided for the purposes of, or for purposes incidental to, a religious meeting or service, but it would otherwise be licensable.

 No costs will be incurred by churches and village halls in North Staffordshire for the provision of regulated entertainment or entertainment facilities under the proposals of the Licensing Bill.
<P>

<a name="30204w22.html_para5">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made a statement to the House on 3 February 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 7WS-8WS setting out the conclusions of our consideration of the provision of entertainment and entertainment facilities in places of religious worship and village halls under the Licensing Bill. The Government have now tabled an amendment to the Bill that would exempt secular entertainment provided in places of public religious worship and the provision of entertainment facilities in such places from the need to obtain a licence under the Bill when it is enacted. Music for the purposes of or incidental to a religious service or meeting will remain exempt.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what eligibility criteria were employed by the New Opportunities Fund when allocating National Lottery money earmarked for children's hospices; which hospices applied to the New Opportunities Fund for a share in the allocation; which hospices were successful; how much each hospice was allocated; and which hospices were declined funding and on what grounds.  [95427]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30204w22.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Applicant organisations must have had a hospice building; have been providing hospice services for children including in-patient services; and must have been registered with the Charity Commission with the word 'hospice' included in the registered name or with the 'relief of sickness' included as a charitable objective. An applicant organisation had to meet all these eligibility criteria to be considered for funding against a further set of published assessment criteria. Full details of all published assessment criteria is available from the New Opportunities Fund.
<P>

<a name="30204w22.html_para7">With the funding available the Fund was able to fund 23 applications. The following table gives details of the awards.
<P>

<a name="30204w22.html_para8">Three hospice applications were not successful because they failed fully to meet either the programme's eligibility or assessment criteria. The Fund's policy is that, to protect the confidentiality of unsuccessful applicants, feedback on individual bids is not made public unless the organisation concerned gives its express approval.

 The Regional Tourist Boards are independent companies which produce annual reports on their activities. The North West Tourist Board's (NWTB) report details activities carried out with or on behalf of local authority members including Lancashire and its districts. Work undertaken by the NWTB on behalf of the industry is supported by local authority, businesses and other organisation's subscriptions. Membership benefits for local authorities include networking and support for tourist information centres, assistance with tourism strategy and guidance, dissemination of research and best practice and regular liaison with local authority departments, including tourism, planning and economic development. For private sector members, NWTB facilitates marketing opportunities, a range of member benefits and tourism business support. Both public and private sector funding contributes to the NWTBs operations and complements funding from the North West Development Agency (NWDA) and the English Tourism Council.
<P>

<a name="30204w23.html_para0">The NWTB are currently working closely with the NWDA in the production of a Vision Document for Tourism in the next 5&#150;10 years.

<a name="30204w26.html_para0">The MRC spent &#163;1.4 million in 2001&#150;02 on research relevant to motor neurone disease (MND) and on basic work on the function of motor neurones.

 The Government has followed the case of Mr Crew and understands the suffering of many who have a terminal illness and those who care for them. It is right that dying patients should be relieved of suffering through the provision of adequate care and support.

<i>[holding answer 28 January 2003]:</i> The Government are implementing a range of measures to improve recruitment and retention of all staff, including speech therapists. These include an increase in pay, encouraging the national health service to become a better employer through the Improving Working Lives and Positively Diverse programmes, increasing training commissions, reducing student attrition, running national and local recruitment and return to practice campaigns and supporting international recruitment where appropriate.

 Given the trans-national nature of tobacco, we believe that much of the work of a tobacco regulatory authority is best carried out at a European level. There are therefore no plans to establish such an authority at present in the United Kingdom. The Government will, however, keep this situation under review.
<P>

<a name="30204w27.html_para8">In the meantime, the Government is committed to regulating tobacco and recently introduced legislation to transpose the Manufacture, Presentation and Sale of Tobacco Products Directive (2001/37/EC). This new legislation will require greater information on the content, emissions and effects of tobacco to be displayed on packets of tobacco; and information on the ingredients and additives in tobacco products and their purpose and effect to be disclosed to Government.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what criteria his Department has for identifying whistleblowing inside the health service; and what mechanisms are in place for a whistleblower, whose case has been dismissed by a trust, to have his case examined by the Department.  [94935]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30204w28.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Government expect a climate of openness and dialogue in the national health service that encourages staff to feel able to raise concerns about health care matters sensibly and responsibly without fear of victimisation.
<P>

<a name="30204w28.html_para0">On 27 August 1999, the Department of Health issued new guidance in Health Service Circular 1999/198, "The Public Interest Disclosure Act: Whistleblowing in the NHS", to all NHS trusts and health authorities. The HSC advises that all NHS trusts and health authorities are expected to issue guidance to staff so that they know how to raise concerns in a reasonable and responsible way. The Department's policy is that, wherever possible, concerns raised by staff should be dealt with locally in accordance with local policies and procedures on whistleblowing, so that problems can be addressed quickly. However, there have been cases where whistleblowers have considered the local response inadequate, and, as a consequence, have sought to raise their concerns with the Department. At present, these cases would be examined by the relevant Directorate of Health and Social Care, on behalf of the Department.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what recent assessment his Department has made of the effects on the regeneration of North Greenwich of the Millennium Dome; and if he will make a statement.  [94478]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30204w28.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 One of the stated objectives of the Millennium Experience was to support the regeneration efforts on the Greenwich Peninsula. English Partnerships' acquisition of land on the Greenwich Peninsula for the Millennium celebrations has so far resulted in: reclamation of 289 acres of despoiled land; installation of servicing and public access across the land; private investment of over &#163;400 million in the Millennium Village, a new cinema, retail and hotel developments on the Peninsula; the provision of a new school and health centre; 50 acres of new parkland, a new ecology park and yacht club, and over 12,000 trees planted. The Village will ultimately have some 1,400 homes, 300 of which have been completed so far: 20 per cent. will be affordable.




<P>
<P><I>4 Feb 2003 : Column 231W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30204w28.html_para1">A study commissioned by the New Millennium Experience Company, English Partnerships and the London borough of Greenwich in 1999 found that the preparation for and running of the Millennium celebrations at the Dome led to the creation of 7,700 jobs in construction, 5,300 jobs in management and operation of the Dome. In addition, of the &#163;500 million worth of contracts let for the Dome, companies in Greenwich won &#163;44.7 million.
<P>

<a name="30204w28.html_para2">These developments and activities have helped narrow the gap between the unemployment rate in Greenwich and the rate in London from 2.9 per cent. in April 1993 to 1.0 per cent. in November 2002.
<P>

<a name="30204w28.html_para3">The regeneration momentum is being maintained, and will be boosted further on the Peninsula by the deal signed by English Partnerships on 29 May 2002, under which Meridian Delta Ltd and Anschutz Entertainment Group are committed to investing &#163;200 million in the Dome. MDL expects the total investment in the development on the Greenwich Peninsula to be up to &#163;4 billion. The development is expected to deliver around 20,000 full-time equivalent jobs.
<P>

<a name="30204w28.html_para4">The deal is subject primarily to planning permission. An application for planning permission was submitted to Greenwich Council on 23 December 2002, for a new 26,000 capacity arena inside the Dome, with associated leisure, entertainment, retail, exhibition and community uses in and around the Dome; over 10,000 homes on the Peninsula of which a substantial number will be affordable; 3.5 million sq. ft. of commercial development; and associated infrastructure and public open space. An interim base-line study and evaluation published by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions in 2000 confirmed that the Peninsula developments were acting as a catalyst for regeneration in Greenwich and the Thames Gateway, and that the developments demonstrated best practice in terms of sustainable development. It is intended to follow up that research with a further evaluation and long-term monitoring of the Peninsula regeneration.

The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will continue to work with the fire service to achieve a work force that better reflects the communities it serves; to help the service remove barriers to creating a more diverse workforce and to assist in raising the profile of the service as a career choice within currently under-represented groups.

This repeal would remove the requirement for fire authorities to seek approval of my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister before making any reduction, no matter how minor, in the number of firefighting posts or appliances, or before closing a fire station. We do not believe that in a modern fire service my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister should take these decisions.

<a name="30204w28.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B>

<P>
<a name="30204w28.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B>

The amendments to the 1996 Act which came into force on 31 January 2003, include a provision to make it easier for housing authorities to offer housing applicants a choice of accommodation, whether they live within or outside that local authority area. This includes people who are unintentionally homeless and in priority need who must be given reasonable preference under a housing authority's allocation scheme.

achieved; adopt a portfolio approach to assessing quality of service; ensure that reliable information is available and regularly monitored to give assurance that services are delivered cost effectively; manage call centre resources to handle peaks and troughs in the volume of calls; and provide better information for the public on the services which they can obtain by telephone.
<P>

<a name="30204w29.html_para5">The Department welcomes this report. As far as the specific recommendations are concerned:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>DWP accepts the need for a robust business case covering the development of all new centres and for effective planning and monitoring to ensure that the expected benefits are actually realised. The Department has established new governance procedures to ensure that modernisation projects only proceed to the next stage of development if an appropriate business case, including appropriate plans for realising benefits, is in place.
<P>
<BR>
DWP accepts the portfolio approach to measuring the quality of service it provides from its centres. We already use a variety of measures (cost, efficiency, customer service etc) but are always looking for ways to improve our measures. In particular our central Contact Centre Advisory Team are currently developing proposals for measuring customer satisfaction in a way that gives quicker feedback to our centre managers. We expect this new methodology to be ready for piloting in the summer of 2003.
<P>
<BR>
All new DWP centres are being developed using modern IT designed to give managers at all levels a wide range of information about the cost and effectiveness of the service provided. Managers are being trained, in understanding the data they receive and acting on it to improve performance. Some of our existing centres operate on old IT that does not give access to as much information as we would like, for these centres we will update their technology as and when opportunities arise.
<P>
<BR>
All new DWP centres are being established with appropriate work force management software. Several of our older centres lack this software. Our central Contact Centre Advisory Team have recently secured funding for a project to provide this software to the older centres that don't currently have it, this project is due to complete its work in September 2003.
<P>
<BR>
DWP routinely publicises details of its services in telephone directories, on leaflets and letters and on its website.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30204w29.html_para6">DWP is keen to develop and improve the service it gives its customers. With that in mind we have become foundation partners of the Call Centre Association and our central advisory team, working closely with the CCA, have developed a good practice framework for DWP centres and are developing the process through which our centres will be able to secure professional accreditation.

<a name="30204w30.html_para1">It is estimated that there are 8,582,200 disabled adults in Great Britain (aged 16+). This estimate is based on a survey published in 1999 <sup>1</sup> , and it is therefore not possible to calculate the proportion of disabled people receiving DLA in 1997 and 2002 from this information, as the data are not comparable. The survey estimated that 34 per cent. of disabled people had a disability related to hearing.
<P>

<a name="30204w30.html_para2">It should be noted that entitlement to Disability Living Allowance is based on the extent to which a severely disabled person requires attention, supervision or watching over by another person and/or has walking difficulties as a result of their disabilities, and not on the disabilities themselves. In addition, the majority of people who are hard of hearing are over the age of 65. People who become disabled after reaching age 65 claim Attendance Allowance instead of Disability Living Allowance. For these reasons, there is no meaningful correlation between the numbers of disabled and deaf people in Great Britain and the numbers receiving Disability Living Allowance.

 Support, including accommodation, comes to an end once a final decision is made on the claim except in the case of asylum seeking families with children under 18. In such cases where support ends, the former asylum seeker will be given notice to leave the premises at which they are residing by the accommodation provider. For those former asylum seekers who have received positive decisions on their claim, accommodation providers are expected to assist with issues such as access to the main benefits system and long-term housing.
<P>

<a name="30204w31.html_para9">Asylum seekers may choose to leave their NASS (National Asylum Support Service) provided accommodation before a final decision has been made on their claim.

 [<i>holding answer 3 February 2003</i>]: Payment of financial support via the application registration card (ARC) began on 5 August 2002. To date over 37,000 main applicants (50 per cent of the total of main applicants supported) are using their ARC as a means of payment. The transfer to payments using an ARC are being introduced on a phased basis and we are aiming to complete the transition by the Spring of this year. Until the transfer is complete some asylum seekers will continue to receive their support on presentation of a personal Receipt Book at their designated Post Office. Making payments via an ARC provide a more secure method of payment. The process requires Post Office counter staff to undertake a photo Identity check which is proving to be an effective control. The system also allows for detailed electronic records of all transactions including the location, time and nature of every transaction (whether successful or unsuccessful).

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his answer of 27 January, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 705&#150;7W, how many fraud investigations were undertaken prior to April 2002, and what the outcomes were; and if he will make a statement about the arrangements to prevent asylum support fraud since the establishment of NASS in April 2000.

<i>[holding answer 3 February 2003]:</i> The National Asylum Support Services (NASS) became operational on 3 April 2000. Between that date and 31 March 2002 NASS investigated 1,467 suspected cases of fraud. NASS did not begin to keep a central record of the outcome of investigations until June 2001. Between June 2001 and 31March 2002, 176 support claimants had their NASS support terminated following a fraud investigation.
<P>

<a name="30204w32.html_para1">NASS Investigations Section was formed in October 2000 and became fully operational until May 2001. In addition to investigating referrals the Section conducts visits (both announced and unannounced) to supported asylum seekers to establish continued eligibility for support and also works with other government departments to tackle fraud. This work will be devolved to NASS regional offices as part of the current regionalisation programme.
<P>

<a name="30204w32.html_para2">The introduction of Application Registration Cards (ARCs) containing photographs and biometric data is aimed at further reducing the opportunities for fraud.

<a name="30204w33.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Recorded crime figures include statistics on drugs offences, such as possession, and on acquisitive crimes, such as burglary, but do not record whether the latter are related to an offender's drug habits.
<P>

<a name="30204w33.html_para0">However, the New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (NEW-ADAM) research programme, which involves interviewing and drug testing those arrested by the police, confirms a link between drug misuse and crime, although the conclusions do not relate specifically to Lincolnshire. Analysis of the data from the first eight sites in the survey, collected during 1999&#150;2000, shows that 65 per cent. of arrestees provided a urine sample that tested positive for one or more illegal drug. The analysis also shows that up to 29 per cent. of arrestees tested positive for opiates (including heroin) and/or cocaine (including crack).
<P>

<a name="30204w33.html_para1">As a guide to the proportion of crime that is drug-related, analysis of the NEW-ADAM self-report data indicates that whilst only 21 per cent. of non-drug using arrestees reported having previously offended in the past 12 months, this figure rises to 75 per cent. for those arrestees who use heroin and/or cocaine/crack. Moreover, whilst users of both heroin and cocaine/crack represented just under one-quarter of all arrestees interviewed, they were responsible for more than three-fifths of all the illegal income reported.
<P>

<a name="30204w33.html_para2">In support of this, 55 per cent. of arrestees who reported using one or more drugs in the last 12 months and committing one or more acquisitive crimes acknowledged a link between their drug use and their offending behaviour. This proportion rose to 78 per cent. for arrestees who said they had used heroin and cocaine/crack.

 Prison officers involved in the teaching of vocational qualifications receive a specialist allowance of &#163;1,200 a year. There are no direct promotion incentives for prison officers to assist prisoners in obtaining qualifications or in improving their emotional and parenting skills. However, a number of personal development opportunities are available. Prison officers undertake the Custodial Care National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) which includes optional units that measure competence in areas such as assisting in the provision of emotional and parenting skills. The Prison Service is considering linking attainment of the NVQ to the promotion process.

 It is for the courts to decide in indidual cases whether a prison sentence is appropriate. However, custodial sentences should be used for dangerous violent and sexual offenders and those who persistently offend or commit serious offences. Protecting the public is a priority and these offenders should go to prison for as long as public protection requires. Whether a custodial or community sentence is given it is important that rehabilitative processes are followed to address the causes of offenders' behaviour and to break the cycle of repeat offending.

<a name="30204w34.html_para1">For young offenders the Government has introduced a range of credible community options including Electronically monitored curfew orders for 10&#150;15 year olds and Electronic tagging for 12&#150;16 year olds on bail and local authority remand. The Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programme (ISSP) is a recently introduced programme to tackle persistent and serious young offenders as an alternative to custodial sentences or secure remands. Targeting the 3 per cent. of young offenders estimated to be responsible for 25 per cent. of youth crime, it is the most rigorous non-custodial intervention available for young offenders, providing the courts with a credible alternative to custody.
