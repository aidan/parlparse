As reported by the NAO in their 1998 report into the sale of the dockyards, DML were subsequently required to implement a number of changes in order to satisfy the Department that they were adequately resourced and structured. These conditions were met and the changes in structure, processes and systems implemented by DML were instrumental in ensuring that key facilities were ready in time for the start of HMS Vanguard&#039;s overhaul in 2002.

 The latest (2000) figures from the Avian Population Estimates Panel suggest a GB buzzard population of between 36,000 and 51,000 pairs. The latest (2000) figures from the Breeding Birds Survey/Common Birds Census suggest a GB house sparrow population of between 2,300,000 and 4,100,000 birds. There are no annual counts, but buzzard population trends in the UK between 1994 and 2004 show a 53 per cent. increase, while house sparrow trends were down by 3 per cent. In England over the same period, buzzard populations show a 79 per cent. increase with house sparrow trends down by 10 per cent.

<sup>(6)</sup>The figures for 2002/03 onwards are on a different basis from those for earlier years, so are not directly comparable with the figures up to 2001/02. The figures from 2002/03 onwards are more comprehensive as they include some institutions (such as specialist designated institutions) previously excluded from statistical publications, and also take into account changes to funding arrangements made by the LSC since taking over responsibility for FE funding. The impact of these changes is estimated to have increased overall learner numbers by around 250,000 between 2001/02 and 2002/03, but the effect on numbers of LLDD in particular has not been estimated.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what factors were taken into account in making the decision to reduce the annual cash growth allocated to the further education sector for 2005/06 in the Government spending review.  [17923]</p>








<p><a name="st_104"><a name="51017w11.html_spnew2"><b> Bill Rammell: </b> 
 Funding for the further education (FE) sector is not being reduced. We are putting more money than ever into further education. Total funding for the FE sector will increase by over &#163;1 billion in 2005/06 compared to 2002/03&#151;a 25 per cent. increase.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51017w11.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_69">The Department allocates funds for education and training in the post-16 learning and skills sector to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) through our annual grant letter. Funding allocations for FE providers increased by 16.3 per cent. between 2002/03 and 2003/04, by 9.1 per cent. between 2003/04 and 2004/05, and by 4.4 per cent. between 2004/05 and 2005/06.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51017w11.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_70">The particularly large increase in 2003&#150;04 is a result of the consolidation of previously targeted funds, and the extra investment through Success for All. All colleges received increases in core funding rates of 2.5 per cent. above inflation in 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06, with some colleges receiving even higher increases. The relatively lower increase in 2005&#150;06 is still significantly higher than inflation and in part reflects actual learner numbers in colleges as compared to plans, and the Government&#039;s intention&#151;as set out in the Skills Strategy and reaffirmed in the Skills White Paper: Getting on in Business, Getting on in Work&quot;&#151;to rebalance over time the contributions of the state, employers and individuals towards the costs of learning. This was reflected in a 2.5 percentage point increase in the assumed fee contribution to the cost of learning for those learners not in national entitlement groups. Even so, this resulted in seven out of 10 colleges receiving an above inflation increase in budget&#151;almost half of them getting an increase of over 5 per cent.

Notes:<br>

1.Includes planned expenditure on the provision for pupils with statements and the provision for non-statemented pupils with SEN, support for inclusion, inter authority recoupment, fees for pupils at independent special schools and abroad, educational psychology service, local authority functions in relation to child protection, therapies and other health related services, parent partnership, guidance and information, the monitoring of SEN provision and inclusion administration, assessment and co-ordination. Also included is the funding delegated to nursery, primary and secondary schools identified as notional SEN&quot; and the individual schools budget (ISB) for special schools.<br>

2.The ISB for special schools will include some general education costs for pupils with SEN in addition to those costs specifically for SEN while the figures recorded against notional SEN&quot; are only indicative of the amount that might be spent by schools on SEN and, from 2004&#150;05 onwards, notional SEN&quot; delegated to nursery schools was reported on section 52 for the first time and this 



accounts for &#163;13,000 and &#163;14,000 of the 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 totals respectively. In 2005&#150;06, Essex also budgeted &#163;13.5 million for SEN transport expenditure but this is not included in the budgeted net expenditure on SEN as figures are not available prior to 2005&#150;06.<br>

3.Figures are as reported by the LEA in cash terms as at 13 October 2005 and are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds and may not sum due to founding.<br>

 Mature students have the same access to financial support for the undergraduate degree in medicine as do younger students. If entering higher education in 2005&#150;06, they could be eligible during the first four years of the course for tuition fee support, the Higher Education Grant, a student maintenance loan and any more specialised grant like the child care grant (which in fact is mainly received by mature students). Currently the only restrictions on funding for eligible students are on tuition fees if a student has previous study and on the maintenance loan if a student is aged over 55 (or 50 if not going into work subsequently). From 2006&#150;07 there will be no age limit applied to the fee loan and the age limit on maintenance loans will be increased to age 60. The Department of Health pay tuition fees and provide bursaries in the fifth and any subsequent year of the course.

 The Criminal Justice Act 2003 makes provision for trial by a judge sitting without a jury in serious or complex fraud cases, and in cases of jury tampering. Before that legislation was introduced, the White Paper Justice for All&quot;, published in July 2002, invited views on the proposal that it should be possible for a court to order non-jury trial in such circumstances. There has been no consultation about the appropriateness of jury trial in the generality of cases, since no further reform is contemplated.

The Sexual Offences Act 2003 redefined and increased the penalties for many sexual offences and clarified the law on consent.

<a name="stpa_92">We have developed the way that the police, probation service and others work together to ensure that decisions about managing known sex offenders are based on the best information available. In addition, there are also tighter requirements for known sex offenders to notify their whereabouts to the police and any plans they have to travel abroad. Based on evidence about what really works in reducing offending, intensive programmes are being run both in prison and the community (for sex offenders).

 Sport based activities are one of the key interventions delivered through the Youth Inclusion Programmes and Positive Activities for Young People and are part of the Government&#039;s wide package of measures to target and steer young people most at risk of crime and reduce their re-offending. Sport is also an important part of the Youth Justice Board&#039;s Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programme.

A Regulatory Impact Assessment of the Gambling Act was published on 21 April 2005. It concluded that the gaming machine reforms in the Act would increase competition between adult gaming centres and other venues offering machine gambling, including casinos, bingo halls, licensed betting offices and members&#039; clubs.

Notes:<br>

1. Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia reporting became a mandatory requirement from 1 April 2002.<br>

2. Staphylococcus aureus patient episodes&#039; are defined as the total number of patients from whom blood culture set(s) collected during the quarter grew Staphylococcus aureus. If repeat specimens were collected from a single patient, and the patient was considered to have had two episodes of bacteraemia, then they should be counted as two patients. As an arbitrary measure, if positive blood culture sets are collected more than 14 days apart, they should be considered as reflecting different episodes.<br>

<a name="stpa_160">The Department of Education has made clear to education and library boards the need to have clear criteria for the provision of crossing patrols that ensure that patrols are provided where there are safety issues. In response, boards have agreed to operate within the Local Authority Road Safety Officers Association (LARSOA) guidelines. These guidelines provide an objective, risk-based framework for assessing the need for crossing patrols, taking into account factors such as the volume of traffic, road width, availability of footpaths and provision of other crossing aids such as footbridges or pelican crossings. Where the guidelines demonstrate particular hazards or risks, crossing patrols are normally provided.

 When an education and library board is aware that a crossing patrolperson is going to retire/resign, it will carry out an assessment of need to determine if the patrol point still meets the eligibility criteria relating to the identification of hazards and assessing risks as determined in a framework based on the Local Authority Road Safety Officers&#039; Association (LARSOA) guidelines. If the patrol point does not meet the criteria a board will not replace the retiring patrolperson. However, if the patrol point still meets the criteria a board will then take action to recruit a new crossing patrolperson.

 The decision to produce the handbook was based on various sources of feedback from MPs and their researchers.

The research indicated that MPs wished to have more contact with HSE, and that health and safety issues were a common theme in constituency correspondence that they deal with. As a result, the handbook was produced to provide an easy source of reference for answers to a typical range of questions about health and safety, and to provide helpful contact details for more information. The total cost of producing the handbook (including HSE staff time) was &#163;12,000. A number of MPs have thanked HSE for the handbook.

Notes:<br>

1.A finished consultant episode is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

2.Hospital episode statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. The Health and Social Care Information Centre liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of correct data.<br>

 As vasa praevia is a very rare condition and technically difficult to detect, even for a highly skilled ultrasonographer with the appropriate specialist equipment (a colour Doppler scanner), routine screening of all pregnant women for vasa praevia is not currently advocated by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Neither the national screening committee nor the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) have made any assessments into screening for this condition.

 The Government take the recent increases in energy prices very seriously, and particularly their impact on the competitiveness of UK industry. In January this year my Department set up the Gas Prices Working Group with the Energy Intensive Users&#039; Group and Ofgem, with the remit of examining the workings of the gas market and developing ideas for improving its operation. The group has now agreed a list of action points for the short to medium term, such as maximising gas supplies, encouraging demand side response and pursuing energy market liberalisation in the EU.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51017w37.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_214">Gas is a substantial component of the UK fuel mix in electricity generation, so the movement in the gas price is probably the largest factor behind electricity price increases. The EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) is also having an impact on electricity prices. We recognise that some business stakeholders have argued for greater simplicity and streamlining of instruments aimed at the business sector in the wake of the EU ETS. This will be an important consideration in the Government&#039;s deliberations during the current review of the climate change programme.

In August 2005 the Housing Corporation launched the bidding round for the 2006&#150;08 Affordable Housing Programme (AHP). This invited both registered social landlords and non-registered bodies to apply for funds to develop affordable housing based on priorities set by the Regional Housing Boards. The outcome of this bidding round will not be known until early in 2006.

As part of the bid evaluation process English Partnerships is considering the reasonableness of such construction profit margins in relationship to the project risk. English Partnerships has set clawback terms linked to final sales prices over base values to be agreed with each developer in negotiation, so the agency will benefit if the land generates values higher than anticipated.

 Growth in the Thames Gateway will be largely concentrated on previously developed land in existing urban areas which is already protected by a very high standard of existing defence. Development will be in line with Planning Policy Guidance Note 25, which applies a sequential risk-based approach to prevent inappropriate development in flood risk areas. In order to enable local planning authorities to apply planning policy effectively, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is funding Strategic Flood Risk Assessments across the Thames Gateway to assess flood risk and inform planning decisions.
