<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">Estimates for post-tax national income by quantile are not available but estimates for post-tax household income are shown in the following tables. These have been produced from the Office for National Statistics&#039; analyses &#039;The effects of taxes and benefits on household income&#039; and the latest analysis for 2002&#150;03 was published on the National Statistics website on 6 May 2004 at http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits. The analyses include measures of income inequality for households in the United Kingdom as a whole based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey (the Family and Expenditure Survey from 1997&#150;98 to 2000&#150;01). This is a sample survey covering about 6,000 to 7,000 households in the UK. The analysis for 2003&#150;04 is due to be published on the National Statistics website on 7 July 2005.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">The tables show a breakdown of post-tax household income in terms of the average annual amount per household for each year between 1997&#150;98 and 2002&#150;03 for all households in the UK, and for each income decile and quintile group where households are ranked by equivalised disposable income. Equivalisation is a standard methodology that takes into account the size and composition of households and adjusts their incomes to recognise differing demands on resources. The tables also show the equivalised disposable income decile and quintile point boundaries, which have been calculated separately for each year. For example, the 1st decile point is the income below which one tenth of all households are estimated to lie. The decile and quintile point boundaries differ between each year as shown in the tables.</p>

 It is Government policy that Departments and non-departmental public bodies should not seek to minimise tax liabilities through transactions or activities for which there is no genuine justification in economic terms, and should apply restrictions on the use of offshore jurisdictions by successful bidders to procurement contracts, where such restrictions are justified in terms of the objectives of the project and consistent with international obligations and stated objectives on tax transparency and openness. This is made clear in the Dear Accounting Officer&quot; letter sent by HM Treasury to Departments on 22 May 2003 (DAO Gen/03).

 Restrictive covenants protect private rights and benefits of the owners or occupiers of the land specified in them. Covenants are privately negotiated and agreed. If a covenant is breached, it would be for those affected to see if enforcement would be possible; through the courts, if necessary.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50615w10.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_51">Private rights are quite separate from planning considerations. Planning decisions are taken in the broader public interest, in the light of policies in development plan documents and of any other factor relevant to land-use planning. There is public involvement when plan documents are put forward for adoption, or planning applications made. Accordingly, the existence of a restrictive covenant should not be the basis of a decision about a planning application or appeal.

This figure was considered low by some of those who responded to consultation, but they did not produce any evidence on which to base a different forecast of initial take-up.

<a name="stpa_79">Training on issues relating to race, and other key equality areas are incorporated into a range of learning opportunities, including comprehensive information and guidance on the Departments internal website. The Diversity and Equality Unit have provided a number of presentations to Business Units (over 100 staff) and have used these to facilitate discussions on a number of equality issues. These included work required within business units to address the duties arising from the RRA and other equality legislation e.g. the impending duties relating to disability.

<a name="stpa_80">Specific training on the duties arising from the RRA delivered through an external consultant were provided to staff working in areas identified in the Race Equality Scheme as relevant to the RRA. The seminars provided an overview of the responsibilities arising from the RRA as well as guidance on mainstreaming race equality in policy development and in service delivery. Feedback from recent workshops which was specifically targeted at senior managers is currently being evaluated. It will be used to inform the work under way to review the Race Equality Scheme and future strategies for providing staff with the required training.

<a name="stpa_81">Currently the Department is unable to monitor comprehensively attendance at all training events. The new Human Resource database which was introduced in July 2004 should enable such monitoring in the future. However the module that will provide this functionality has not yet been rolled out. Data are therefore only available for courses which were organised centrally. As a result we are unable to provide details of attendees at locally organised events which were arranged by Business Units to provide staff with training on the specific duties arising within their work area, although we are aware of a number of such events. This information should be available in the future.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 Jun 2005 : Column 430W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
The remaining Executive Agencies have produced Agency specific Schemes using the core Department&#039;s Scheme as a model. Annual progress reports are produced and the Schemes are discussed regularly as part of an ongoing review process.

Although these Bodies are not required to produce a Race Equality Scheme they are expected to follow the lead of the core Department in addressing the general duties imposed. This list is updated periodically in consultation with the CRE and other Government departments and amended to take account of new Bodies and to delete defunct Bodies.

updated guidance issued by the Department, motor sports may take place on up to 28 days during the nominated 10-month period, in addition to all of the remaining two months of the year. The updated guidance takes on board representations made by motor sports interests and, overall, we would expect the impact of the SPS on the availability of agricultural land used for such sports to be limited. There are no immediate plans to further update the guidance, but it will be reviewed for the 2006 scheme in the light of experience of this first year of operation of the SPS.

 The EU rules for the &#039;flat-rate&#039; model of the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) adopted in England are designed to avoid any SPS related increase in production of fruit, vegetables and potatoes and so avoid disadvantaging growers of these crops in those parts of the EU which did not adopt the &#039;flat-rate&#039; model. There is no need for similar rules in relation to sugar beet as quotas still limit production of that crop.

<p><a name="st_148"><a name="50615w15.html_spnew6"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 The Department has issued guidance on the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) and non-agricultural use of land which balances the need for diversification opportunities with the necessity to abide by EU rules on eligibility of land under the scheme. Following representations from a number of motor sports organisations and enthusiasts, that guidance has recently been updated. Motor sports are now placed in a category which allows for events to take place on up to 28 days during the 10-month period that farmers must declare, for SPS payment purposes, that they have the required amount of eligible land at their disposal. In addition, such events may take place on that land at any time during the remaining two months of the year. It remains the case that all claims for SPS payment are subject to observance of set cross-compliance conditions, which apply for the whole calendar year.

<p><a name="st_157"><a name="50615w17.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 In very exceptional circumstances the effect of applying the normal formula will be that some pensioners will receive a reward of &#163;1.20 instead of 60 pence for each extra pound of qualifying income. This may happen if the pension credit recipient is also receiving a working tax credit, spousal maintenance, or a social security benefit which does not count as rewardable income. It will only occur if their total income brought to account is greater than their appropriate guarantee level but the income which counts for the savings credit is less than the guarantee level. If this happens the pensioner will be able to ask the Pension Service for an explanation.

It is accepted internationally that asylum seekers should seek asylum in the first safe country they reach. Where juxtaposed controls are in operation, it is clearly established in all instances that the host State should remain responsible for those claiming asylum at such controls, so that an asylum application made at the UK controls in France will be handled by the French authorities and vice versa.

<p><a name="st_196"><a name="50615w20.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The Identity Cards Bill Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA), published on 25 May 2005, outlines the assessed benefits of the identity cards scheme in section two. Benefits specifically relating to the categories mentioned in the question above are summarised below: The scheme will provide a straightforward means to record and verify the immigration status of all residents aged 16 and over. The verification service will be available not just to the authorities for maintaining immigration controls but also to employers to check status and entitlement to work. The scheme will reduce the opportunity for those facilitating terrorist and organised criminal activity to operate using multiple identities, encourage verifiable proof of identity when conducting major financial transactions, provide the capability&#151;with independent oversight&#151;for law enforcement and security agencies to be provided with information on when a person&#039;s record on the National Identity Register has been checked or amended, allow for the more efficient use of police resources and to check fingerprint biometric information at scenes of crime where no match can be found against existing police records. Public services will benefit from the ID cards scheme through improving the administration of social security benefits, eligibility checks for free non-emergency NHS treatment, adult allocation of the national insurance number; speeding up and improving the accuracy of Criminal Records Bureau checks and in more general ways through speeding up administrative processes.

The UKPS trial was not a trial of ID cards nor the technology involved, rather a test of the practicalities of enrolling people&#039;s biometrics and people&#039;s perceptions of that process. A great deal was learnt from the trial. We now know much more about the practicalities of biometric enrolment and issues that arise with enrolment on such a large scale. We also learned that people&#039;s perception of the process was very positive overall, with a post-trial reduction in those who had reported concerns about having their biometrics taken pre-trial and a majority reporting a better than expected level of intrusion at the process. The vast majority of participants found their expectations of the overall experience to have been met or bettered.

Primarily, individual cardholders will be encouraged to keep their record up-to-date in order to maintain the integrity and accuracy of the register. It is likely that the convenience of having a reliable method of verifying identity in everyday situations will encourage individuals to keep their details up to date, so they can access services in a secure and speedy manner. The proposed identity cards agency will seek to validate and verify new information provided as far as is practically possible.

<a name="stpa_112">The data requested on the number of cases that cited domestic violence are not held centrally. One recent research report (Wade and Smart, DCA Research Series 06/2003), however, did suggest that around 25 per cent. of child contact cases involved allegations of domestic violence. From 31 January new forms for applications for child contact and residence were introduced. These &#039;Gateway forms&#039; identify allegations of harm at the beginning of the court process. We are committed to evaluating the impact of these forms and further research is planned for one year on from implementation with a report expected in the autumn of 2006.

 The Government are committed to establishing a pilot of a dedicated drug court by the end of 2005. It is anticipated that this pilot will involve trained sentencers, inter-agency co-operation and regular court reviews by a consistent court to track an offender&#039;s progress from sentence through to completion or breach of an order. The pilot builds upon international evidence and existing best practice that close sentencer review of drug treatment can play a role in successful rehabilitation.

We welcome the resumption, on 10 June, of peace talks in Abuja. A UK Representative is present to provide support to the parties.

 Under the existing private fostering regulations (the Children (Private Arrangements for Fostering) Regulations 1991) local authorities are already required to make arrangements for each child who is privately fostered within their area to be visited by an officer of the authority when reasonably requested by the child (or private foster carer) and, in particular, in the first year of the private fostering arrangement, within one week from its beginning and then at intervals of not more than six weeks and in any second or subsequent year, at intervals of not more than three months.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 Jun 2005 : Column 492W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
reasonably requested to do so by a parent of the child, or any other person with parental responsibility for him or her.

The Government remain committed to widening participation in HE for all those who have the merit and potential to benefit from it, regardless of background. Much of the Government&#039;s reforms of HE over the last year has widening participation at its heart and we look forward to seeing improvements in participation rates as a result.

The Government have elevated the priority of effective parental engagement by requiring all schools to address it explicitly within the self evaluation form that will underpin the new inspection regime to take effect from this autumn. Ofsted inspectors will seek the views of parents and must have regard to those views when conducting an inspection. Inspectors will use this information alongside the evidence provided in the self evaluation form to assess how effectively the school is working in partnership with parents.

 Over the last 12 months, Ministers and officials have met regularly with the Open University to consider a range of issues, including the changes to the funding system which will be introduced in 2006/07. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) has considered representations from the Open University and Birkbeck College for special funding in response to their concerns about the impact of variable fees on large scale providers of part-time undergraduate higher education. The Council announced its findings on 1 March. These included a commitment to develop a widening participation measure, from the 2006/07 academic year, designed to ensure that the most disadvantaged students will continue to be able to study on a part-time basis. Details of the measure will be confirmed by the HEFCE Board in the autumn. Both the Government and HEFCE continue to monitor the sector, holding discussions with the Open University and other institutions, to ensure that available funding is used to support part-time provision in the most effective way.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will estimate the likely debt of graduates from higher education institutions in England from <i>(a)</i> low, <i>(b)</i> medium and <i>(c)</i> high income backgrounds from 2009&#150;10, broken down by (i) fee and (ii) maintenance loans.  [3099]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 Jun 2005 : Column 501W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>






<p><a name="st_312"><a name="50615w33.html_spnew1"><b> Bill Rammell: </b> 
 Debt will depend on the financial circumstances and choices of individual students. Information from the Student Income and Expenditure Survey (SIES) 2002/03 indicated that average total student debt on graduation was &#163;8,666: &#163;10,198 for students from the lower, &#163;9,288 for those from the middle and &#163;7,952 for those from the higher socio-economic classes. The 2004/05 SIES, published at the end of 2005, will give up-to-date figures.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50615w33.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_181">The introduction of loans for variable fees of up to &#163;3,000 will increase the amount the average student borrows. However, those receiving the new maintenance grants and university bursaries could use them to reduce their call on loans for fees. Students generally may also seek to pay fee contributions from part-time work or family income.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50615w33.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_182">Changes to maintenance loans levels could reduce rather than increase student indebtedness for many poorer students. Although maintenance loans will rise in 2006/07 to reflect the median of essential living costs expenditure recorded in the SIES 2002/03, a bigger change will be the substitution of a significant part of the new &#163;2,700 maintenance grant for maintenance loans for lower income students, reducing the need to borrow.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50615w33.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_183">It is therefore very difficult to estimate student indebtedness from 2009/10 now. We will be monitoring changes in borrowing patterns as the new student support arrangements come in.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50615w33.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_184">Whatever a student&#039;s circumstances, no student from 2006/07 has to pay fees upfront and the arrangements for repayment of maintenance and fee loans are fair and equitable. The graduate&#039;s repayments are at zero real rate of interest, related directly to earnings and only required when earnings are greater than &#163;15,000 per year.

<a name="stpa_190">Being recalled to have a second cervical screening test because the first was inadequate can be a stressful and anxious time for women. To reduce this uncertainty we are introducing liquid based cytology (LBC) to the national health service cervical screening programme. LBC is a new way of making and reading cervical test slides. Government-funded pilot studies have shown that LBC reduces the rate of inadequate tests from around 9 per cent. to between 1 and 2 per cent. This means that, when fully implemented, 300,000 women a year will not be called back because their slide could not be read.
