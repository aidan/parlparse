 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to the answer of 6&nbsp;May, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1658W, on disposable nappies, whether the Waste Implementation Programme Manager met representatives of the Nappy Alliance at Ashdown House on 23rd March; and if she&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will make a statement on the outcome of the meeting.  [174743]</p>








<p><a name="40521w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 20 May 2004]:</i> I can confirm that the Waste Implementation Programme (WIP) Manager met with representatives of the Nappy Alliance on 23rd March. The meeting was a useful opportunity to discuss the work WIP is already taking forward through the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) to promote re-usable nappies. This work stream forms an essential part of Government&#039;s renewed drive to minimise the amount of household waste generated in England.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40521w01.html_para0">
One of the issues raised in the course of the meeting was the need to ensure that this element of Defra&#039;s waste strategy has full support across Government. In particular, this means working closely with the Department of Health to ensure that hospitals are in a position to encourage the supply of re-usable nappies, and that healthcare professionals give new parents the facts they need to make their own informed choice. Following the meeting on 23&nbsp;March and the subsequent publication of the Women&#039;s Environmental Network&#039;s report &#039;Nappies and the NHS: Waste Prevention and a Fair Choice for Parents&#039;, I have written to the Under-Secretary at the Department of Health to make the case for a strong lead from hospitals and health trusts on this important initiative.

<p><a name="40521w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Government welcome the report &quot;Foresight Future Flooding&quot; by Professor Sir David King published through the Office of Science and Technology on 22&nbsp;April.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40521w01.html_para2">
Currently nearly two million properties are at risk of flooding in the UK from rivers and the sea and a further 80,000 are at risk from heavy downpours that overwhelm drains in urban areas. Under future scenarios in the report and assuming our approval to flood risk management does not change then annual damages could rise substantially by the 2080s. The areas at greatest risk include the South East Coast. We therefore face major challenges in managing these potential risks and associated costs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40521w01.html_para3">
The Government are considering the implications of the report and we intend to address the findings in an initial response through a consultation document for a new flood and coastal defence strategy that I hope to publish in the summer.

<p><a name="40521w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Morley </b> 
<i>[holding answer 10&nbsp;May 2004]:</i> We have no plans to use such facilities for the handling of hazardous waste. Sites for handling hazardous waste would have to have the appropriate authorisations under the Waste Framework Directive and the Landfill Directive. The disposal by burial of animal carcases during the FMD epidemic was subject to control under the Animal Waste Directive which has now been superseded by the EU Animal By-Products Regulation.

<p><a name="40521w01.html_spnew7"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 I am not aware of any research or discussions with any organisations on an inter-relationship between hunting and the new Single Payment Scheme. Hunting is not an activity that would attract payment under the Scheme, but agricultural land on which hunting takes place may be used by a farmer in support of a Single Payment claim if that activity does not lead to a breach any of the Scheme&#039;s conditions, including the obligation on the farmer to maintain the land in good agricultural and environmental condition.

<p><a name="40521w02.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Kidney: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in what ways she proposes that agri-environment schemes will contribute to maintaining the UK&#039;s biodiversity, with particular reference to insects.  [165305]</p>








<p><a name="40521w02.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 We regularly monitor our existing Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs) and Countryside Stewardship (CS) schemes to assess their environmental benefits. This has demonstrated substantial benefits for many Biodiversity Action Plan priority habitats and species, including mammals, birds, plants and insects.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40521w02.html_para0">
Recent Defra-sponsored research has shown that simple measures such as planting a seed mix of flowers in field margins to provide pollen and nectar can attract huge numbers of insects (bumble bees, butterflies, and others) relative to the in-field crop. Full details are available at http://www.f-e-c.co.uk/Buzz/index.htm.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40521w02.html_para1">
Defra has also sponsored specific research on butterflies. This has shown that ESAs and CS schemes are slowing, and in some cases reversing, the long-term decline in numbers of England&#039;s rarer butterflies. Further details are available at http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2002/020806a.htm.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40521w02.html_para2">
Recent Defra-funded reports on &#039;Managing priority habitats for invertebrates&#039; will help inform targeting and formulating of future agri-environment agreements. &#039;Environmental Stewardship&#039; (ES) will rationalise and replace ESAs and CS in 2005. ES will be divided into two levels: an Entry Level (ELS) and a Higher Level (HLS). ELS should include measures beneficial for biodiversity, including insects, in the wider countryside. The HLS Scheme will continue the work of ESAs and CS by targeting management on the most valuable and vulnerable farmland habitats. The options available under these new schemes will also have the advantage of having greater generic benefits for insects. Further details of these schemes can be found at http://www.defra.gov.uk/erdp/reviews/agrienv/entrylevel.htm and http://www.defra. gov.uk/erdp/reviews/agrienv/higherlevel.htm.

<p><a name="40521w02.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Methyl bromide is an ozone depleting substance and its production and supply are controlled under the Montreal Protocol. Its production is due to be phased out in developed countries after 31&nbsp;December 2004, except for quarantine and pre-shipment purposes.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 May 2004 : Column 1223W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

In addition, under the Protocol and the equivalent EC legislation, methyl bromide can be authorised for &quot;critical uses&quot; after 2004, including use in relation to farming and food production.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40521w02.html_para4">
The Government&#039;s view is that methyl bromide is being phased out by the Protocol and should not be phased back in by excessive critical uses. Every effort should be made therefore to identify possible alternatives to methyl bromide use in relation to farm and food production.

<p><a name="40521w02.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Oil Care Campaign is a voluntary initiative which brings together the oil industry, regulators, local authorities and other stakeholders with an interest in reducing the number and severity of oil pollution incidents affecting inland waters in the UK.

<p><a name="40521w02.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 High-level waste (HLW) is held and managed by British Nuclear Fuels plc (BNFL) at its Sellafield site and by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) at its Dounreay site. Responsibility for this HLW is due to be taken over by the new Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) when it comes into being in April 2005. Government sponsorship of both the nuclear industry and the NDA is the responsibility of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). Radioactive waste management policy is the joint responsibility of The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), and the devolved Administrations for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The main nuclear site regulators are the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), the environment agencies (the Environment Agency (EA) in England and Wales and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) in Scotland) and the Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS).

<p><a name="40521w03.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 The &#039;Volume Incentive&#039; was first introduced by the Rail Regulator in his Access Charges Review 2000. The SRA set out its views on the continuing effectiveness of a Volume Incentive for Network Rail as part of its response to the Initial Consultation Paper of the Access Charge Review 2003. The SRA&#039;s view was that for a number of reasons, the Volume Incentive would no longer be cost effective or appropriate given the changes to the industry since it was first introduced. The Rail Regulator considered this view and the supporting reasons, along with the views of other consultees, in the course of the Access Charge Review 2003. His view was that the Volume Incentive would continue to be an effective way of encouraging Network Rail to make efficient use of a constrained network so that additional traffic could be accommodated. He therefore retained the Volume Incentive, with a number of modifications (including only rewarding Network Rail for growth above a certain threshold level) in the Final Conclusions to the Access Charge Review published in December 2003. This decision is entirely for the Rail Regulator, taking into account his statutory duties as set out in the Railways Act .1993.

Notes:<br>

1.&nbsp;The financial data are taken from Kent LEA&#039;s Section 52 Outturn Statements submitted to the DfES from 1999&#150;2000 onwards and the ODPM&#039;s R01 statement prior to then. 1999&#150;2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance. Figures up to and including 1997&#150;98 are for Kent LEA prior to local government re-organisation. From 1998&#150;99 onwards parts of Kent LEA became Rochester and Gillingham LEA.<br>

2.&nbsp;The outturn 2002&#150;03 tables captured the data in a fundamentally different way to the previous years. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector. Consequently the unit costs per pupil in 2002&#150;03 are not strictly comparable with earlier years as they include an apportionment of LEA expenditure based on pupil numbers. 2002&#150;03 data is subject to change by the LEA. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10.<br>

3.&nbsp;Net current expenditure (NCE) includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEA.<br>

4.&nbsp;In 1992&#150;93 NCE after recharges was not collected on R01. In this year Net Recurrent Expenditure is used and consequently figures for this year may not be strictly comparable with those for future years.<br>

The LSC decides on allocations at individual college and regional levels from the funds allocated to it for learning participation.

Mark Haysom, the Council&#039;s Chief Executive, will write to the Honourable Gentleman on this matter. A copy of his reply will be placed in the House Library. The Government have set out its investment plans for 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06 which should enable the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) to increase funding for further education significantly.

 Specialist school status is available for secondary (but not primary) maintained schools in England.

 These questions have been answered with respect to the Defence Information Infrastructure (DII) programme. The Ministry of Defence is in negotiations with two potential commercial Delivery 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 May 2004 : Column 1253W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Partners (DP) for the provision of Information Systems services. The DII programme is currently in the Assessment Phase of the Smart Procurement cycle.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40521w08.html_para3">
In terms of cost, the MOD currently spends over&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#163;450&nbsp;million per annum on its information infrastructure. It is anticipated that the DII Public/Private Partnership contract will cost in the region of &#163;4&nbsp;billion over 10 years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40521w08.html_para4">
Track record is one of a number of factors included in the evaluation of bids. The Department&#039;s Supplier Relations Group has conducted research of bidding consortium members&#039; performance both in Defence and across Government. In addition, the project has taken up references, by telephone and through visits, from existing customers of the key companies in the bidding consortia. Further reference visits will be conducted during the final phase of the procurement, targeting customers in receipt of a similar volume and range of services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40521w08.html_para5">
10 major legacy contracts for IT infrastructure have been identified and these will be subsumed within, or superseded by, the DII contract. The majority of these contracts are due to expire naturally over the next 18 months. An options appraisal has been conducted for each contract and an appropriate scenario agreed for each during subsequent mitigation planning. Where the risks, liabilities or known termination charges are unacceptably high, the preferred option is to allow a contract to run to expiry and then assimilate the activity within DII. Any contracts that currently lie beyond the next three years, which in the main are PFI contracts, will be subsumed on expiry. Residual liabilities will be assessed more fully following negotiations with bidders in the later stages of procurement but generally we would expect to be in no worse a position than now and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would seek to be in a better position through negotiation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40521w08.html_para6">
Support to deployed operations will continue to be supplied by Service personnel. For all other elements of IT infrastructure provision and support the MOD will mitigate the risk of supplier failure by contracting with a consortium which will provide the services through a range of service providers. This will ensure that in the event that one member of the consortium fails, there is capacity available for another consortium member to pick up the service provision. In addition, the MOD will retain rights to step in and use its own staff or other third party contractors to remedy major service failures. Ultimately, the MOD will have rights to terminate the contract for material breaches in performance, with options to take services back in-house or contract with another commercial provider for their delivery.

Notes:<br>

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1&nbsp;April at the start of the data year. Periods of care on-going at the end of the data year (unfinished admission episodes) are included. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PCT and strategic health authority (SHA) data was added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002&#150;03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of Treatment and SHA of Treatment is poor in 1996&#150;97, 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>

 The national health service has never been required to provide statistics on the number of overseas visitors treated under the provisions of the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 1989. It is therefore not possible to give a definitive assessment of the scale of this matter. Nevertheless, NHS staff operating the charging regime have told us that there are significant issues in some areas, which we are taking action to deal with. We are taking forward a study of 12 NHS trusts across England, the results of which will, over time, help to give us a better understanding of the level of inappropriate use of the NHS by overseas visitors.

Notes:<br>

1.&nbsp;A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

2.&nbsp;Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br>

3.&nbsp;All operations count of episodes&#151;these figures represent a count of all FCE&#039;s where the procedure was mentioned in any of the 12 (four prior to 2002&#150;03) operation fields in a HES record. A record is only included once in each count, even if an operation is mentioned in more than one operation field of the record. Population figures are not available so only operation counts can be provided.<br>

4.&nbsp;Strategic Health Authority (SHA) Data Quality&#151;SHA data were added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002&#150;03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on SHA of treatment is poor in 1998&#150;99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Users of time series analysis including 1998&#150;99 need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>

 The codes of conduct and code accountability for national health service boards require that all board members should declare any conflict of interest that arises in the course of conducting NHS business. The codes also requires that board members should declare any business interests in the field of health and social care which should be formally recorded in the minutes of the board and entered into a register which is available to the public. When a conflict of interest is established, the board member involved is also required to withdraw from any related board discussion and not play any part in the relevant discussion or decision. All NHS board members are required on appointment to sign an undertaking that they will comply with the provisions of the codes. A copy of the codes is available in the Library.

Prescriptions written within a GP practice but dispensed outside the PCT or SHA will be included in the PCT or SHA in which, 



respectively, the GP practice is based. Prescriptions written in England but dispensed outside England are included. Prescriptions written in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man but dispensed in England are excluded.<br>

2.&nbsp;Prescriptions are written on a prescription form. Each single item written on the form is counted as a prescription item.<br>

3.&nbsp;The figures for Statins represent data on the following chemical entities: atorvastatin; cerivastatin; fluvastatin sodium; lovastatin; pravastatin sodium; rosuvastatin calcium; simvastatin.<br>

 Disconnection remains an appropriate action of last resort where a customer has repeatedly failed to respond to efforts to secure payment or to make specific repayment arrangements.

I welcome the arrangements proposed by Ofgem and energy suppliers in April to improve those safeguards to protect&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vulnerable customers.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what advice is given to local authorities on how best to assess whether developers have sought brownfield site alternatives before proposing back land development.  [174462]</p>








<p><a name="40521w16.html_spnew0"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 Planning Policy Guidance Note 3: &quot;Housing&quot; (PPG3) says that the country&#039;s housing needs should be met in the most sustainable way possible, giving priority to re-using suitable brownfield land in preference to the development of greenfield sites. PPG3 advises local planning authorities, in preparing their local plans, to adopt a systematic approach to assessing the development potential of sites and the redevelopment of existing buildings, deciding which are most suitable for housing development and the sequence in which development should take place. It is for local planning authorities to consider whether proposals for back land development are in principle consistent with the local plan (or where this is not up-to-date, the relevant criteria set out in PPG3) and are well-designed.
