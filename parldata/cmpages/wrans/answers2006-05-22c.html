completed by the end of
2007.</p><p><a name="06052325000187">The increase in
direct fighting between the Sri Lankan military, the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and militia&#146;s associated with each side
has been accompanied by an increase in communal tension. Development
agencies and non governmental organisations have evacuated staff for
their security and protection and recovery programmes have been
suspended. In addition, regular economic activities and recovery work
undertaken in communities without external assistance has also been
affected by military activity. Able bodied men are being mobilised for
LTTE service, and people are being displaced by fighting, or the fear
of fighting.</p><p><a name="06052325000188">The
situation continues to deteriorate, as evidenced by the recent suicide
bombing in Colombo and the subsequent air strikes and naval shelling in
the east. Without a considerable improvement in the security situation
it is unlikely that much recovery can be undertaken. The international
community, including the United Kingdom, are working hard to encourage
the Government and the (LTTE) to curtail violence and to return to the
negotiating table. Once the security environment improves we will renew
efforts to help ensure delivery of development assistance to
communities.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1259W</b><br><h3 align="center"><a name="06052325000016">Family

[72176]</p><p><a name="06052325000190"><b><a name="06052325001881">Mr.
Thomas:</b> The UK Government's approach to promoting
reproductive health is set out in the DFID position paper, "Sexual and
Reproductive Health and Rights". Our approach to achieving the fifth
Millennium Development Goal of improving maternal health is outlined in
the DFID strategy paper, "Reducing Maternal Deaths: Evidence and
Action". Both were published in 2004 after extensive consultation with
a broad range of stakeholders, including the research community, NGOs,
parliamentarians and civil society groups. A web-based consultation was
also held as part of this
process.</p><p><a name="06052325000191">Our
understanding of the so-called "Mexico City Policy" is that it requires
non-US NGOs to agree that they will not perform or actively promote
abortion as a method of family planning in order to receive US funding.
This means, for example, that non-US NGOs who accept US funding are not
allowed to use their own funds to provide information or counselling
for abortion care, or to promote awareness of the benefits of legal
reform. As the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF)
"Death and Denial: Unsafe Abortion and Poverty" report makes clear, the
policy forces NGOs to choose between carrying on work to protect the
health and rights of women or lose funds. No reproductive or maternal
health NGOs affected by the policy work to "promote abortion as a
method of family planning", and indeed this would be contrary to the
global consensus reached at the International Conference on Population
and Development (ICPD). What they try to do is to provide a
comprehensive range of information and services that can help save
women's lives, and reduce the need for abortion. The US policy means
that the work of such organisations is compromised, and that is why my
Department is opposed to
it.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06052325000017">Iraq</h3><p><a name="06052325000192"><b><a name="06052325001882">Mr.

Benn:</b> The Government of Iraq, supported by the UK and
other donors, has made significant progress with reconstruction since
2003. But there is still a long way to go. Once a relatively wealthy
country with high levels of education and health care, by 2003 Iraq had
suffered more than 20 years of conflict, mismanagement and chronic
under-investment from a brutal regime. Continued violence, especially
sabotage 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1260W</b><br>directed at key infrastructure, and low (but growing) levels of
management capacity in Iraq&#146;s national and local government have
slowed progress. The UK and international community are committed to
helping the new Iraqi Government tackle these
challenges.</p><p><a name="06052325000194">One
challenge is the lack of data, especially at the regional and
provincial level. The following information therefore covers the
progress that has been made across Iraq, including regional detail only
where this is
available.</p><p><a name="06052325000195">Electricity
generation is more equitably distributed across Iraq than before 2003.
Nearly 5,000 megawatts (MW) have been added to the national grid since
2003, but Iraq&#146;s average electricity generation has not improved
over that period. This is because at the same time as capacity is being
added through reconstruction projects, breakdowns of the pre-existing
dilapidated systems, shortages of fuel supplies and sabotage are
reducing capacity. So Iraqis are not getting the full benefit of those
extra megawatts. Demand for electricity also continues to rise
dramatically, as the economy grows and more people own and use
electrical goods such as fridges and air-conditioning units. The new
Iraqi Government will be starting work on a long-term power sector
strategy, with DFID&#146;s
support.</p><p><a name="06052325000196">In the south,
average electricity generation levels have increased from approximately
750 MW in January 2004 to over 1,000 MW in December 2005. The south now
receives its fair share of national power&#151;whereas under
Saddam&#146;s regime, power was often diverted from the south to
Baghdad.</p><p><a name="06052325000197">To improve

Thomas:</b> DFID is the only major bilateral donor to already
have a specific strategy focusing on maternal health: &#147;Reducing
maternal deaths: evidence and action&#148;, which was launched in
2004. We have disseminated this comprehensive maternal health strategy
throughout the international system, with other donors, the UN, and
most importantly, with the developing partners we
support.</p><p><a name="06052325000213">The strategy
provides the basis for DFID support to improve maternal health at
country level, which we do through a combination of programmes to
strengthen health services and improve overall reproductive and child
health, along with specific maternal health programmes and HIV
interventions. Long-term support for maternal health in Nepal, for
example, is demonstrating significant increases in women&#146;s
access to emergency obstetric care in remote areas and in a fragile
state. This work highlights the importance of support for community
level action to overcome cultural and socio-economic barriers to
accessing care, as well as the importance of addressing infrastructure
(roads, bridges) and communications issues to ensure an effective
referral system. In Malawi, DFID is supporting an Emergency Human
Resource Programme to address the acute shortages of health workers, an
issue which has been compounded by the AIDS epidemic. Overall
investments for maternal health (including reproductive health
services) have increased by over 40 per cent. over the past three
years, to &#163;242.9 million in
2004-05.</p><p><a name="06052325000214">The maternal
health strategy also provides the platform for DFID&#146;s regular
policy discussions with other donors, such as the EU, G8 and the UN, on
the actions needed to improve maternal health in developing countries
and the importance of doing more on maternal health. We are seeking to
highlight the importance of maternal health within the current G8
process, although the prime health theme at present is infectious
disease. We are also working to ensure that the new Partnership for
Maternal, Neonatal and Child Health can play a useful role in
advocating for more action on maternal health, and to improve the way
UN agencies work together on this issue.</p><p><a name="06052325000215">Importantly, good advocacy is
based upon good data. Getting reliable information on maternal deaths
is difficult in most developing countries where maternal deaths are not
recorded and where more than half of all births take place at home,
without a skilled attendant but either with relatives or alone. This is
why DFID, along with the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) and the Gates Foundation, supports IMMPACT, the
only global research initiative which is successfully identifying
effective ways in which maternal deaths can be measured and the
statistics used for high level advocacy. DFID further supports a recent
global partnership, Health Metrics Network, which aims to provide
country level support to governments to get better data.</p>

(WIPO) Intergovernmental Committee (IGC) in December 2004 which
suggests that disclosure of country of origin or source in patent
applications could be introduced on a global basis in national,

Nations is taking forward these reforms with the support and
participation of the wider donor community, including DFID, NGOs and
the Red Cross movement. In December 2005, a new UN Central Emergency
Response Fund (CERF) was approved by the UN General Assembly. It was
launched on 9 March 2006 with $254 million from 38 donors, including
$70 million from DFID. Under the direction of the UN's Emergency Relief
Coordinator, the CERF is now enabling UN humanitarian agencies to
respond rapidly to sudden disasters, such as earthquakes; time-critical
responses in slow-onset disasters, such as drought; and essential
life-saving actions in ongoing but under-funded crises such as in the
Democratic Republic of Congo and
Chad.</p><p><a name="06052325000246">A number of
proposals for strengthening the UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator system are
being taken forward, including developing a pool of suitable candidates
and associated training. Currently there are 21 trained humanitarian
co-ordinators, including some from NGO or Red Cross backgrounds.
Alongside this, DFID is leading seven other donors in piloting pooled
country level funding, to be used as directed by the resident
humanitarian co-ordinator, in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of
Congo during 2006. DFID is also providing support to the World Health
Organisation (WHO) and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) in developing
performance benchmarks for mortality, nutrition, and health. DFID has
supported progress over the last 12 months in reforming the UN
International Strategy for Disaster Reduction and in March this year we
launched our new Disaster Risk Reduction
Strategy.</p><p><a name="06052325000247">In September
2005, the UN Inter-Agency Standing Committee, which deals with
humanitarian issues, established a new 'cluster' system to deliver more
accountable and predictable humanitarian responses. Named agencies have
responsibility for coordinating responses in key sectors such as water
and sanitation (UNICEF), protection (the United Nations High
Commissioner fro Refugees (UNHCR), Logistics (the World Food Programme
(WFP), and Health (the WHO), and developing networks or clusters of
other agencies and NGOs to work together to improve capacity,
performance, and effectiveness. DFID is currently considering, along
with other donors, how best to support this
initiative.</p><p><a name="06052325000248">In January

bioethanol as a transport fuel by means of a 20 pence per litre fuel
duty incentive. Since this was introduced in January 2005, sales of
bioethanol in the UK have increased from zero to a monthly average of
some 7 million litres. We have also announced that we will introduce a
Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation in 2008, which will require all
transport fuel suppliers to ensure that biofuels account for a certain
percentage of their total fuel sales. In 2010, the level of the
Obligation will reach 5 per cent., which should mean that annual sales
of bioethanol reach over a billion litres a
year.</p><p><a name="06052325000784">European Union
fuel quality standards currently allow 5 per cent. ethanol to be
blended into petrol, and all petrol vehicles are already capable of
running on these blends. Above that level, a number of technical
modifications are required to vehicles and to refuelling points. We
introduced a new grant programme in 2005 to support the installation of
alternative refuelling infrastructure, and through this we are
supporting the installation of a small number of high level ethanol
pumps. In addition, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the
March 2006 Budget that cars manufactured to run on high level ethanol
blends will qualify for the reduced rate of Vehicle Excise Duty for
alternatively fuelled cars. Beyond that, the Government have no current
plans for other
incentives.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06052325000050">Road Fund

("contaminated land") of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. This
places local authorities under a statutory duty to inspect their areas
to identify contaminated land as defined in the Act, and to secure its
remediation, in accordance with the detailed provisions of the regime.
They are required to take a strategic and prioritised approach to the
duty of inspection. A local authority must designate contaminated land
as a &#147;special site&#148; if it meets specific legal
definitions. Where a local authority designates a site as a special
site, the Environment Agency will become the enforcing authority for
the site. In broad terms, the regime addresses unacceptable risk

Harvey:</b> To ask the Secretary of State for
Defence what recent steps the Government have taken to implement its
disarmament obligations under Article VI of the Non-Proliferation
Treaty.
[71522]</p><p><a name="06052325001655"><b><a name="06052325002257">Des
Browne:</b> The UK is fully committed to its obligations under
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, including those on disarmament
under Article VI, and has made significant disarmament steps since
1992. For example, the UK has given up both the nuclear Lance missile
and artillery roles we undertook previously with US nuclear weapons
held under dual-key arrangements, along with our maritime tactical
nuclear capability, so that Royal Navy surface 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1330W</b><br>ships no longer have any capability to carry or deploy nuclear weapons.
In 1998, the UK withdrew and dismantled the last air-launched nuclear
weapon, the Royal Air Force&#146;s WE117 nuclear bombs. The
dismantlement of the last remaining Chevaline (Polaris) warheads
occurred in April 2002, so that Trident is now our only nuclear weapons
system;</p><p><a name="06052325001656">In all, there
has been a reduction of the UK&#146;s operationally available
stockpile of nuclear weapons to fewer than 200 warheads, representing a
reduction of more than 70 per cent. in the potential explosive power of
our nuclear forces since the end of the cold war. Only one Trident
submarine is on deterrent patrol at any one time and that submarine is
normally on several days &#145;notice to fire&#146; and its
missiles are not targeted at any specific
country.</p><p><a name="06052325001657">In addition,
the UK announced in 1995 that we had stopped the production of fissile
material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, and we
continually press for negotiations to begin on a fissile material
cut-off treaty at the conference on disarmament in Geneva. We have also
been more transparent about our nuclear and fissile material
stockpiles, publishing an historical account of plutonium stockpiles,
along with an account of our highly enriched uranium earlier this
year.</p><p><a name="06052325001658">We are the only
nuclear power that has so far been prepared to take such important
steps on the route to nuclear
disarmament.</p><p><a name="06052325001659"><b><a name="06052325002258">Nick

remains as set out in the 1998 strategic defence review (SDR) (Cm 3999)
and the 2002 SDR New Chapter (Cm 5566). The UK&#146;s nuclear weapons
have a continuing use as a means of deterring major strategic military

security of the UK. We would only ever contemplate their use in extreme
circumstances of

use nuclear weapons only in extreme circumstances of self-defence. We
would not use our weapons, whether conventional or nuclear, contrary to
international law.</p><p><a name="06052325001672">A
policy of no first use of nuclear weapons would be incompatible with
our and NATO&#146;s doctrine of deterrence. We have made clear, as
have our NATO allies, that the circumstances in which any use of
nuclear weapons might have to be contemplated are extremely remote. Our
overall strategy is to ensure uncertainty in the mind of any aggressor
about the exact nature of our response, and thus to maintain effective
deterrence.</p><p><a name="06052325001673"><b><a name="06052325002270">Norman

Browne:</b> We have not undertaken a detailed assessment of
this hypothetical situation, as we have no reason to believe that the
withdrawal of US technical support for Trident is remotely likely.
However, we anticipate that, in this highly unlikely scenario, the main
impact on the UK would be in terms of the cost of maintaining the

Watson:</b> It has been the policy of successive governments,
applied to all public sector schemes and in accordance with common law
principles, that an individual cannot receive double payment for loss
of earnings and support where such compensation has been awarded by two
different routes for the same incident. The Ministry of Defence has no
plans to change that
policy.</p><p><a name="06052325001677">The armed
forces occupational pension schemes pay death benefits regardless of
whether the death was caused by service. This standard level of widows
pension is not reduced by any common law compensation
award.</p><p><a name="06052325001678">Where the death
of the serviceman has been caused by service in the armed forces, the
widow may receive compensation. Where the cause of death was on or
before 5 April 2005, this would be by way of a War Widow&#146;s
Pension under the War Pensions Scheme (WPS). This pension is paid in
full. In addition, an enhanced rate of widows pension under the
occupational pension scheme may be paid, which includes an element for
loss of earnings and support. It is only this final element that may be
affected by a common law compensation settlement, where that settlement
also includes an element for loss of earnings and
support.</p><p><a name="06052325001679">Where the
cause of death was on or after 6 April 2005, the widow may receive
compensation under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS), which
replaces both the WPS and the enhanced elements of the occupational
scheme. Because the AFCS benefits will normally be paid before any
common law compensation settlement, arrangements are in place to reduce
the common law compensation instead of seeking to claw back the AFCS
benefit that would already be in payment.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06052325000143">Predator Unmanned

the formula by which both the Further Education (FE) and the Personal

accept that this is the case. You will also be aware that whilst
overall funding is increasing, resources to fund the FE sector are
finite and priorities have to be set. In our allocations for 2006/07,
we have therefore asked providers to concentrate core funding on four
key priorities that make the biggest impact towards delivering the

terms of 2006-07 and 2007-08, it is too early to say how many courses
and venues will form part of the offer from September 2006; the LSC is
currently in dialogue with Derbyshire Adult Learning Service around
funding allocations and the proposed mix and location of the adult
learning offer from September 2006. Although indicative funding
allocations have been outlined to the Derbyshire Adult Learning
Service, the published timescale for confirmation of final allocations
is by the end of May
2006.</p></ul><a name="06052389005596"><ul><p class="tabletext">The funding
allocations for the Derbyshire Adult Learning Service since 1997 are
detailed below. Prior to 2000, Adult &amp; Community Learning
allocations to the ALS were determined by the Local Education Authority
and we have no details of these. The NDTC allocation relates to
provision transferred to the Adult Learning Service when North
Derbyshire Tertiary College was
closed.</p></ul><a name="06052389005597"><ul><p class="tabletext">Areas of
education and training outside these priority areas - such as part-time
courses for adults that do not lead to basic skills or first level 2
qualifications - will inevitably feel the funding
pressure.</p></ul><a name="06052389005598"><ul><p class="tabletext">This
dialogue will consider very carefully the impact of the reduced
allocations on service delivery and will be reviewing what
transitionary funding may be available to alleviate the same. As part
of this review, the LSC will also consider the progress made
byerbyshire Adult Learning Service in its ongoing efforts to review the
relevance, appropriateness and fit with key government targets of its
overall adult offer. This is in he context of significant increases in
funding for adult learning across Derbyshire during the 2006-07
period.</p></ul><a name="06052389005599"><ul><p class="tabletext">There will
also be fee income opportunities which Derbyshire Adult Learning
Service will want to pursue to reflect the appropriate balance of
contributions between the individual and the state for some of this
provision - such as part-time courses for adults that do not lead to
basic skills or first level 2 qualifications - and in the light of the
increasing fee assumption that will apply for
2006/07</p></ul><a name="06052389005600"><ul><p class="tabletext">Unfortunately
we do not hold information on the number of men and women attending
adult courses broken down by parliamentary constituencies within
Derbyshire. However, the number of learners accessing adult community
education across the whole of Derbyshire in 2004/05 totalled 11,955,
comprising 9,577 female learners and 2,378
male.</p></ul><a name="06052389005601"><ul><p class="tabletext">Clearly this is
only part of the overall picture, with a further 87,247 adult learners
funded via FE across Derbyshire, an additional 4,673 through work-based
learning programmes, 6,584 through the Employer Training Pilot and a
further 20,303 engaged on ESF-funded
projects.</p></ul><a name="06052389005602"><ul><p class="tabletext">Naturally I
am concerned about the impact of the 2006/07 allocation on Derbyshire's
Adult Learning Service, and as I mentioned we will be looking to help
ameliorate the effects via the provision of transitionary funding.
Verity Bullough, the LSC's Regional Director for the East Midlands and
Peter Brammall, Executive Director for Derbyshire, are meeting with
colleagues from the ALS to discuss this issue more
fully.</p></ul><a name="06052389005603"><ul><p class="tabletext">I trust that

funding allocation will have been determined individually in discussion

The differing levels of movement in funding allocations will be due to
a number of factors,

funding for adult learning has decreased within further education,
within the reduced total significantly more funding is now concentrated
on priority adult learning. Further education providers should also now
receive more funding from the collection of increased fees and from
other funding streams, notably train to gain, subject to their ability
to provide training which meets the needs of employers. In 2006-07

Skills, Improving Life Chances&#146; sets out a comprehensive
programme of change that will transform our FE system and achieve its
potential as a powerhouse of economic prosperity and social mobility.
Its central purpose is to equip both young people and adults with the
skills for productive and rewarding employment in a modern economy. In
England we will continue to spend between &#163;2.8 billion and
&#163;2.9 billion a year of taxpayers&#146; money on support for
adult learning. The broad volumes of publicly funded education and
training will be maintained; however the balance will shift. We believe
that it is right

without the basic skills or a full level 2 qualification needed if
individuals are to become effective and fulfilled members of the work
force, their families and local
communities.</p><p><a name="06052389000520">This does
mean that those outside our priority areas may have to pay more for
their courses. It does not mean that courses which are valued by
learners and providers should close because public funding is reduced.
The experience of many colleges, for example the City college, Brighton
and Hove, is that it is possible to increase fees and the number of
enrolments at the same time as providing safeguards for those adults on
benefits. I would look to providers in other areas, including Bath, to
follow these
examples.</p><p><a name="06052389000521">In the White
Paper &#145;Further Education: Raising Skills, Improving Life
Chances&#146; we reaffirmed our commitment to safeguard funding for
Personal and Community Development Learning with a budget of
&#163;210 million in 2006/07, including family learning, family
literacy, language and numeracy and neighbourhood learning in deprived
communities. In addition we set out our intention to reinvigorate this

that under previous legislation an individual identified as a risk to a

(HEIs) to consider how best they can minimise the adverse effects on
students of the current dispute, including making contingency
arrangements for examinations and other assessments. HEIs, as
autonomous bodies, are responsible for determining their own academic
and administrative affairs, including deciding what to pay their own
staff. Pay and conditions of service are subject to negotiations
between employers, their staff and their representative trade union
bodies. The Government plays no part in
this.</p><p><a name="06052389003513">While this is a
matter for unions and employers, I am disappointed that this has come
to industrial action and that students&#146; progress is being

per cent. over three years, which I believe the academic unions should
now formally put to their members with a view to ending this damaging
dispute.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06052389000038">Unspent

includes formal Regulatory Impact Assessments where appropriate, as
well as wider cross-Government work on Better Regulation. The tourism

Assurance Schemes operated by VisitBritain, the Automobile Association,

Participating businesses pay to be quality inspected, and derive
marketing and other benefits from inclusion in the Schemes. The Schemes
have, from May 2005, been improved and standardised following work
commissioned by VisitBritain and led by Alan Britten CBE. Both inbound
and domestic visitors now have confidence in a standardised inspection
regime across Britain. This has led to some changes in classification
as it affects the descriptions used by hotels and guest houses in their
own signage and promotional
material.</p><p><a name="06052389004014">The changes
to the Quality Schemes followed wide industry consultation, and
assessments of the cost and benefits to affected businesses. My
Department is satisfied that the consultation carried out was more than
adequate to reflect the views of affected businesses. The general
consensus across the industry was that the changes in classification
were highly beneficial in terms of improved consumer certainty

Since April 2006, tax credits only respond to rises in income in the
current year of more than &#163;25,000, disregarding the first
&#163;25,000 of any rise. This means that recipients will not see
their tax credits reduced as soon as their income rises, so reducing
the effective marginal deduction in any one
year.</p><p><a name="06052389005534">As a result of

households now face marginal deduction rates in excess of 70 per cent.
than did so in April 1998. The increase in the number of households
facing marginal deduction rates of between 40 and 70 per cent. is
primarily due to the introduction of tax credits, and more recently the

children.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06052389000161">Teenage

Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations in 2003. The TPS
scheme provides protection to consumers from cold-calling if they have
previously notified the caller that they do not wish to receive such
calls or have been registered with the TPS for at least 28 days. Those
making cold calls from within the UK or on behalf of UK companies from
outside the European Union are legally required not to call a number
that has registered on the TPS list. However, cold calls from non-UK
companies marketing a service or product are not covered by the TSP
scheme, as the companies and products have no link with the UK. The
Information Commissioner has responsibility for the enforcement of the
TPS scheme and considers complaints about

Causes Act 1973 governs the division of property on divorce and sets
out a number of factors to be taken into account by the courts when
considering that division. The prime consideration is the welfare of
any children. Other factors include the contribution, both financial
and other, that each spouse has made and the length of the marriage.
The courts often make property adjustment orders as part of an
assessment based on the future needs of the divorcing spouses and the
needs of any children involved. Every marriage is different and
circumstances vary so much that it would not be equitable in many cases
to impose an automatic equal
right.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06052418000023">Racial

circumstances surrounding Mrs Fordyce's claim for CA have been
carefully and sympathetically reconsidered but regrettably I can only
confirm that her award cannot be backdated to 27 July 2004. We have
considered all statutory means with which to backdate the claim but the
rules governing this are clear and cannot be relaxed or varied no

whether a special payment should be made because Mrs Fordyce has lost
out on entitlement to benefit as a direct result of a clear and
unambiguous error made by the department. It is appreciated that
without a record of the conversation held between Mrs Fordyce and the
Benefit Enquiry Line it is difficult to confirm what was actually said.
However, as explained, our advisors are fully conversant with the rules
for claiming CA and deal with a great number of enquiries on this very
issue on a daily basis. I am confident, therefore, that they would have
provided the correct advice to Mrs Fordyce. In view of this a special
payment could not be
made.</p></ul><a name="06052439005725"><ul><p class="tabletext">Despite the fact
that it is clearly stated on the DLA claim pack that if carer's want to
claim CA they should do so straightaway, we were aware that some carers
chose to wait for a decision on DLA before claiming. With new
legislation, brought in from10 April 2006, there is no longer

the state retirement pension age for women would correspondingly
increase the qualifying age for benefits such as pension credit,
housing benefits and winter fuel payments. However, there would also be
extra costs arising from working age benefits such as incapacity
benefit, income support, jobseeker's allowance, bereavement benefits,
and housing benefits. The net effect of these changes is shown in the

proposed restructuring of police forces on the provision of <i> (a)</i>

[71595]</p><p><a name="06052439002390"><b><a name="06052439006042">Mr.
Byrne:</b> The assessment found that the resources providing
the armed response function were required to be dual-function,
providing other services such as roads policing. Clearly, this caused
difficulties in trying to respond to simultaneous incidents. In
addition, many smaller forces did not provide their own (expensive)
specialist firearms services but looked to neighbouring forces to
assist them as and when incidents occurred, relying on goodwill and
building in a delay to what is often an urgent requirement.</p><p><a name="06052439002391">The impact of
restructuring will be that new forces will have sufficient resilience
to provide armed response units dedicated solely to this function. This
will allow them to gain greater skills and experience and have
sufficient capacity to focus on not just responding to firearms
incidents but also preventative work. Forces will be of sufficient size
to allow them to develop their own dedicated, specialist firearms
services, improving their training, expertise and experience of
incidents as well as negating their reliance upon others for those
services.</p><p><a name="06052439002392"><b><a name="06052439006043">Mrs.

sum of the weighted values divided by the sum of the weights. The
median is the value below which 50 per cent. of employees fall. It is
preferred over the mean for earnings data as it is influenced less by

Criminal Procedure was established in 1977 and published its final
report in January 1981 (Cmnd 8092). The Commission made a wide range of
recommendations. For example, its report is known to have influenced
legislation governing police powers in the Police and Criminal Evidence
Act 1984 and also the establishment of an independent Crown Prosecution
Service in the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. There does not appear
to have been a formal published Government response to the
recommendations in the report and it is not possible to supply the

level as well as robust partnership working are both essential parts of
our strategy to tackle crime and to sustain the confidence and trust of
the public in all parts of the
country.</p><p><a name="06052439004377">We introduced
the Rural Policing Fund in 2000-01 specifically to enhance the
visibility and accessibility of policing in rural areas. 31 police
authorities with the most widespread populations have benefited
fromthis additional funding. The annual allocation
is&#163;30 million. As part of the police funding
settlement for 2006-07 and 2007-08, we have consolidated four specific
grants, including the Rural Policing Fund, into a single provision for
each police authority to give them more control over how they may be
used. However, we expect authorities to honour commitments and agreed
policy initiatives to build on the outstanding successes achieved by,
for example, the Rural Policing Fund that has enhanced the visibility
and accessibility of policing in rural
areas.</p><p><a name="06052439004378">We have
invested in the police right across the country, and there are now more
officers on the streets than there have ever been before. Bedfordshire
police employed 121 more officers in March 2005 than it did in March
1997. Across England and Wales there were 14,072 extra officers in the
same period, giving a record total of 141,230. We have also made a
commitment that by April 2007, Neighbourhood Policing will have been
introduced to every area in England and
Wales.</p><p><a name="06052439004379">There
is a wide programme of work under way nationally to reduce violent
crime, in both rural and urban areas. We have introduced the Violent
Crime Reduction Bill, which contains new measures to ensure that police
and local communities have the powers they need to tackle guns, knives
and alcohol-related violence.</p><p><a name="06052439004380">Three
national Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaigns have taken place, with a
fourth due to start before the football World Cup. Police operations
targeting hotspots of alcohol-related disorder have included the use of
fixed penalty notices, confiscation of alcohol and test purchases to
address under-age sales. Bedfordshire police have taken part in these
campaigns.</p><br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1544W</b><br><p><a name="06052439004381">In
Bedfordshire, a number of police operations have targeted violent crime
and antisocial behaviour. Operation Coriander has seen high visibility
police patrols targeting violence and antisocial behaviour in Flitwick
with extra resources at peak times. Operation Lead has taken a similar
approach to reducing violence in the night-time economy in several
Bedfordshire towns. Additionally, alcohol exclusion zones and dispersal
zones have been set up and are being enforced in several locations
across the force
area.</p><p><a name="06052439004382">Violent crime as
measured by British Crime Survey (BCS), considered to be the most
reliable measure of violent crime in England and Wales, has fallen
significantly in recent years. According to the BCS it has nearly
halved (fallen by 43 per cent.) since a peak in 1995, an estimated 1.8
million fewer incidents. It has fallen by 34 per cent. since 1997, by
11 per cent. since 2003-04 and by 5 per cent. since 2004-05.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06052439000085">Security

Furthermore, doctors are asked to report suspected adverse reactions

Therefore, a report of a particular adverse reaction on the yellow card

factors such as an underlying or new medical condition may have played
a role. Any comparison between products is invalid as the usage of

given funding allocations for national health service dentistry based
on previous levels of expenditure during the reference period of
October 2004 to September 2005. This included all dental expenditure in
that period including any maternity, paternity or sick pay given to
qualifying dentists. In dentistry, as in any other areas of NHS
provision, maternity payments will vary over time but allowing for such
variation is a normal part of a PCT&#146;s funding
role.</p><p><a name="06052439004710"><b><a name="06052439006169">Mr.

(GDS) contract, the level of maternity pay for a principal dentist
providing NHS general dental services was based on the principal's
earnings during a 12-month test period (beginning 21 months before the
expected period of confinement). Under the new GDS contract that came
into effect from 1 April 2006, any dentist (be they the contract
holder, a partner or a practice employee) performing dental services
under a national health service contract is entitled to payments in
respect of a period of maternity leave. The level of the payment is
based on the dentist's pensionable earnings immediately before the
period of maternity leave
begins.</p><p><a name="06052439004712">Under the
transitional arrangements, a principal dentist who was entitled to NHS
maternity pay under the former GDS contract and who began her maternity
leave before 1 April is entitled to continue receiving the same level

Radiological Protection Board (now the Health Protection Agency&#146;
radiation protection division (HPA-RPD)) recommended the adoption of
international electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure guidelines. The
supporting review of scientific evidence stated that there is no
scientific consensus that exposures to EMFs at levels below currently
accepted exposure restrictions cause cancer or any other disease.
However, it is their view
that</p><a name="06052439005768"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the totality of

subsequent study by the HPA has investigated sources of residential
magnetic field exposures (www.hpa.org.uk/radiation/publications/hpa_rpd
_reports/2005/hpa_rpd_005.htm). Another study, published in June 2005
by Dr. Draper and colleagues, has estimated the number of children
living within certain distance of overhead power lines in England and
Wales (bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/reprint). Responding to the Draper
study, the HPA noted that the majority of raised ELF magnetic fields in
homes are due to variations in the electricity supply and distribution
system, the presence of substations and equipment in the home rather
than proximity to power lines. The HPA response statement is available
on its website at:

precautionary measures. SAGE is currently developing its advice and is

[67435]</p><p><a name="06052439005436"><b><a name="06052439006310">Caroline
Flint:</b> The Immigration Act 1971 gives immigration officers
the power to refer people who are subject to immigration control and
who are seeking entry to the United Kingdom to a medical inspector for
a medical examination. The immigration officer may take the findings of
the medical examination into account when deciding whether to admit the
person to the UK.</p><p><a name="06052439005437">The
long-standing policy of successive Governments are that people who come
from a country with a high annual incidence rate of tuberculosis (over
40 cases of TB per 100,000 population) and who are seeking leave to
enter the UK for more than six months and port asylum claimants should
routinely be referred for medical examination. In addition, immigration
officers should refer for medical examination anyone who appears ill,
or who mentions health or illness as a reason for coming to the UK.
Because of the large 
<br><notus-date day="22" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>22 May 2006 : Column 1589W</b><br>numbers of travellers passing through Heathrow and Gatwick airports,
there are three x-ray machines at Heathrow and one at Gatwick for
taking chest
x-rays.</p><p><a name="06052439005438">The time
pressures at points of entry mean that it is not possible, even where
x-ray machines are available, to carry out there all the tests that
would be desirable, or to make firm diagnoses of TB. That is why
long-standing policy is that checks carried out at points of entry
should be followed up by the national health service. This was
reinforced by the &#147;NICE TB Clinical Guidelines&#148; published
on the 22 March 2006, which make clear recommendations to the NHS to
identify new entrants for TB screening from port of arrival reports
(that is, information from medical inspectors), new registrations with
primary care, entry to education (including universities) and links
with statutory and voluntary groups working with new entrants. The
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence also have
provided screening protocols and toolkits for the NHS for new entrant
screening. The Department does not routinely collect figures from
points of entry on the numbers of immigrants screened for TB. Follow up
health checks on immigrants may take a variety of forms, in a variety
of settings, and are not identified as such in statistics about NHS
activity.</p><p><a name="06052439005439">As
announced in February 2005, in the Home Office&#146;s five-year
asylum and immigration strategy &#147;Controlling our Borders&#148;
(Cm 6742), the Government plan to increase the number of routine TB
checks that are done abroad. Checks overseas can be more thorough than
those that can be made under pressure of time at points of entry, and
those found to have infectious TB are required to complete treatment
before entry clearance to the UK is granted. Phase one of this overseas
programme began in autumn 2005 has been operational in six countries
(Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, Sudan, Tanzania and Thailand) since spring
2006. Phase two is planned to start later in
2006.</p><p><a name="06052439005440">The
Department and the Home Office commissioned a review of the operational
arrangements made at points of entry in England both for medical
examinations under the Immigration Act and for discharging
responsibilities under the Public Health (Aircraft), (Ships) and
(International Trains) Regulations with a view to strengthening those
arrangements. (Responsibility for the health input into operational
arrangements at points of entry in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
rests with the Scottish Ministers, National Assembly for Wales, and
Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern
Ireland). The review was carried out by a project team led by the
Health Protection Agency (HPA) and with Home Office representation.
Their report is on the Agency's website at
www.hpa.org.uk/porthealth/default.htm. Specific actions relevant to
medical examinations under the Immigration Act 1971 that are being
taken in the light of the review are
