 On 24 October I wrote to the Japanese Fisheries Minister expressing the UK's continued opposition to the killing of whales in the southern and Northwest Pacific oceans and to the hunting of small cetaceans in Japanese coastal waters. At this year's IWC meeting in June, I raised concerns over the animal welfare implications of small cetacean hunts. The UK also highlighted the plight of the Dall's porpoise in Japan and the high levels of toxic chemicals found in cetacean meat.</p>

 Part of the Dee estuary has been accepted by the European Commission as a Site of Community Interest in accordance with the provisions of the Habitats Directive.

The Statutory Nature Conservation Bodies in England and Wales have also undertaken a consultation on revisions to the existing Special Protection Area (SPA) within the estuary, classified under the Birds Directive. The net effect of these revisions will be to extend the area of the SPA. We expect to make an announcement on these issues shortly.</p>

2. Small changes should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br>
3. The reference period for Households Below Average Income figures are single financial years.<br>
4. Figures are for the United Kingdom from 2002-03 onwards. Earlier years are for Great Britain only.<br>
5. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication HBAI series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or 'equivalised') for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br>
6. For the HBAI series, incomes have been equivalised using Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) equivalisation factors.<br>
7. A family is defined as a man or woman living together as husband and wife, including cohabiters. From January 2006, same-sex civil partners are also included in the same benefit unit. A household will consist of one or more families.<br>
8. Number of children in low income have been rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.<br>

 The Department has had no recent discussions, and only a small number of representations, about enabling housing benefit (HB) calculated using local housing allowance (LHA) rules, to be paid into the Post Office card account (POCA).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="91130w0007.htm_para0"><a name="09113037000117">One of the key features of the LHA rules is that, where possible, the benefit is paid to the customer, so that they can take more personal responsibility for their housing, helping them to prepare for when they move into work. In support of this, we want customers living in the private sector to have housing benefit paid into a bank account and to set up a direct debit or standing order to pay their rent to their landlord.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="91130w0007.htm_para1"><a name="09113037000118">The POCA is a simple account designed to receive payments of benefits and pensions. It does not have the facility for the customer to set up direct debit or standing order payments and is therefore not suitable to receive payments of HB. The Department has recently signed a new contract with Post Office Ltd. for the POCA and no provision was made for direct debits, standing orders or for HB payments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="91130w0007.htm_para2"><a name="09113037000119">Most people should be able to open a basic bank account which can be used to receive HB and which also has the facility to set up direct debits or standing orders. There are over 25 such accounts, including 17 basic bank accounts which can be accessed at post offices. These accounts enable customers to use their local post office if this is important to them and also provides additional footfall for sub-postmasters.</p>

 Risk and hazard assessments for natural gas pipelines are based on research carried out over many years by pipeline operators (for example; British Gas, Shell) and HSE.

This advice is supplemented and supported by a rolling programme of campaigns such as the Defence Road Safety Week (23-27 November 2009). The policy also provides guidance for line managers on causes of impairment of driving and preventative measures, and on accident reporting requirements which also apply to private vehicles being used on official duties. It is a requirement that all incidents or accidents resulting in fatality or serious injury are investigated and lessons identified are shared to prevent recurrence.</p>

As it remained the same project, and the name change was implemented over a period of time, it is not possible to clearly distinguish between expenditure under each of the two names. A reasonable approximation, however, would be to consider expenditure from financial year 2009-10 as being under the SDP name, and expenditure in previous years as being under the ISOLUS name.</p>

The regulations list a number of criteria, by way of example, that contracting authorities can use to identify which tender would be the most economically advantageous.

The space occupied by Press Office staff, and cost of their facilities, varies according to staffing levels throughout the year. Press Office uses communal facilities such as meeting rooms and break out spaces which are shared with other staff in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

 The UK remains seriously concerned about the situation in Fiji, particularly following developments in April 2009, when the regime abrogated the constitution, suspended the courts and introduced Public Emergency Regulations, including press and media censorship. We are particularly concerned that the regime has ruled out elections before 2014, and we have called for a prompt return to democratic processes and institutions. Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth on 1 September 2009. The UK maintains that an inclusive and open dialogue with all parties in Fiji, as well as international partners, is needed to help Fiji make an early and successful return to a democratically elected Government.

The elections themselves were a critical marker in Kosovo's emergence as a multi-ethnic democracy, though improvements are still needed for Kosovo fully to meet European standards.

 All life sentence and indeterminate sentence for public protection (IPP) prisoners are eligible to have their case for release on parole considered once they have served the minimum period as set down by the court.

 In the National Offender Management Service (NOMS), there is no formal requirement to notify headquarters whenever a member of staff is accused of misconduct.

 There are two complementary processes for determining the effectiveness of youth offending teams (YOTs). The HMI probation inspection regime looks in depth at practice around the key areas of public protection, safe guarding and risk of harm. The inspection process reports its findings in terms of the level of improvement that is required against each of the core areas. The descriptors used are as follows:</p>

 The published national statistics on adult and juvenile reoffending are not broken down by area. However, as part of the National Indicator Set, NI19: Juvenile Reoffending provide these data at the local level. This measure is different to the published National Statistics on reoffending for England and Wales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="91130w0018.htm_para6"><a name="09113051000398">Juvenile reoffending data are available for 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2008. For 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 data are based on a cohort of offenders that received a pre-court disposal (reprimand or final warning) or a first-tier or community penalty or were released from custody between October and December of that year. Data on this previous measure for the 2002-05 cohorts were reported in early 2004-07 respectively. After 2007 the basis of the measure changed to offenders that received a pre-court disposal (reprimand or final warning) or a first-tier or community penalty or were released from custody between January and March. Data on this new basis are available for the 2005 and 2008 cohorts-the former submitted retrospectively in September 2008, and the latter returned in July 2009.</p>

The primary difference is that the data source is administrative data held by youth offending teams, whereas the National Statistics are produced using the police national computer. There are therefore differences in the offences which count towards reoffending. In addition to this, local juvenile reoffending data are based on a one year follow up period with a further three months allowed for any cautions or convictions to occur, whereas the National Statistics allow a six month period for cautions or convictions.</p>

Applying these percentages to the mid-2006 population estimates of people aged 16 or over in Great Britain suggests that 5.6 million people held shares other than employee shares or share options and 2.3 million people held employee shares or share options. These figures should not be added together to estimate the total number of people in Great Britain owning shares, as some individuals may own both types of share. The estimates do not include any indirect investment in shares through for example ISAs, unit trusts or pension funds.</p>

Of this £85 million was delivered through better procurement services including collaborative contracts, consolidated IT and rationalisation of the estate, forming part of the Department's contribution to the Government's £35 billion target for the current spending review period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_367"><a name="91130w0022.htm_para22"><a name="09120111000118">Building upon this work, we will use the Operational Efficiency Programme to bring extra focus to achieving greater efficiency in a number of cross-cutting areas. This will include taking additional steps to drive improvements in our back office, collaborative procurement, property and IT. The details of these savings will next be published in the 2010 autumn performance report.</p>

 It is not possible to provide a comprehensive figure for the cost of enforced or voluntary removals because there are many different factors which may or may not be involved in the cost of a case (such as detention costs, travel costs, and the cost of escorting the individual in question). We are unable to disaggregate the specific costs and any attempt to do so would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

The table on page 36 of the report sets out 12 typical profiles, including cases which result in either enforced or voluntary removal, and the lower to upper end estimate of costs either excluding or including accommodation and support costs. For example, profile four, estimates the cost of a case resulting in the enforced removal of a single, undetained adult after he or she has exhausted their appeal rights, as being between £7,900 and £17,000 excluding accommodation and support, or £12,000 to £25,600 including accommodation and support.

 The Government are advised by the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) on the case for meeting specific skill shortages through the Points Based System (PBS) for non-EEA nationals. In particular, the MAC advises the Government on the coverage of the Shortage Occupation List which informs the scoring of points under Tier 2 (skilled workers) of the PBS. In doing so, the MAC not only identifies those occupations where skills are in short supply but also assesses the extent to which it is sensible for such shortage to be remedied through the admission of migrant workers.</p>

The Government have also announced, on 11 November, their National Skills Strategy in which the Government made clear their intention to strengthen the linkage between the MAC's work to identify those areas where migration could assist in meeting immediate skills needs and future work by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills to develop and prioritise training strategies.</p>

 The Government have consistently emphasised the economic and social benefits that migration brings if it is properly managed. In introducing the points based system, the Government have sought to maximise the economic benefits of migration by ensuring that we admit those who possess skills that UK businesses and providers of public services need or who will contribute to UK exports by studying here. However, as both the Home Secretary's speech on 4 November and the Prime Minister's speech on 12 November have made clear, it is equally important that the migration system is proofed against abuse and protects the interests of communities and resident workers if the public is to have confidence in it and the benefits it delivers.</p>

The reasonable grounds decision is a low threshold which is made following multi-agency consultation and engagement. There is also an opportunity for first responders to provide additional information if the competent authority is initially unable to make a positive identification. This helps to ensure that the right decisions are taken and victims are properly identified. There are also standard avenues for appealing immigration decisions, and a reasonable grounds decision can be subject to judicial review.</p>

 Homeowners Mortgage Support is part of the range of assistance available at every stage to households struggling with their mortgage. The scheme encourages lenders to allow households who have suffered a temporary income shock to defer some of their interest payment, if this is necessary to make their monthly payment affordable. The Department plans to publish information in December on the number of households who have been helped through Homeowners Mortgage Support. Statistics from the Financial Services Authority show that more than 135,000 borrowers were benefiting from forbearance offered by their lender at the end of June 2009, an increase of 17 per cent. on the previous quarter.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many and what proportion of staff of his Department, its executive agencies and non-departmental public bodies work flexibly or part-time; and what his Department's policy is on making jobs available on a job-share or flexible basis. [301326]</p>

 The Department's centrally held records show that at 1 April 2009, 0.3 per cent. of civil servants in the Department were in job share arrangements. 9 per cent. were working part time and 0.2 per cent. were working in term time only.</p>

The Department encourages staff to work flexibly through providing opportunities such as part-time working, job sharing, term time only working and the use of flexitime.

1. The rates of funding are per full-time equivalent UK/EU student for 2009/10 and reflect the standard rates of grant provided for each institution through HEFCE's main teaching grant plus those other elements of its teaching grant that can be clearly attributed to undergraduate students (funding for widening access, improving retention, foundation degrees and part-time undergraduate students). It does not include other elements of teaching grant that are calculated at the whole institution level.<br>
2. The figures also exclude income from tuition fees, other public funders such as the NHS and the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) or from other sources.<br>
3. The main reason for variation in the rates of funding received by institutions is their mix of students between different subject areas. Hence the highest rates are received by institutions specialising in medicine or veterinary science and the lowest rates by institutions specialising in classroom-based subjects. Other causes of variation are the extent to which institutions receive funding to reflect their additional costs associated with widening participation and supporting students more at risk of not completing their studies, and their mix between full-time and part-time and between foundation degrees and other undergraduate students.<br>

 Representatives of the Department regularly meet with a range of companies. However, the Department does not have a central record of the dates when meetings with executives of Royal Dutch Shell have taken place. To separately identify them over the specified period of time would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

 The Student Loans Company (SLC) has released figures on its website to show the levels of processing and payments made for Student Finance England for the 2009-10 academic year. I am advised that the Student Finance England is currently processing paper applications received from end of October, and on-line applications received from 15 November. Student Finance England expects to clear new cases within a four to six week turnaround time, subject to receipt of the appropriate evidence.</p>

Student Finance England will have made interim payments to a number of these students to ensure that they can start their courses. In such cases, provided the applicant has supplied the relevant evidence by the end of October, Student Finance England will re-assess these applications and confirm whether any additional payments can be made, by 14 December 2009.</p>
