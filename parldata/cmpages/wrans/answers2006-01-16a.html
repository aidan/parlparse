 Bonfires on domestic and business premises, including those in rural areas, are already regulated under the statutory nuisance provisions in sections 79 to 82 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.

Failure to comply with the terms of an abatement notice will, upon summary conviction, result in a fine of up to &#163;5,000 for domestic premises and &#163;20,000 for business premises. In addition, Section 2 of the Clean Air Act 1993 prohibits emissions of dark smoke from industrial and trade premises, which can include agricultural and horticultural premises.

In 2001 Defra funded a national study of information on long term coastal processes and evolution over the next century (Futurecoast).

As the packaging waste recycling targets, set in the regulations, increase between now and 2008 it is expected that producers will have to ensure that more packaging waste is extracted from the household waste stream for recycling. Producers will therefore need to work with local authorities e.g. through their packaging compliance schemes and/or accredited reprocessors/exporters, to ensure that packaging materials can be collected by local authorities for recycling, e.g. by co-financing such collections. This is particularly so where producers&#039; needs extend beyond the local authorities&#039; own recycling obligations.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">The nZEC project aims to demonstrate coal-fired power generation with carbon capture and storage technology in China by 2020. The technology has the potential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by some 90 per cent. This is in recognition that carbon dioxide emissions from China&#039;s increasing coal use are set to double by 2030.</p>
</ul>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">We have just signed an agreement with the Chinese Government to take this work forward (21 December 2005).

 A new outline Strategic Plan, covering the period 2006 to 2011 was agreed by the Commission in July 2005. The text is available via the Commission&#039;s intranet and internet pages. This new plan confirms that the primary purpose of the House Service is to enable the House and its Members to perform their parliamentary duties effectively. Beyond this it has a duty to promote public understanding of Parliament&#039;s work and role through the provision of information and access. The plan also sets out six priority areas for the period 2006 to 2011: accommodation and works, human resources, information for the public, information management and ICT, planning and management and security. For each of these areas the board of management has developed a detailed statement of its aims for the planning period. These have been incorporated in the 2006 Corporate Business Plan.

A further statement on performance will be provided in the 2005&#150;06 Annual Report. The views of Members and other stakeholders on the implementation of elements of both the core tasks and the development objectives have been expressed in a number of ways, including reports and advice from the Administration Committee and its predecessors in the last Parliament and the Modernisation Committee, and the 2003 Survey of Services. It is anticipated that a further survey of services will be conducted during the current Parliament.

However, we remain open to the IMF&#039;s projections that the financial gap may widen dramatically in the next financial year and for a number of years after that, as the current construction industry boom subsides. We will continue to keep the situation under close review.

<a name="stpa_97">DFID provided some &#163;250,000 to Cayman Islands for emergency supplies and services in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Ivan. We have not provided specific assistance for reconstruction. We understand, however, that the European Union is considering a request from the Cayman Islands Government for support to rebuild homes. DFID&#039;s focus has been aimed at improving and strengthening disaster preparedness in all UK Overseas Territories in the region. In the Cayman Islands, we also funded a study of the impact of Hurricane Ivan to help learn from the Cayman Islands&#039; experience of handling the emergency.

 Jordan is now a middle income country, which receives relatively large amounts of donor funding in relation to its levels of poverty. DFID has provided bilateral funding in the form of technical co-operation (i.e. support for projects) as well as other types of bilateral funding for example humanitarian assistance and debt relief. DFID&#039;s bilateral programme with Jordan closed in September 2005. DFID also provided funding to Jordan through our contributions to multilateral organisations including the EC and the World Bank which we will continue to do.

 The only legislation introduced by DFID since 1 May 2002 was the International Development Act 2002, which put furthering poverty reduction at the heart of the Secretary of State&#039;s statutory powers. Subject to this overarching objective, as defined by the Act, it did not outlaw any specific activities. The restriction in the Act over how funds voted by Parliament can be used means, for example, that aid cannot be tied to the purchase of British goods and services.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on his road detrunking programme.  [42410]</p>




<p><a name="st_127"><a name="60116w14.html_spnew4"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The policy of transferring non-core trunk roads (detrunking) to local highway authorities was first set out in the White Paper &quot;A New Deal for Transport&quot; published in July 1998. Detrunking allows the Highways Agency to concentrate on the operation of the strategic trunk road network, whilst enabling local authorities to consider their own priorities for the improvement of non-core routes. The aim has been to transfer some 3,200 km (30 per cent.) of the trunk road network (as it was in April 1999) to local authorities in a phased programme. To date more than 80 per cent. (around 2,628 km) of the programme has been completed since April 2001. Prior to detrunking, the Highways Agency and local authorities agree the transfer of an appropriate level of funding for annual maintenance and in some cases for outstanding capital projects.

<p><a name="st_141"><a name="60116w16.html_spnew5"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 The New Approach To Appraisal (NATA) was announced in the Government&#039;s 1998 White Paper &quot;A new deal for transport: better for everyone&quot;. The NATA provides a comprehensive assessment of the main impacts of a scheme on the environment, safety, the economic performance, accessibility and integration so that all the key criteria are considered in decisions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60116w16.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_133">NATA was first used to inform decisions taken during the 1998 Roads Review and results for 67 schemes which were candidates for the targeted programme of improvements were published in &quot;A new deal for trunk roads in England: Understanding the New Approach To Appraisal&quot;. The Highways Agency has continued to use the NATA for all major (that is, those costing more than &#163;5 million) highway schemes since then. It also introduced a simplified version of NATA for use on small schemes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60116w16.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_134">Subsequently, the NATA was revised to be applicable to other transport modes, including rail, light rail and bus schemes. NATA has been used for appraisal of Community Infrastructure Funding. The Department has required the use of the NATA for the appraisal of all Local Transport Plan major schemes (road and public transport) since 2000. The NATA was the basis for OPRAF&#039;s 1999 &quot;Planning Criteria&#151;a guide to the appraisal of support for passenger rail services&quot;, revised in 2003 by the Strategic Rail Authority and published as &quot;Appraisal Criteria&#151;a guide to the appraisal of support for passenger and freight rail services&quot;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60116w16.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_135">The NATA has been applied to a wide range of transport projects proposed by a number of different agencies. The Department does not hold a comprehensive record of all of these projects and to compile one would be prohibitively

<a name="stpa_136">NATA is used to appraise and inform the prioritisation of schemes. A range of appraisal requirements including assessments using the NATA system apply to all schemes submitted to the Department for funding, with the level of detail required in the appraisal being proportional to the scale and complexity of the scheme. For each scheme, the Appraisal Summary Table provides an indication of the impact of the scheme on each of five criteria.

<p><a name="st_248"><a name="60116w26.html_spnew0"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 The contractual arrangements for future oil exploration and production are a decision for the incoming Iraqi Government and the Government have not sought to influence this decision. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office did support a 2003 independent study which set out the full range of possible contractual financing arrangements to allow the rehabilitation and development of the Iraqi oil industry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60116w26.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_219">Under the outgoing Iraqi Transitional Government, the Ministry of Oil was clear that the option of concluding Production Sharing Agreements would be one of a range of contracts that might be needed to help redevelop the oil industry. This is because after decades of isolation, Iraq has weak technical and managerial capacity combined with an ageing infrastructure with severely outdated production facilities. Furthermore, there has been no explorations for new fields since the 1980s and limited post-2003 investment and poor maintenance. Given the state of the infrastructure, and the US$20 billion needed for reconstruction of the oil industry, it is highly unlikely that the Iraqi Government will be able to fund investment in the oil industry itself. Without the needed investment the oil industry will not be able to fuel the required sustainable economic growth in Iraq.

This relationship allows for the free and frank exchange of information on the understanding that it will be treated in confidence.
