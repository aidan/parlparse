<a name="30619w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 We have received representations from a number of disabled people affected by the withdrawal of breakdown cover for these vehicles and we have discussed this issue both with the motoring organisations and with representatives of wheelchair manufacturers and suppliers. We will continue to support initiatives to offer a similar service in future.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport pursuant to his Answer of 12 May 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 128W, on railways, whether Thameslink has asked for approval from <i>(a)</i> the SRA and <i>(b)</i> Network Rail to exceed the prescribed journey times; and if he will list Thameslink core routes and prescribed permitted journey times.  [117274]<P>
<P>
<P>

 The SRA have informed me that the information they gave me for the answer given on 12 May 2003 was incorrect. In consequence, the hon. Member was misinformed. I regret this has happened. The SRA have apologised for the error. The SRA have now told me that Thameslink have, in fact, requested and received approval from them to exceed the prescribed maximum journey times for the services listed in the table. The SRA have granted derogations as the prescribed journey times are being exceeded because of capacity constraints, and in several cases, because this allows services to be extended from Luton, where they would otherwise terminate, to Bedford. Network Rail does not prescribe maximum journey times.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport pursuant to his answer of 10 June 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 743W, on uninsured drivers, what the overall cost of uninsured driving was in Great Britain between 1997 and 2001; and what assessment has been made of the average increase in the insurance premium of a motorist in each of these years.  [120042]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30619w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Estimates from the insurance industry show that, for the years 1997 to 2001 inclusive, the estimated cost of uninsured driving was &#163;1,280 million. This is a running figure that includes cases arising from accidents that happened (and were settled) during those years and accidents occurring in previous years but only settled in those years.

 The Northern Ireland Office aims to ensure that its staff are treated fairly and equally by promoting equal opportunities policies whereby no employee or job applicant is unfairly discriminated against either directly or indirectly on a number of grounds, including age. All staff are provided with a copy of this policy.
<P>

<a name="30619w01.html_para7">In addition, in compliance with its statutory duty under section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, the Department has due regard to the promotion of equality of opportunity between persons in nine specified categories, which include persons of different ages.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30619w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Dodds: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how much of the underspend by Departments in Northern Ireland for the year ending 31 March 2002 will not be carried forward to the next financial year.  [119045]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30619w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 The full amount of end-year flexibility (EYF) that Northern Ireland is entitled to carry forward from 2001&#150;02 is being retained under the normal arrangements. Underspends to be carried forward into 2002&#150;03 in respect of 2001&#150;02 were originally based on an estimate of departmental spend made in the early summer of 2002. This has subsequently been revised to take account of actual departmental spend in 2001&#150;02 and will be drawn down in 2003&#150;04, subject to agreement by the Treasury.




<P>
<P><I>19 Jun 2003 : Column 339W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30619w02.html_para0">Of the actual underspend by Northern Ireland Departments for 2001&#150;02, some amounts were outside the EYF arrangements: resources of &#163;3.6 million in respect of the Interconnector scheme were not carried forward into future years. This was a specific ring-fenced and time-bounded scheme where the original allocation was not required in full. In addition, resources of &#163;9.9 million in respect of the EU Peace and Reconciliation Programme I (EUPRP I) were not carried forward into future years. Due to changes in the Sterling/Euro exchange rates and other technicalities during the life of the Programme, these resources were not required to secure the full draw-down of eligible funding from Brussels.
<P>

<a name="30619w02.html_para1">Under Treasury rules, some Reserve claims have to be deducted from the following year's end-year flexibility (EYF): in respect of 2001&#150;02, amounts of &#163;1.9 million had to be treated in that way. Also, as had been agreed following the 2000 Spending Review (SR 2000), the EYF claim was abated by an amount of &#163;22.1 million to correct an over-allocation which arose in SR 2000. These had been allowed for in the planning of budgets and did not affect departmental budgets.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30619w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 Within the Northern Ireland Office the efficiency target, built into last year's Spending Review outcome, requires the Department to continue to secure 2.5 per cent. efficiency savings annually in our core departmental administration costs. These core costs of &#163;57.6 million represent 34 per cent. of the department's total administration cost limit.
<P>

<a name="30619w02.html_para2">Within the 11 Departments of the Northern Ireland Administration the 2003&#150;04 spending plans do not contain specific efficiency savings targets expressed in money terms or as a percentage of departmental expenditure limits. However, the drive to achieve greater efficiency is evidenced by the ongoing development and refinement of Public Service Agreements and Service Delivery Agreements. In addition, the key aim of the reform agenda and Departmental Reform Plans is to improve performance in terms of delivering better quality services to the public.

 No projects were funded during 2001.

The information relates to projects that have been allocated funding with a postal address in the North Belfast Parliamentary Constituency. Where the project address is incomplete, further analysis has been carried out on the applicant address. The figures, therefore, have been produced by first including those projects with a project address in Belfast North and then adding those where the project address is incomplete but the applicant address is in Belfast North. However, where it is apparent that the benefit of the project clearly falls outside North Belfast, these amounts have been excluded. Also, the impacts of any project may extend beyond the geographical location of the project itself.

<P>
<a name="30619w02.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Dodds: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what the interest rate for borrowings is under the Reform and Reinvestment Initiative; and what the interest rate for PPP projects is.  [119041]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30619w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 The Reinvestment and Reform Initiative (RRI) is about tackling Northern Ireland's infrastructure deficit and improving and reforming public services. As part of the RRI, there is the power to access borrowing from the National Loans Fund (NLF). The Public Works Loans Board (PWLB) is the statutory body that facilitates all lending from the NLF and they publish the interest rates through their website on a daily basis (www.pwlb.gov.uk). The interest rate on any loan will be dictated by the prevailing rate at the time it is drawn down.
<P>

<a name="30619w02.html_para8">It is not appropriate to consider PPP projects as borrowing by the public sector. Rather, the PPP approach allows additional resources to be levered in from the private sector sooner than is possible under conventional procurement, with additional benefits in terms of value for money and efficiency. While the cost of capital for the private sector may be higher than borrowing from Treasury, this is mitigated by other cost, risk and service advantages inherent in the approach. Value for money over the lifetime of the contract is the key concept.

 The Review of Public Administration (RPA) was initiated by the Northern Ireland Executive in June 2002. The original work programme for the review envisaged final decisions being taken by the Executive in December 2003. The suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly has, however, affected this timetable. The RPA has continued with its scheduled programme of engagement, research and study visits, but I decided earlier this year not to go out to public consultation in advance of the elections to the Assembly, then scheduled for 29 May 2003.

<a name="30619w03.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how many persons lost their lives in conflict-related incidents in each year since 1973 and were the subject of a murder investigation conducted by the police; how many murders in each year were eventually the subject of a successful prosecution; and how many unsolved murders remain from each year.  [118960]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30619w03.html_spnew2"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The information cannot be provided in the format requested. Table A provides the number of murders for each year since 1973 and the number of these murders where persons have subsequently been charged. Table B provides the number of convictions for murders in each year since 1993. We are unable to provide data prior to 1993 as to do so would require a substantial manual exercise and would incur a disproportionate cost.

<P>
<a name="30619w03.html_wqn3"><B> Lynne Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what differences there are between the death-in-service gratuities payable under the armed forces pension scheme and those payable in similar circumstances to members of the Brigade of Gurkhas; and if he will make a statement.  [119685]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30619w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The death-in-service gratuity paid under the armed forces pension scheme varies according to whether or not the death is considered attributable to, or aggravated by, service. If the death is considered non-attributable, a tax-free basic death-in-service lump sum is payable, this is approximately equivalent to the individual's representative annual rate of pay. If the death is considered attributable to service, in addition to the basic death-in-service lump sum, a tax-free attributable gratuity is also payable; this increases the overall rate of death-in-service benefit to between one and 1&#189; times the individual's representative annual rate of pay.
<P>

<a name="30619w03.html_para3">The pension and gratuity arrangements for Gurkha soldiers, which are different to those of the armed forces pension scheme, stem from the 1947 Tri-partite Agreement and are linked to Indian Army rates. An examination of these arrangements in 1999 resulted in substantially increased pension payments for all British Gurkha pensioners and enhanced gratuity provision in the event of death in service.
<P>

<a name="30619w03.html_para4">Similar to the wider Army, the death-in-service gratuity payable to a Gurkha varies according to whether or not the death is considered attributable to, or aggravated by, service. If death-in-service is attributable then the Death-in-Service Gratuity payable to a Gurkha is the same as that paid to the equivalent rank in the wider British Army. If a death in service is not attributable, the normal provisions of the Gurkha pension and gratuities scheme apply, and the death element of the Death Cum-Retirement Gratuity is payable.

<P>
<a name="30619w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 United Kingdom forces are required to provide, within their means and capabilities, medical treatment to Iraqi civilians.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30619w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The vast majority of injured Iraqis have been treated at Iraqi hospitals, and in the United Kingdom's area of operations we have made every effort to restore power, water and medical supplies to those facilities. All of the major hospitals in Baghdad and Basra are now functioning.
<P>

<a name="30619w03.html_para6">However, where certain specialist skills have been required, Iraqis have been treated in UK medical facilities. In the very small number of cases where the necessary medical capabilities are not available in theatre, those Iraqis have been airlifted to UK hospitals for treatment. We will continue to provide medical treatment where possible for as long as UK forces remain in Iraq, although the requirement to do so will reduce over time as Iraq's civilian medical infrastructure continues to improve.

However, in some operational circumstances, this may not always be possible. In addition, under the terms of the Reserve Forces Act 1996, Reservists cannot be deployed for more than 12 months in any three years, unless they volunteer otherwise, and in the case of consultants their deployment patterns would be in line with that of their Regular counterparts.

 The average number of staff employed by the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office during the Financial Year ended 31 March 2003 was 940 compared with 907 in the previous year. The numbers include permanent and temporary staff and Service personnel. There are four staff employed at the Chart Maintenance Unit, Faslane, this is unchanged from 2002. The increase in numbers during the year ended 31 March 2003 primarily reflects the recruitment of additional trainee chart compilation personnel in anticipation of the future retirement of significant numbers of experienced staff.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence whether anti-ballistic missiles will be located in the UK once the Fylingdales radar base has been upgraded.  [120178]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30619w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The upgrade of the radar at RAF Fylingdales does not of itself commit the United Kingdom Government to the acquisition or deployment of a missile defence system, and no such decision has been taken. The United States has not made any request to site interceptor missiles in the UK as part of its missile defence system.

<P>
<a name="30619w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The cost of the upgrade, including the installation of new equipment, will be met by the United States. The United Kingdom will continue to operate and support the radar. The upgrade is expected to have a minimal effect on these running costs, which are of the order of &#163;20 million per annum.

 The Ministry of Defence adheres to the guidance produced by the Cabinet Office on the handling of ministerial and other correspondence which emphasises that appropriate arrangements should be in place to ensure that the quality of all replies is high. Similarly, we subscribe to the Cabinet Office guidance on plain written English. Departmental publications are prepared in line with the Guidance on the Work of the Government Information and Communication Service.

 The Royal Households, including representatives from The Prince of Wales' and The Duke of Edinburgh's Offices, are members of a working group with representatives from environmental organisations including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, World Wildlife Fund and Forest Stewardship Council. The group looks at the way the Palaces can be more environmentally friendly, and at the Household's environmental policy to promote sustainability, and ensures that appropriate guidance is obtained and followed.
<P>

<a name="30619w05.html_para2">The Royal Household has a policy of using timber from renewable sources for construction work. Other environmentally friendly activities include the construction of combined heat and power units at Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle and a borehole for chilling the air-conditioning at The Queen's Gallery, Buckingham Palace.

<P>

<a name="30619w06.html_para2">As part of the Government's programme of tourism reform, the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) are, from April 2003, playing a stronger part in the strategic leadership of tourism, with the Regional Tourist Boards (RTBs) as their natural delivery partners. Guidance has been issued to the RDAs on how tourism should be covered in their Corporate Plans and Regional Economic Strategies, including the development of Regional Sustainable Tourism Strategies in partnership with RTBs, and sub-regional and local tourism organisations. Advantage West Midlands (RDA) will lead this process in the West Midlands, taking into account the tourism potential of rural areas, and in 2003&#150;04, will receive &#163;252,000 to pass on to the Visit Heart of England Tourist Board, subject to agreed targets and objectives.
<P>

<a name="30619w06.html_para3">VisitBritain's current domestic marketing campaign, "Enjoy England", will benefit rural tourism businesses that depend largely on domestic tourism.

<a name="30619w06.html_para4">The Rural Enterprise Scheme (RES), part of Defra's England Rural Development Programme, provides project-based support for diversifying the rural economy.

<a name="30619w06.html_para5">Defra is promoting countryside recreation through the new statutory right of access to open countryside. The Countryside Agency is taking forward several relevant projects, such as: integrated quality management of rural tourist destinations; retaining visitor expenditure in rural areas; promoting environmentally responsible tourism businesses; promoting local produce with the Youth Hostels Association.
<P>

<a name="30619w06.html_para6">Government support is not limited to direct funding for tourism. This Department alone spends some &#163;1 billion per year, for example, on the arts, the historic environment, museums and galleries, much of which directly benefits rural tourism across the country.

 The trade in bushmeat in this country is controlled mainly through domestic legislation designed to protect animal and human health, although some species traded as bushmeat are also regulated under EU legislation implementing the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Illegal imports of bushmeat are being tackled under the illegal imports Action Plan.

 The UK Government have strongly supported the aims of the European Commission's proposals on reforming the Common Agricultural Policy and my right hon.

<P>
<a name="30619w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The European Commission's CAP reform proposals to break the link between subsidies and production would enable producers to respond more directly to market signals. This may reduce employment in direct agricultural production, while creating new opportunities from diversified land uses. We estimate that the economic benefits from such restructuring could be worth Euro400 million per year in the UK.

<P>
<a name="30619w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government's Waste Strategy 2000 set national targets for the recycling or composting of at least 25 per cent. of household waste by 2005, 30 per cent. by 2010 and 33 per cent. by 2015. To underpin these national targets we have set challenging statutory recycling and composting targets for all local authorities in England.
<P>

<a name="30619w07.html_para2">We encourage recycling above incineration, but incineration with energy recovery is more sustainable than landfill. We have no plans at present to discourage the use of this option, albeit that it is one option of waste management.

 Data are not held at constituency level so there is no specific information available for the Bury St. Edmunds constituency. However, there are currently no payments outstanding for Suffolk, there are also no payments outstanding for Cambridgeshire. There is one payment outstanding in Norfolk and one in Essex under the 2002 Arable Area Payments Scheme (AAPS), both for reasons beyond the RPA's control. For 2002 main AAPS payments, the regulatory payment window ran from 16 November 2002 to 31 January 2003.

 My Department does not have a target in the terms expressed. The Department has value for money targets arising from the Government's spending reviews in 2000 and 2002 (SR2000 & SR2002). Following SR2000, schools can now meaningfully compare costs with one another and thus improve value for money year on year. We established a framework of Consistent Financial Reporting requiring all maintained schools to report their accounts in a standardised way, which has been operational since 1 April 2003. Following SR 2002, the Department is developing a challenging target covering minimum performance and value for money in FE colleges and other post-16 providers.

<P>
<a name="30619w09.html_spnew10"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) distributes a portion of its block grant to higher education institutions according to the quality of their research as measured by the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), and the volume of research they carry out. This provides equitable funding to institutions of all sizes. The White Paper, "The future of higher education", set out plans to strengthen higher education research by increasing substantially the funding available, providing further support to the best research departments and institutions, promoting collaboration and encouraging and supporting promising departments and emerging subject areas. HEFCE is considering how best to implement the White Paper plans. Some institutions have seen reductions in their research funding for the coming year, typically where most of their research falls below international standards of excellence. However, the Government do not intend to restrict research funding to a particular group of universities. In the longer term funding may be affected by Sir Gareth Roberts' review of research assessment, commissioned by the higher education funding bodies. The report of that review was published for consultation last month (http://www.ra-review.ac.uk/). It recommends a more flexible system of research assessment, including different types of assessment for institutions and departments with different levels of research. As now, HEFCE would decide how to use the assessment results in funding institutions.

The Higher Education Funding Council for England has responsibility for funding the number of HE places in English HE institutions, but these places are funded in terms of four broad price groups, rather than individual subjects. The price groups recognise that some subjects, such as those that involve laboratory or workshop activities, require higher levels of resource to those that are mainly classroom based. Veterinary Science is included in highest price group along with clinical medicine and dentistry.

To ask the Solicitor-General pursuant to her answer of 8 April 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 154W, whether she is now in a position to make a statement on the implications for the Crown Prosecution Service of the case of Mrs. Sally Clark.  [119872]<P>

<P>
<a name="30619w10.html_spmin1"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Court of Appeal has now given its judgment in full in the case of Mrs. Sally Clark. In giving its reasons for quashing the murder convictions, the Court found the convictions were unsafe. No fault was attributed to the Crown Prosecution Service.
<P>

<a name="30619w10.html_para8">The Court of Appeal focused on the non-disclosure of potentially significant evidence by Dr. Williams. It also considered the use of statistical evidence by Professor Meadow.
<P>

<a name="30619w10.html_para9">The Crown Prosecution Service has already responded to the Sally Clark judgment. It is in the process of issuing guidance to all Chief Crown Prosecutors instructing them to identify cases involving either Doctor Williams or Professor Meadow and ensuring that the defence are made aware of the judgment. Such disclosure would also be applied to any future cases. The implications for previous cases involving Doctor Williams has been discussed and is still being assessed. The Crown Prosecution Service is involved, alongside other relevant agencies, in consideration of that issue.

<P>

 The Home Office is committed to promoting equality and diversity for the communities we serve and also for our staff. This accords with the Department's purpose of working with individuals and communities to build a safe, just and tolerant society and our aim to support strong and active communities in which people of all races and backgrounds are valued and participate on equal terms. The Home Office published its Race Equality Scheme on 25 April 2002, in line with the requirements of the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000. We have identified a number of areas of our work as having a high potential impact on race equality and race relations, including policies on reducing crime and disorder, on police leadership, powers and relations with the public, on victims of crime, on drugs and on active communities, community cohesion and race relations. Our scheme commits us to assessing and consulting on new policies, and monitoring policies generally, for their impact on race equality and race relations.
<P>

<a name="30619w16.html_para2">The Police Complaints Authority, National Crime Squad, National Criminal Intelligence Service and Commission for Racial Equality have all published race equality schemes in line with the requirements of the Act. Although not required to do so, the Central Police Development and Training Agency (Centrex) has also published such a scheme; and the Parole Board, which has already produced an action plan against racial discrimination, on which it has consulted the Commission, is preparing a scheme.

 An Afghanistan Health Resources Assessment was carried out on behalf of the Ministry of Health by Management Sciences for Health in 2002. This national survey gathered information about the location and facilities of hospitals and health centres, services provided, human resources and rehabilitation needs.
<P>

<a name="30619w17.html_para0">The survey identified 21 regional/national hospitals, 41 provincial hospitals and 114 district hospitals. 87 per cent. of the 1,038 hospitals and health facilities identified are presently operating.
<P>

<a name="30619w17.html_para1">The survey identified 8,445 beds in 210 health facilities (approximately 1 bed for every 2,500 people). Most of these beds are located in urban areas&#151;Kabul in particular. On average, developing countries have 2.7 hospital beds per 1,000 population. The survey suggests that Afghanistan has 0.4 of a bed per 1,000 population.
<P>

<a name="30619w17.html_para2">There are approximately 2,300 doctors (approximately 0.1 per 1,000 population), (average rate in developing countries 1.1). There are massive shortages of nurses and qualified birth attendants: doctors make up over a quarter of all health workers. 40 per cent. of facilities providing basic health care have no female health provider. This is extremely important in this largely conservative Muslim country with strong taboos against female patients being treated by male health providers.
<P>

<a name="30619w17.html_para3">Over 80 per cent. of health facilities currently receive external support for drugs and supplies. The availability of five of the most important primary care level drugs was good, at 90 per cent.

<a name="30619w17.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Government are committed to biomass and have launched a number of programmes to support and promote bioenergy in the UK.
<P>

<a name="30619w17.html_para9">The Bioenergy Capital Grants Scheme (BCGS), joint-funded by DTI and the New Opportunities Fund and worth &#163;66 million, will support the early deployment of biomass-fired technology and builds on support made available under the Non Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO). The BCGS, launched in February 2002, has proven very popular and has become over-subscribed with funds now fully allocated. In total, 21 projects across the UK will be supported by the Scheme, covering heat, combined heat and power and electricity generation from biomass.
<P>

<a name="30619w17.html_para10">DEFRA, as part of its England Rural Development Programme, has made available &#163;29 million for the establishment of energy crops including short rotation coppice (SRC) and miscanthus under the Energy Crops Scheme. A further &#163;3.5 million is to be made available for the establishment of infrastructure to facilitate the harvest and supply of energy crops to the power generator.
<P>

<a name="30619w17.html_para11">The Woodland Grant Scheme and the Farm Woodland Premium Scheme, co-ordinated by the Forestry Commission in mainland UK and Forest Services in Northern Ireland, provides grants to create and manage woodland, which can help in the production of wood fuel. The Woodland Grant Scheme also supports the establishment of SRC in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="30619w17.html_para12">The Clear Skies Initiative, a &#163;10 million grants programme launched by DTI in February 2003, supports eligible community and domestic wood fired heating projects.
<P>

<a name="30619w17.html_para13">Biomass is also supported through the Renewables Obligation, which came into effect on 1 April 2002, and electricity supplied by dedicated biomass plant or through co-firing will qualify for Renewable Obligation Certificates and be exempt from the Climate Change Levy (CCL).

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has no plans to intervene in the administration of insolvent estates by seeking to limit the fees charged by insolvency practitioners. This is primarily a matter for the creditors of the insolvent estate. The Insolvency Rules 1986 make provision for the court to review the amount where, in appropriate circumstances, an application is made by either the creditors or the practitioner.

 The issue of the detainees' rights under international law is linked, in part, to the question of their status, which depends on all the facts of the individual cases. However, whatever their status, the detainees are entitled to humane treatment and, if prosecuted, a fair trial. We have made this clear to the United States authorities. They have assured us they will treat the detainees humanely and consistently with the principles of the Geneva Conventions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs how many new settlements he estimates have been built in the Palestinian Occupied Territories since 1993 to 2003.  [118300]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30619w19.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 At least two major new settlements have been established within the expanded municipal boundaries of East Jerusalem. Two new settlements have been established in the West Bank. We have concerns about another four settlements in the West Bank and one in the Gaza Strip. In addition, we estimate that around 108 settlement outposts have been established in the period 1993&#150;2003, some as far as 2 km from existing buildings. The combination of expanding settlements, the Eastern Ring Road and Route 80 will effectively isolate Jerusalem from the West Bank. Other settler roads (Routes 55, 57 and 505) divide the West Bank in an east-west direction. Settlers control 42 per cent. of the West Bank and 15 per cent. of the Gaza Strip.
<P>

<a name="30619w19.html_para3">These figures are the most authoritative available, as it is difficult to get accurate statistics about settlement activity. In particular, the number of settlement outposts is fluid. The Israel Defence Forces began dismantling a number of outposts on 9 June 2003; most of which are uninhabited. Settlers have vowed to establish more. We are monitoring the situation closely.

 A carer premium can only be awarded as part of the minimum income guarantee (MIG) and would therefore not be available to those who are not eligible for MIG. However, if an amount equivalent to the carer premium was paid to all those over state pension age with an underlying entitlement to carers allowance, not eligible for MIG the anticipated cost for one year would be &#163;100 million, with 80,000 gainers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30619w21.html_spnew2"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Department for Work and Pensions has carried out research into compensation schemes that protect final salary pension schemes in other countries including United States, Finland, Germany, and Japan.
<P>

<a name="30619w21.html_para1">Departmental officials visited the US to explore their scheme (the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation) and reported their findings back to the Secretary of State. There has been ongoing correspondence between the Departments officials and their counterparts in the US. This is because the US pensions system, and their corporate structure more generally, is most similar to the UK position.
<P>

<a name="30619w21.html_para2">As a result of research into schemes in other countries, discussions with US counterparts, and the strong support expressed by respondents for this option in the Pensions Green Paper "Simplicity, security and choice: Working and saving for retirement" (Cm 5677), we decided to introduce a compulsory compensation scheme for the protection of employees of insolvent firms.
<P>

<a name="30619w21.html_para3">On June 11 2003 the Secretary of State announced our decision in the House, and we published an Action plan: "Simplicity, security and choice: Working and saving for retirement&#151;Action on occupational pensions" (Cm 5835) setting out a package of measures to strengthen protection for pension scheme members and ease the burden on companies running schemes.
<P>

<a name="30619w21.html_para4">We plan to establish a new independent organisation called the "Pensions Protection Fund" (PPF) in order to protect members of defined benefit pension schemes whose sponsoring employer has become insolvent. Where the pension scheme has insufficient assets to meet the PPF guarantee, the compensation scheme will pay the guaranteed level of benefits to scheme members as they fall due.




<P>
<P><I>19 Jun 2003 : Column 413W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30619w21.html_para5">The PPF will be funded by a levy on all defined benefit pension schemes. The levy will contain both a flat rate and a risk-based component, based on an assessment of the degree of underfunding in the particular scheme. Those schemes that are most underfunded will therefore have to pay a higher rate.
<P>

<a name="30619w21.html_para6">Pensioners will be guaranteed to receive 100 per cent. of their pension, and non-pensioners will be guaranteed to receive 90 per cent. of the pension they have accrued.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions pursuant to his response of 7 May 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 701W, (1) whether his Department has conducted research to assess the public understanding of declines in private pension income that normally occur with increased longevity;  [119218]

<P>
<P>
<a name="30619w21.html_spnew3"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Department has not carried out research to assess the public understanding of the relationship between private pension income and increased longevity.
<P>

<a name="30619w21.html_para8">Regarding research on public attitudes, I refer my hon. Friend to the answer given to him on 21 May 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 798&#150;99W. That research on attitudes to pensions and financial planning for retirement examined how long people of working age expected to remain retired, their income, pension provision and sources of income in retirement, and what they considered to be an adequate retirement income. A report is due to be published in July and, in accordance with normal practice, a copy will be placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="30619w21.html_para9">Additionally, a major cross-government study to which the Department contributes&#151;the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing&#151;is following a sample of people aged 50 and over for a number of years. The survey collects detailed information about income and assets and asks participants about the probability of their income keeping up with inflation. Over time this study will shed light on perceptions of changes in income as the population ages. A first report from the study is due in December 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30619w21.html_spnew4"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 On average, older pensioners receive less income from all sources than younger pensioners. This is illustrated in the following table. There are two main reasons for the difference in occupational pension income. First, the rapid rise in occupational pension coverage in the late 1950s and 1960s has been more beneficial for the younger of today's pensioners. Secondly, before retirement the value of occupational pensions is broadly linked with earnings growth over 



<P>
<P><I>19 Jun 2003 : Column 414W</I><P>
time. After retirement the value of pensions in payment is broadly linked to prices. Other things being equal, an older pensioner who has been retired for longer will, therefore, have a lower occupational pension than the equivalent younger pensioner.
<P>

<a name="30619w21.html_para10">Information showing how incomes change over time at the individual or household level requires data on the same individuals over time. The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing is following a sample of people aged 50 and over for a number of years. The survey collects detailed information about income and assets and, in due course, will provide up-to-date information on how incomes from different sources, including, occupational and personal pensions, change overtime at the individual level. A report from the first wave of the study is due in December 2003 but information about changes over time will only be available after the second wave.

 Poverty is a complex and multi-dimensional problem. The fourth Opportunity for all report (Cm 5598) sets out our strategy for tackling poverty and social exclusion and presents the latest information on the indicators used to monitor progress against our strategy.
<P>

<a name="30619w22.html_para2">Specifically on child poverty, we launched Measuring Child Poverty: a consultation document in April 2002. We received over 80 detailed written responses to the consultation and have gathered feedback from workshops in London and Edinburgh with academics and organisations interested in child poverty measurement. We have also organised workshops in partnership with organisations such as the Children's Society, Barnardo's, Children in Wales and the European Anti-Poverty Network&#151;to gather the views of children, young people and adults with direct experience of poverty.
<P>

<a name="30619w22.html_para3">Measuring Child Poverty Consultation: preliminary conclusions was published in May 2003. This outlines recommendations and next steps based on a thorough analysis of the responses to the consultation. The report states that further technical work is necessary before finalising any new measure of child poverty and that we intend to publish final conclusions by the end of 2003.

<a name="30619w22.html_spnew2"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 The married women who opted to pay reduced rate contributions made an informed choice. They were required to give written notice of their decision on a form attached to a leaflet. The leaflet went to great lengths to describe the consequences of that decision and required them to sign a declaration that they had read and understood the leaflet. Employers could not make this decision on behalf of their employees. Women who chose to pay reduced rate national insurance contributions were given a certificate to give to their employer. An employer was not allowed to deduct reduced rate national insurance contributions without this certificate. It would be unfair to those married women who chose to pay the full rate contribution to retrospectively put married women who paid the reduced rate contribution in the same position.
<P>

<a name="30619w22.html_para5">All married women are able to get a basic state pension based on their husband's contributions of 60 per cent. of his entitlement once both have reached state pension age and have claimed their state pension.

 A considerable amount of guidance has been issued to local authorities and providers on the Supporting People programme, which may be found on the SPKweb www.spkweb.org.uk. This guidance has been being issued over the last two years. The programme went live on 1 April, following the closure of the Transitional Housing Benefit Scheme. Local authorities were informed of the provisional amounts of funding in February 2003, and confirmation of final allocations is planned to take place in September following the receipt of further returns from authorities. Chief authorities are now responsible for Supporting People and will decide, following reviews of current provision, which types and levels of service should be provided locally.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's web site (www.odpm.gov.uk) follows the Office of the e-Envoy's Guidelines for United Kingdom Government web sites to provide an accessible web site for partially sighted and blind people.
<P>

<a name="30619w23.html_para3">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will soon be replacing its web site. The new site has been developed based on the Office of the e-Envoy's Guidelines but it has also been designed to take into consideration the way screen readers work by conducting rigorous screen reader testing using JAWS for Windows software. It has improved accessibility for partially sighted and blind people through the use of the access key system throughout the site on the most commonly used links. It has been rigorously tested so that the HTML conforms to the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Accessibility Initiative's AA standard. In addition, the site has been tested using the BOBBY analysing application, a well-known test of accessibility.

<P>
<a name="30619w23.html_spnew4"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 Under the homelessness legislation local authorities have a duty to provide advice and assistance about homelessness and the prevention of homelessness. This service must be available free of charge to anyone in their district, including young people in housing need. Last year, the Government extended the groups who have a priority need for accommodation under the legislation. The new groups include a number of young homeless people, including 16 and 17-year-olds, care leavers aged 18 to 20 and people over 20 who are vulnerable as a result of having been in care (except those for whom local social services authorities have responsibility).
<P>

<a name="30619w23.html_para6">Through the July 2002 Homelessness Code of Guidance for Local Authorities, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister issued guidance to housing authorities about discharging their duties under the homelessness legislation. The guidance emphasises that, in dealing with 16 and 17-year-olds who may have left home because of a temporary breakdown in their relationship with their family, local authorities should consider reconciliation with the family as a first response. It also highlights the fact that many young homeless applicants, particularly 16 and 17-year olds 



<P>
<P><I>19 Jun 2003 : Column 421W</I><P>
who are homeless and estranged from their family, will be vulnerable and in need of support. The guidelines also make it clear that housing authorities will need to recognise that accommodation solutions for this client group are likely to be unsuccessful if the necessary support is not provided and close liaison with social services and the Supporting People team will be essential.
<P>

<a name="30619w23.html_para7">Advice on specialist services for homeless young people is also included in "Homelessness Strategies&#151;A good practice handbook" issued by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in March 2002.
<P>

<a name="30619w23.html_para8">Specialist Personal Advisers in the Connexions Service also play a key role in ensuring that those under 20 in housing need are linked into housing advice services. They should also advise other Personal Advisers working with young people in housing need. The former Rough Sleepers Unit worked closely with the Connexions Service to develop the "Working together" guidance highlighting the strategic links that the Connexions Service should make with local authority homelessness strategies and voluntary agencies working with young people in providing effective housing advice.
<P>

<a name="30619w23.html_para9">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister funds Shelter's National Homelessness Advice Service (NHAS). NHAS is a secondary advice and support service provided by Shelter in partnership with the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux and has been supported by Government since it was established in 1990. In addition, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister funds agencies such as Alone in London and Centrepoint who work with young people, to promote family mediation, re-establish contact and negotiate a return home or respite care.

<P>
<a name="30619w23.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 Buprenorphine is already included in the treatment protocols developed in conjunction with national health service services at eight prison service establishments. The prison service's standard for clinical services for substance misusers requires every establishment which receives prisoners from court to have detoxification guidelines in place for at least one of methadone, lofexidine, and dihydrocodeine. It also states that, as new evidence becomes available on the chemical management of detoxification or abstinence, establishments should develop further treatment guidelines which are in line with those available in the NHS. Prison health keeps the question of a formal trial of buprenorphine in prisons in England under review, but expects its use to develop at a similar pace to the growth in its use in the community.

quality of care. Consideration of the use of buprenorphine forms part of the NTA's activity, including receiving advice from experts on prescribing issues. The NTA advocates a range of treatment options following adequate assessment of need and works with local drug action teams (DATs) to ensure an appropriate range of provision is developed locally.
<P>

<a name="30619w23.html_para11">There is already a body of evidence for the efficacy of buprenorphine in the treatment of opioid dependence. The level of evidence does not suggest that buprenorphine should replace methadone as a substitution treatment, but rather that buprenorphine should now be considered an evidence-based addition to the range of pharmacological maintenance treatments. Information from specialists indicates that there has been an increase in the use of buprenorphine in the United Kingdom as an alternative to methadone.

 The Supporting People programme provides support for people to live independently in the community, or to sustain their capacity to do so, through packages of support agreed between the client and support provider. There is a wide range of types of support (sheltered housing, for homeless people, for people with learning difficulties, and others) some of which have formal eligibility criteria, and others of which have looser assessment and application procedures. The Supporting People programme does not provide grants to registered care establishments (unless such funding was being provided under previous arrangements, where it is transitionally permitted to be paid).

The fund will support the same areas of work as at present. The learning disability task force, which has members drawn from both the self and citizen advocacy movements, will be involved in discussions about the detailed use of the support fund.
<P>

<a name="30619w24.html_para1">Mental health policies also focus on the use of advocacy.

This new duty ensures that patients can have the help of specialist advocacy when it is most needed. There are also proposals in the draft Bill for safeguards, including access to advocacy, for some adult patients who have a long-term incapacity to consent and who are in a hospital or nursing home receiving treatment for a serious mental disorder.

A survey of the mental health of children and adolescents in Great Britain (commissioned by the Department of Health and conducted by the Office for National Statistics in 1999) found that 23 per cent. of children who wet their beds had a mental disorder compared with a prevalence of mental disorder of 10 per cent. for all children assessed in the survey. No single specific disorder nor psychiatric symptom is associated with enuresis and the majority of children cease to wet their beds by adolescence. Persistence of enuresis, particularly beyond adolescence and into adulthood, can cause significant distress, affect self-esteem and may interfere with the confidence required to establish close relationships.

<i>[holding answer 16 June 2003]:</i> The main Government agency for research into the causes of and treatments for disease is the Medical Research Council (MRC) which receives its funding from the Department of Trade and Industry via the Office for Science and Technology.

 The Commission for Social Care Inspection will be under a duty to lay an annual report of its findings before Parliament and to make public the results of any reviews and investigations that it has carried out into English local authority social services. Since the Secretary of State for Health has overall responsibility for the provision of social care throughout England, Clause 73 of the Bill makes specific provision for the Commission to keep him informed.

The Commission for Health Improvement (CHI) and NICE have agreed a methodology for CHI to incorporate the monitoring of NICE guidance in its clinical governance reviews. Specifically CHI now looks to see if NHS trusts have mechanisms in place to implement and comply with NICE guidance. CHI will also support and facilitate clinicians to discuss when NICE guidance is and is not followed on an individual patient basis.
