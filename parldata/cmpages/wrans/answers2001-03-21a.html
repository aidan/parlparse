 I refer the hon. Member to the answer given to my hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Murphy) on 16 March 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 756W. This stage of the review has taken longer than expected because of legal and financial complexities. It is proposed that any new scheme would be introduced for all incidents giving rise to illness, injury or death after the date of introduction. Claims relating to incidents which occurred before this time would continue to be covered by the existing arrangements. Following consultation, we expect to take final decisions on the review by early next year, when we will inform Parliament in the normal way.

<P>
<a name="10321w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Job evaluation of both Other Ranks and Officer posts has been routinely undertaken since 1970. A new job evaluation system was introduced in 1997 and was extensively tested across all ranks including Officers. During the period leading up to Pay 2000, priority has been given to evaluating Other Ranks in order to assign posts to pay ranges based on job weight. Most Senior Officer posts have now been evaluated. We are about to begin a comprehensive programme of evaluation for the remainder of the Officer corps with the aim of completing the first tranche by September to meet the stated requirements of the Armed Forces Pay Review Board.

 I wrote to my right hon. Friend on 30 November 2000 regarding a similar query. I explained that the impact of Home Office policies and actions is not normally collected by constituency and the statistics which the Department collects cannot be matched in the way requested. The three major projects which I mentioned are ongoing. They are a burglary reduction project in Rusholme, a targeted policing project against armed crime in South Manchester and the neighbourhood wardens projects in three parts of Gorton.

 The Home Office is working to build a safe, just and tolerant society in which the rights and responsibilities of individuals, families and communities are properly balanced, and the protection and security of the public are maintained. Detailed information on the impact of Home Office policies across the full range of responsibilities is set out in Home Office annual reports. A copy of the most recent report, Home Office Annual Report 1999-2000, is available in the Library. The latest report will be published shortly. Information on recorded crime and policing is also published. 'Recorded Crime England and Wales, 12 months to September 2000' and 'Police Service Strength England and Wales, 30 September 2000' can be found in the Library.

The project will reduce crime by reducing drug and alcohol use among young offenders. A project worker will be based in each of the two YOTs and will assess levels of substance abuse and the influence it may have on individuals' crime-related activity. Motivational interviewing, solution focused, brief intervention, rational emotive behavioural and existential therapeutic approaches will be provided for approximately 1,500 young people over the period of the bid.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is the longest period of detention a person at present seeking asylum in the United Kingdom has been held in detention since arrival at a port of entry in the UK; and if he will make a statement.  [154453]<P>

<P>
<a name="10321w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The longest period of detention of an asylum seeker currently detained under Immigration Act powers and so detained since their arrival in the United Kingdom on 30 July 1999, is 600 days.
<P>

<a name="10321w03.html_para0">While detention under Immigration Act powers should always be for the shortest period possible, the decision on whether to maintain detention is strictly monitored and made on a case-by-case basis. Various factors influence that process, such as an individual's previous history, connections with the United Kingdom and an assessment on their willingness to comply with the terms of any temporary admission or release. In all cases detention must be considered essential for it to continue.

 Under the Milosevic regime, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) was not prepared to accept failed asylum seekers back into the country.

However, following the change of government and the restoration of full diplomatic relations, we are in touch with the authorities of the FRY about arrangements for returning FRY

 Information relating to scientific procedures performed on living animals is collected and published for each calendar year and laid before Parliament in a Command Paper in late summer the following year. The number of animals used in scientific procedures which were started in 1999, the latest year for which figures are available, was 2.57 million. More detailed information is given in Table 1a of the publication Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals, Great Britain, 1999, a copy of which is in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment has been made of the trials of the Airwave public safety radio communications system; and if he will make a statement.  [154431]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10321w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The main evaluation began on 19 March when Divisions in the Lancashire Constabulary started to migrate progressively to Airwave and use the service operationally. Service performance will be assessed continually by the Lancashire force and the Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO) against rigorous criteria and a formal report is planned for issue in June 2001. If the service meets the criteria set out in the main Airwave contract then national implementation of the service will begin.
<P>

<a name="10321w04.html_para1">Last autumn a number of contractually defined tests to prove radio coverage and service features and performance were carried out. Both Lancashire and PITO were party to these tests which proved satisfactory. PITO subsequently ran and monitored a large number of scripted quasi-operational tests on the system for a seven week period between November 2000 and January 2001. These tests involved some 300 police personnel drawn from the majority of forces in England, Wales and Scotland. User feedback was generally very positive.

<a name="10321w06.html_para0">I very much hope the NUM will give the offer the serious consideration which it merits, as I am anxious that a way can be found to allow payments to be made to the claimants as quickly as possible.

 My Department is committed to the reduction of child labour with special emphasis on the worst forms. We do not make checks on goods imported into the UK but are supporting the efforts of Governments, non-governmental organisations, and international bodies such as the International Labour Organisation to end exploitative child labour in developing countries in both domestic and export sectors.
<P>

<a name="10321w06.html_para9">We are also providing assistance to business, through, for example, the Ethical Trading Initiative and the Resource Centre for the Social Dimensions of Business Practice, for the elimination of child labour and other exploitative labour practices, including in supply chains. We support the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development guidelines for multinational enterprises.

<P>
<a name="10321w06.html_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Developing and developed country governments choose both the sectors in which and the extent to which they liberalise services under the General Agreement on Trade in Services. Services supplied in the exercise of governmental authority--that is, public services like health and education services--are explicitly excluded from the GATS (although private services are covered by the GATS).
<P>

<a name="10321w06.html_para11">Further liberalisation of private services under GATS offers developing countries potential benefits in a number of different sectors. Increased competition in basic services such as banking, transport and telecommunications would provide more efficient and effective infrastructure in developing countries, which is vital if they are to achieve the economic growth they need to reduce poverty.

 I refer my right hon. Friend to the answer I gave on 6 November 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1W.
<P>

<a name="10321w06.html_para14">On 13 November 2000, the City of Manchester branch of the Crown Prosecution Service underwent the reorganisation I referred to in my previous answer. In line with the Glidewell proposals, the branch now has Trial Units and Criminal Justice Units covering the North and South Manchester Policy Divisions. At the present time and for the foreseeable future, it is unlikely that the Crown Prosecution Service will be able to co-locate with the police at Elizabeth Slinger Road Police Station.
<P>

<a name="10321w06.html_para15">In partnership with other agencies, the Crown Prosecution Service has made a concerted effort to reduce the length of time, between arrest and sentence, that persistent young offenders remain within the criminal justice system. On 25 November 2000, there were 201 persistent young offender cases currently before Manchester Youth Court. On 14 March 2001, that figure had been reduced to 137. Similarly, the average time from arrest for all current cases has shown a reduction from 98 days to 89 days over the same period. All these changes illustrate the Government's successful period. All these changes illustrate the Government's successful policy of speeding up the work of the criminal justice system.
<P>

<a name="10321w06.html_para16">On 15 January 2001, section 51 Crime and Disorder Act 1988 came into force. One of the first cases dealt with by the City of Manchester branch involved the arrest of four defendants under Operation Auction 1. This, as my right hon. Friend knows, is a police operation set up to combat a high level of street robberies in Gorton. The four defendants made their first appearance before Manchester City Magistrates Court on 16 January 2001. On 24 January 2001 they appeared before the Crown 



<P>
<P><I>21 Mar 2001 : Column: 232W</I><P>
Court. One of the defendants, Stuart Smith, indicated immediately that he intended to plead guilty to assault with intent to rob. He entered his guilty plea on 8 February 2001 and was sentenced to a Detention and Training Order for two years. This illustrates the potential effectiveness in speeding up serious cases. Slightly over three weeks from the date of his first court appearance, the defendant received a substantial custodial sentence. Previously the case was unlikely to have been finalised within three months. Committal proceedings would have taken approximately eight weeks and a further four weeks would have elapsed between committal and a plea and directions hearing at the Crown Court.

 Relaxing the existing requirement to purchase an annuity would provide an incentive for some to use pension schemes for purposes other than providing a secure income throughout retirement. Costs will vary depending on the nature of any reforms, including what level of income must first be secured and what tax charge is applied to withdrawals above that level.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10321w08.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 The democratic deficit in the National Health Service has long been recognised. In future, democratically elected councillors will take on from community health councils the important function of scrutinising local NHS service through local authority overview and scrutiny committees (OSCs).
<P>

<a name="10321w08.html_para5">The provisions that give local authority OSCs the new powers to scrutinise the NHS are contained within the Health and Social Care Bill, which is currently before Parliament. The Bill will enable the OSC to scrutinise and review the operation, management and development of the NHS bodies within its area, it will then make reports and recommendations of those NHS bodies based on the results of that scrutiny.
<P>

<a name="10321w08.html_para6">The aim of the new scrutiny arrangements is to allow flexibility and to enable the building of local authority scrutiny models that are fit for ensuring that the NHS is scrutinised rigorously, and that scrutiny is democratically accountable to the local population.

 We have no plans to support doctors (many of whom will still be resident in their home countries) while they prepare for professional and language tests that are, in themselves, no guarantee of employment in the United Kingdom.

<P>
<a name="10321w09.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 February 2001]:</i> Primary responsibility for the safety of food rests with the national competent authority of each country, whether a member state of the European Community or a third country. It is the responsibility of each individual country to ensure that food exported to the United Kingdom complies with both national and European Union food safety requirements. The EC, and not the United Kingdom Food Standards Agency, has competence for monitoring and, where appropriate, investigating issues of compliance with EU food safety law, both in third countries exporting food to the European market and in member states producing food for trade within the EC.

 <i>[holding answer 9 March 2001]:</i> As indicated in the National Health Service information management and technology procurement review (published by the NHS Executive in June 2000), the South Western regional procurement programme needs to have been judged as successful by means of a post-implementation review before this approach can be recommended nationally.

These encourage more frequent donation patterns and NBS research has shown that the "Give Blood" message is successful. Communication with donors continues through a series of initiatives which include the NBS magazine "The Donor", sent to donors twice yearly, contacting donors to remind them of their next donor session and further development the NBS website with plans to include on-line invitations to give blood.

<a name="10321w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 March 2001]:</i> We are reforming the current regulatory arrangements for care homes and nursing homes for all client groups. The Care Standards Act 2000 establishes a new independent body, the National Care Standards Commission, which will regulate all care homes, whether in the private, voluntary or statutory sector, from April 2002. The commission will register and inspect homes according to national minimum standards. These standards will promote better quality of care and prevent abuse of all kinds by grounding practice on the principles of dignity, choice, privacy and respect.
<P>

<a name="10321w09.html_para3">They will guarantee residents access to an effective complaints procedure and ensure that residents are cared for by trustworthy, competent and reliable staff, who have been properly trained for this difficult and sensitive job.
<P>

<a name="10321w09.html_para4">National minimum standards for care homes for older people were published on 2 March 2001. We intend to publish standards for other client groups in homes soon.
<P>

<a name="10321w09.html_para5">In addition, the Department launched guidance titled 'No Secrets' on 20 March 2000, under Section 7 of the Local Authority Services Act 1970. 'No Secrets' deals with developing and implementing multi-agency policies and procedures to protect vulnerable adults from abuse.
<P>

<a name="10321w09.html_para6">All prescribing for older people, including those in residential and nursing home care, should be undertaken and monitored carefully by the doctor responsible. The Department published advice in 1998 on prescribing in residential and nursing homes. The National Service Framework for Older People will contribute to improving the care of older people with dementia by setting national standards for health and social care services.

<P>
<a name="10321w09.html_spnew10"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Ninety-seven 'definite' and 'probable' cases of variant Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease (vCJD) have been identified to date. A number of geographically associated case groupings is under investigation, but only one such grouping has so far been identified by the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) in July 2000 as being unlikely to have occurred by chance. That grouping of cases occurred in an area in Leicestershire near Queniborough. A subsequent investigation by Leicestershire health authority into these cases has been undertaken and the results are being announced in a report published today. A copy is being placed in the Library. The main conclusion from the investigation is that there is a strong association between these cases and cross-contamination of carcase meat with cattle brain material which occurred at a number of local butchers' premises during the 1980s.
<P>

<a name="10321w09.html_para7">Controls on specified risk material (SRM) have, since 1989, required brains of cattle over six months old to be removed and disposed of under controlled conditions. It has been illegal since then for them to be used for human consumption. And, since 1996, it has been a legal requirement for the whole head of cattle over six months old to be disposed of in the slaughterhouse as SRM under the supervision of the Meat Hygiene Service.
<P>

<a name="10321w09.html_para8">Scientific advisers and health experts, including SEAC, will be looking very carefully at the results of the study, to assess the implications for our wider understanding of vCJD.

 <i>[holding answer 14 March 2001]:</i> The New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC), having recently reviewed its papers on the Hinduja Foundation's contribution of &#163;1 million to the Faith zone, concluded that VAT is chargeable in respect of that contribution. NMEC reached this conclusion on the basis that an allocation of free tickets to the Hinduja Foundation represented a benefit. The Company made a voluntary disclosure to HM Customs and Excise. NMEC has now brought this payment into account for VAT purposes and will make the appropriate payment when all related aspects are agreed with HM Customs and Excise. NMEC is satisfied that in respect of the earlier treatment of the Hinduja Foundation's contribution, and the latter allocation of tickets, there was no deliberate attempt by NMEC staff to avoid VAT. There was an innocent error which, having been identified, is now being corrected.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10321w12.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 Consultees have overwhelmingly endorsed our proposals to abolish the present system of local authority capital controls and replace it with the prudential system described in the Green Paper. Legislation will be introduced as soon as parliamentary time allows. The new system will rely heavily on professional regulation and my Department has agreed to provide financial support to the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy who will draft the

<P>

<a name="10321w12.html_para0">Under the new system local authorities will be free to invest in their communities without having to get permission each time from central Government. The consultation confirmed our view that the proposed safeguards in the system will ensure that authorities do not run up unsustainable levels of debt, and that the increased flexibility will allow them to deliver better value for money, including through partnership working.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will publish his response to the recommendations of the independent panel that conducted the public examination of the draft regional planning guidance for the east Midlands; and if he will make a statement.  [155260]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10321w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has today published for consultation proposed changes to the draft Regional Planning Guidance for the east Midlands. These are largely based on the recommendations of the independent panel that held a public examination into draft RPG last summer.
<P>

<a name="10321w12.html_para1">In October 2000 my right hon. Friend published new guidance on regional planning in Planning Policy Guidance (PPG) Note 11. This followed the announcement of a new approach to planning for housing provision last March which was taken forward in more detail in revised Planning Policy Guidance Note 3. Important issues for the region to take forward are contained in the Urban and Rural White Papers issued last November. The proposed changes to the draft RPG for the east Midlands reflect the principles and priorities set out in these statements. They aim to support economic growth and regeneration while protecting and enhancing the region's environment.
<P>

<a name="10321w12.html_para2">For housing, the regional allocation and those for each structure plan area are now expressed as annual averages to reflect the requirements in PPG3 and PPG11 for annual bench marks, rather than a fixed total. Adjustments can then be made regularly as required by the "plan monitor and manage" approach. The regional allocation of 13,900 a year should meet expected needs. We are proposing a small reduction for Lincolnshire of 200 a year over the draft to discourage long distance commuting across the regional boundary into East Anglia and reduce the pressure for developing greenfield sites.
<P>

<a name="10321w12.html_para3">We agree with the panel's recommendation that 60 per cent. of housing completions should be on previously developed land by 2008. The regional planning body will be invited to develop sub regional targets to allow for variations in local circumstances while still aiming for 60 per cent. at the regional level. We propose to adopt the panel's recommended annual rate of 3,400 dwellings a year as an appropriate indicator for monitoring whether affordable housing need is being met.
<P>

<a name="10321w12.html_para4">The panel considered that a new business park near to the East Midlands Airport and Junction 24 (M1) in addition to the existing commitments for business development there, could undermine regeneration of nearby urban areas, in particular Nottingham, Derby and 



<P>
<P><I>21 Mar 2001 : Column: 252W</I><P>
Leicester. We agree with the panel, as we are not persuaded that sufficient limitations on occupation are possible through the planning system to avoid harmful displacement of economic activity from those urban areas.
<P>

<a name="10321w12.html_para5">Draft RPG proposed designating two major investment sites (sites of at least 50has and capable of being safeguarded for a single user). We propose to adopt the panel recommendation that no new greenfield sites should be promoted for this purpose until a comprehensive analysis has been carried out of the quantity and quality of the existing supply of employment land.
<P>

<a name="10321w12.html_para6">We make it clear that there should be no variation across the region in the systematic approach to selecting sites for development so as not to damage the credibility of the RPG and to maintain consistency with the sustainable development objectives of national policy. We agree that the coalfields are a priority for regeneration. The outcome of applying a systematic approach to the selection of sites might be that some greenfield development would occur, but only if that is the most sustainable option in the context of local circumstances and the priority for employment development.
<P>

<a name="10321w12.html_para7">We agree with the panel that car parking standards should be consistent with those in Draft PPG13, and should be applied across the region to all new employment development but above certain thresholds.
<P>

<a name="10321w12.html_para8">The consultation period on the proposed changes will be for 12 weeks ending on 15 June. Views are invited and should be made to the Government Office for the east Midlands. Copies of all the relevant documents have been placed in the House Library and made available to the region's MPs.

<a name="10321w12.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 I am today issuing a consultation paper which proposes new, more robust planning policies for sport, open space and recreation. The proposed revision of Planning Policy Guidance note 17: Sport and Recreation (PPG17) follows our commitment in the Urban and Rural White Papers to creating more sustainable communities that offer a better quality of life.
<P>

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10321w12.html_para15">It is essential to their quality of life that people have access to open space and a wide range of sporting and recreational facilities. We are proposing a systematic assessment procedure to assist local authorities in determining whether any shortfall in the provision of open space, sports or recreational facilities exists in their areas. This will help them in planning to remedy any deficiencies. The draft guidance reinforces current measures to safeguard existing open space and further protects playing fields, which are vital to the health and well being of our young people, as well as benefiting the wider community.
<P>

<a name="10321w12.html_para16">Copies of the consultation draft of PPG17 have been placed in the Library and Vote Office.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10321w12.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Todd: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has, following publication of the White Paper "Our Countryside: the Future", to clarify planning policy guidance for the countryside; and if he will make a statement.  [155262]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10321w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 A competitive and sustainable agricultural industry is vital to the economic, social and environmental well-being of rural areas. The Prime Minister's Action "Plan for Farming" and the White Paper "Our Countryside: the Future" emphasised the Government's desire both for agriculture to be prosperous, forward-looking and sustainable, and to encourage diversification and enterprise. Reform of the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is changing the direction of agriculture and the England Rural Development Programme provides a major switch of CAP funds to support the new approach.
<P>

<a name="10321w12.html_para17">Planning policies for the countryside are set out in Planning Policy Guidance note 7, "The Countryside: Environmental Quality and Economic and Social Development" (PPG7). That guidance is now four-years-old and needs to be clarified in respect of the Government's policy on farm diversification. I am therefore amending the text of the guidance to reflect the importance that the Government attach to effective planning for sustainable farm diversification projects and the re-use of redundant farm buildings.
<P>

<a name="10321w12.html_para18">The first point in paragraph 2.8 of PPG7 is amended as follows:
<P>

<a name="10321w12.html_para19"><P>

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10321w12.html_para20">Paragraph 3.4 no longer adequately reflects the significant changes now shaping the agricultural industry. I am therefore deleting the current text and replacing it with the following:
<P>

<a name="10321w12.html_para21"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"3.4A--The Government's long term strategy for farming was set out in "A New Direction for Agriculture" published in December 1999 and was taken a step further with the launch of the "Action Plan for Farming" in March 2000. The England Rural Development Programme (ERDP) was launched in October 2000. Together, these are providing opportunities to help the industry become more competitive and diverse and to promote environmental aims. Farming continues to make a significant contribution to the economy of rural areas but increasingly diversification into non-agricultural activities is vital to the continuing viability of many farm businesses. Local planning authorities should set out in their development plans the criteria to be applied to planning applications for farm diversification projects. Local planning authorities should be supportive of well-conceived farm diversification schemes for business purposes that are consistent in their scale with their rural location.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10321w12.html_para22"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>3.4B--The ERDP will, through the Rural Enterprise Scheme (RES) and the Processing and Marketing Grant (PMG), provide support for selected diversification proposals, subject to competition. Success in securing RES and PMG funding may depend upon obtaining prior planning permission for diversification proposals, but the potential availability of any grant funding is not a material consideration when determining a relevant planning application. Further guidance on development related to agriculture (other than that covered by permitted development rights) and to farm diversification is given in Annex C, which includes a non-exclusive list of examples of potential farm diversification. It is usually preferable for farm diversification schemes to re-use good quality existing buildings and put them to a new business use, rather than build new buildings in the countryside. New buildings, either to replace existing buildings or to accommodate expansion of enterprises, may also be acceptable provided that they satisfy sustainable development objectives and are of a design and scale appropriate to their rural surroundings."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10321w12.html_para23">Planning guidance relating to the protection of England's best quality agricultural land is also contained in PPG7. The Rural White Paper signalled the Government's intention that decisions about the development or protection of best and most versatile agricultural land (BMV land) should rest with local authorities. Additionally, the Draft Soil Strategy for England, which we published for consultation on 6 March, sets out our wider proposals for protecting and managing our soil resources.
<P>

<a name="10321w12.html_para24">Paragraphs 2.17 and 2.18 of PPG7 are therefore withdrawn and the following paragraphs should be substituted:
<P>

<a name="10321w12.html_para25"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"2.17--Development of greenfield land, including the best and most versatile agricultural land (defined as land in grades 1, 2, and 3a of the Agricultural Land Classification), should not be permitted unless opportunities have been assessed for accommodating development on previously-developed sites and on land within the boundaries of existing urban areas (see PPG3 in respect of housing development). Where development of agricultural land is unavoidable, local planning authorities should seek to use areas of poorer quality land in preference to that of a higher quality, except where other sustainability considerations suggest otherwise. These might include, for example, its importance for biodiversity, the quality and character of the landscape, its amenity value or heritage interest, accessibility to infrastructure, workforce and markets, and the protection of natural resources, including soil quality. Some of these qualities

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10321w12.html_para26"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2.18--Local authorities planning to allow the development of greenfield land, where soil or agricultural quality is a consideration, should seek advice from MAFF and from other relevant bodies such as English Nature, the Countryside Agency, the Environment Agency or English Heritage as appropriate. They may also be required to consult one or more of these agencies of any intention to allow development under the Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) Order 1995, and in respect of development plan proposals as described in Annex C to PPG12. The decision whether to utilise BMV land for development is for each local planning authority, having carefully weighed the options in the light of competent advice."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10321w12.html_para27">MAFF will continue to provide technical advice to local planning authorities on agricultural land quality issues and other matters relating to agricultural development as described in Annex B to PPG7. My Department expects to issue good practice guidance on methodologies for integrating competing sustainability considerations later this year. In due course the Government expect to repeal the statutory right available to the Minister of Agriculture under section 18(3) and 44(3) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to require the Secretary of State to intervene in development plans to which MAFF have unresolved objections.
<P>

<a name="10321w12.html_para28">My Department will be writing to every planning authority in England to inform them of the clarification of PPG7 set out in this statement and a version of PPG7 which consolidates these and other changes already announced will be posted on the Department's website at: www.planning.detr.gov.uk. Other planning policy guidance notes and mineral policy guidance notes that refer to PPG7 should be read in conjunction with this statement.

<P>

<a name="10321w13.html_para20">The broad reason for the decrease is that clients are choosing to attend Not-for-Profit agencies for assistance with social welfare law issues.

 <i>[holding answer 12 March 2001]:</i> MAFF officials are in regular contact with abattoir representatives over the new Licensing for Slaughter scheme and are monitoring prices regularly. Official deadweight price reporting for beef has now been re-established and beef prices have shown a slight decline of up to 3 per cent. It has to be borne in mind that abattoirs have additional costs and up to 50 per cent. reduced throughput to contend with under the new scheme. My right hon. Friend's first priority is to eradicate foot and mouth disease. The Licensing for Slaughter scheme is there to release pressure on producers and get meat supplies moving again. My right hon. Friend has already asked all in the supply chain to behave in a spirit of mutual commercial co-operation. The market situation is being kept under review.

 <i>[holding answer 15 January 2001]:</i> Participation rates are not routinely collated below national level. The available figures for the four home countries, showing the proportion of under 21-year-olds who enter higher education for the first time, are given in the table. A higher proportion of young people from Scotland and Northern Ireland enter HE than from England and Wales. This is largely due to high levels of participation in Diplomas, Certificates and other similar undergraduate qualifications in these countries. There was an increase in the Great Britain index in 1997-98 related partly to changes in the funding arrangements for higher education, with students choosing to enter HE rather than wait until 1998-99. There was a corresponding reduction in 1998-99 before the entry rates started to increase again in 1999-2000. Between 1996-97 and 1999-2000, total students rose by 76,000 in England and by 89,000 in Great Britain.

 In the period from the start of the New Deal for Young People, April 1998 to December 2000, there have been 478 starts to the programme in Shrewsbury and Atcham. Of these, 240 young people have gained employment from the programme.
<P>

 The Department is liaising closely with the awarding bodies on the impact of the foot and mouth emergency on public examinations. The awarding bodies have already announced that where students are unable to travel to their schools and colleges to complete assessments/examinations because of MAFF restrictions, special consideration arrangements will apply and candidates will be considered for aegrotat awards. The awarding bodies have also announced that they will agree to alternative arrangements where students are unable to complete fieldwork and coursework assignments because of restrictions on access to land. Both announcements have been placed on the awarding bodies' websites. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10321w15.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Information on class sizes at individual schools is not normally published. However, in January 1997 20.1 per cent. of Key Stage 1 classes in Shrewsbury and Atcham had 31 or more pupils. By September 2000 the figure was zero. In January 1997 42 per cent. of the Key Stage 2 classes in the constituency had 31 or more pupils. By January 2000 the figure had dropped to 25.7 per cent. The size of the average Key Stage 2 class in the constituency fell over this period from 28.7 to 27.3.
<P>

<a name="10321w15.html_para0">We are delivering our infant class size pledge, including in Shropshire. The local education authority has received &#163;3.6 million to support the initiative, and had met the 30 limit in full as early as September 2000. At the same time, the size of the average Key Stage 2 class in the Authority fell from 29.1 in January 1997 to 28.3 in January 2000. Primary headteachers will receive an average &#163;24,000 in direct funding in 2001-02 to spend as they choose--including on reducing class sizes further if that is a priority.

 <i>[holding answer 20 March 2001]:</i> On 1 April 1998 all of the Department's buildings in Scotland were transferred under the PRIME contract to the private sector consortium Trillium. The insurance cover of the buildings is now a matter for Trillium.
<P>

<a name="10321w15.html_para2">Prior to 1 April 1998, the insurance charges for any sites the Department occupied under a lease would have been paid by landlords and where appropriate passed on to the Department via the service charge. Details of the cost of this to the Department in 1997-98 are not available. Additionally, all departmental buildings owned by the Department were covered by Crown Indemnity and the Department was not required to provide any insurance cover for these buildings.
<P>

 We have put a number of measures in place to remove barriers to work for disabled people. These include higher earnings disregards in the Independent Living Funds and improvements to the linking and therapeutic earnings rules in Incapacity Benefit. We are also piloting Capability Reports as part of the Personal Capability Assessment, which we introduced in April 2000.
<P>

<a name="10321w16.html_para0">We have introduced the Disabled Person's Tax Credit (DPTC) to help make work pay. In the Budget my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced an increase in DPTC from June and this, combined with increases in the National Minimum Wage in October, will raise the guaranteed minimum income for a disabled person moving into work of 35 hours per week or more to &#163;170 a week for a single person, and &#163;257 a week for a couple with one child.
<P>

<a name="10321w16.html_para1">Furthermore, we are extending the New Deal for Disabled People across Great Britain. From July 2001 a national network of Job Brokers will be set up jointly by the Department of Social Security and the Department for Education and Employment to offer people receiving incapacity benefits the support, guidance and preparation they need to find paid work and move off benefit dependence, continuing to test and assess what works best.
<P>

<a name="10321w16.html_para2">Alongside the national extension, in early 2002 we will be starting New Deal for Disabled People Job Retention and Rehabilitation Pilots jointly with the Department for Education and Employment and the Department of Health. These pilots will test the relative effectiveness of different employment and health interventions in reducing the number of people forced to give up work through prolonged illness or disability.

<a name="10321w16.html_para7">These goals are being pursued nationwide and our achievements are set out in our annual "Opportunity for all" reports. Our second report, "Opportunity for all--One year on: making a difference" (CM4865, September 2000) sets out what progress has been made in the past year, as well as highlighting what more needs to be done. Nationwide statistical information is necessarily more complete than constituency level data, but the following provides a comparative guide to the effect of the Department's policies and actions in Sutton and Cheam since May 1997.
<P>

<a name="10321w16.html_para8">Measures in our five Budgets so far will lift over 1.2 million children out of poverty. These include record increases to Child Benefit, the introduction of the Working Families Tax Credit, increases in the income- related benefits, the minimum wage and tax changes.
<P>

<a name="10321w16.html_para9">Child Benefit will be worth &#163;15.50 a week for the eldest child and &#163;10.35 a week for other children from April 2001: nationally about 7 million families receive Child Benefit, and in Sutton and Cheam 9,661 families benefit.
<P>

<a name="10321w16.html_para10">We now have the lowest unemployment rate in 25 years. The New Deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, the over 50s and partners of the unemployed to move from benefit into work. In the period since May 1997 the number of people claiming Jobseekers' Allowance nationally has reduced from 1,562,400 to 960,600; in Sutton and Cheam the number has reduced from 1,200 to 800. Since May 1997 the number of lone parents who claim Income Support has decreased from 1,013,500 to 894,100 nationally and in Sutton and Cheam from 700 to 500.
<P>

<a name="10321w16.html_para11">Older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. So we have introduced Winter Fuel Payments to help with their heaviest fuel bill. This winter, the payment is &#163;200 for households who qualify. Around 16,400 older people in Sutton and Cheam have received a Winter Fuel Payment for this winter.




<P>
<P><I>21 Mar 2001 : Column: 268W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10321w16.html_para12">To demonstrate our commitment to combating pensioner poverty, this year we will spend &#163;4.5 billion extra in real terms on pensioners. Some 15,600 pensioners in Sutton and Cheam will benefit from the substantial increases in the basic State pension this April and next; this year's increase is &#163;5 a week for single pensioners and &#163;8 for couples. In addition we have introduced free TV licences for the over 75s of whom we estimate there are about 7,200 in Sutton and Cheam. 1,700 pensioner families in Sutton and Cheam are receiving the Minimum Income Guarantee, which we introduced in April 1999 to help our poorest pensioners. From April they will be at least &#163;15 a week, or &#163;800 a year, better off in real terms as a result of Government measures since 1997.
<P>

<a name="10321w16.html_para13">Other reforms in the pipeline include: the new Pension Credit in 2003 designed to ensure that pensioners benefit from their savings; the launch of Stakeholder Pensions in April this year; and the introduction of the State Second Pension in April 2002 both of which will help provide greater security for tomorrow's pensioners.

<P>
<a name="10321w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 After years of neglect, we have implemented an effective strategy for dealing with Social Security fraud. Figures are not available for the areas requested but nationally we have already made a 6.7 per cent. reduction in the level of fraud and error in Income Support and Jobseeker's Allowance. This is the first significant reduction.
<P>

<a name="10321w16.html_para14">We are on course to meet our first target, of a 10 per cent. reduction in fraud and error, well ahead of the scheduled date in 2002.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="10321w17.html_para2">Poverty and social exclusion are complex multi- dimensional issues, affecting many aspects of people's lives--including income, health, housing, the quality of their environment and opportunities to learn. There is no single measure that can capture the complex problems that need to be overcome.
<P>

For example, the number of unemployed people in Wales has fallen by around 35,000 from nearly 90,000 in February 1997 to around 55,000 in February 2001. Between 1997 and 2000 the number of children in families in Wales in receipt of out of work benefits has fallen from 160,000 to around 145,000. The proportion of 11-year-olds in Wales achieving level 4 or above at Key Stage 2 has risen in English from 64 per cent. in 1997 to 74 per cent. in 2000 and in Mathematics from 64 per cent. in 1997 to 69 per cent. in 2000.

 Good progress has been made in implementing policy on the use of electronic signatures.
<P>

<a name="10321w19.html_para0">The electronic signature registration process on the Government Gateway, which provides an authentication mechanism for citizens and businesses using Government services, went live early in February 2001.
<P>

<a name="10321w19.html_para1">The Inland Revenue has introduced electronic filing of tax returns, and PAYE end of year returns, both certified by a form of electronic signature.
<P>

<a name="10321w19.html_para2">Customs and Excise is introducing electronic filing of VAT returns, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is introducing an electronic Area Aid Application service for farmers. Both these services will be available in March 2001 and will use electronic signatures.
<P>

<a name="10321w19.html_para3">Orders are planned under section 8 of the Electronic Communications Act 2000 to enable Departments to accept electronic signatures for various transactions. Examples are electronic conveyancing, the use of electronic signatures by general practitioners on electronic prescriptions and by Ministers on newly made Statutory Instruments transmitted electronically to HMSO.
