<a name="00314w01.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 I can confirm that the specialist schools programme is open to applications from all types of maintained secondary schools--whether or not their admissions arrangements are selective. Schools which are designated Sports, Arts, Language or Technology Colleges are expected to work closely with a "family of schools" to spread the benefits to pupils beyond their own school boundaries and to the wider community.

 The figures requested are shown in the table. For Standards Fund grants, the figures include both the Government's and the local education authority's contributions where appropriate. The figures shown for Education Standard Spending Assessment also include provision for the Authority's contribution to the Standards Fund. For 1997-98, figures are given for Hereford and Worcester.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what assessment he has made of the impact of the Utilities Bill on electricity supply and distribution and renewable energy in Scotland; and if he will make a statement.  [113610]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00314w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 This Government are determined to put the interests of consumers first, both north and south of the border. The Utilities Bill contains provisions aimed at facilitating further competition in the electricity and gas markets, and thus are expected to lead to price reductions for consumers. This includes a bar on supply and distribution licences being held by the same legal person. It also allows for the continuation of arrangements ensuring that remote areas of Scotland do not suffer from discriminatory pricing.
<P>

<a name="00314w01.html_para1">The Bill contains a provision for a separate renewables obligation in Scotland which will contribute towards the Government's target of renewable energy providing 10 per cent. of UK electricity supplies by 2010.

 I meet Scottish Executive Ministers, including the First Minister, on a regular basis and discuss a wide range of issues with them, including action to reduce inequalities such as the gender pay gap. The UK Government are tackling the gender pay gap across Great Britain through a range of measures such as encouraging less gender stereotyping and considering ways of interesting more women in careers in information and communication technology. Other measures to help people, predominantly women, combine work and other responsibilities include the campaign on work/life balance, New Deals for Lone Parents and Partners, the Working Families Tax Credit and childcare tax credit and fairness at work measures such as parental leave, improved maternity leave and rights for part-time workers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what steps are taken to protect personnel in training and operational areas exposed to discharged depleted uranium ammunition.  [112839]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00314w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 March 2000]:</i> We do not use depleted uranium during routine training. It is used during trials and has been used in operations. Detailed safety instructions are distributed to all Arms and Services Training Establishments and to all units serving in operational theatres where there may be a risk of exposure to discharged depleted uranium ammunition. MOD trial sites are subject to a comprehensive programme of monitoring, the results of which are published annually.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many rounds of depleted uranium shells were fired by coalition forces during the Gulf War; how many were fired by UK tanks; how many UK tanks carried depleted uranium shells; and if he will make a statement.  [113956]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00314w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The US Department of Defense has assessed that over 860,000 DU-based ammunition rounds, of varying calibre, were used by US Forces during the 1990-91 Gulf conflict. The MOD's current assessment is that UK tanks fired fewer than 100 DU rounds against Iraqi military forces during hostilities, although additional 



<P>
<P><I>14 Mar 2000 : Column: 104W</I><P>
rounds were fired during earlier work-up training in Saudi Arabia. DU munitions were available in-theatre for the British Main Battle Tanks deployed in combat. These totalled 176 with a further 45 as in-theatre War Reserve.
<P>

<a name="00314w02.html_para2">DU-based tank ammunition was brought into service by the Ministry of Defence because of its unique capability as a kinetic penetrator against the most modern types of Main Battle Tank armour. No satisfactory alternative material currently exists to achieve the levels of penetration required to defeat modern tanks. Although research is being conducted into alternative materials, none have so far demonstrated significant potential. There are, therefore, no plans to remove DU-based ammunition from service. Indeed, if the safety of British troops in any conflict required such a capability against modern Main Battle Tank armour, DU-based ammunition would be deployed and used.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what quantities of strategic nuclear material have been declared surplus to military requirements in the last 10 years; when, and in what form, the material was transferred to civilian facilities and in which locations; on what date the material was notified to Euratom and IAEA safeguards authorities as non-military; when the first visits were paid by inspection teams from each body respectively to verify the notification; and what costs have been incurred to date in the transfer of status of the nuclear material.  [113285]<P>

<P>

<a name="00314w02.html_para3">During July and August 1998, the following material was brought into safeguards:

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what benefits the equipping of the CM010 optronic masts to the Astute Class nuclear attack submarines will provide; what is the cost of the contract for them; and if he will make a statement.  [113912]<P>

<P>
<a name="00314w02.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The optronics masts to be fitted to the three Astute Class submarines currently on order supersede the conventional optical periscopes fitted to earlier RN submarines. The optronics masts offer significant benefits over conventional periscopes. These include improved hull integrity (strength) as the optronics mast no longer needs to penetrate the hull of the submarine; and greater operational flexibility such as improved target analysis, improved effectiveness in different sea states/weather conditions, improved night vision and the ability to distribute and display images on other systems within the submarine. The optronics masts also offer lower through life costs as they require a lower level of technical expertise and maintenance facilities to support them.
<P>

<a name="00314w02.html_para9">The optronics masts are being procured from Pilkington Optronics Ltd. The contract for the masts was placed by the Ministry's Prime Contractor for the Astute Class submarines (BAE SYSTEMS) following competition. The terms and conditions of the sub-contract, including the price, are "commercial--in confidence" and I am, therefore, withholding this information under exemption 13 of the Government's Code on Open Government.

 The Ministry of Defence has examined the possibility that pollution caused by oil well fires during the Gulf conflict could be responsible for the ill-health now being experienced by some UK Gulf veterans. No evidence has so far emerged to suggest that this is the case. In March 1991, when UK Forces were stationed in Kuwait, consideration was given to the health risks from oil well fires. Information supplied by Shell UK stated that Kuwaiti crude oil had a high (2.5 per cent.) sulphur content. Combustion products were said to contain carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide and particulates which were not carcinogens.

The results were that exposure to oil fire smoke did not appear to have any effect on respiratory function. No assessment has since been made by the Ministry of Defence of the long-term effects of smoke inhalations in the Gulf.

 <i>[holding answer 13 March 2000]:</i> The European Staff Requirement for the Future Large Aircraft (now A400M) includes the specific requirements of all seven countries involved in the programme and has security and commercial sensitivities attached to some of the information it contains. I am therefore withholding this information under Exemption 1 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how long the London Underground escalators to the Victoria Line from Kings Cross railway station will be out of commission.  [113077]<P>

<P>
<a name="00314w04.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 These are operational matters for London Underground. They have informed me that in addition to temporary repairs, agreed with HMRI, to bring some of the recently discovered defective escalators back into service quickly, they will start a full programme of work to repair or replace the defective escalators in late May, once redesigned shafts have been manufactured. The programme will be completed in the autumn. Kings Cross is high on London Underground's priorities along with Oxford Circus and Walthamstow Central.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is the total number of deaths from asbestos-related diseases in the UK for each of the last five years for which figures are available broken down by <i>(a)</i> region and <i>(b)</i> occupation.  [113328]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00314w04.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The figures available are set out in the tables. These detail the deaths from mesothelioma and asbestosis in Great Britain between 1993 and 1997 by region and by occupational group. Occupational information is only available for people aged under 75 at the time of death and has only been recorded in the Health and Safety Executive's register of asbestosis deaths since 1995. No information is available for asbestos-related lung cancer because it cannot be medically distinguished from lung cancer from other causes.
<P>

<a name="00314w04.html_para5">A more detailed breakdown of the figures on mesothelioma deaths in Great Britain by occupation and by geographical distribution, published by the Health and Safety Executive, will be placed in the House of Commons Library.

 The removal of abandoned vehicles in the Greater London area is the responsibility of local authorities under the Refuse Disposal (Amenity) Act 1978 and the Department holds no central records of the number of vehicles identified as abandoned and subsequently removed and disposed of.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what monitoring his Department carries out on emissions from open-topped tourist buses in town and city centres.  [113639]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00314w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Government do not specifically monitor emissions from open-topped tourist buses. These vehicles only account for a very small proportion of bus journeys, even in towns and cities with a large tourism industry.
<P>

<a name="00314w05.html_para0">The Government, nevertheless, want to encourage more clean, low emission vehicles for public and private bus services in towns and cities. We have introduced fiscal measures to encourage cleaner vehicles and fuels, including a VED concession for buses with very low particulate emissions and a fuel duty differential for ultra low sulphur diesel.
<P>

<a name="00314w05.html_para1">All buses and coaches are already subject to a black smoke emission test, as part of the annual roadworthiness test, and the Vehicle Inspectorate has powers to conduct roadside emission testing of these vehicles. The Government are also currently considering whether local authorities should have similar powers following trials by seven local authorities.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will estimate the cost of extending the 50 per cent. concessionary fare scheme to 100 per cent., using the same basis as outlined in the national concessionary fares scheme cost assessment (annexe B), in the consultation document, "Implementation of Statutory Minimum Concessionary Fares Commitment".  [113582]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00314w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hill </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 March 2000]:</i> The estimated extra cost, in respect of people of pensionable age, and assuming a minimum charge of &#163;5 for a bus pass, is in the order of &#163;300 million per year for local authorities in England and Wales. This reflects the fact that relatively few local authorities already operate concessionary fare schemes which provide travel at less than half fare.

Summary provisional estimates published last May in the DETR/GSS Information Bulletin 500 show the area for each Government Office Region of vacant, derelict and other previously developed land and the amounts which either had planning permission or were judged suitable for housing. The extract table shows the provisional results for the Government Office Regions for South East and London. Final estimates will be published shortly. The estimates are a 'snapshot' for 1998, based on the sites reported by local authorities at the time and may only be a partial appraisal. They take no account of future supply of previously developed land. Urban capacity studies, as required by Planning Policy Guidance Note 3: Housing (issued 7 March), will provide local authorities with a further means of identifying the full scope for reuse of land and buildings for housing.

 In almost all circumstances, applications for a Standard Individual Export Licence (SIEL) must be supported by appropriate end-user documentation. Where the intended consignee is a Government body, and the application is not for a licence to export chemicals listed in Schedule 2 or 3 to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) to a state which has not ratified the CWC, a copy of the official Government purchase order or a copy of the relevant part of the Government contract covering the order is normally sufficient.

 <i>[holding answer 13 March 2000]:</i> The entry in the relevant legislation under which the export of goods is controlled is known as their rating. The Export Control Organisation's computer databases have been interrogated and the following results were obtained. Between 1 January 1999 and 3 March 2000, 69 Standard Individual Export Licences (SIELs) and 18 Open Individual Export Licences (OIELs) were issued covering the export to consignees or end-users in Pakistan of goods subject to export control by being listed in Part III of Schedule 1 to the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994, commonly known as the Military List. Individual licences may cover a range of goods with various ratings (and OIELs may also cover a range of countries). Where this is so, the licence is included in the table in the total for all of the relevant ratings.

 The Northern Ireland Act 1998 defines over one hundred public bodies to which the section 75 obligations already apply. However, the Secretary of State may designate additional bodies under section 75(3)(a) and (d) of the Act, including those listed in the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967, to which the obligation should apply. The Parliamentary Commissioner Act lists a large number of public authorities, many of which have little or no influence in Northern Ireland.

At our meeting, the Equality Commission suggested a considerable number of other bodies for inclusion in the order. We plan to consult those bodies suggested to us by the Equality Commission which carry out functions relating to Northern Ireland as part of our consideration of whether they should be designated.
<P>

<a name="00314w08.html_para1">We intend to lay an order before Parliament as soon as possible which will list a number of bodies in respect of which our consultation is complete. In due course we hope a more comprehensive designation order will be drafted, for making later this year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00314w08.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 March 2000]:</i> The Ministry operates a range of schemes to encourage environmentally friendly farming. The Countryside Stewardship (CSS) Scheme and the Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) Scheme both provide for the planting, laying and coppicing of hedgerows. 10,000 km of hedgerows are currently managed under these schemes.
<P>

<a name="00314w08.html_para3">The CSS and some of the 22 ESAs also offer incentives to create field buffer strips. The Ministry is the lead partner in the Habitat Action Plans for cereal field margins and ancient species-rich hedgerows. The announcement by the Minister on 7 December that the funding of agri- environment schemes will be doubled over the next seven years will allow for more hedgerows and field margins to be managed under these schemes.

<a name="00314w09.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 We have made available &#163;50 million over three years for health authorities to improve treatment services for drug misusers. A priority is to develop and increase the provision of primary care, which is recognised as the ideal setting for the treatment of the basic health needs of drug misusers and problems associated with drug misuse. The Department has set the target of involving at least 20 per cent. of general practitioners in the treatment of drug misusers. Revised clinical guidelines were issued in April last year which recommend shared care as the model for treating drug misusers in primary care. The Standing Conference on Drug Abuse produced a "training pack" last year for primary care teams in support of the clinical guidelines, on behalf of the Department.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment has he made of the extent of disruption to NHS Direct Services caused by the failure of computers in the week beginning 20 February; and what action is being taken to ensure complete reliability in the telecommunications infrastructure for NHS Direct.  [113180]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00314w09.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 On 20 February, British Telecom had a major fault with two of the three main BT routers for 0845, 0345, 0870, 0645, 0800 link-line numbers. This left one router to carry all traffic. This British Telecom problem, over which "NHS Direct" has no control, affected many services including banks, building societies, and insurance companies, public utility emergency numbers and the Samaritans and domestic violence helplines, among others within the voluntary sector<i>.</i> This was the first time that this problem has occurred. "NHS Direct" on that day handled about 1,000 calls less than the number of calls expected.

<P>

<a name="00314w09.html_para2">In order to communicate this problem, "NHS Direct" immediately released a press notice urging callers who were unable to get a ringing tone after trying 0845 4647 to use alternative health services.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00314w09.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 March 2000]:</i> The White Paper "The New NHS; Modern, and Dependable" announced our commitment to NHS Direct. At present, NHS Direct covers 65 per cent. of the population. By the end of October this year, the whole of England will be covered. I have placed copies of the list of <i>(a)</i> constituencies, <i>(b)</i> health authorities and <i>(c)</i> counties that are (i) covered and (ii) not covered by NHS Direct in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what studies he has commissioned to establish how many users, as distinct from individual calls, there are of NHS Direct.  [114496]<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="00314w09.html_spnew12"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 NHS Direct currently accounts nationally for about 600 whole-time equivalent nurses. Following the national rollout later this year, we expect the number to increase to about 1,000 nurses, a small number against the overall size of the nursing workforce (330,000 whole-time equivalent in England as of 30 September 1998).
<P>

<a name="00314w09.html_para5">NHS Direct recruits nurses from a wide range of different backgrounds. Some are from a hospital background, others are from primary care or are working outside the National Health Service. NHS Direct also provides opportunities for disabled and work injured nurses. Many staff who work for NHS Direct do so on a part-time basis, allowing them to combine working for NHS Direct with other clinical duties.

 I am grateful that my hon. Friend has persistently raised the case of the Karens.

 The continued detention on espionage charges of a number of Iranians including members of the Iranian Jewish community is a matter of great concern to us. We and our EU partners have repeatedly stressed to the Iranian authorities the importance we attach to this issue.

We will not issue export licences where there is a clearly identifiable risk that the small arms might be used for internal repression or international aggression.

 The British Government have supported in principle Bosnia and Herzegovina's membership of the Council of Europe since its application in December 1998. But we believe that Bosnia and Herzegovina must be able to meet the basic commitments and obligations arising from membership. The Council of Europe has set down 12 central preconditions for Bosnia and Herzegovina's membership. It is clear that further progress is still needed towards the requirements set down by the Council of Europe, particularly in areas such as the functioning of the state-level institutions and the passage of an Election Law. We are continuing to assist Bosnia and Herzegovina in its efforts to meet these requirements and have recently given &#163;50,000 to the Council of Europe for additional assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina specifically for this purpose.

 China is an important and growing presence in the world, with which we need to engage. We have a good and wide ranging relationship with China, which is not just political and commercial, but includes areas such as culture, education and science and technology. Engagement with the Chinese at all levels enables us to promote our interests in these areas and to raise our concerns about human rights and other sensitive issues.

 The European Union's ECOFIN Council on 28 February adopted a Common Position and Council Decision implementing changes to the EU sanctions regime on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which had been agreed at the General Affairs Council on 14 February. Council Decision 2000/177/CFSP introduced, with immediate effect, a revised and expanded list of FRY citizens (representing an increase to a total of 794 names) against whom the EU visa ban applies, and Common Position 2000/176/CFSP suspended the EU flight ban on the FRY for a period of six months. The suspension of the flight ban will come into effect when the necessary amendments have been made to the relevant Council regulations. In parallel we are working with our partners to tighten up the implementation of financial sanctions targeted against the regime.

Friend the Member for Manchester, Central (Mr. Lloyd)--the then Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs--on 13 July 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 141-42W, the Government have decided to introduce a case by case approach to consideration of export licence applications for dual use goods to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia including Kosovo and Montenegro. There are humanitarian developmental and commercial reasons for doing so and it brings us into line with the practice of our major partners. Reconstruction in Kosovo is crucial to the province's development and the UK contribution to Kosovo could potentially be hindered without a change in practice. Applications will be considered consistent with the national export licensing criteria announced in July 1997 and those in the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports. We will not approve any dual use goods licence applications which could benefit the armed forces, internal security forces or similar entities of the authorities in Belgrade.

In line with HMG's policy of increased interchange with the private sector as part of the Modernising Government agenda, there are at present eight private sector secondees at posts overseas, primarily in the US and the Far East. A further 14 secondments were completed over the last year. These include substantive secondments of up to four years and short-term attachments of 3-6 months under the Short Term Business Attachment Scheme.

 We remain concerned about the absence of any independent verification of the whereabouts of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, the Dalai Lama's choice as Panchen Lama. We regularly urge the Chinese authorities to allow access by diplomats or an independent figure to confirm his state of health and living conditions. I raised the matter with Chinese Vice Foreign Minister, Wang Yingfan, in Beijing on 9 November 1999, and was given a written assurance that reports that Gedhun Choekyi Nyima had died were not accurate and that he was alive and well. We also raised the Gedhun's case during the fourth round of the UK/China bilateral human rights dialogue in February and received similar assurances. We will continue to press for independent access.

 When the Single Room Rent restriction was introduced, the estimated yearly savings, which took little account of behavioural changes, for 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99 were &#163;13/&#163;57/&#163;62 million respectively.

<a name="00314w13.html_spnew10"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 In 1997, the Department of Social Security and the Department of the Environment Transport and Regions (DETR) commissioned the London Research Centre to explore the role of Housing Benefit in the private rented sector. In particular, the study sought to investigate the impact of the single room rent and local reference rent. The study included interviews with young people who had their Housing Benefit restricted under the single room rent rules, as well as with other tenants, landlords, Housing Benefit Officers and Rent Officers. The report was published by DETR in April 1999, with the title 'Housing Benefit and the Private Rented Sector'.
<P>

<a name="00314w13.html_para14">The findings of the report concluded that the single room rent restriction is causing difficulties for some young people under 25 years in accessing and maintaining accommodation. We are considering the future of the single room rent as part of our wider review of housing. We will be taking account of all the available research which will include the localised reports we received from a variety of organisations on the effects of the single room rent.

<a name="00314w13.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Willetts: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what is the cost of implementing the housing benefit verification framework; and what estimates have been made of the savings in housing benefit costs through fraud reduction.  [114103]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00314w13.html_spnew11"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Government have made available &#163;100 million to enable all local authorities to implement the Verification Framework. By the end of 1999-2000 we expect to have spent over &#163;34.5 million funding the implementation of the Verification Framework in 229 local authorities. Some authorities will have received set-up costs, some will have received continuing costs and some will have received both set-up and continuing costs.
<P>

<a name="00314w13.html_para15">Although it is too early to draw firm conclusions about the impact of the implementation of the Framework on savings in Housing Benefit costs the increasing number of authorities implementing the Framework will make an important contribution towards reducing the estimated &#163;840 million lost each year through fraud and error in Housing and Council Tax Benefit claims. A robust approach to checking at the outset and during the life of a claim will prevent fraudulent claims from entering the system and will detect fraud at the earliest point during the life of a claim. Initial views from local authorities that are fully compliant with the Framework indicate that its implementation has already led to the prevention and detection of a considerable amount of fraudulent claims.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00314w13.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Willetts: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what evidence he has assessed and what monitoring is being undertaken, of the impact of the housing benefit verification framework on <i>(a)</i> the overall level of housing benefit claims, <i>(b)</i> the level of housing benefit claims from pensioners and <i>(c)</i> the time taken to process new and repeat claims for housing benefit.  [114102]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00314w13.html_spnew12"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 All local authorities are required to provide Housing Benefit management information. In addition, local authorities fully compliant with the Framework provide Verification Framework management information. This information will enable us to measure the impact of the introduction of the Framework. At present we only have initial views and anecdotal information concerning a limited number of local authorities.
<P>

<a name="00314w13.html_para16">We are currently examining, and we will continue to monitor, the impact of the Verification Framework on the number of Housing Benefit claims, the overall Housing Benefit caseload and the time taken to process claims. As part of our on-going evaluation of the Framework we will examine the number of pensioners receiving Housing Benefit.
<P>

<a name="00314w13.html_para17">As soon as robust evidence becomes available the Department will consider publishing this in the usual way.

 The review's objective is to measure the extent of losses due to fraud and error, including fraud involving landlords, in Housing Benefit paid with Income Support or Jobseeker's Allowance (Income Based). The sample to be reviewed is therefore made up of a random selection of Housing Benefit claimants including those whose benefit is paid direct to their landlord. The results will give us a representative value for the amount lost through landlord fraud.

 In the year ending 31 March 1999, the Office of the Pensions Advisory Service (OPAS) recommended 170 complainants take their case to the Pensions Ombudsman. OPAS suggested that a further 73 complainants, where the evidence was inconclusive, might consider taking their case to the Pensions Ombudsman. Of the 510 cases determined by the Pensions Ombudsman in the year to 31 March 1999, 122 of those upheld had been referred by OPAS.

Friend the Member for Manchester, Central (Mr. Lloyd), to discuss proposals for holding the 2005 World Athletics Championships. This presentation was followed up by my officials and Sport England who discussed the proposals further with the Chief Executive of Manchester City Council. However, the decision by UK Athletics to submit a London bid for the 2005 World Athletics Championships and the BOA confirming that it will only consider a London based Olympic bid has effectively ruled out Manchester as an option for a national athletics venue. I also understand that the delay caused by redesigning the Manchester stadium upgrade to host the World Athletics Championships could have put the 2002 Commonwealth Games in jeopardy.

 The Police Pension Scheme is administered locally by individual police authorities and the information requested is not held centrally. However, as the vast majority of regular police officers choose to be members of the Police Pension Scheme the number of active members of the Scheme in each force will be slightly less than its total number of officers.

<P>
<a name="00314w16.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Association of Chief Police Officers' "Harmonisation of Business Processes" document has been one of a number of emerging influences which have been taken account of, and incorporated into, the new inspection model developed by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. The new inspection model will assist us in our efforts to compare performance across police authorities and Basic Command Units.

<a name="00314w18.html_para5">Persistent young offenders often exhibit challenging behaviour. Preliminary analysis shows that half of the early recipients of the Secure Training Order had been excluded from school and at least 75 per cent. had been in local authority homes care. Many trainees have a history of disruptive behaviour in local authority homes. Previous community-based attempts to tackle their offending have proven to be unsuccessful.

 The capital costs of secure training centres are met by the contractors, with part of the contract payment (the fixed element) covering the cost of financing the capital expenditure. We estimate that the capital costs are in the order of &#163;10 million per centre. The average cost per place per year, including the fixed element and based on full occupancy, is: Medway &#163;149,445; Rainsbrook &#163;118,161 and; Hassockfield &#163;131,827 (all at January 2000 prices). There are 120 places in total at the three centres. There are currently plans to provide two further secure training centres.

 There are three secure training centres, each contracted to hold up to 40 trainees. Medway opened on 17 April 1998, Rainsbrook opened on 1 July 1999 and Hassockfield opened on 17 September 1999.
<P>

<P>
<UL>(2) how many allegations of breaches of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, its codes of practices and licence conditions were made by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection in their report about Harlan UK; and how many of these were substantiated by the results of the investigation made by his officials;  [114201]
<P>
(3) how many lines of text of his officials' report into the allegations made by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection against Harlan UK were blanked out or removed at the request of the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection before a copy was placed in the Library; what subjects these sections refer to; what reasons were given by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection for requesting that these sections of the report be blanked out or removed; if these sections include suggestions by his officers that the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection investigator was herself responsible for the breaches that formed the basis of the allegations made against Harlan UK; and if he will publish the full, unedited version of his official's report of their investigation.  [114202]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00314w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 As originally summarised by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV), there were 22 clusters of allegations which were investigated by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate. A further set of eight allegations was submitted in July 1999. One breach of a condition of certification, mentioned separately in two allegations, was confirmed. No action has been judged necessary in relation to the remaining allegations.
<P>

<a name="00314w18.html_para9">Blanked out areas of the text in the report placed in the Library on 8 March reflect confidentiality agreements entered into by the Home Office and points of commercial sensitivity and personal safety. About 90 lines of text were blanked out because of a confidentiality agreement with the BUAV, accepted in July 1999 in order to obtain information to enable a full Home Office investigation. This agreement covered incidental material from videotapes, an audio-tape and diaries kept by the undercover investigator. An interview conducted with her in the course of the Inspectorate's investigation was also subject to the same reservations. Discussions are continuing with the BUAV about the release of confidentiality of these sections of the report, so that a fuller version can be published.
<P>

<a name="00314w18.html_para10">In excess of 1,000 hours were expended on the investigation into the allegations and the preparation of the report at a cost of more than &#163;36,000. Inspectors were also diverted from other work protecting animals to

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is his estimate of the impact on the average daily prison population of ending automatic release on licence of offenders; and if he will make a statement.  [114644]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00314w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Prisoners sentenced to less than 12 months are released automatically half way through their sentence unless additional days have been imposed for breaches of discipline. These prisoners will be "at risk" until the end of their sentence; that is, if they commit a further imprisonable offence before the end of their original sentence, the court dealing with the new offence may add all or part of the outstanding sentence to any new sentence it imposes. The effect of stopping automatic unconditional release would be approximately to double the number of prisoners currently serving sentences of up to 12 months, which at the end of January 2000 was 7,200.
<P>

<a name="00314w19.html_para0">Prisoners sentenced to 12 months or more but less than four years are released automatically half way through their sentence (subject to additional days). They are released on licence and subject to supervision up to the three-quarter point of their sentence (or to the end in the case of some sex offenders) and are "at risk" until the end of their original sentence. The effect of stopping automatic conditional release would be to double the number of prisoners currently serving sentences of 12 months and up to four years, which at the end of January 2000 was 19,400.
<P>

<a name="00314w19.html_para1">Those sentenced to four years or more are eligible for parole half way through their sentence. If parole is not granted then or at a subsequent parole review, release occurs at the two-thirds point of the sentence. Release is on licence and subject to supervision up to the three- quarters point of the sentence (or to the end in the case of some sex offenders). All are "at risk" until the end of their original sentence. The effect of stopping discretionary release could be to increase the number of prisoners serving determinate sentences of four years or more by up to 20,000.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if, in delivering best value, it is his policy that comparisons should be made between the performance of basic command units within police forces; and if he will make a statement on the criteria to be used.  [114457]<P>

<P>
<a name="00314w19.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 In January this year, for the first time, the recorded crime statistics were published at Basic Command Unit (BCU) level. This allows local people to judge and compare the performance of their local police. From July 2000, this will be augmented with recorded crime statistics being published at crime and disorder reduction partnership level.
<P>

<a name="00314w19.html_para3">Both the BCU and the partnerships' data will be published in a form which will assist comparison on a like with like basis. We are working, in conjunction with Leeds University, to draw up families of BCUs and partnerships, so that they can be compared with one another within these families. We expect the existence of these families to be a significant help to police forces and authorities who, under Best Value, wish to benchmark performance at local level.

<a name="00314w19.html_para4">From April 2001, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary hope to undertake more comprehensive inspections at BCU level. This will also allow comparisons to be made.
