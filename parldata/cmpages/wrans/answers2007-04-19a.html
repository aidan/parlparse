 This Department is represented on the cross-government Ministerial Steering group which is promoting sensible risk management as part of its work on tackling perceptions of a compensation culture. Officials are working with colleagues from the Department for Constitutional Affairs, Local Government Employers, and the Health and Safety Executive, on a workshop &#147;Risk and Redress&#151;The way Forward for Local Government&#148;, which will look at approaches to managing risk sensibly. The workshop will involve local government stakeholders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="70419w0001.htm_para0"><a name="070419115000178">In addition the Department is taking a number of specific steps to promote good risk management. The Department will shortly bring forward revised guidance under the &#145;How To&#146; programme, which aims to raise the quality of town centres, residential areas, and parks and green spaces by encouraging and supporting a climate of good practice. The new guidance will provide advice on how local managers of the public realm, and parks in particular, should assess and manage risk and the perception of risk.</p>

 There is no legislation preventing local councillors from discussing issues of concern with their constituents or other members of the public. However, in any such discussion about matters such as a land sale, councillors, if they are to be involved in the final decision, must avoid giving the impression of having a predetermined view, or otherwise risk that decision being challenged in the courts. It is a matter for each member to ensure that, in the circumstances of particular cases, such an impression is not given.  <br>

 The Code for Sustainable Homes (the Code) came into effect in the beginning of April 2007 as a voluntary assessment and rating system. All homes built with Housing Corporation and Communities and Local Government housing growth programme funding, and all housing developed by English Partnerships will be built to Code Level 3 from April 2008. These new homes will be 25 per cent. more energy efficient than current Building Regulations, use less water than the average home and have an improved environmental performance overall.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (1) what her Department&#146;s most recent estimate is of the costs to industry of complying with the gaming machine regulations to be made in accordance with sections 240 and 241 of the Gambling Act 2005 and the new machine technical standards; [132217]</p>

 The Department is consulting industry and other groups on proposals under sections 240 and 241 of the Gambling Act 2005, including on potential compliance costs and lead times, and within the context of the licensing objectives to keep gambling crime free, to make sure that gambling is fair and open and to protect children and vulnerable adults from harm.

 The Independent European Sport Review was instigated under the UK Presidency following the expression of concerns about the state of football by both UEFA and FIFA.

framework. It&#146;s publication in final form in October has triggered a wide-ranging debate both within sport and at EU level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="70419w0003.htm_para2"><a name="070419115000424">The Review contains recommendations aimed at football&#146;s governing bodies, the European Commission and member states. Sport is autonomous and much of the responsibility for taking forward the issues raised lies with sport itself. It is for football to agree what it wants to achieve, develop more detailed proposals and engage with the political authorities. My Department has been encouraging this process and there is a well developed debate taking place among the numerous Clubs, Leagues and Governing Bodies across Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="70419w0003.htm_para3"><a name="070419115000425">UEFA has made good progress and already implemented a range of the Review&#146;s recommendations aimed at it. These include putting in place a new Strategic Council to involve clubs, leagues and players in top-level decision-making, a range of enhancements to their Club Licensing system, the launch of a feasibility study into a European Supporters Direct, based on the highly successful UK model, and enhancement of anti-racism disciplinary measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="70419w0003.htm_para4"><a name="070419115000426">The key issue the Review raises for the Commission and member states is how the 2000 Nice Declaration can be effectively implemented to ensure the special nature of Sport is recognised in policy-making and in the application of EU rules. Doing so will help overcome the current uncertainty facing those involved in the game and help enable them to find the right balance between its commercial and sporting sides.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="70419w0003.htm_para5"><a name="070419115000427">The UK has been working closely with the Commission and other member states to take this forward. The Commission will publish a White Paper on Sport this summer that will address this issue and respond to the Review&#146;s recommendations aimed at it. I would like to see this set out clearly how the Commission plans to &#145;sports-proof&#146; its decision-making and thus fulfil the commitments made in the Nice Declaration. I strongly welcome indications that it will also recommend the development of an ongoing structured dialogue between sport and the EU aimed at finding a way forward on the kind of issues raised by the Review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="70419w0003.htm_para6"><a name="070419115000428">There is widespread support across Europe to help sport tackle the challenges facing it. The European Parliament issued a Report on the future of Professional Sport on 28 March (the Belet Report) which welcomes the Review and asks the Commission to establish an action plan based upon its recommendations. The Council of Europe has, at the UK&#146;s instigation, agreed to consider the issues raised by the Review as part of its new Enlarged Partial Agreement on Sport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="70419w0003.htm_para7"><a name="070419115000429">The Review is one of a number of recent initiatives that have acted as a catalyst to the wider debate that has been going on in football, and other sports, about where the right balance between its commercial and sporting sides lies and how it can best secure its future stability and success within the wider EU framework. I look forward to the Commission&#146;s White Paper as the next key milestone in taking forward the debate on how the political level can help football, and sport more widely, to achieve this within the wider EU framework.</p>

<i> [holding answer 19 March 2007]</i>: The assessment of all Defence accommodation is undertaken by grading boards consisting of a mixture of service officers and technical experts. The process of grading involves assigning deficiency points against a predefined checklist of assessment criteria. The number of deficiency points awarded, if any, then determines the grade for charge, on a scale of one to four, and hence the level of accommodation charge. Normally accommodation is graded on a four year rolling programme. A grading board may also convene on completion of a refurbishment or if the grade for charge is challenged by the occupant shortly after move in.</p>

 UK forces are expressly forbidden from hooding any prisoners or making them adopt stress positions under any circumstances.

Handcuffing of prisoners is permitted when necessary to prevent escape and for the protection of UK troops and/or other detainees.</p>

 There are no general minimum qualification requirements for learning support/teaching assistants in schools. It is for schools to determine the suitability of individual candidates for posts. However, there are a range of qualifications and professional standards that support staff can undertake to develop their depth of skills and abilities. These range from bespoke Vocational Qualifications (VQ) such as the Support Work in Schools VQ, through to Level 2 and 3 National Vocational Qualifications and the professional standards for Higher Level Teaching Assistants.</p>

On the basis of this information, the fostering service provider is required to prepare a written report which is referred to the fostering panel for consideration; the fostering panel then makes its own recommendation about the individual's suitability to foster. The final decision is made, taking into account this recommendation, by the fostering service provider. Subject to paragraph 27(6), a person would automatically be considered unsuitable to become a foster carer if he/she, or any other adult member of the household, had committed a specified offence under the terms of the regulations. If this is not the case, the decision as to whether or not to approve an individual as a foster carer is made by the fostering service provider in line with the process outlined above.</p>

I have discussed the human rights abuses taking place in Burma with Juan Mendez, the UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide. I discussed Burma in detail with Ibrahim Gambari, the UN Under Secretary-General for Political Affairs, on 15 November 2006, following his visit to the country. Most recently, I raised the human rights situation in Burma in my address to the Human Rights Council in Geneva on 13 March and at the EU/ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in Nuremberg on 15 March, in the presence of the Burmese Deputy Foreign Minister.</p>

The notice will set out the reasons for deciding to impose the penalty and the amount of the penalty as well as explaining the steps that the person may take to object to it.

This is in addition to the existing target under MDG 5 to &#147;Reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three quarters between 1990 and 2015&#148;. The new target means that access to reproductive health information, services and supplies should be available to all who need it.

We are proud that the UK fought hard for this target and has supported subsequent work to agree appropriate monitoring indicators.

 As set out in the Air Transport White Paper (2003) and its progress report (2006), the Government believes that aviation&#146;s climate change impacts are best addressed through a Global Emissions Trading scheme. This approach is endorsed by the Stern Review on the economics of climate change which strongly supports carbon pricing to ensure that economic decisions fully reflect social and environmental costs. Until a truly global solution can be found, the inclusion of aviation in the existing EU Emissions Trading scheme represents the best multilateral option available.</p>

 Total sales of biofuels in the UK in 2006 were around 264 million litres, of which around two thirds were biodiesel and one third bioethanol. The Government do not hold precise data on the country of origin of these biofuels. Our understanding is that the great majority of the biodiesel sold in the UK in 2006 was produced domestically, but all of the bioethanol was imported.</p>

<i> [holding answer 18 April 2007]</i>: Under the Transport Act 1985 local authorities have power to secure by means of subsidy contracts the provision of bus services which are necessary to meet the transport needs of their area and which would not be provided other than by subsidy. It is for individual local authorities to decide which bus services should be provided in their area under this power. It is also for them to decide the terms of contracts, and to which operators they should be awarded, after undertaking any necessary competitive tendering exercise. There are no specific limits relating to minimum commercial returns.</p>

In recent months, Northern Rail has introduced an additional six trains to provide additional capacity in West Yorkshire, has announced an additional six trains to strengthen services into Liverpool and, in conjunction with the Department and other partners has secured the retention of eight vehicles in trains serving Leeds that otherwise would have been removed this month.</p>

 The specification for the New Cross Country franchise does not significantly change the number of trains terminating and beginning at Birmingham. The specification will lead to new through journey opportunities and, overall, the Department for Transport expects that the changes proposed will result in broadly the same passenger numbers. Journey times from Warrington or Glasgow to Birmingham will reduce and hence average travel times to the South and South West will be broadly similar to today.</p>

DFID also supports the World Bank&#146;s Debt Reduction Facility, which provides grants to enable countries to buy back their commercial debts at very significant discount (on average over 90 per cent. reduction), thereby removing the potential for litigation.
