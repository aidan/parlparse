<p><a name="st_5"><a name="51212w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 We have no statistics for the number of animals currently requiring re-homing. However the introduction of the welfare offence is not expected to increase overall numbers significantly. We believe that 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>12 Dec 2005 : Column 1585W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
the majority of sanctuaries are run satisfactory, providing a valuable service to animal welfare. However, there is evidence that a minority pose a risk. The Animal Welfare Bill will enable this risk to be addressed through the introduction of secondary legislation. The Regulatory Impact Assessment published in conjunction with the Bill proposes that all sanctuaries should be required to register with local authorities on the basis of a veterinary assessment and be subject to a code of practice by 2009. The regulation of animal sanctuaries under the Animal Welfare Bill will enable reliable data to be built up by local authorities so that high-risk establishments can be identified and inspected.

<p>
<a name="51212w01.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">We propose to work closely with welfare organisations and representatives of animal sanctuaries in preparing secondary legislation. This consultation will enable us to refine our thinking on key issues such as the criteria for regulating a sanctuary and the guidance which the code will give on rehabilitation and re-homing. The draft regulations and code will be subject to public consultation and there will also be the opportunity for discussion in Parliament.

 Advice on food safety is a matter for the Food Standards Agency. They have already issued clear advice that, on basis of current scientific evidence, Avian flu does not pose a food safety risk for UK consumers. For people, the risk of catching the disease comes from being in close contact with live poultry that have the disease, and not through eating cooked poultry. The Agency will continue to monitor the most up-to-date information and evidence, as it becomes available and will keep an open mind as to any information that may lead to its advice being updated.

The Central Science Laboratory carried out two studies. The first, in 2002, looked at the prospects and potential impacts of liquid biofuels on UK agriculture, the farmed environment, landscape and rural economy. The second, in 2003, looked at industry support, cost of carbon savings and agricultural implications. Cambridge university is currently carrying out a review of the economics of energy crops, including those used for biofuels.

<p><a name="st_23"><a name="51212w03.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The evidence in this area is complex. It is difficult to pinpoint sources of infection for individual herd breakdowns, particularly when infection by wildlife is a possibility, and the regional variation in the incidence of the disease complicates the overall picture. It is, therefore, not possible to put a precise figure on the number of cases of bovine TB (bTB) that can be attributed to cattle-to-cattle transmission (or to any other source of infection). It is clear, however, that &quot;cattle-to-cattle transmission is of critical importance&quot; (Independent Scientific Group on cattle TB, 3rd report, p41) and in low bTB incidence areas there is evidence that it could be responsible for around 80 per cent. or more of cases.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51212w03.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_17">The evidence from work recently submitted for publication does suggest that cattle-to-cattle transmission is the main cause of TB spread in areas currently free, or relatively free, of cattle TB.

<p>
<a name="51212w03.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_18">But the situation is quite different in the high incidence areas of the country where 85 to 90 per cent. of all confirmed breakdowns occur. Some herds in these areas are also infected by purchased cattle, but wildlife is a major source of new herd infection and in some counties it may be a more important source than cattle.

Notes:<br>

<sup>(1)</sup> Provisional data downloaded from the State Veterinary Service Data Warehouse on 2 December 2005. Subject to change as more data becomes available.<br>

<sup>(2)</sup> In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) outbreak. When testing resumed in 2002, resources were concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk herds tested immediately after the FMD outbreak was greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, data for 2001 and 2002 are not comparable with other years.<br>

 Section 27 of the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 came into force on 7 June this year, and provides clarification that chewing gum and smoking-related materials are litter for the purposes of Part 4 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. It has always been the case that Defra considered these items to be litter but the legislation now confirms this for the avoidance of any doubt among practitioners.

Tackling these forms of litter is particularly important given the huge cost to local authorities of removing gum once it has become impacted, and the findings of the Local Environmental Quality Survey of England (LEQSE) which show that in both 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 smokers materials were found on 79 per cent. of the sites surveyed and so is one of the most widespread types of litter. Section 27 operates so as to encourage action to be taken by local authorities against these forms of litter through awareness-raising, public campaigns and enforcement action including the use of fixed penalty notices.

This is an interesting proposal, although significant technical issues remain, including on how baselines would in practice be defined and reductions relative to them measured.

 Figures are available for the estimated total amount of paper and plastic materials consumed within the UK and therefore likely to become waste.

The British Plastics Federation estimate that the total amount of plastics consumed within the UK in 2001 was 4.7 million tonnes and this is expected to steadily increase to 5.3 million tonnes in 2005. All plastics are potentially recyclable, but the extent to which this occurs will depend on economic and logistic factors.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps she is taking to develop a quality protocol for certified compost material to enable it to be defined as a product rather than waste.  [31618]</p>




<p><a name="st_74"><a name="51212w07.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The definition of waste in force in the United Kingdom is the definition in Article 1<i>(a)</i> of the Waste Framework Directive (as amended). Whether or not a substance is discarded as waste, and when waste ceases to be waste, are matters which must be determined on the facts of the case and the interpretation of the law is a matter for the courts. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has issued several judgments on the definition of waste which are binding on member states and their &quot;competent authorities&quot;. The composting of waste is classified as a waste recovery operation under the Directive. This means that composting must be carried out under the terms of a waste management licence issued by, or a waste management licensing exemption registered with, the Environment Agency (England and Wales).
</p>


<p>
<a name="51212w07.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_42">The ECJ has ruled that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">&quot;..whether [a substance] is waste, must be determined in the light of all the circumstances, regard being had to the aim of the Directive and the need to ensure that its effectiveness is not undermined.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51212w07.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_43">In practice, this means that waste does not cease to be waste until it has undergone a complete recovery operation and has been fully recovered within the meaning of the directive. A complete recovery operation is one which has the effect of transforming waste into a product which is wholly interchangeable with another 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>12 Dec 2005 : Column 1610W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
product and requires no additional regulation or supervision beyond that applicable to the product which it is replacing. Waste has not undergone a complete recovery operation if, after the operation has been carried out, it continues to present a danger typical of waste (e.g. it continues to be contaminated).

<a name="stpa_44">The Environment Agency considers that <i>(a)</i> source-segregated waste which, after composting, meets a recognised and suitable quality standard (e.g. BSI PAS 100) is likely to be fully recovered within the meaning of the directive; and <i>(b)</i> mixed waste which is composted is likely to remain waste until it is used in a further recovery operation (e.g. land treatment resulting in agricultural benefit or ecological improvement subject to control by the Agency under a licence or registered licensing exemption). These considerations are being taken into account in work currently being undertaken by the Environment Agency and the Waste Resources Action Programme (WRAP) on the development of a quality protocol for waste composting.

<a name="stpa_45">The Department supports the development of such protocols at national level and advocates their development at a European Union level. A key objective of our doing so is to enable our competent authorities, and those engaged in the recovery of waste, to determine with a high degree of certainty the point at which waste has been fully recovered for the purposes of the Waste Framework Directive and has ceased to be waste. This was reflected in the UK&#039;s response of 15 February 2005 to the European Commission&#039;s questionnaire on possible amendments to the directive linked to the Thematic Strategy on the prevention and recycling of

In the event of a failure of the piped water supply, water companies are required to give priority to the domestic needs of the sick, the elderly, the disabled, hospitals, schools and other vulnerable sectors of the population. The minimum amount of water to be provided to all domestic customers when such a failure occurs is 10 litres per head per day. Those vulnerable customers who are housebound will be provided with supplies of bottled water. Water companies maintain a list of their vulnerable customers based on information provided by the customers, and in liaison with local authorities, health agencies and other support bodies.

Part of that certification requires that VGA verifies the &quot;conformity of production&quot; arrangements of the manufacturer to ensure production vehicles and components continue to meet the standards. This is done through an audit of the manufacturer&#039;s quality management systems. With the introduction of ISO 9000&#151;quality management systems&#151;manufacturers requested VGA to extend the auditing service to include the issue of certificates.

 DFID expenditure for the Overseas Territories for each of the financial years from 1998&#150;99 to 2004&#150;05 is set out in the table. A number of territories, for example Montserrat and St. Helena, still need significant levels of support to help meet basic needs and promote growth and, in the case of Pitcairn, a need now for budgetary aid to cover essential recurrent expenditure. Declining levels of support, for example in Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands, follow increased prosperity and economic growth.

 Progress towards Euro-Mediterranean free trade has been one of the main achievements of Euro-Mediterranean relations since the Euro-Mediterranean process was launched in 1995. Association Agreements covering free trade have been negotiated with all Southern Mediterranean partners. The liberalisation of trade in goods in the Mediterranean region is now a reality and most industrial goods originating in Southern Mediterranean countries enjoy duty free access to the EU. Conversely, Mediterranean countries are progressively dismantling tariffs on imports of EU industrial goods over a period of 12 years. The adoption in 2003 of a protocol on rules of origin has allowed economic operators to cumulate processing made in different countries of the region in order to obtain preferential treatment for their products more easily. Progress has also been made towards the conclusion of South-South agreements (eg the Agadir free trade agreement between Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco in 2004).

 None. The Department has for many years maintained advice on its website on safety in the home.

 The Government believe that security of energy supply is best delivered by ensuring that market mechanisms provide incentives to energy suppliers to meet demand. This includes financial penalties, which can be very stringent depending on the overall balance of the market, where suppliers fail to balance the amount of electricity supplied by them to the national grid with the amount of electricity used by their customers. Responsibility for deciding how best to meet demand&#151;for example, by restoring mothballed generating plants or building up coal stocks or back-up fuel for gas-fired power stations&#151;rests with the electricity supply industry itself.

 The UK&#039;s presidency of the EU&#039;s Council of Ministers continues until the end of December; progress to date has been made on a number of fronts. This includes:
</p>


<p>
<a name="51212w23.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_102">EU Market Liberalisation: The best means we have of ensuring our energy supplies is the development of an open and competitive EU energy market. It is for this reason that I pressed the Competition Commissioner to undertake a competition inquiry into the state of the European Energy Market in electricity and gas (announced in June 2005). The UK has also supported the Commission&#039;s report on implementation of the existing directives in electricity and gas. The interim report of the competition inquiry and the 2005 implementation report were both published on 15 November. The UK facilitated substantive discussion of the two reports at the Energy Council on 1 December, where, on the basis of presentations by Commissioners Kroes and Piebalgs, the presidency was able to conclude that secure electricity and gas supplies at competitive prices, delivered on open, transparent and competitive markets are crucial to Europe&#039;s competitiveness and that full implementation of the second electricity and gas directives was paramount.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51212w23.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_103">There have also been important steps taken on Energy Efficiency. At the UK&#039;s Energy Council on 1 December, energy efficiency was recognised as making an important contribution to all three primary energy objectives of competitive markets, security of supply and tackling climate change. Negotiations have been ongoing during the UK presidency on the Energy End-Use Efficiency and Energy Services Directive. We have worked hard to reach a Council position under our presidency and we expect the final agreement of the European Parliament on 14 December. In addition, we have pushed for more long-term action, facilitating discussion of the Commission&#039;s Green Paper on energy efficiency. We also held a successful conference on Energy Efficiency on 2&#150;3 November in London.

The UK has also furthered the EU&#039;s relations with external actors during our presidency, with a view to enhancing our security of supply (as per parliamentary answer 2005/2255). The UK held Permanent Partnership Council on Energy with Russia on 3 October, participated in the EU-OPEC dialogue, on behalf of the Council, in Vienna on 2 December; and facilitated the signing of a treaty establishing an Energy Community (with South East Europe), signed on 25 October. The UK has also been working with the Energy Charter Secretariat ahead of their annual conference on 9 December, particularly on the long running negotiations on a Protocol on Energy Transit.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51212w23.html_para14">
<a name="stpa_104">Finally, the potential for a European Energy policy was discussed at the Hampton Court Heads of State Informal in October. The Commission plans to take this forward through a Green Paper in 2006 and with a view to reporting to the 2006 December European Council. The EU&#039;s Security of Energy Supply will be an important feature of this document, on which the UK will continue to work with the Commission.

The strategic role is to influence and advise both Departments and agencies on the implications of new responsibilities and government initiatives based on their technical knowledge and expertise in project processes and agency procedures. This helps avoid duplication of effort, maximises the use of resources and so achieves value for money.

 It is not possible to accurately estimate what percentage of young people will be eligible for education maintenance allowance (EMA) at sub-national level. However, for the academic year 2005/06, we estimate that around 55 per cent. of young people in full-time education nationally will be eligible for EMA. Eligibility in Doncaster local education authority as a whole is likely to be higher than this.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what measures she is taking to reduce the burden of administration on head teachers.  [35511]</p>




<p><a name="st_233"><a name="51212w33.html_spnew1"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 First we are determined that head teachers have the time and support to provide good leadership to manage their schools. That is why from the start of this school year every head teacher has a contractual entitlement to &quot;dedicated headship time&quot;. Head teachers must have dedicated time to lead their schools, as well as manage them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51212w33.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_161">And with the right leadership much school management can be delegated effectively. Through our workforce remodelling agenda we are supporting schools in recruiting very many numbers of administrative and support staff to free school leaders to lead and teachers time to teach. This ensures the best use of resources to improve outcomes for children.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51212w33.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_162">We are also establishing a new relationship with schools; this will strip away clutter and bureaucracy in schools. Key aspects include the introduction of an improved and streamlined data collection system, more user-friendly communications (ordering publications online when the schools require them rather than when DfES sends them out automatically) and fewer of them; and a Single Plan from which Ofsted and other bodies will draw on information about the school and its performance. This will make the planning process more coherent and less time-consuming.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51212w33.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_163">We remain determined to make sure our policies have the maximum impact on standards with the minimum burden on head teachers. That is why we have announced in the recent Schools White Paper that the independent Implementation Review Unit, (IRU) will continue to serve until at least 2008. The IRU, which is a group of practising head teachers and senior staff in schools will therefore continue to scrutinise our policies and ensure that we understand the impact of our initiatives on schools and how best to introduce them from a schools perspective.

 The average public sector Prison Service daily food cost per prisoner for 2004&#150;05 was &#163;1.85. The average cost per meal per prisoner is based on the understanding that breakfast, lunch and dinner account for approximately 20 per cent., 40 per cent. and 40 per cent. respectively of the daily food cost. Using these figures the average cost per meal per prisoner was: breakfast 37.5p; lunch 73.8p; and, dinner 73.8p.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73">The UK Parliamentary electorate excludes residents of countries other than the UK and the Commonwealth and includes UK citizens resident abroad. In addition not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth. prisoners, etc, are not eligible) and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place. Also there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. This latter is the main reason why in some Constituencies the population aged 18 and over is less than those registered to vote. These factors may have a different impact from place to place.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_74">Furthermore, you should note that the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has revised the mid-2001 population estimates since the publication of the 2001 Census results. In September 2003, revisions were made that added approximately 193,000 to the population of England and Wales. This revision primarily related to the addition of a number of young males that were not captured by the Census. In September 2004, ONS made further revisions as a result of concluding studies designed to improve population estimates in the areas that proved hardest to count in the 2001 Census in England and Wales. The results of this work showed that the Census worked well in most areas, but that there were a few cases where it was not able sufficiently to adjust for exceptional circumstances. The analysis showed that there was a need for revisions to the 2001 Census based population estimates of around 107,000 for England and Wales as a whole. The adjustments were included in the new mid-year population estimates for 2001, published in 2004. The census database itself was not revised following the publication of these adjustments.

<a name="51212w40.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_199">Infrastructure results vary widely from one area to another and from one development to another, and so it is not possible to apply a general formula to growth plans. In order to underpin the plans for the growth areas, studies were commissioned on the growth areas (e.g. the 2002 Milton Keynes and South Midlands study undertaken by Roger Tym and Partners) and on individual locations within the growth areas (e.g. the 2003 Milton Keynes and Aylesbury Growth Area studies, also prepared by Roger Tym and Partners). These studies have included information on infrastructure requirements and costing and have been made public in order to inform the regional planning documents relevant to the growth areas (e.g. the Milton Keynes South Midlands Sub-Regional Strategy).

<a name="stpa_200">Both housing development and infrastructure investment are on-going activities. The allocation of individual houses and expenditures on infrastructure to &quot;growth&quot; and &quot;background levels&quot; is not a practical option. Nor is it practical or desirable to halt all development until all of the investment contemplated in support of that development is in place. Indeed, infrastructure requirements will change over time, reflecting, for example, the detailed geography of housing and jobs, as well as changes in technology, consumer preferences and service provision. Rather, infrastructure needs to be put in place on a timely basis to support growth in a locality and needs to be planned for on a dynamic basis. We look to local partners, in particular the local delivery vehicles, to construct their business plans accordingly and to work with regional and national bodies in prioritising funding towards timely provision of infrastructure.

 I understand from my noble Friend, Lord Rooker, that Northern Ireland received Barnett consequentials as part of the 2004 Spending Review. They were received as a result of funding allocated to DEFRA for increases in the standard rate of landfill tax. As part of the priorities and Budget process, decisions on the allocation of resources have to be taken in the context of local needs and priorities. Therefore, in this instance, it was decided to allocate these resources elsewhere within the Northern Ireland Block where the need is greatest.

 Units to wheel-clamp unlicensed vehicles were introduced in Northern Ireland in 1998 and camera detection units in 2001. Output from the wheel-clamping units is measured in the number of vehicles clamped not prosecutions. Separate recording of prosecutions arising from enforcement action by camera units did not begin until 2003&#150;04. For vehicle excise duty offences it is the normal policy to offer out of court settlements rather than proceed direct to court. Resulting from camera detections, in 2003&#150;04 1,695 people paid out of court (OCS) settlements and 217 were prosecuted in court. In 2004&#150;05, 1,830 paid OCSs and 306 were prosecuted in court.

Contact centre staff ask the customer a series of questions to assess their potential eligibility to Jobcentre Plus benefits. They then arrange to call the customer back to complete the claim form, which is sent to the customer to check and sign. They will also arrange a work focused interview at the customer&#039;s local Jobcentre Plus office where this is appropriate.</p>

Notes:<br>

1. The figures are based on data from the 5 per cent. samples, but they have been adjusted to make their totals consistent with the WPLS data. These figures are therefore subject to a degree of sampling variation.<br>

2. The data are taken from an extract of PSCS as at 31 March 2005.<br>

3. In certain cases, caseload figures for certain countries are nil or negligible, hence the expenditure has also been suppressed.<br>

4. Certain caseloads produced from the 5 per cent. sample data are under 500 and are subject to a high degree of sampling error, hence the associated expenditure values should only be used as a guide to the current situation.<br>

5. The winter fuel payment estimate includes Gibraltar, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland.<br>

6. State pension information is recorded on a weekly basis.<br>

7. Total weekly benefit figures have been rounded to the nearest hundred pounds.<br>

1. Estimates are based on the Lifetime Labour Market Database 2, 2003&#150;04. This is a 1 per cent. sample of the national insurance records.<br>

2. It has been assumed that individuals accrue entitlement to basic state pension between 2003&#150;04 and 2006&#150;07 at the same rate at which they have accrued basic state pension over their working life to date.<br>

3. Every year between 2006&#150;07 and state pension age is treated as a qualifying year for basic state pension.<br>

4. Women who have interacted with the national insurance recording system at some point during their working lives, but who are not estimated to be resident in the UK in 2003&#150;04, are excluded.<br>

5. It is assumed that all women who appear on the Lifetime Labour Market Database 2 in 2003&#150;04 and who are estimated to be resident in the UK, survive until state pension age, and that there is no migration.<br>

6. Figures are given as a proportion of the total number of women in each age group estimated by the Government Actuary&#039;s Department to be resident in the UK in 2004.<br>

7. Entitlement to basic state pension is based on women&#039;s own national insurance records. Entitlement that may be derived from husband&#039;s records is not available.<br>

2. Figures exclude people who have interacted with the National Insurance Recording System at some point during their working lives but who are not estimated to be resident in the UK in 2003&#150;04.<br>





3. Figures are based on the Lifetime Labour Market Database 2, which is a 1 per cent. sample of the national insurance records.

The model used by the Government Actuary&#039;s Department to forecast entitlement to basic state pension is based on aggregate level data, that does not permit accurate distributional analysis in the manner requested.<br>

4. Figures refer to the number of qualifying years accrued by men at state pension age in the 2004&#150;05 tax year. For the purpose of this table a year of Home Responsibilities Protection (HRP) is treated as a qualifying year. (Although strictly HRP acts to reduce the requisite number of qualifying years needed for a full basic state pension (BSP), therefore men and women will not always require 44 and 39 qualifying years respectively).<br>

5. For the reason noted in 2, and others, this table should not be used to infer entitlement to BSP. For example:<br>

The first and second contribution conditions must be satisfied to qualify for BSP. The first contribution condition is satisfied through paid contributions from earnings or by paying voluntary Class 3 contributions during one tax year (either must be equivalent to 52 weeks at the Lower Earnings Limit (LEL)). Having satisfied this first contribution condition, a person must acquire a further 9 (for women) or 10 (for men) qualifying years through a combination of contributions and Nl credits. This second contribution condition is also known as the 25 per cent. de minimis rule.<br>

The table does not represent any entitlement to BSP that may be derived from a partner&#039;s contribution record.<br>

<sup>(48)</sup> A new system of occupation coding for NHS non-medical staff was introduced in 1995. The new codes classify staff according to what they do rather than the terms and conditions under which they are employed i.e. national pay scales. Figures based on new occupation codes are not directly comparable with those based on the old pay scale classification. Therefore figures since 1995 are not comparable with earlier years.<br>

<sup>(49)</sup> From 1982 onwards data is taken from the Department of Health Non-Medical Workforce Census. Prior to 1982 data is taken from the Health and Personal Social Services Statistics for England (HPSSS). Data from HPSSS contains hospital-based staff only and is therefore not directly comparable with later years.<br>

Notes:<br>

Figures are rounded to the nearest whole number.<br>





All figures exclude learners and agency staff.<br>

<p><a name="qnpa_32">(2) how many positions for junior and middle-ranking doctors were available <i>(a)</i> immediately before and <i>(b)</i> immediately after modernising medical careers was introduced.  [30313]</p>




<p><a name="st_499"><a name="51212w62.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 The launch of the foundation programme as the first phase of modernising medical careers (MMC) in August this year saw some senior house officer (SHO) posts converted to SHO equivalent foundation year two posts but this conversion did not affect the overall number of posts available for doctors working at the SHO level.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51212w62.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_374">The MMC proposals for specialist training have yet to be agreed in detail. The proposals would see the gradual phasing out of the SHO grade to be replaced by structured programmes of training leading to the award of a certificate of completion of training.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51212w62.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_375">Current SHOs will not be disadvantaged in the new training system and MMC will be working closely with the Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board and Medical Royal Colleges to ensure that all are treated fairly.

<a name="stpa_376">We have consulted widely on these proposals and will continue to engage with stakeholders, including the British Medical Association, to manage transition.

<a name="51212w62.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_377">In the September 2004 census, the number of medically qualified SHOs and equivalents was 20,094 in England. This was an increase of 1,882 (10 per cent.) from the previous year and an increase of 5,514 (38 per cent.) since 1997. The census is a count of doctors on particular salary scales or their equivalents, not a count of doctors with a particular job description. These figures therefore include trust doctors, clinical fellows and other such posts.

<p><a name="st_530"><a name="51212w64.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 A key aim of public service agreement target number 4 is to improve health outcomes for people with long term conditions by offering a personalised care plan for those people with the most complex conditions. The initial focus for achievement of the target has been on the recruitment and training of the case managers who will be responsible for drawing up and agreeing care plans with patients. Further work on defining the care plan and how this should be measured is in progress and the outcome will be shared with the national health service early in 2006.

<p><a name="st_531"><a name="51212w64.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Byrne  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 17 November 2005]:</i> The Department has commissioned the National Primary Care Research and Development Centre at the University of Manchester to undertake an evaluation of the impact of the quality and outcomes framework (QOF) on quality of patient care. The study covers three clinical conditions: asthma, angina and type two diabetes, which are all covered by the QOF. However, the range of indicators against which quality of care will be assessed includes some that are outside the QOF; it does not include osteoporosis. This study will be able to assess the extent to which QOF and non-QOF elements of clinical management of these conditions are provided in general practice.
