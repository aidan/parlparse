<P>
<a name="80508w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 I chaired the first meeting of the Development Awareness Working Group on 31 March. We had a creative and constructive discussion about the opportunities for the Government to enhance their role in this area, and to add value to much of the excellent work which is already underway across the country. We agreed to establish three sub-groups to examine in more detail new themes and partnerships, key issues in relation to existing formal and non-formal structures, and lesson learning from others. The sub-groups will report back to the next full meeting of the Working Group, which is scheduled for 22 July. A fuller record of the meeting will be placed on the Department for International Development's Internet site.

 The "Serious Play" Zone within the Millennium Dome will include an interactive look at the world of sport and games in the 21st century, the details of which are still being worked up. "Surfball" was a working title used for illustrative purposes at the end of last year, when design proposals were at a very early stage. The New Millennium Experience Company does not intend to seek to register the name "Surfball" for any games or features which may form part of the content of the "Serious Play" Zone.

<P>
<a name="80508w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Barry Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what additional individual health authorities' allocations he has announced; and if he will make a statement.  [40647]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80508w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 I announced, in May 1997, &#163;600,000 for breast cancer services which was disbursed to the health authorities and Trusts by the Cancer Services Co-ordinating Group and &#163;2.5 million for primary care. In October 1997, I announced &#163;9.5 million to assist with winter pressures. In December 1997, a cash increase of &#163;113 million for NHS Wales in total for 1998-99 was announced by the Secretary of State, which included &#163;60.2 million new money and an additional &#163;1.3 million found from within the Welsh Office Block.
<P>

<a name="80508w01.html_para0">The 1998-99 NHS cash increase included &#163;77 million in revenue funding, of which &#163;65.8 million was allocated to health authorities, and also included an additional &#163;2.4 million for cancer services and &#163;0.5 million to tackle prescription fraud. Following the latest Budget, I announced on 18 March an additional &#163;25.1 million for NHS Wales for 1998-99 to bring in-patient waiting lists down to the level when we took office. &#163;18 million of the additional money has already been allocated and further guidance on its use will be issued shortly. The balance of the money will be used to address in year waiting list issues as they arise together with other initiatives such as preparing a Corporate Plan for NHS Wales and managing the Trust reconfiguration exercise.
<P>

<a name="80508w01.html_para1">Allocations directly to health authorities of the Winter Pressure money, the 1998-99 health authority cash increase and the Waiting List money are as follows:

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many inmates of young offender institutions have <i>(a)</i> committed suicide, <i>(b)</i> attempted suicide and <i>(c)</i> been victims of violence, in each of the last three years for which figures are available; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="80508w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The information requested is not available in the format requested. However, information is available on the number of self-inflicted deaths, the recorded incidents of self-harm and the recorded incidents of assault of a prisoner on a prisoner. It should be noted that not all self-inflicted deaths conclude with a verdict of suicide. The figures on self-harm and assault of a prisoner on a prisoner may include a number of incidents concerning the same prisoner. Definitions and methods of recording both these types of incident have also changed over time. The broader definition of incidents of self-harm is now used rather than attempted suicide. The figure for incidents of self-harm for 1997/98 is provisional.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many cases were heard in England and Wales by a judge alone during 1997.  [40909]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80508w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 It is not clear to what type of case this question refers, but criminal cases tried on indictment in the Crown Court in England and Wales are heard by a judge sitting with a jury. The law and procedures governing civil trials are the responsibility of the Lord Chancellor.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to introduce a national motorway police force.  [40616]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80508w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 We have no such plans. Road traffic offences and general criminal offences do not arise in clearly separate ways which can be independently 



<P>
<P><I>8 May 1998 : Column: 514</I><P>
enforced. It is an advantage that traffic officers deal with all crimes which occur on the roads and, conversely, that police officers on general duties can take action against breaches of road traffic law.
<P>

<a name="80508w01.html_para4">Separating the enforcement of road traffic law from other types of police work would generate operational difficulties and lead to the wasteful duplication of resources. Traffic policing, whether on motorways or other roads, is central to the overall police responsibility for maintaining law and order and preventing and detecting crime.

<a name="80508w01.html_sbhd8"><H4><center>Stop and Search</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="80508w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Singh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many stop and search incidents took place in each division of the Metropolitan Police in 1996 and 1997; if he will provide the ethnic breakdown of those stopped and searched; how many arrests were made per 100 stops for each ethnic group; and if he will make a statement.  [40824]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80508w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Stop and search policy remains an effective technique for dealing with individuals about whom the police have reasonable suspicion. The policy protects communities but needs to be operated fairly.
<P>

<a name="80508w01.html_para5">The results of the first full year of ethnic monitoring of police activity, which includes stop and search, arrests, cautions and homicides, was published on 8 December 1997 under section 95 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. This requires the Home Secretary to publish annually information he considers appropriate to enable those engaged in the administration of criminal justice to avoid discriminating against any person on the ground of race, sex or any other improper ground. The data brought to light areas of concern, particularly the disproportionate impact of stop and search on black people, which need to be probed further. Ethnic monitoring of police activity is an important step forward as it allows police forces to identify areas in which they need to take action to ensure that all sections of the community receive equal treatment.
<P>

<a name="80508w01.html_para6">The Commissioner tells me that the Metropolitan Police will continue to review stop and search policy, systems and procedures to ensure that this valuable but potentially sensitive activity is properly used and understood. He tells me that a new approach is being examined in a number of divisions. I look forward to hearing the outcome of the study.
<P>

<a name="80508w01.html_para7">The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis has provided tables of information on the Metropolitan Police's stop and search record for 1996 and 1997, copies of which have been placed in the Library.

 The closing date for responses on the Best Value Consultation Paper was 1 May. The responses are still being analysed although it is clear that a number of authorities have made representations about the importance of environmental matters in Best Value. Our conclusions will be published in a White Paper later this year. Although the Government will lay down the general framework for Best Value, it will be for local authorities to decide how to include environmental criteria in the consideration of Best Value, in consultation with the local community and against the background of progress in drawing up Local Agenda 21 strategies.

 We receive a considerable number of letters from people seeking a reduction in speed limits. Highway authorities already have considerable scope for reducing limits on particular roads, but a greater challenge is to ensure more people comply with the limits. The enforcement of speed limits is an operational matter for the police and chief constables take this responsibility very seriously. To assist police in that

 Responsibility for such assessments rests with the local operating authorities (Environment Agency, local authorities and Internal Drainage Boards). Whilst this Department has overall policy responsibility for flood defence in England and administers grant aid for capital defence schemes, the planning, design, construction, maintenance and operation of defence measures is the responsibility of the operating authorities. The Ministry calls for Medium Term Plans from operating authorities which indicate the need for capital works.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80508w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Overseas Trade Statistics show that a total of 6,247 horses were exported from the UK in 1997. None of these were exported for slaughter.

 <i>[holding answer 7 May 1998]:</i> Under the legislation on release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), the risk to human health and the environment is assessed on a case by case basis for each and every proposed release. This includes an assessment of the direct and indirect effects of the crops on other organisms, including birds.
<P>

<a name="80508w02.html_para9">Similarly, the possible risks to human health and the environment, including birds, from the use on a genetically modified herbicide tolerant crop of a herbicide to which it is tolerant, would be assessed in accordance with the pesticides legislation.
<P>

<a name="80508w02.html_para10">In 1997, the Department commissioned a programme of research on possible risks to the agricultural environment from the release of herbicide tolerant crops. This includes a three-year monitoring programme to look at the effects on plant biodiversity in field margins. A LINK research project is being put in place on the impacts and management of herbicide tolerance, which will include research into the effects on plant diversity within arable systems. The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions also has a research programme on the risks to the environment from the release of GMOs.

<P>
<a name="80508w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The labelling of food ingredients derived from Monsanto's genetically modified (GM) soya beans is covered by Commission Regulation 1813/97. Detailed rules for these ingredients are to be decided at the Internal Market Council on 18 May.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what steps he is taking during the United Kingdom's Presidency to achieve consistency of labelling for genetically modified foods across Europe under the Novel Foods Regulation 258/97; and if he will make a statement.  [41190]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80508w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Under the United Kingdom's Presidency, we have been working hard to improve a Commission proposal on detailed labelling rules for genetically modified (GM) soya and maize ingredients to ensure that the rules are practical and meaningful to consumers. The UK proposals have attracted a large degree of support from other Member States, and the issue will be decided at the Internal Market Council on 18 May. I expect these rules to set a precedent for the labelling of GM foods under the Novel Foods Regulation (258/97).

 ECGD's aim is to help exporters of UK goods and services to win business and as such limits the amount of support that can be given for the foreign content of a UK export contract. However, recognising that exporters sometimes have no choice but to source some elements of their contract from overseas, support is usually available in line with EU regulations or bilateral agreements with other export credit agencies for certain levels of foreign content in contracts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80508w04.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when the 130 decibel live firing limit on Salisbury Plains was established; how this figure was arrived at; with whom it was agreed; how often it has been breached in the past year; how many complaints have been received about live firing in the past year; and from whom.  [41181]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80508w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 My Department has observed a voluntary limit of 130 decibels for live firing on Salisbury Plain Training Area since 1984, except in certain areas where such a limit would have a serious impact on training. This figure was set at a level that would allow normal training to be undertaken, while preventing unreasonable disturbance to the local community.
<P>

<a name="80508w04.html_para0">It is not currently possible to measure every noise event on Salisbury Plain throughout the year, and so determine on how many occasions, if any, noise from live firing has exceeded 130 decibels. However, a detailed noise monitoring survey was carried out during Exercise IRON TORNADO, an artillery concentration on Salisbury Plain in September 1997, which showed that noise in residential areas around the Plain did not exceed 125 decibels during the four day exercise.

 Three multi-year licences have been rescinded since 1 May 1997 in accordance with our policy of harmonising the issue of all hunting licences across the Defence Estate; this process is due to complete by the end of the month. The licences rescinded so far covered the Royal Artillery Hunt, the Avon Vale Hunt, and the South Wiltshire Hunt. The policy of harmonisation was explained to the hunts concerned in the notices of cancellation. Applications for new licences for the 1998-99 season, incorporating standard terms and conditions, will be considered in August from those hunts who have traditionally held licences or enjoyed such rights.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80508w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Attendance Allowance and Disability Living Allowance provide a contribution towards extra costs arising from the effects of disability. The structure of these benefits reflects findings from the Office of Population, Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) surveys of disability in Great Britain in the mid-1980s. These showed that locomotor and personal care disabilities were among the types of disability most strongly associated with higher than average additional expenditure arising from disability.

<a name="80508w05.html_para5">Incontinence is a symptom of a number of different medical conditions rather than a diagnosis in itself and is therefore not recorded as a separate category in the International Classification of Diseases which the Department uses to record diagnoses underlying claims for Incapacity Benefit.

<a name="80508w05.html_para7"><i>Letter from Faith Boardman to Ms Joan Walley, dated 7 May 1998:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Social Security about the changes being made to the Child Support Agency organisational structure. I thought it would be helpful to give you an explanation of the changes we are making and why we are unable to suspend our plans pending the review.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>These changes will result in more jobs overall, much more face-to-face contact, and much more contact being carried out by telephone in a more personalised way than at present. They will also enable backroom paper processing work which involves no direct contact with the public to be done far more cost-effectively than at present; thus releasing funds which will be reinvested in improved service delivery and in keeping up with rising workloads. The results of the on-going reorganisation are already beginning to show. In 1997/98 the backlogs of outstanding cases were more than halved, and the amount of maintenance collected and arranged rose by over one third.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I can assure you that Ministers were made aware of the proposals for reorganisation before we embarked on changes and their wishes have been taken fully into account in the further work which we have done since. They require improvements to be made in the Agency's performance in the interval before implementation of any longer-term changes which may result from the review. Ministers have asked me to concentrate on improving the quantity and quality of direct personal contact (both by telephone and face to face); and with seeking ways in which this can be provided actively with other Agencies as a one-stop service for customers. That will be a primary outcome of the reorganisation. The objective is to find means of extending and <i>improving</i> the range and quality of active modern contact with customers whilst at the same time improving the efficiency of the Agency sufficiently to keep pace with the 50% increase in workloads over the next 3 years, and to improve compliance levels.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>At present, over 95% of the staff years in local offices are not providing <i>any</i> face-to-face contact at all. They are employed on paper processing and are no more accessible to the public than those in the major processing centres. The number of CSA staff years which are devoted to face-to-face contact is currently only 120; in many locations there is less than one interview a day, and there is no Child Support presence in many Benefits Offices. The 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>8 May 1998 : Column: 529</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>reorganisation will enable us to more than quadruple the staff years used for face-to-face contact, and increase the locations at which it is available.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency's plans for re-organising are fully in line with the Government strategy of modernising the delivery of public services. Many of the changes directly reflect the concerns expressed about accessibility and customer service during the recent discussion sessions which I have held with MPs and their support staff. As part of that, the Agency has looked at the whole range of ways in which it contacts its customers. Until this year that has been predominantly by paper which has been consistently criticised as too complex and impersonal.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am quite convinced of the need for much increased face-to-face contact, not least because of its effectiveness in reducing the incidence of fraud, improving the explanations available to customers, and improving their compliance and co-operation. The reorganisation will significantly increase the availability of local face-to-face contact in a number of ways. As part of their wider strategy to improve face-to-face contact with DSS customers, the Government announced last year that CSA would be working more closely with their colleagues in the Benefits Agency which will provide customers with a one stop service. From 1 April 1998, Benefits Agency staff are interviewing and assisting all new Income Support parents with care to complete their maintenance application form, where appropriate.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Pilot studies have shown this to be both very cost effective and welcomed by individual customers. 75% of our parents with care will be interviewed at the time when they first come into contact with child support and most need information and help. Customers will have to provide information only once, thus reducing overlap and repetition of work. So you can see that for many customers there will be a noticeable improvement in the face-to-face contact without retaining a separate, duplicate CSA presence. Together with BA we will be looking to see how far we can extend this joint approach for parents with care.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Restructuring will allow CSA to offer significantly more face to face contact on a peripatetic basis, in a greater range of locations which we hope in future will also include for example, CAB premises. The CSA will then be able to concentrate on improving the service to new absent parents, by telephoning them at an early stage and, where necessary, offering individuals with particular problems an interview to ensure that information is gathered more quickly and that fewer absent parents begin with significant arrears.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As well as improving customer service there are sound resourcing reasons to support the re-organisation. Most of the current sites are very small and inflexible and impose considerable extra cost. Many offices have very few staff. For example, there are a number of offices with as few as four staff. It only takes one person to be on holiday and another to be ill and the effectiveness of the office is immediately reduced by 50%. In terms of accommodation alone, up to &#163;8m will be released to be reinvested in better telephone services and more jobs to keep up with rising workloads and to finish clearing the backlogs.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Conversely, the centres provide significant economies of scale for processing paper and (with the reinvestment of such efficiency savings and the introduction of flexible working patterns) will be able to accommodate in excess of 1200 staff during the working day. Telephone availability to the public at the centres has already been extended from 9am to 5pm on Monday to Friday, initially to 8am up to 9pm and in the near future to weekends. That will allow CSA to be contacted by absent parents in particular in the privacy of their own homes rather than during the day when they are at work. And it will release local resources to provide much more face-to-face contact where that is needed.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Finally, I want to stress that we are making every effort to ensure that individual staff in the field will be taken care of and found suitable alternative work in their location. The movement of work will not take place overnight. Moving the backroom paper processing work which does not require face-to-face contact will be done in conjunction with improvements to face-to-face contact; to CSA's telephone service; and, with an increase in the staff resources and hours in the centres. Every support will be given to ensure that field staff are provided with alternatives and we certainly have no plans to make any member of staff redundant. The Agency is already

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in touch with the Benefits Agency and Employment Services who will have suitable vacancies in many areas over the next 2 years. Some field staff will be able to move with the paper work to the existing centre; and the Agency will be establishing a number of intermediate sized satellite centres which will provide further opportunities for staff in other areas.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Overall, the changes will result in <i>more</i> jobs (but in different locations); and enable us to provide both a more cost-efficient and accessible service. Throughout the period the Agency will continue to report regularly to Ministers and consult customer representative groups at both national and local levels to ensure that service standards are improved.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Ministers will be considering a revised proposal which will ensure that there will be no change in benefit service delivery to the Jarrow community. The proposal is to maintain a full Public Caller Office with full payment facilities located in the Viking Precinct, adjacent to the existing office. Amongst other things this will improve facilities for disabled people as the new site will have ground floor access. BA facilities are currently located on the first floor at Viking House. This move will allow the BA's Tyne Tees Area Director to manage the wider operational needs of the Area more effectively. The final decision on the proposal, subject to Ministerial approval, will involve full consultation with staff, Trade Union representatives, local MPs and any other interested parties.

Details of other physiotherapy grades are in the Review Body's 1998 Report. Consultant salaries effective from December 1998 run from &#163;45,740 to &#163;59,040, with discretionary points up to &#163;70,850. The average intended net income for general practitioners is &#163;49,450 from December 1998. Earnings from achieving higher childhood immunisation and cervical screening targets, estimated by the Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration at &#163;3,500 for the average GP, are extra.

 The Department does not consider applications for research grants as such. Research supported directly by the Department is commissioned according to Departmental needs. Research contracts are awarded on scientific merit, following competitive tendering exercises and peer review by qualified referees. The Department does not collect information on the gender of those bidding for Departmental research and development contracts.

 Ritalin (methylphenidate) has been assessed by the normal procedures for licensing of medicinal products in the United Kingdom to ensure its efficacy, safety and quality. The safety and adverse effects of Ritalin continue to be monitored by the Medicines Control Agency. Ritalin has controlled drug status, which imposes restrictions on prescribing and handling. Treatment should be under the supervision of a specialist in childhood behavioural disorders. Guidance on prescribing Ritalin is provided in the product information which is produced by the manufacturer and authorised by the Licensing Authority.
