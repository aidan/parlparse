 The procedure whereby, before any investigation begins, the Standards Board seeks to filter out allegations without merit is the principal guard against vexatious and malicious reporting. The Board's current performance target is to filter out any such cases within 10 working days of receiving an allegation, and the Board's current track record on this is nine working days.</p>

This amendment would reduce the encouragement some feel this provision gives to the reporting of trivial or vexatious complaints by members. We intend to consult on a draft revised code of conduct for local authority members later this year, to include this proposal.</p>

<i> [holding answer 13 July 2006]:</i> The Ministry of Defence takes its responsibilities under the Data Protection Act 1998 very seriously, and has a network of Data Protection Officers across the Department to ensure compliance. The Act provides a framework for the protection of personal data, but it also allows the sharing of such data where the processing is necessary. This requires a balance between the legitimate interests of the Ministry of Defence or the third parties to whom the data is disclosed, and the rights, freedoms and legitimate interests of individuals. Each case needs to be considered on its own merits, but it is certainly possible to share and co-ordinate personal data where it is warranted, subject to the relevant conditions set out in the Act.</p>

 Notifications of all new and revised war pensions awards include details of the arrangements for NHS priority treatment in Great Britain. Information is also published at www.veteransagency.mod.uk. Priority treatment applies post-service to the condition or conditions for which an award is made under the war pension scheme or armed forces compensation scheme. Standing guidance on the right of GB based war pensioners to receive priority treatment in NHS hospitals is also circulated to senior managers of trusts, and health boards; they are asked to ensure that relevant clinical staff are aware of the provision.</p>

In the EU Ministerial General Affairs and External Relations Council Conclusions of 3 October 2005, the UK and its EU partners recognised the importance of the Colombian Justice and Peace Law, agreed in July the same year, in providing an overall legal framework for this process. With our international partners, the UK has encouraged the Government of Colombia to implement this new law transparently so that it will have a positive impact on the peace building process. The Colombian Government announced on 18 April the completion of the formal process of demobilisation which saw over 30,000 paramilitaries demobilise.

 The Department does not hold information centrally on specific clinics offered by individual trusts or funded by individual primary care trusts (PCTs). The provision of services is a matter for agreement between trusts and their commissioning PCTs and the strategic health authority for the area, in consultation with local stakeholders.

NICE clinical guidelines are covered by the Department&#146;s developmental standards, standards which the national health service is expected to achieve over time.

money spent on these services now remains with the local PCT so that it is spent on commissioning new services from other dentists to replace lost capacity. Third, the new contractual arrangements are based on the expert clinical guidelines produced by the National Institute for Health and Clinical excellence. These recommend that dentists recall patients at intervals of between three and 24 months depending on their oral health needs. In our view, this is likely to mean that many patients with good oral health who have traditionally attended at typically six-monthly intervals will not need to attend as frequently as they have done in the past. This will free up additional capacity and enable dentists to treat a greater range of patients.</p>

The new arrangements give PCTs greater flexibility to commission and develop domiciliary dental services and other primary care services to reflect local needs.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to the answer of 18 April 2006, <i> Official Report</i>, column 209W and the answer to question 81211, on NHS dentistry, why information on the number of people registered with an NHS dentist in each constituency available on 29 June was not collected.

 Patient registration was part of the remuneration arrangements under the former system of general dental services up to 31 March 2006. Under the new system, the concept of registration no longer forms part of the remuneration system. The Department is therefore introducing a comparable means of monitoring the number of patients covered by national health service dental services, but the transition to the new arrangements has meant that it will be some months before the new measure is available.</p>

This will provide a measure that is broadly similar to that of patient registration under the former system of CDS. We expect the first information to be available in the autumn.</p>

 Providers of general dental service and personal dental services are no longer paid by item of service but have an agreed annual contract value, which is paid in 12 monthly instalments. In return for this contract value, the provider carries out over the course of the year an agreed number of units of dental activity that correspond to overall courses of treatment. The provider therefore no longer has to submit data on the individual items of service within each course of treatment. Any items prescribed within a course of treatment are a matter for individual clinical judgment. This approach is intended to help promote more clinically appropriate practice, with less emphasis on the quality of individual interventions and more time available for preventative care.</p>

The specification was included in tender documents issued in October 2004. The Department also included representatives of the British Thoracic Society, which has developed clinical best practice guidelines on home oxygen therapy, and the British Lung Foundation, which campaigns and supports patients with lung disease, on a central panel that evaluated tenders received for the service.

A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<i> Time waited (days)</i><br>
Time waited statistics from hospital episode statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>
<i> All operations count of episodes</i><br>
These figures represent a count of all finished consultant episodes where the procedure was mentioned in any of the 12 operation fields in a HES record. A record is only included once in each count, even if an operation is mentioned in more than one operation field of the record.<br>
<i> Ungrossed data</i><br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what factors account for the difference between the forecast national expenditure on the National Programme for Information Technology, as stated in paragraph <i> (a)</i> on page 25 of the National Audit Office Report the National Programme for IT in the NHS, HC1173, published on 16 June 2006, and the figure given by her Department's Director of Health and Social Services Delivery in oral evidence to the Health Committee in answer to Question 163 on 1 December 2005.

 The figure given to the Health Committee as the value of the core national procurement programme contracts placed in 2003 and 2004 was &#163;6.2 billion. This figure has not increased since the contracts were let, and is confirmed in the National Audit Office (NAO) report. The forecast national expenditure figure of &#163;9.2 billion referred to by the NAO includes this sum, but in addition includes other elements, some of which are costs not directly associated with the national programme for information technology.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"><a name="60714w0014.htm_para0"><a name="06071458001990">The other elements are made up of &#163;382 million for contracts and projects added to the original scope of the programme; &#163;239 million for additional services beyond the scope of the core national contracts; and a further &#163;337 million pro rata extrapolation of the cost of the core contracts to cover the period to 2013 to 2014. This last figure is a purely notional sum to allow total expenditure to be projected over 10 years, and needed because two contracts (choose and book, and the new national broadband network&#151;N3) reach the end of their life before the end of 10 years, requiring further provision to take forward the services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="60714w0014.htm_para1"><a name="06071458001991">In addition, a further &#163;1.9 billion represents centrally managed expenditure on centrally managed projects and services within the national programme, and the cost of running the Department's NHS Connecting for Health agency. Some of these costs relate to agency responsibilities other than the national programme, including all of the information technology service delivered by the former NHS Information Authority (NHSIA). The NHSIA spent some &#163;219 million in its last year. NHS Connecting for Health will be spending relatively less centrally and doing much more over 10 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="60714w0014.htm_para2"><a name="06071458001992">We expect that actual expenditure will be very significantly less than &#163;1.9 billion since, once the initial stages of system development and deployment are complete, the role and size of the agency will reduce accordingly.</p>

 No such decision has been taken.

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="60714w0014.htm_para5"><a name="06071458001997">The aim of the new initiative is to enable GPs to either choose to upgrade their current clinical system, or migrate to an LSP-provided system in order to continue on the path to integration with the NHS Care Records Service.

 Studies suggest that the prevalence of food allergy in the United Kingdom may be increasing, especially in children, in line with the general increase in allergic diseases. There are many possible explanations for the apparent rise and there is currently no definitive answer. The Food Standards Agency is currently funding several studies aimed at identifying the prevalence of individual food allergies, including nut allergy. These projects should also give clues as to the possible reasons for the apparent rise in food allergy. The first of these studies is expected to be published in the scientific literature later this year and the second is part of a larger Europe-wide study on food allergy prevalence and factors that influence development of food allergy and will finish in July 2009.</p>

 HM Treasury&#146;s &#147;Cross Cutting Review&#148; recommended that funders should recognise that it is legitimate for voluntary and community sector providers to include the relevant element of overheads in their cost estimates for providing a given service under a contract or service agreement. In the context of hospice care, this does not mean the full costs of the hospice, but rather those services provided by the hospice that are commissioned by the primary care trust. National health service commissioners should be moving towards implementing the Treasury&#146;s recommendation on full cost recovery on those services they commission from the voluntary sector. The emphasis should, therefore, be on effective negotiation between contracting partners as contracts and service level agreements come up for renewal.</p>

 The need to maintain, and improve where necessary, the health and vitality of trees is integral to the Government&#146;s approach to sustainable forest management. We have set this out in the UK Forestry Standard and its supporting literature, which contain many specific measures for protecting woodland and improving tree health. All woodland management by the Forestry Commission is consistent with this standard and we expect private woodland owners that receive grant aid from the Forestry Commission to also meet the standard. The Government have encouraged the development of the voluntary UK Woodland Assurance Standard that provides an independent verification of compliance with good practice and measures to ensure the continuing good health of woodland. We shall continue to ensure compliance with the UK Forest Standard in those woods managed by the Forestry Commission and encourage it in the private sector.</p>

We have a number of long-standing research programmes the results of which are being fed into adaptation policies for woodland. plans are well advanced for instituting more such research.

Examples are the recent deployment of a predatory beetle to control outbreaks of the great spruce bark beetle and continuing development of &#147;integrated pest management&#148; techniques against one of our most serious forest pests, the Hylobius weevil.</p>
