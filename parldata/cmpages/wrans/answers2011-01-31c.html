 In its opium survey for 2010, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reported stable levels of opium cultivation across the country, with the number of poppy-free provinces remaining at 20. Opium cultivation in Helmand fell by 7%. This follows two successive years of reductions in opium cultivation and a dramatic fall in the wheat price. Current indicators suggest that opium poppy cultivation will remain broadly stable again in 2011, despite continuing low wheat prices. The UNODC intends to release its next assessment in February/March.</p>

 International sanctions, including those adopted by the UN and the EU, show the strength of international concerns about Iran's nuclear programme. We continue to monitor the progress of that programme closely. It is clear that sanctions are having an impact. Iran is finding it increasingly difficult to acquire access to goods of proliferation concern and is also finding it hard to access international finance. We believe these and other pressures brought Iran back into talks with the EU 3+3. But, its disappointing failure to engage on the substance of international concerns in Istanbul and its continuing defiance of Security Council Resolutions; of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the international community more broadly mean that pressure will need to increase.</p>

 For TriStar, the engineering unserviceability database does not give the aircraft location or the task planned/undertaken by the aircraft. It would incur disproportionate cost to compare the flight departure logs which give this information against the engineering unserviceability database. I am able to confirm, however, that in 2010 there were 99 instances where short term TriStar unserviceability caused a delay to an Operation Herrick task departing RAF Brize Norton at the start of an Airbridge flight. In many cases, engineers were able to quickly rectify the unserviceability, or to minimise the overall delay another airframe was substituted to undertake the task.</p>

 In July the Department published the 2050 Pathways report, which as well as presenting the assumptions lying behind the 2050 Calculator, calculated high-level costs in the large scale power generation sector for six illustrative pathways. The analysis set out cost figures for the physical capital; fixed and variable operating costs; fuel; nuclear decommissioning and waste; and infrastructure (such as the electricity transmission and distribution network). It does not consider the cost of financing, carbon, electricity imports, research and development, behavioural change or wider macro-economic impacts.

 None. It will be a matter for each local authority, democratically accountable to its own electorate, to decide whether or not to introduce a code of conduct for its members. In taking this decision, a council will have regard to the duty, provided for in the Localism Bill, to promote and maintain high standards of conduct by its elected members.

 I took into account the fact that these waters off the Suffolk coast are the only area where the Department's Maritime and Coastguard Agency currently allows ship-to-ship transfers (other than those in a harbour authority area) to be carried out, and that these waters are recognised by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and by the industry as a suitable area for carrying out ship-to-ship transfers on navigational safety grounds. I also considered whether there was a demand from the industry for ship-to-ship transfers in other locations around the UK coast, and I considered the implications of introducing ship-to-ship transfers to waters where they are not currently carried out.</p>

 The pupil premium for 2011-12 will be allocated to local authorities and schools with pupils that are known to be eligible for free school meals (FSM) as recorded on the January 2011 school census. Each pupil known to be eligible for free school meals will attract ¬£430 of funding which will go to the school or academy if the pupil is in a mainstream setting or will be managed by the responsible local authority if the pupil is in a non-mainstream setting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="110131w0003.htm_para4"><a name="11013122000071">The January 2010 school census allows an estimate of the number of pupils known to be eligible for FSM to be made. In the Redditch constituency in January 2010 there were approximately 1,760 pupils in Redditch schools known to be eligible (rounded to the nearest 10), which would give rise to a pupil premium of ¬£756,800. However, these are estimates only and are not necessarily indicative of how the pupil premium will be distributed. The number of eligible pupils in 2011 could be higher or lower. The figures do not include the pupil premium for service children, which is paid at the lower rate of ¬£200 per pupil, or for looked after children who attract their own premium, again set at ¬£430 for 2011-12.</p>

<i> [holding answer 21 January 2011]:</i> For the purposes of the 2010 performance tables the humanities element of the English Baccalaureate measure was either history or geography. We have not included religious education (RE) as fulfilling the humanity requirement of the English Baccalaureate because it is already a compulsory subject. One of the intentions of the English Baccalaureate is to encourage wider take up of geography and history in addition to, rather than instead of, compulsory RE. However we recognise, as many schools do, the benefits that religious education can bring to pupils. This is why the teaching of RE remains compulsory throughout a pupil's schooling. Success in all subjects studied at GCSE will also continue to be recognised by other performance table measures, as it has in the past. We are open to arguments about how we can further improve the measures in the performance tables and will review the precise definition of the English Baccalaureate for the 2011 tables.</p>

 Under the law of England and Wales anyone may make a will without professional advice. The person making the will (the testator) usually specifies the people he or she wants to administer his or her estate (the executors). It is for the testator to choose his or her executors. Banks appointed as executors cannot charge for their services unless and to the extent that they are authorised to do so by the testator in the will, by the court or by statute.

 We have already announced our intention to abolish the Legal Services Commission as soon as the parliamentary timetable allows. The proposals on legal aid reform and civil litigation funding reforms are currently subject to consultations that close on 14 February.

When an offender has been cautioned for two or more offences at the same time the principal offence is the more serious offence.  <sup>(3)</sup> Cannabis was classified as a class B drug to January 2004 when it was reclassified as a class C drug.

Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.  <sup>(6)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.  <sup>(7)</sup> The sentenced column may exceed those found guilty as it may be the case that a defendant found guilty, and committed for sentence at the Crown court, may be sentenced in the following year.  <sup>(8)</sup> Excludes data for Cardiff magistrates court for April, July and August 2008.  <i> Source:</i>  Justice Statistics Analytical Services-Ministry of Justice.<br>

When an offender has been cautioned for two or more offences at the same time the principal offence is the more serious offence.  <sup>(3)</sup> Cannabis was classified as a class B drug to January 2004 when it was reclassified as a class C drug. It was then subsequently reclassified as class B from January 2009.  <sup>(4)</sup> Statutes and corresponding offence descriptions used: Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 s.5(3) as amended by Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Amendment) Order 2008 Having possession of a controlled drug with intent to supply-Cannabis and cannabis resin; Cannabinol; Cannabinol derivatives. Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 s.5(3) Having possession of a controlled drug with intent to supply-Cannabis or cannabis resin.  <sup>(5)</sup> The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.  <sup>(6)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.  <sup>(7)</sup> The sentenced column may exceed those found guilty as it may be the case that a defendant found guilty, and committed for sentence at the Crown court, may be sentenced in the following year.  <sup>(8)</sup> Excludes data for Cardiff magistrates court for April, July and August 2008.  <i> Source:</i>  Justice Statistics Analytical Services-Ministry of Justice.<br>

 We are conducting an assessment of sentencing to ensure that it is effective in deterring crime, protecting the public, punishing offenders and cutting reoffending. On 7 December 2010 we published proposals in the Green Paper, "Breaking the Cycle: effective punishment, rehabilitation and sentencing of offenders", for public consultation. These proposals included the reform of sentences of Imprisonment for Public Protection. They have been published on the Ministry of Justice website at:</p>

It is proposed that violent and sexual offenders who do not meet the new threshold will be able to receive a long determinate sentence or in appropriate cases an extended sentence (where the offender remains under supervision for an extended period after release). Additionally, there are court orders available to manage the risk of serious sexual and violent offenders whose risk was not considered high enough at the time of conviction for an indefinite sentence, but who appear to present a risk at the end of their sentence.</p>

The strategy encompasses a wide spectrum of prison and Department of Health work around such issues as mental health, drugs, resettlement, leadership and training. A prisoner-focused care planning system for those identified at risk, Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) has helped prisons to manage self-harm.</p>

 The Ministry of Justice does hold limited data which can be provided relating to the purchase of gym equipment in prisons. Providing you with the information in the format requested would incur a disproportionate cost as locating and consolidating this information at local level would require significant resource within the timescales for submission. We are however able to provide limited information extracted from the MoJ Procurement Directorate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="110131w0004.htm_para9"><a name="11013131001375">Since 2007 the NOMS HM Prison Service has contracted with three main suppliers of gym/sports equipment who are Newitts Ltd, Physique plc and Service Sport. Newitts product portfolio consists of mainly light sports equipment, such as rackets, bats, free weights and consumables etc. Physique and Service Sport product ranges mainly consist of gym machines and other light sports equipment. The HM Prison Service where possible purchases remanufactured/refurbished heavy gym equipment. Purchasing equipment is considered the most cost-effective method of procuring those types of goods and where it is possible the HM Prison Service will be continuing with purchasing remanufactured equipment, subject to availability. The MoJ is currently working in collaboration with the Ministry of Defence for the next generation supply framework contract where a collaborative approach will allow the MoJ and MOD to leverage its economies of scale in the market place. This activity is currently being advertised in the Official Journal of the European Union. The framework contract is due for completion in summer 2011.</p>

 We are introducing a time limit of 12 months for entitlement to contributory employment and support allowance for claimants in the Work Related Activity Group. The period of 12 months was chosen because it strikes the best balance between allowing people with longer-term conditions to adjust to their health condition and providing a level of access that is appropriate for contributory benefits. Around 60% of all those claiming ESA already come off this benefit within a year<sup>(1)</sup>. We will be putting in place significant additional employment support through the Work programme.</p>

 The overall financial effect of these changes is complex and will vary significantly from person to person. This makes it difficult to generalise about the impact of the changes on individuals.</p>

This consultation is wide ranging but it seeks to consider how the Government can ensure that the UK creates and retains the skills necessary to support essential national security capabilities and to what extent it should take wider economic considerations into account when taking decisions about fulfilling its defence and security requirements.

1. Direct comparisons of employee estimates over these different periods should be treated with caution. Estimates for 2008 onwards are from the Business Register Employment Survey (BRES) and are on a new standard industrial classification basis (SIC2007). Estimates prior to this are from the Annual Business Inquiry (ABI) on the previous standard industrial classification basis (SIC2003).<br>
 2. An assessment of changes in survey methodology suggests the total number of employees for the manufacturing sector for GB increased by around 0.1% by moving to BRES from the ABI.<br>
 3. The change from SIC2003 to SIC2007an additional impact between 2008 and 2009 with the removal of the recycling industry out of manufacturing having the largest impact.<br>
 4. For the ABI estimates prior to 2006 are on a different basis to 2006 to 2008. An assessment of changes in survey methodology suggests that the estimate of the total number of employees for the manufacturing sector for GB increased by around 0.3%.<br>

 A comprehensive assessment is not available. It is estimated that more than one third of all households have insufficient money to meet their basic needs, and 10% of the population do not have enough to eat. One in five children die before they reach the age of five, and one in three is malnourished. 380 of every 100,000 women die unnecessarily in pregnancy or childbirth. 70% of people are at risk from malaria, with 4 million cases and 9,000 deaths each year. Over 95% of health costs are met by people themselves, with government expenditure and international assistance for health care amounting to less than US $1 per person per year. Education is also severely underfunded. It is likely that poverty is particularly severe in areas of eastern Burma affected by armed conflict, in Chin and Rakhine States, and in parts of the central dry zone. Around 500,000 people have been displaced by conflict in eastern Burma, of which about 100,000 are living in areas of continuing fighting. Around 150,000 Burmese people live as refugees in camps in Thailand.</p>

DFID's allocation for Burma for 2010-11 is ¬£28 million, to which a further ¬£3 million is being added in order to contribute to the relief and recovery effort following Cyclone Giri which hit Burma in October 2010.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) has identified and is implementing a range of initiatives to achieve a 10% reduction in carbon emissions by June 2011. The biggest reduction in energy consumption will be achieved through reducing the number of IT servers. DFID has also installed a green roof at its East Kilbride headquarters, which has reduced carbon emissions from gas usage. A number of other changes have also been made, such as reconfiguring lighting systems and reducing plant operation times and cooling of IT equipment.

 Improving reproductive, maternal and newborn health is a key priority for the coalition Government. On 31 December 2010 the Department for International Development (DFID) launched 'Choices for women: planned pregnancies, safer births and healthy newborns'. This new framework for result sets out how the UK will double its efforts to improve reproductive, maternal and newborn health over the coming years, including saving 50,000 maternal lives and 250,000 newborns. Projects that will be supported in order to achieve this are currently being determined as part of the ongoing aid reviews, which will report in the coming months. Information on the new framework and all current maternal health projects is available on the DFID website.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="110131w0005.htm_para48"><a name="11013145000157">Those who exceed the weekly equivalent (more than 21 units weekly for men, more than 14 units weekly for women) of the national health service guidelines for regular daily consumption are the nearest measure of the first type of problematic drinker. Some individuals who drink regularly within the NHS guidelines will also incur illness or death as a result of their consumption, as risks of certain diseases are lower but still occur at these levels. These data are likely to understate the true numbers of those exceeding the NHS guidelines, as they are based on self-reported consumption.</p>

The specification will look to ensure that the needs of veterans in all parts of England are met, and this will require some flexibility in the number and type of mental health nurses and where they are placed.</p>

The Department also links with the devolved Administrations on these and other issues through the MOD/UK Departments of Health Partnership Board.

<p><a name="stpa_374"><a name="110131w0006.htm_para3"><a name="11013145000480">We have been in contact with Novartis, the suppliers of Femara (letrozole) tablets. They have confirmed that adequate supplies of this medicine are available for United Kingdom patients. If pharmacists have problems obtaining it from their wholesaler, they can contact Novartis customer services to arrange a direct supply to the pharmacy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_375"><a name="110131w0006.htm_para4"><a name="11013145000481">The Department is aware of the concerns that pharmacy contractors have raised about the work load caused by shortages and changes in distribution. As part of the 2009-10 and 2010-11 community pharmacy contractual framework funding settlement, recognition was made of the increased time taken by pharmacists and their staff in obtaining medicines, given the shortages being experienced.</p>

1. Headcount totals are unlikely to equal the sum of components. When overall headcount figures are split into subcategories the sum of the subtotals may exceed the overall sum due to inclusion of staff in multiple subcategories.<br>
2. Monthly data are extracted on the final day of each month. The data in the table, therefore, are in respect of 30 April 2010, which is the date nearest to, and after, the date specified in the question.<br>
3. As from 21 July 2010, the NHS Information Centre has published experimental, provisional monthly NHS workforce data. Figures obtained from provisional, experimental statistics may be revised from month to month as issues are uncovered and resolved. The monthly workforce data is not directly comparable with the annual workforce census. It only includes those staff on the Electronic Staff Record and does not include primary care staff or bank staff. It also includes locum doctors (not counted in the annual census). There are also new methods of presenting data; headcount methodology has changed and there is now a role count. This information is available, in respect of September 2009 onwards, at the following website:<br>
www.ic.nhs.uk/pubs/provisionalmonthlyhchsworkforce<br>
<i> Data Quality:</i><br>
The NHS Information Centre for health and social care seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data but responsibility for data accuracy lies with the organisations providing the data. Methods are continually being updated to improve data quality where changes impact on figures already published. This is assessed but unless it is significant at national level figures are not changed. Impact at detailed or local level is footnoted in relevant analyses.<br>

1. Data are provided in respect of Northwest London Hospitals NHS Trust rather than Northwick Park Hospital, as hospital level data are not held centrally.<br>
2. The data provided in the table refer to the number of episodes of care where at least one procedure or intervention was carried out, rather than a count of the number of operations, which is not collected as part of the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES).<br>
3. A finished consultant episode (FCE) is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.<br>
4. Number of episodes with a main or secondary procedure: The number of episodes where the procedure (or intervention) was recorded in any of the 24 (12 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and four prior to 2002-03) procedure fields in an HES record. A record is only included once in each count, even if the procedure is recorded in more than one procedure field of the record. Note that more procedures are carried out than episodes with a main or secondary procedure. For example, patients under going a 'cataract operation' would tend to have at least two procedures-removal of the faulty lens and the fitting of a new one-counted in a single episode.<br>
5. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so are no longer included in admitted patient HES data.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department for what reason there was an increase in the number of persons detained under Immigration Act powers in the third quarter of 2010; what her estimate is of the number of persons who will be detained under Immigration Act powers in each of the next eight quarters; and if she will make a statement.

 While there was an increase in the number of persons detained under Immigration Act powers in the third quarter of 2010 it is worth noting that the data are a snapshot. They only show the number detained on the last day of the reporting period, therefore, on any other date during the quarter (or in previous quarters) the number detained could have been higher or lower.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_417"><a name="110131w0006.htm_para46"><a name="11013145001236">The increase in the detained population may have been, partially, a result of the opening of Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre which provided additional detention space for Immigration Group to progress cases through to removal. There were 360 more adult detainees at Harmondsworth comparing Q2 of 2010 to Q3 (from 250 to 610). The population at Oakington dropped from 395 to 100 but the fall was less than the rise of the detained Harmondsworth population.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_418"><a name="110131w0006.htm_para47"><a name="11013145001237">The increase may have also occurred due to a higher than average number of charter flight removal operations during that period in which individuals would have required detention prior to removal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_419"><a name="110131w0006.htm_para48"><a name="11013145001238">There is no specific estimate for the number of persons who will be detained in the next eight quarters. However our aim is to maintain and improve the number of removals over the next two years which will inevitably require detention.</p>

<i> [holding answer 25 January 2011]:</i> A transitional Neighbourhood Policing Fund will be in place for the first two years of the comprehensive spending review before being devolved to police and crime commissioners. The amount will be ¬£340 million in 2011-12 and ¬£338 million in 2012-13. This includes amounts to be paid to the Metropolitan Police Authority where conditions of the grant will be revoked in recognition of the role that the Mayor of London and the deputy mayor of policing already play.</p>

 The police pension schemes are included in the scope of the Independent Public Service Pensions Commission, led by Lord Hutton. The commission will make recommendations on how public service pensions can be made sustainable and affordable in the long-term and fair to both the public service workforce and the taxpayer. The Government will consider the commission's findings before proposing any changes to the police pension schemes. Any changes will be subject to the normal consultation processes in line with statutory requirements.</p>
