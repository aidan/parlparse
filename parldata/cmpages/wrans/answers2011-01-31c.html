 In its opium survey for 2010, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reported stable levels of opium cultivation across the country, with the number of poppy-free provinces remaining at 20. Opium cultivation in Helmand fell by 7%. This follows two successive years of reductions in opium cultivation and a dramatic fall in the wheat price. Current indicators suggest that opium poppy cultivation will remain broadly stable again in 2011, despite continuing low wheat prices. The UNODC intends to release its next assessment in February/March.</p>

 International sanctions, including those adopted by the UN and the EU, show the strength of international concerns about Iran's nuclear programme. We continue to monitor the progress of that programme closely. It is clear that sanctions are having an impact. Iran is finding it increasingly difficult to acquire access to goods of proliferation concern and is also finding it hard to access international finance. We believe these and other pressures brought Iran back into talks with the EU 3+3. But, its disappointing failure to engage on the substance of international concerns in Istanbul and its continuing defiance of Security Council Resolutions; of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the international community more broadly mean that pressure will need to increase.</p>

 For TriStar, the engineering unserviceability database does not give the aircraft location or the task planned/undertaken by the aircraft. It would incur disproportionate cost to compare the flight departure logs which give this information against the engineering unserviceability database. I am able to confirm, however, that in 2010 there were 99 instances where short term TriStar unserviceability caused a delay to an Operation Herrick task departing RAF Brize Norton at the start of an Airbridge flight. In many cases, engineers were able to quickly rectify the unserviceability, or to minimise the overall delay another airframe was substituted to undertake the task.</p>

 In July the Department published the 2050 Pathways report, which as well as presenting the assumptions lying behind the 2050 Calculator, calculated high-level costs in the large scale power generation sector for six illustrative pathways. The analysis set out cost figures for the physical capital; fixed and variable operating costs; fuel; nuclear decommissioning and waste; and infrastructure (such as the electricity transmission and distribution network). It does not consider the cost of financing, carbon, electricity imports, research and development, behavioural change or wider macro-economic impacts. Each of these pathways showed a marked increase in electricity demand, up to a doubling in some cases.</p>

 Since May 2010, the Department has consolidated the seven separate sets of national newspapers previously received by the ministerial and special adviser offices to a single shared set of papers, delivering over £15,000 of ongoing revenue savings.</p>

Neither DCLG Ministers nor officials in the Department now receive hard copy press cuttings. Ministers have taken the view that an excessive and unnecessary amount of taxpayers' money was being spent on press cuttings. The Department estimates that the cancellation of the regional cuttings service and streamlining of the national cuttings service will save approximately £16,000 and £19,000 respectively in the remainder of this financial year.</p>

 The coalition agreement commits us to exploring a range of measures to bring empty homes back into use. As part of that, we have recently completed a consultation on the New Homes Bonus which includes the option of including empty homes within the scheme.

 None. It will be a matter for each local authority, democratically accountable to its own electorate, to decide whether or not to introduce a code of conduct for its members. In taking this decision, a council will have regard to the duty, provided for in the Localism Bill, to promote and maintain high standards of conduct by its elected members.

 I took into account the fact that these waters off the Suffolk coast are the only area where the Department's Maritime and Coastguard Agency currently allows ship-to-ship transfers (other than those in a harbour authority area) to be carried out, and that these waters are recognised by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and by the industry as a suitable area for carrying out ship-to-ship transfers on navigational safety grounds. I also considered whether there was a demand from the industry for ship-to-ship transfers in other locations around the UK coast, and I considered the implications of introducing ship-to-ship transfers to waters where they are not currently carried out.</p>

The research was undertaken across six local authorities, which were selected to be broadly representative (in terms of type, urban and rural and levels of deprivation). The survey was also supplemented with interviews with booster samples of: 303 young people with LDD; 102 parents of young people with LDD; 65 young people in a job without training (JWT) aged 16 or 17; 75 young people who were not in education, employment or training (NEET) aged 16 or 17; and 76 teenage parents aged 16-18.</p>

 The pupil premium for 2011-12 will be allocated to local authorities and schools with pupils that are known to be eligible for free school meals (FSM) as recorded on the January 2011 school census. Each pupil known to be eligible for free school meals will attract £430 of funding which will go to the school or academy if the pupil is in a mainstream setting or will be managed by the responsible local authority if the pupil is in a non-mainstream setting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="110131w0003.htm_para4"><a name="11013122000071">The January 2010 school census allows an estimate of the number of pupils known to be eligible for FSM to be made. In the Redditch constituency in January 2010 there were approximately 1,760 pupils in Redditch schools known to be eligible (rounded to the nearest 10), which would give rise to a pupil premium of £756,800. However, these are estimates only and are not necessarily indicative of how the pupil premium will be distributed. The number of eligible pupils in 2011 could be higher or lower. The figures do not include the pupil premium for service children, which is paid at the lower rate of £200 per pupil, or for looked after children who attract their own premium, again set at £430 for 2011-12.</p>

<i> [holding answer 21 January 2011]:</i> For the purposes of the 2010 performance tables the humanities element of the English Baccalaureate measure was either history or geography. We have not included religious education (RE) as fulfilling the humanity requirement of the English Baccalaureate because it is already a compulsory subject. One of the intentions of the English Baccalaureate is to encourage wider take up of geography and history in addition to, rather than instead of, compulsory RE. However we recognise, as many schools do, the benefits that religious education can bring to pupils. This is why the teaching of RE remains compulsory throughout a pupil's schooling. Success in all subjects studied at GCSE will also continue to be recognised by other performance table measures, as it has in the past. We are open to arguments about how we can further improve the measures in the performance tables and will review the precise definition of the English Baccalaureate for the 2011 tables.</p>

 Under the law of England and Wales anyone may make a will without professional advice. The person making the will (the testator) usually specifies the people he or she wants to administer his or her estate (the executors). It is for the testator to choose his or her executors. Banks appointed as executors cannot charge for their services unless and to the extent that they are authorised to do so by the testator in the will, by the court or by statute.

For example, last year, the Office of Fair Trading published advice for consumers on making wills and appointing executors.

 We are conducting an assessment of sentencing to ensure that it is effective in deterring crime, protecting the public, punishing offenders and cutting reoffending. On 7 December 2010 we published proposals in the Green Paper, "Breaking the Cycle: effective punishment, rehabilitation and sentencing of offenders", for public consultation. These proposals included the reform of sentences of Imprisonment for Public Protection.</p>

This will capture very serious sexual and violent offenders. It is proposed that violent and sexual offenders who do not meet the new threshold will be able to receive a long determinate sentence or in appropriate cases an extended sentence (where the offender remains under supervision for an extended period after release). These proposals have been published on the Ministry of Justice website at:</p>

When an offender has been cautioned for two or more offences at the same time the principal offence is the more serious offence.  <sup>(3)</sup> Cannabis was classified as a class B drug to January 2004 when it was reclassified as a class C drug. It was then subsequently reclassified as class B from January 2009.  <sup>(4)</sup> Statutes and corresponding offence descriptions used: Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 s.5(2) as amended by Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Amendment) Order 2008 Having possession of a controlled drug-Cannabis and cannabis resin; Cannabinol; Cannabinol derivatives Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 s.5(2) Having possession of a controlled drug-Cannabis or cannabis resin.  <sup>(5)</sup> The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.  <sup>(6)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.  <sup>(7)</sup> The sentenced column may exceed those found guilty as it may be the case that a defendant found guilty, and committed for sentence at the Crown court, may be sentenced in the following year.  <sup>(8)</sup> Excludes data for Cardiff magistrates court for April, July and August 2008.  <i> Source:</i>  Justice Statistics Analytical Services-Ministry of Justice.<br>

When an offender has been cautioned for two or more offences at the same time the principal offence is the more serious offence.  <sup>(3)</sup> Cannabis was classified as a class B drug to January 2004 when it was reclassified as a class C drug. It was then subsequently reclassified as class B from January 2009.  <sup>(4)</sup> Statutes and corresponding offence descriptions used: Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 s.5(3) as amended by Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Amendment) Order 2008 Having possession of a controlled drug with intent to supply-Cannabis and cannabis resin; Cannabinol; Cannabinol derivatives. Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 s.5(3) Having possession of a controlled drug with intent to supply-Cannabis or cannabis resin.  <sup>(5)</sup> The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.  <sup>(6)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.  <sup>(7)</sup> The sentenced column may exceed those found guilty as it may be the case that a defendant found guilty, and committed for sentence at the Crown court, may be sentenced in the following year.  <sup>(8)</sup> Excludes data for Cardiff magistrates court for April, July and August 2008.  <i> Source:</i>  Justice Statistics Analytical Services-Ministry of Justice.<br>

 We are conducting an assessment of sentencing to ensure that it is effective in deterring crime, protecting the public, punishing offenders and cutting reoffending. On 7 December 2010 we published proposals in the Green Paper, "Breaking the Cycle: effective punishment, rehabilitation and sentencing of offenders", for public consultation. These proposals included the reform of sentences of Imprisonment for Public Protection. They have been published on the Ministry of Justice website at:</p>

It is proposed that violent and sexual offenders who do not meet the new threshold will be able to receive a long determinate sentence or in appropriate cases an extended sentence (where the offender remains under supervision for an extended period after release). Additionally, there are court orders available to manage the risk of serious sexual and violent offenders whose risk was not considered high enough at the time of conviction for an indefinite sentence, but who appear to present a risk at the end of their sentence.</p>

 When ECGD is asked to provide its support for an export transaction where the buyer is a Ministry or Department of the central Government it would be usual to seek a sovereign guarantee of payment that commits the full faith and credit of the sovereign Government to honour its debt obligations. Sovereign guarantees of payment may also be sought where the buyer is a publicly owned entity in circumstances when ECGD judges that such security is necessary and it is available.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills pursuant to the answer of 24 January 2011, <i> Official Report,</i> column 109W, on overseas students: EU nationals, what the mechanisms are which his Department has in place to recover loans from <i> (a)</i> EU and <i> (b)</i> other students who move abroad; and if he will make a statement.

 Student loans in England are only available to those who meet the relevant residence requirements. The Student Loans Company (SLC) applies the same mechanisms to all borrowers who move overseas after leaving their course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="110131w0004.htm_para68"><a name="11013139000353">When borrowers move abroad, whether temporarily or because they live in another country, they must give the SLC information about their location and earnings. SLC will determine whether the borrower should be making repayments and if so, gives them a monthly repayment schedule under the terms of the contract of the loan. The SLC will convert the income into pounds sterling and tell the borrower the amount they will need to pay each month in pounds sterling.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="110131w0004.htm_para69"><a name="11013139000354">Where borrowers move overseas and do not notify the SLC, they may be charged penalties which will be added to the outstanding loan amount. They may also have to pay the costs of any trace agents employed by SLC. In some circumstances, they may have to repay the full outstanding amount in a single payment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="110131w0004.htm_para70"><a name="11013139000355">Effective collection of student loans across the EU is underpinned by EC regulation 44/2001, which allows the SLC to obtain judgments in UK courts which can be enforced by courts in other EU countries. Borrowers who choose to disregard their obligation will be pursued by SLC and where appropriate, court orders will be sought.</p>

1. Direct comparisons of employee estimates over these different periods should be treated with caution. Estimates for 2008 onwards are from the Business Register Employment Survey (BRES) and are on a new standard industrial classification basis (SIC2007). Estimates prior to this are from the Annual Business Inquiry (ABI) on the previous standard industrial classification basis (SIC2003).<br>
 2. An assessment of changes in survey methodology suggests the total number of employees for the manufacturing sector for GB increased by around 0.1% by moving to BRES from the ABI.<br>
 3. The change from SIC2003 to SIC2007an additional impact between 2008 and 2009 with the removal of the recycling industry out of manufacturing having the largest impact.<br>
 4. For the ABI estimates prior to 2006 are on a different basis to 2006 to 2008. An assessment of changes in survey methodology suggests that the estimate of the total number of employees for the manufacturing sector for GB increased by around 0.3%.<br>

 A comprehensive assessment is not available. It is estimated that more than one third of all households have insufficient money to meet their basic needs, and 10% of the population do not have enough to eat. One in five children die before they reach the age of five, and one in three is malnourished. 380 of every 100,000 women die unnecessarily in pregnancy or childbirth. 70% of people are at risk from malaria, with 4 million cases and 9,000 deaths each year. Over 95% of health costs are met by people themselves, with government expenditure and international assistance for health care amounting to less than US $1 per person per year. Education is also severely underfunded. It is likely that poverty is particularly severe in areas of eastern Burma affected by armed conflict, in Chin and Rakhine States, and in parts of the central dry zone. Around 500,000 people have been displaced by conflict in eastern Burma, of which about 100,000 are living in areas of continuing fighting. Around 150,000 Burmese people live as refugees in camps in Thailand.</p>

DFID's allocation for Burma for 2010-11 is £28 million, to which a further £3 million is being added in order to contribute to the relief and recovery effort following Cyclone Giri which hit Burma in October 2010.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) has identified and is implementing a range of initiatives to achieve a 10% reduction in carbon emissions by June 2011. The biggest reduction in energy consumption will be achieved through reducing the number of IT servers. DFID has also installed a green roof at its East Kilbride headquarters, which has reduced carbon emissions from gas usage. A number of other changes have also been made, such as reconfiguring lighting systems and reducing plant operation times and cooling of IT equipment.

Projects that will be supported in order to achieve this are currently being determined as part of the ongoing aid reviews, which will report in the coming months. Information on the new framework and all current maternal health projects is available on the DFID website.</p>

1. Headcount totals are unlikely to equal the sum of components. When overall headcount figures are split into subcategories the sum of the subtotals may exceed the overall sum due to inclusion of staff in multiple subcategories.<br>
2. Monthly data are extracted on the final day of each month. The data in the table, therefore, are in respect of 30 April 2010, which is the date nearest to, and after, the date specified in the question.<br>
3. As from 21 July 2010, the NHS Information Centre has published experimental, provisional monthly NHS workforce data. Figures obtained from provisional, experimental statistics may be revised from month to month as issues are uncovered and resolved. The monthly workforce data is not directly comparable with the annual workforce census. It only includes those staff on the Electronic Staff Record and does not include primary care staff or bank staff. It also includes locum doctors (not counted in the annual census). There are also new methods of presenting data; headcount methodology has changed and there is now a role count. This information is available, in respect of September 2009 onwards, at the following website:<br>
www.ic.nhs.uk/pubs/provisionalmonthlyhchsworkforce<br>
<i> Data Quality:</i><br>
The NHS Information Centre for health and social care seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data but responsibility for data accuracy lies with the organisations providing the data. Methods are continually being updated to improve data quality where changes impact on figures already published. This is assessed but unless it is significant at national level figures are not changed. Impact at detailed or local level is footnoted in relevant analyses.<br>

1. Data are provided in respect of Northwest London Hospitals NHS Trust rather than Northwick Park Hospital, as hospital level data are not held centrally.<br>
2. The data provided in the table refer to the number of episodes of care where at least one procedure or intervention was carried out, rather than a count of the number of operations, which is not collected as part of the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES).<br>
3. A finished consultant episode (FCE) is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.<br>
4. Number of episodes with a main or secondary procedure: The number of episodes where the procedure (or intervention) was recorded in any of the 24 (12 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and four prior to 2002-03) procedure fields in an HES record. A record is only included once in each count, even if the procedure is recorded in more than one procedure field of the record. Note that more procedures are carried out than episodes with a main or secondary procedure. For example, patients under going a 'cataract operation' would tend to have at least two procedures-removal of the faulty lens and the fitting of a new one-counted in a single episode.<br>
5. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so are no longer included in admitted patient HES data.<br>

 While there was an increase in the number of persons detained under Immigration Act powers in the third quarter of 2010 it is worth noting that the data are a snapshot. They only show the number detained on the last day of the reporting period, therefore, on any other date during the quarter (or in previous quarters) the number detained could have been higher or lower.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_417"><a name="110131w0006.htm_para46"><a name="11013145001236">The increase in the detained population may have been, partially, a result of the opening of Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre which provided additional detention space for Immigration Group to progress cases through to removal. There were 360 more adult detainees at Harmondsworth comparing Q2 of 2010 to Q3 (from 250 to 610). The population at Oakington dropped from 395 to 100 but the fall was less than the rise of the detained Harmondsworth population.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_418"><a name="110131w0006.htm_para47"><a name="11013145001237">The increase may have also occurred due to a higher than average number of charter flight removal operations during that period in which individuals would have required detention prior to removal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_419"><a name="110131w0006.htm_para48"><a name="11013145001238">There is no specific estimate for the number of persons who will be detained in the next eight quarters.

<i> [holding answer 25 January 2011]:</i> A transitional Neighbourhood Policing Fund will be in place for the first two years of the comprehensive spending review before being devolved to police and crime commissioners. The amount will be £340 million in 2011-12 and £338 million in 2012-13.
