<P>
<a name="00615w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the total cost to his Department was of the supply of 226 LH-40C hand-held laser range-finders to the Army; how many units have been purchased; which companies bid for this contract; if the bid by the Eloptro Division of Denel company was the lowest; and if he will make a statement.  [124883]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00615w01.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The total cost to the Department, including three years support, is in the region of &#163;2 million, but the details are a matter of commercial confidentiality. Bids were received from four companies in November 1999: Eloptro, a division of Denel; Leica Geosystems Ltd.; Litton Laser Systems; and Simrad Optronics Ltd.
<P>

<a name="00615w01.html_para0">Following a detailed technical evaluation including extensive trials of all candidate equipment only Eloptro provided a compliant tender and this, therefore, was the lowest acceptable bid. A contract for the supply and support of the 226 systems was awarded to Eloptro on 23 March 2000. The unsuccessful companies have been given the opportunity for a formal debrief and, while all have indicated that they wish to take up this offer, only Leica have done so to date.

<P>
<a name="00615w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Keetch: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what are the planned in-service dates for follow-on Type 45 destroyers; and if he will make a statement.  [124993]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00615w01.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 On current plans, we expect that the first Type 45 destroyer will enter service with the Royal Navy in 2007 and that the last will enter service in 2014, with progressive deliveries between these dates. The delivery programmes for the ships have yet to be negotiated.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00615w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the benefits of the United Kingdom being granted special status under the US International Traffic in Arms Regulations; and if he will make a statement.  [125380]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00615w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 We welcome the announcement of the Defence Trade Security Initiative made by the US Government on 24 May 2000. The proposed reforms to US defence export control arrangements should reduce munitions licensing process times in general and simplify many licensing procedures, particularly for NATO countries, Japan and Australia. They represent a significant step towards enhancing alliance interoperability and preventing the widening of the technology gap.




<P>
<P><I>15 Jun 2000 : Column: 668W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00615w01.html_para1">The initiative includes a proposal for an International Traffic in Arms Regulations exemption for the UK and other close allies. This would enhance the ability of UK firms to compete in the US market; to benefit from US Research and Development expenditure; and give access to some of the most advanced defence technologies in the world. US defence companies are, of course, free to compete in the UK market.
<P>

<a name="00615w01.html_para2">We expect early discussions with the US to take this forward as part of the implementation of the UK/US Declaration of Principles.

 There has been no central estimate of the number of places on training courses for paramedics as this training is managed directly by the 32 National Health Service ambulance service trusts around the country. We have made &#163;21 million extra available per annum to support the ambulance services in meeting the national target of responding to 75 per cent. of all life threatening 999 calls within eight minutes. &#163;18.5 million of this allocation is to provide additional staff, in particular paramedics, thereby increasing significantly the number of training places.

<a name="00615w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We recognise the importance of detecting diabetes as early as possible. Ministers have asked the United Kingdom National Screening Committee, which advises us on all aspects of screening policy, to consider whether there is a case for the introduction of a targeted screening programme for Type 2 diabetes and, if so, how this could most effectively be achieved. The conclusions of the Committee will inform the work of the Expert Reference Group for the National Service Framework (NSF) for diabetes in England which we announced last year.

<P>
<a name="00615w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We remain committed to the modernisation of the National Health Service which will continue to provide a universal service, free at the point of use and available to all on the basis of clinical need. Development of intermediate care is a key part of the Government's programme to improve services for older people, including the National Service Framework. It can be achieved in a number of ways--by investing more in NHS hospitals, including giving new life to community hospitals, and by entering into new arrangements with the private sector.
<P>

<a name="00615w02.html_para8">The whole system approach, which typifies intermediate care and is essential to its development, should recognise the contribution made by all partners in the health and social care system, including the independent sector. The same standards of clinical quality and effectiveness will apply to both NHS and non-NHS providers, and services should provide value for money.

<P>
<a name="00615w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We shall announce detailed proposals on the introduction of new intermediate care services later this summer. Intermediate care involves a variety of different services in preventing inappropriate admissions to hospitals or long-term care and in providing active rehabilitation and support on discharge from hospital. Local authority services will have an important part to play in intermediate care. Our proposals will be influenced by the work of the modernisation action team on partnership, charged with ensuring that all parts of the health and social care, including local authority services, work together more efficiently.

 Intermediate care is a whole system approach to a range of multi-disciplinary, multi-agency services designed to promote independence by reducing avoidable hospital admission; facilitating timely discharge from hospital and promoting effective rehabilitation; and minimising premature or avoidable dependence on long-term care in institutional settings.

 The Department has not carried out any projects on the efficacy of prescribing diamorphine to heroin addicts, which is subject to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Supply to Addicts) Regulations 1997. The Department is funding a &#163;2.4 million research initiative on drug misuse. Over the next four years this will deliver evidence to underpin our 10 year anti-drugs strategy. A major aim of this initiative is to improve knowledge on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of treatment and care procedures. The initiative includes a trial comparing the efficacy of substitute prescribing of injectable and liquid methadone.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is the total number of valid applications he has received for the sale of playing fields in each month since October 1998. [125927]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00615w04.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Secretary of State's consent to the disposal of land by local authorities under their general powers is required only where they wish to do so at less than the best reasonably obtainable consideration, which is normally open market value. Six applications for consent for the sale of playing fields have been received since October 1998.

 The Environment Agency's records indicate that since 1 May 2000 one domestic garage has flooded from the Ouseburn. The Environment Agency is aware of further surface water flooding within the Red House Farm estate and within Brunton Park, Gosforth. This flooding was caused by the drainage systems within these estates being unable to discharge into the Ouseburn when in flood. Although precise numbers are not available, the Environment Agency believes around eight properties on the Red House Farm estate were affected, along with a similar number on the Brunton Park estate.

<a name="00615w05.html_para0">The Environment Agency believes, based on detailed modelling studies, that the development of the Newcastle Great Park will have no adverse impact in terms of flooding within the Ouseburn catchment. The use of Sustainable Urban Drainage techniques, in the form of large balancing ponds, will maintain water and discharge flow into the Ouseburn at a rate equivalent to the undeveloped site. The design criteria utilised will reduce flows from the development site in extreme

 Combined heat and power is vital to helping us meet our Kyoto commitments. The Government are actively working towards a target of at least 10,000 megawatts by 2010, and will issue and consult on a new CHP Strategy for achieving the target. The Government have already announced that Good Quality CHP will be eligible for Climate Change Levy exemption, Enhanced Capital Allowances, and de-rating of electricity generating plant and machinery, from April next year.

<P>
<a name="00615w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 A consultation on proposals for substantial changes to the energy conservation requirements in Part L of the Building Regulations has been published today. The consultation period will end on 29 September 2000. The Government have made clear their aim to do all they can to address the global problem of adverse climate change. This cannot be achieved by any one policy, and the contribution made by each separate initiative will be crucial to achieving our overall aim.
<P>

<a name="00615w05.html_para5">Buildings produce about half of the total national CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions, and average building performance is poor by comparison with current best practice. If implemented, the proposals would yield significant improvements in the energy efficiency of new buildings and also in existing buildings when they are renovated. This would contribute directly to our vision of more sustainable construction set out in "Building a better quality of life". The draft proposals aim to contribute to the Government's climate change programme while keeping the Regulations technically sound, cost-effective and proportionate. Other improvements would also accrue for those who occupy buildings in terms of the opportunities for increased comfort and reduced energy costs.
<P>

<a name="00615w05.html_para6">This consultation has been anticipated by all sectors of the construction industry and by others who have a desire to see standards of energy efficiency raised. We anticipate receiving comments on the proposals from all interested parties, and all such comments will be considered when drafting our final proposals for amendments. Participation by all interested parties will ensure that the eventual amendments reflect the broadest views of what can reasonably be achieved by the Building Regulations.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1) how many UK vessels are obliged under EU regulations to carry operational satellite monitoring equipment; and how many UK vessels comply;  [125133]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many UK vessels have satellite monitoring equipment on board which is not operational; and in which fleet segment these vessels are concentrated. [125134]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00615w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Some 430 UK fishing vessels over 24 metres overall length are required to carry satellite monitoring equipment. Our records, and those of the devolved administrations, show that all vessels are equipped. The vast majority of vessels are complying with the requirement to provide position reports at the required frequency. Those which are not submitting reports are mostly in the demersal segment. Some vessels have not submitted reports because they have recently been inactive due to lack of fishing opportunities and the number not complying is declining. Appropriate action is being taken against active vessels which are not yet fully compliant.

The development of a UKYP fits with the Government's commitment to involve young people in all aspects of Government and to develop citizenship skills among young people--an essential element of education is citizenship and the teaching of democracy in schools. As the Department with the lead responsibility for the Connexions strategy and the development of citizenship through the National Curriculum, DfEE has a particular interest in supporting the work of the UKYP. For example, we recently agreed to a full-time member of staff from the Department being

seconded to the UKYP for 12 months. In addition, the Department has funded consultancy support for the group of young people and other representatives who make up the UKYP steering group, taking forward the development of the UKYP. And the training process for prospective young Members of the Youth Parliament, currently being developed, will include sessions on citizenship--the UKYP is in discussion with DfEE on the help that we will be able to provide for those sessions, which are scheduled to take place in late October. While DfEE and other Government Departments are helping in its development, the UKYP is independent of Government and political parties and will belong to the young people themselves. It is the young people who will ultimately decide how the UKYP will be run, what issues they want to debate and the part they wish to play in future citizenship developments.

In order to know as much as possible about the destinations of people leaving the New Deal the Government are conducting further surveys of those who leave the New Deal for unknown destinations.

<a name="00615w08.html_para10">Comprehensive information on whether young people left their options having completed them or before having done so is not collected in that form. The New Deal aims to help unemployed people to move as quickly as possible from welfare into employment. Many young people will leave their New Deal options before completing them because they have found jobs in the regular labour market and are no longer unemployed. Young people do not therefore need to complete their New Deal options in order to succeed in the programme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00615w09.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Government are taking a number of significant steps to promote research and development among UK companies. Working closely with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, we have recently introduced an R&D tax credit for small and medium-sized companies which gives them 150 per cent. relief for the cost of staff and consumables used in R&D. The R&D tax credit will be supported by new Guidelines on R&D which will help companies of all sizes to benefit from Research and Development Allowances. We are also increasing the DTI Innovation Budget by some 20 per cent. over three years to nearly &#163;230 million by 2001-02. This budget will fund a number of new and enlarged initiatives designed to drive forward a fundamental change in innovation performance in the UK. This includes for example the Smart scheme which supports R&D activities in private small and medium-sized companies and is being expanded and extended over the period 1999-2002, and the technology transfer scheme known as TCS, for which DTI is doubling its expenditure. Our aim is to improve the overall climate for investment in R&D and innovation. But the level of R&D investment by companies is for companies themselves to determine. DTI helps companies make an informed decision by providing a valuable source of information on UK and international R&D investment through the annual R&D Scoreboard.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00615w09.html_spnew13"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The arrangements for avoiding unsolicited direct marketing faxes are contained in the Telecommunications (Data Protection and Privacy) Regulations 1999. These ban the sending of unsolicited direct marketing faxes to individual subscribers, and introduce an "opt-out" scheme--the Fax Preference Service--for corporate subscribers.




<P>
<P><I>15 Jun 2000 : Column: 698W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00615w09.html_para3">There is good evidence that the arrangements are delivering effective protection to subscribers from unwanted faxes. The number of complaints to Oftel about these faxes has fallen sharply since the Regulations came into force. Over the same period of time, the number of subscribers registered with the Fax Preference Service has risen from less than 15,000 to over 280,000.
<P>

<a name="00615w09.html_para4">The Data Protection Commissioner's Office are responsible for enforcing the Regulations and will take action against those that they feel have wilfully or negligently breached the Regulations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00615w10.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Under the current Cosmetic Products (Safety) Regulations 1996, any reference to testing on animals in the labelling of a cosmetic product must state clearly whether the tests carried out involved the cosmetic product itself or its ingredients. (However, if manufacturers market their products without any reference to animal testing, the regulations do not require them to alter that practice).
<P>

<a name="00615w10.html_para0">The European Commission has proposed a 7th Amendment to the Cosmetics Directive, which aims to ban animal testing in the EU. One aspect of the proposed amendment will be that the Commission, in collaboration with member states, will produce guidelines to ensure that common criteria are applied to any claims relating to animal testing, and that such claims do not mislead the consumer.

<a name="00615w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The proposal to build a new 180 MW gas-fired combined heat and power station at the Sevelco works, Avonmouth, has several potential benefits particularly those to the local area in terms of atmospheric pollution and the requirements of the Environment Agency for a pollution control arrangement. The Station being combined heat and power, albeit not fully meeting the criteria given in the Energy White Paper, the benefits are such that I have decided not to use my powers, under section 14(3) of the Energy Act 1976, to defer or halt this project. However, local planning and other clearances are still required under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989.

 Since Seattle, the mandated negotiations on agriculture and on services have been launched. Consultations have also been conducted by the Director-General and the Chair of the General Council. The General Council meeting on 3-8 May included discussion on the progress of two areas of consultation. The first involved a package of confidence-building measures aimed at helping developing countries, including establishing an implementation review mechanism. Discussions on the second, on improving consultative and decision-making procedures, are continuing in Geneva.

 We have received reports of alleged human rights abuses against Christians in Turkey.

Officials from the British Embassy in Ankara have raised both these cases with the Turkish authorities.

 We have a long standing concern about the position of the Greek and Syrian Orthodox communities in Turkey.

 There is currently a comprehensive police training project under way in Turkey. We have allocated &#163;107,000 to this project which builds on police training workshops held last year. The objective is to increase dialogue on issues of interest to both the British and Turkish police by holding seminars on public order, anti-terrorism, custody and detention. The project focuses on policing methods that protect human rights and are in line with international human rights law. As part of this project, a group of Turkish policemen visited Britain in May to study British policing methods. Further training projects are planned with the Turkish police which are likely to focus on transparency and accountability.

With this in mind, we and the British Council have updated our guidance material for students. We are also working with the British Council in a number of key markets to help students who are qualified to come here to submit properly completed and fully documented visa applications.

 There have been no discussions recently but, at ministerial level, the UK has long pressed for a resolution to the problem of US arrears to the UN. Though we have welcomed US agreement under the Helms-Biden legislation to pay a substantial portion of their arrears, the US will need to convince the UN membership of the case for accepting the conditions attached to the legislation. At the EU General Affairs Council on 20 March, Foreign Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to securing a comprehensive reform of UN finances to put them on a sound, sustainable and equitable basis, and emphasised that the EU could only consider a reordering of UN contributions which protected EU member states' financial interests.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00615w12.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Our legal advice is that time credits derived from participation in a Time Exchange Scheme, such as Fair Shares, do not constitute earnings for income-related benefit purposes and therefore participation does not constitute remunerative work. Entitlement to those benefits would therefore be unaffected. Guidance to local decision-makers will be issued shortly.

 The purpose of the National Intelligence Unit (NIU) is to provide "information for action" or anti-fraud intelligence that facilitates better informed decision making at managerial and operational levels. The NIU is located over five sites and consists primarily of data collection sections and teams of analysts. Once analysed, all intelligence which can be used to help combat benefit fraud is referred to relevant sections of the Benefits Agency. No information is available on the role of the NIU in tackling benefit fraud in specific towns, cities or counties as the unit operates on a national level.
<P>

<a name="00615w13.html_para2">Although we have held no recent discussions with the Benefits Agency about tackling benefit fraud specifically in Dorset, national policy on combating fraud applies throughout Great Britain.

<a name="00615w13.html_para3">The four key principles are; getting it right--benefit payments should be correct from day one; keeping it right--ensuring payments are adjusted as circumstances change; putting it right--detecting when payments go wrong and taking prompt action to correct them with appropriate penalties to prevent a recurrence; and making sure our strategy works--by monitoring progress, evaluating the strength of our defences and adjusting them in the light of experience.

 During April this year, the latest date for which information is available, it was accepted that 501 parents with care had good cause for not co-operating with the Child Support Agency.

<P>

<a name="00615w13.html_para4">The underlying purpose of the requirement to co-operate with the Child Support Agency where these benefits are in payment is to ensure that, wherever possible, parents and not the taxpayer take responsibility for supporting their children. The receipt of regular maintenance can also play an important part in helping to lift children out of poverty.

 The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis included performance data for the first 11 months of the last financial year, and projected performance in its final month, in his Policing and Performance Plan for 2000-01 which he published on 31 March, on the Metropolitan police website http://www.met.police.uk.
<P>

<a name="00615w14.html_para4">The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis tells me that he expects to publish a hard-copy version of the Plan on 21 June. This will include full-year performance data for 1999-2000. These data confirm, I understand, the provisional out-turns included in the version of the Plan published on 31 March.
<P>

<a name="00615w14.html_para5">It may benefit right hon. and hon. Members, in particular those preparing to take part in the debate on the policing of London which, subject to the demands of business, we hope the House will be able to hold before the end of this month, to have early sight of the hard-copy version of the Plan. I am, therefore, today placing proof copies of the Plan in the Vote Office, and in the Library.

 I am announcing today the allocation of &#163;20 million additional resources for tackling robbery in the five metropolitan areas in which 70 per cent. of all robberies take place, and for which challenging targets have been set for the police forces concerned by their respective police authorities. The &#163;20 million forms part of the &#163;91 million which my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer allocated in the Budget for additional measures to support the delivery of crime reduction.

We are discussing with the police service how this money is to be allocated to improve performance. In particular, we will be discussing a national standard response time for emergency calls in rural areas. Additional funding for future years will be considered as part of the Spending Review 2000 process.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the drugs that he proposes to include in the mandatory drug testing for offenders under the provisions of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Bill.  [125996]<P>

<P>
<a name="00615w14.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Initially it is proposed to test specifically for heroin and crack/cocaine, which research has shown to have a particularly strong connection with acquisitive crime. The Bill provides for the Secretary of State to specify, by order, the Class A drugs applicable. Consideration will be given to including other Class A drugs in the testing programme if research evidence demonstrates a similar link to the commissioning of crime.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when the Advisory Council for the Misuse of Drugs is expected to report on the Police Foundation's inquiry into the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.  [125995]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00615w14.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Further to the reply I gave my hon. Friend on 8 May 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 298W, I understand that the Advisory Council had a short discussion on the Police Foundation's Report at its meeting on 25 May. The Council noted that the Government had made it clear that they were not persuaded that the classification or overall legal framework for LSD, ecstasy or cannabis should be changed, but would be giving careful consideration to the other recommendations arising from the Police Foundation's Inquiry.
<P>

<a name="00615w14.html_para24">The Council also noted that the United Kingdom Anti-Drugs Co-ordinator, Keith Hellawell, is to chair an inter-departmental working group to consider the other recommendations of the Police Foundation Inquiry's Report. I understand that the working group plans to provide a progress report to Ministers later this summer. It is not possible to speculate at this stage whether the consideration by the inter-departmental working group will lead the Government to seek the views of the Advisory Council on any of the recommendations being considered. However, under provisions in the misuse of drugs legislation, the Advisory Council would need to be consulted on any proposed amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00615w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 The first UK drugs strategy "Tackling Drugs Together" was launched in May 1995 and allocated &#163;8.8 million over three years to Drug Action Teams, &#163;5.9 million on schools drug education for 1995-96, and &#163;1 million in the same year for services for young people at an early stage of drug misuse. For the present strategy, "Tackling Drugs To Build A Better Britain", the 1998 Comprehensive Spending Review settlement provided an additional &#163;217 million of resources for three years, of which &#163;70.5 million (32.4 per cent.) was allocated for new treatment services in communities, and &#163;60 million (27.6 per cent.) for treatment services in prisons. No extra resources were allocated for enforcement. The overall aim of the Government's present anti-drugs strategy is to shift the emphasis away from dealing with the consequences of the drugs problem towards positive investment in preventing and targeting it, and Government drug-related expenditure will reflect this over the length of the strategy.

The challenge now is to consider how to strengthen that contribution and ensure that all public bodies provide a first class service to all citizens.

 Yes. Copies of the revised guidance to be used in future have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The Lord Chancellor is satisfied that the substance of the existing guidance, which is long standing, remains basically sound. It is necessarily of a general kind, for application in individual circumstances. The Lord Chancellor is satisfied that it strikes an appropriate balance in discouraging activities or interests which may be seen to undermine judicial impartiality, or conflict with judicial office, without being unduly restrictive. He has at the same time made a number of detailed changes in the text and added a statement of general principles. The new guidance will be kept under review in the light of experience. The general guidance on outside activities and interests is separate from any question of conflict of interest arising in individual cases on which the Court of Appeal recently gave further authoritative guidance in its judgment in the case of Lockbail (UK) Ltd. <i>v.</i> Bayfield Properties Ltd.
