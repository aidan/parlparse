<a name="30701w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Cousins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what eligibility criteria were used to define boundaries in each Employment Action Team area; and how each ward in the local authority of each EAT area scored against those criteria.  [113057]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30701w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 During Phase I of the Action Teams for Jobs initiative, Action teams were allowed to focus on pockets of deprivation, often at housing estate level, rather than ward level. This meant that some Local Authority wards with high overall employment rates were still able to receive Action Team help for areas within the ward with lower employment rates.
<P>

<a name="30701w01.html_para0">In Phase II, a new selection method was developed to decide where Action Teams were located which focused on identifying and tackling low employment rates at ward level. The method used to identify ward employment rates used information from a number of sources such as Office of National Statistics 1998 database information on working age population; benefit administrative data; and data from the Scottish Executive and Welsh Assembly. Ward jobless estimates were thus indicative rather than authoritative, but the primary aim was to provide Action Team help to wards with employment rates of 58.5 per cent or below.
<P>

<a name="30701w01.html_para1">However, a number of wards with higher employment rates were included in Action Teams. In some cases this was to prevent the need to withdraw Action Team services from areas with pockets of extreme deprivation but with a high level of employment at ward level. Some wards with employment rates above the threshold were also included to ensure greater viability for those Action Teams with the attendant benefit for the clients they were serving.
<P>

<a name="30701w01.html_para2">The available information on the indicative employment rates of all wards in each Action Team area, and identification of wards covered by Action Team activity has been placed in the Library.

<a name="30701w01.html_wqn2"><B> Bob Spink: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on the Government's plans to help lone parents back to work.  [119482]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30701w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 We have introduced a wide range of initiatives to help lone parents gain independence by moving into work.
<P>

<a name="30701w01.html_para3">The New Deal for Lone Parents is delivering services tailored to meet the needs of individual lone parents and giving them the skills, support and confidence they need to move into work. By the end of March 2003, it had helped over 193,000 lone parents to find jobs.
<P>

<a name="30701w01.html_para4">The combination of the child care component of our new Tax Credits and the extra places created through our National Childcare Strategy are making child care affordable and accessible for parents moving into work. Since April, Childcare Partnership Managers have been introduced into every Jobcentre Plus District to work with personal advisers and Local Authorities to ensure that jobseekers with children have access to information on child care provision in their area. Lone Parents can also benefit from payments of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit at pre-work levels for four weeks after starting work to help them through what can be a difficult transitional period.
<P>

<a name="30701w01.html_para5">We announced a number of measures in Budget 2003 to help lone parents overcome barriers to work. Discovery Week pilots will increase the familiarity of lone parents with the help and support available to them. From 2004 we will also introduce a new mentoring service across the country that is tailored specifically for lone parents. This will be delivered alongside child care taster pilots which allow lone parents to test whether formal child care suits their needs.
<P>

<a name="30701w01.html_para6">From April 2004, in 12 areas we will pilot a payment of &#163;4 per week for 12 months on top of tax and benefits when the lone parent starts a job of more than 16 hours a week. This will be complemented, in eight pilot areas, by a weekly work search premium payment of &#163;20 on top of benefits for lone parents who have been on income support for more than 12 months and are actively seeking work.
<P>

<a name="30701w01.html_para7">We have introduced compulsory Work Focused Interviews for lone parents claiming Income Support to ensure that they are aware of the wide range of help they can access to move into work. Through our programmes we are giving lone parents more choices and more help than ever before to move off welfare and into work and this has helped reduce the number of lone parents dependent on Income Support by over 175,000 since May 1997.

 The Regulatory Impact Unit's Business Regulation Team engages directly with the business community to identify unnecessary or excessive regulatory burdens and works closely with other Government Departments and Agencies to broker reform. The team is built on a core of high quality secondees from industry.
<P>

<a name="30701w01.html_para9">April's Budget Report set out plans for the Business Regulation Team to investigate regulatory burdens in three sectors, including the construction industry, as part of its 2004 work programme. Preliminary research will begin this autumn.

<P>
<a name="30701w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Hood: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the outcome was of the Environment council on 13 June 2003; what the Government's stance was on the issues discussed, including its voting records; and if she will make a statement.  [119887]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30701w01.html_spnew7"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 I represented the UK at Environment council on 13 June 2003. The council reached a provisional political agreement on one important legislative measure and agreed a general approach on another. The council also considered a number of other issues.
<P>

<a name="30701w01.html_para10">The council reached agreement on a framework for a common position on the Environmental Liability directive. This measure will require polluters to bear the cost of remedying environmental damage, in line with the 'polluter pays' principle. Following intensive negotiation, the agreement reflects key UK concerns. First, there will be no obligation for compulsory financial security (to be reviewed within five years of implementation). Second, Member States will retain discretion to decide whether or not to remedy damage in the absence of the polluter. Third, Member States may choose to allow exception from liability on the basis that operations comply with a permit or were not judged harmful by the best scientific knowledge at the time. Some of the technical detail of the proposal remains subject to further discussions before an agreement is finalised. The text did however include a review of the coverage of damage falling within the scope of international conventions and of GMO damage. It should be noted that the Directive is intended to cover damage caused by the deliberate release or contained use of GMOs.
<P>

<a name="30701w01.html_para11">Austria and Ireland opposed the agreement because it did not cover nuclear damage, and Germany was also opposed because of disagreement with major features, notably the permit and state of the art exceptions.
<P>

<a name="30701w01.html_para12">The council also agreed a general approach on gaseous and particulate emissions from non-road mobile machinery. This included an exemption for lifeboat launchers from the scope of the Directive, an issue pressed by the UK in negotiations. I indicated that my intention at this stage was to abstain, pending European Parliamentary consideration, and that I had concerns about the second phase of the proposals. Germany was unable to support the general approach.
<P>

<a name="30701w01.html_para13">Council debated a decision for establishing a monitoring mechanism for greenhouse gas emissions. I, together with Ministers from a number of other Member States, emphasised the need to clarify Member State and Community responsibilities in implementing certain obligations under the Kyoto Protocol, particularly with respect to establishing the assigned amount, and in exercising certain rights, including participation in the flexible mechanisms. There was general agreement to aim for political agreement in October.
<P>

<a name="30701w01.html_para14">We also discussed a presentation from the Commission about progress towards its new system for registering and approving Chemicals. Draft proposals are currently subject to an internet consultation by the Commission. 



<P>
<P><I>1 Jul 2003 : Column 187W</I><P>
Several Ministers emphasised the need to have the right balance in the proposals between environmental protection and industrial competitiveness. The Commission hoped to bring forward its full proposal by October, to enable progress to be made before the European parliamentary elections.
<P>

<a name="30701w01.html_para15">Together with Denmark, the UK tabled a paper drawing attention to the Commission's Communication on Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade and calling for rapid progress on measures to address illegal logging and its associated trade. The council also noted written contributions on the recent Environment for Europe Conference in Kiev, Environmental Technologies, Sustainable Development in an enlarged Union, Natura 2000, vehicle emissions, sensitive sea areas, flood prevention and the herbicide Paraquat.
<P>

<a name="30701w01.html_para16">The Presidency reported that it had written to key members of the Convention on the Future of Europe, setting out the concerns with the inadequate treatment of the environment in the draft Constitutional Treaty. I circulated a letter to colleagues at council, highlighting my continuing concerns on these points, and about the negative impact of the proposal for a Single Legislative council. The Presidency considered that the latest draft Treaty text on environment and sustainable development was a significant improvement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30701w02.html_spnew1"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Balance payments on all the bovine subsidy schemes have been delayed due to the need to implement changes in EU legislation introduced for the 2002 scheme year. These changes introduced new penalty procedures that apply when either the scheme rules or cattle identification requirements have been breached. Before making balance payments the Rural Payments Agency has had to build a new computer database and significantly enhance existing computer systems to cope with the changes. These are complex changes and have taken considerable time to implement. As a result, not all producers will be paid before the 30 June deadline.
<P>

<a name="30701w02.html_para0">Staff at the RPA continue to work overtime at offices around the country to process as many payments as possible.

 The average fare per return journey at 2000 prices implicit in each of the examples shown in Table 14.5 of "The Future of Air Transport in the United Kingdom: South East" is the sum of the fare premia for 2030 given in that table, plus an underlying fare in the absence of airport capacity constraints of &#163;258 in 2030. The underlying fare in the year 2030 is calculated by taking a 1 per cent. per annum reduction in real terms over 20 years from a fare in the year 2000 of &#163;312.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30701w03.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 As both the London and Durham schemes have shown, charging can play a role in the management of local congestion. The effects of congestion charging depend upon the design of a scheme, which is a matter for individual local authorities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30701w03.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Vehicles used for ambulance purposes are exempt from speed limits when used in an emergency. However the legislation does not contain a definition of what constitutes an ambulance. Whilst other vehicles used to carry human tissue are allowed to use blue lights in an emergency, it would be for a court to decide whether they are permitted to exceed speed limits.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30701w03.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 A breakdown of evasion by local authority area could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. Figures of evasion in London were given in my previous answer of 25 June. Estimates of the cost of this evasion in London would be &#163;19.4 million in 1999&#150;2000 and &#163;20.6 million in 2002&#150;03. Increase in lost revenue is not as sharp as the increase in evasion because of the reduction in the average value of licenses.

 Universal banking went live in post offices on 1 April 2003 as scheduled. The Post Office is now providing electronic access to a wide range of bank accounts and is looking to extend these further. The provision of electronic banking services at post offices is an operational matter for Post Office Ltd. I understand from the company that its introduction has gone extremely well and that the systems are working effectively. The Government's investment of &#163;480 million on computerising the post office network means that the Post Office can achieve a new role as a convenient place for people to do their banking.

 We are actively promoting flexible working policies across the workplace through the Government's Work-Life Balance Campaign, which aims to encourage best practice by demonstrating the benefits to both employers and employees in all sectors and size of business. To support and help speed up the spread of best practice, on 6 April 2003 we introduced new flexible working legislation, to ensure that employees with children under six or disabled children under 18 will only have their requests for flexible working turned down where there are valid business reasons.
<P>

<a name="30701w09.html_para6">We are committed to commence a review of this legislation in three years' time, and as a baseline for this, we have already carried out two major surveys covering employers and employees, giving a clear picture of the current levels of flexible working in both public and private sectors. We are currently developing a detailed monitoring strategy for the next three years and are working closely with key employer and employee stakeholders. As part of this strategy we will be repeating the two baseline surveys in 2005.

<a name="30701w09.html_para7">For further evidence on the numbers of people working flexibly, disaggregated into the public and private sectors, we are repeating the large scale Workplace Employment Relations Survey in 2004, and asking specific questions on flexible working to both employers and employees. The spring and autumn modules of the quarterly Labour Force Survey also provide some information on flexible working practices.
<P>

<a name="30701w09.html_para8">We will be working with other Government Departments to gain information on how the new legislation is being implemented and the levels of take up across central Government.

 Ministers have agreed that the Department will coordinate the Government's responses to all market investigations by the OFT or the Competition Commission, which make regulatory recommendations and also monitor progress to follow up action. This reflects the Department's responsibility for consumer and competition matters. Any changes to regulations to be made under the National Health Service Act as a result of the Government's decisions on the merits of the recommendation on control of entry for pharmacies will be for the Department of Health to lead on.

 There will be new controls on the distribution of unsolicited commercial e-mails (UCE) under the UK's implementing regulations for the Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive (Directive 2002/5 8/EC) which are due to come into force by 31 October.
<P>

<a name="30701w10.html_para6">Under these regulations, commercial e-mails may only be sent to individuals with their prior consent, except where there is an existing customer relationship between the sender and the addressee.
<P>

<a name="30701w10.html_para7">The new measures will apply to all EU member states and to instigators as well as senders of commercial e-mails within the EU. UK and other EU advertisers will therefore be unable to avoid the rules by using third part e-mail bureaux located outside the EU.
<P>

<a name="30701w10.html_para8">Where a business decides to relocate its operations entirely to another country outside the EU, and no longer maintains a UK presence, it does become very difficult to enforce the UK rules. However, the fact that the European regime has now been agreed and is being implemented opens the door to agreements between the EU and other countries, which should result in a more unified approach towards the distribution of unsolicited e-mails.

 As sponsoring Department, DTI has had regular liaison with representatives of the waste management industry including the Environmental Services Association (ESA) and the Chartered Institution of Wastes Management (CIWM). In particular, DTI has played an active role in the development of good practice initiatives by the National Resource and Waste Forum (NRWF)&#151;a cross-sectoral forum led by the waste management industry, which was instigated by DTI following a study of industry competitiveness.
<P>

<a name="30701w10.html_para11">The Department takes careful account of the views of the waste management industry in consideration of waste policy. This enables us to bring a waste industry perspective to discussions with other Government bodies such as Defra, the Environment Agency and HM Treasury.
<P>

<a name="30701w10.html_para12">The Joint Environmental Markets Unit (JEMU)&#151;which is jointly staffed by DTI and Defra&#151;continues to promote the UK's waste management industry in international markets. An extensive programme of activities, including seminars and outward and inward trade missions, has benefited around 20 to 30 waste management companies over the past couple of years, and is beginning to achieve a far greater appreciation in the industry of global trade and investment opportunities.
<P>

<a name="30701w10.html_para13">During 2002, an industry-Government Innovation and Growth Team (IGT) for the Environmental Goods and Services Sector (IGT-EGS) was set up to identify actions to help the UK environmental sector take advantage of changes in UK and overseas markets over the next 15 years. As a result, JEMU will expand its role, taking forward those actions that are of common interest across waste, water, energy and other sub-sectors and are not already being dealt with effectively elsewhere. This will include a particular focus on the innovation-related aspects of the IGT work.
<P>

<a name="30701w10.html_para14">To this end, DTI and Defra have established an Environmental Innovations Advisory Group which will meet for the first time on 14 July 2003. The Group will bring together companies from different levels in three supply chains&#151;waste recycling, energy efficient technology and water management&#151;as well as people involved in supporting the innovation and commercialisation process. This theme of innovation in resource efficiency is consistent with policy goals, while the findings would be transferable to other areas of innovation in environmental technologies.
<P>

<a name="30701w10.html_para15">The Department is also represented on the Defra-led Hazardous Waste Forum, and is currently considering options for a possible industry forum on waste, in line with a recommendation in the Strategy Unit report, "Waste Not Want Not".

 The Afghan Transitional Administration requested US$173 million for the health sector as part of the Budget for the current year, of which at least US$22 million is specifically for training and capacity building. We estimate that donors will fund all or most of this. The Afghan Ministry of Health has devised an interim health strategy, which includes specific programmes for addressing institutional development and management and staff training. They are committed to addressing gender issues within these areas. DFID is helping the Ministry of Health to devise a long-term approach to policy and management, including recently by providing a consultant to assist with the assessment of human resource needs.

 The Afghanistan Transitional Authority is trying to improve the basic health services and primary health care for all and wants to avoid a rapid expansion of the hospital sector which will skew current and future resources away from primary care. The International Community supports this approach and is unlikely to fund the opening of large numbers of hospitals in the near future, while the Afghan Government lacks the capacity to manage and staff such institutions. However, DFID and others are assisting the Afghan Ministry of Health to develop its long-term strategy for health care provision in Afghanistan and this will include assessments of the needs of hospitals.

 While "deforestation rate" is one official indicator for measuring success or failure of Millennium Development Goal 7 it is an imperfect one that hides differential impacts on poor people and does not capture the underlying causes of reducing forest cover&#151;population growth, trade (including trade in illegal timber), macro-economic policies, weak governance, unclear access rights and conflict.

<a name="30701w11.html_para1">Official estimates of forest cover are contested by independent organisations like Global Forest Watch.

 The Performance Assessment Network was an informal network of officials from across DFID. It was created to ensure that lessons on performance assessment were shared widely across the Department.

Currently, around 60 per cent. of all general practice dentists offer 90 per cent. or more NHS care. Some 25 per cent. of all general practice dentists offer NHS care exclusively.

 No definition of personal care is used in determining eligibility for funding care.

This is defined, in section 49 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001, as "services provided by a registered nurse and involving either the provision of care or the planning, supervision or delegation of the provision of care, other than any services which, having regard to their nature and the circumstances in which they are provided, do not need to be provided by a registered nurse". Where a person needs care other than services for which the NHS is responsible, those services can be provided by a local authority on a means tested basis.

The NHS also funds nursing care in any setting, this is nursing care as defined by section 49 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001 as "services provided by a registered nurse and involving either the provision of care or the planning, supervision or delegation of the provision of care, other than any services which, having regard to their nature and the circumstances in which they are provided, do not need to be provided by a registered nurse".

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what services are available to NHS staff suffering from work-related stress; what plans there are to advise trusts to operate fast track referral systems for such staff; and if he will make a statement.  [120627]<P>

<P>
<a name="30701w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department's long term plans for reducing organisational stress in the National Health Service are based around the improving working lives (IWL) programme. This covers a range of issues, including the provision of childcare, flexible working, improvements to work/life balance as well as ensuring the provision of counselling services for all staff.
<P>

<a name="30701w16.html_para2">The National Audit Office report, "A Safer Place to Work: Improving the Management of health safety risks to staff in NHS Trusts", reported that 68 per cent. of NHS trusts already operate some form of "fast tracking" for staff. This is to ensure the earliest possible treatment for staff injured at work to facilitate their quick return to duty and maximise staff resources.
<P>

<a name="30701w16.html_para3">The Department will be producing new guidance in the autumn of 2003, which will draw further attention to the use of quicker access services for those who aren't already implementing such systems.

<a name="30701w18.html_para3">The recommendations from the two studies cover three main areas: raising awareness of the crime of distraction burglary and how to prevent it, among both older people and professionals working with them; reducing vulnerability; and reducing the impact once a crime has occurred. They are highly relevant to practitioners and voluntary groups working with older burglary victims and vulnerable groups, and officials will be discussing them with a range of interested organisations, including Help the Aged and Age Concern, through the Home Office Distraction Burglary Task Force.

 Subject to Parliamentary approval, cannabis will be reclassified to Class C under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 as soon as some related provisions in the Criminal Justice Bill currently before Parliament are brought into force. The related provisions introduce a power of arrest for the possession of Class C drugs and increase the penalties for trafficking Class C drugs. It is not expected that the Bill will receive the Royal Assent before the autumn, and the reclassification of cannabis will take effect as soon as practicable thereafter.

 We recognise the real problem of graffiti on street furniture, which my hon. Friend has done much to highlight. That is why we consulted on options in this area in our 2002 document on public space, "Living Places". A number of owners of street furniture responded to this consultation.The Government are considering the results of the consultation exercise and will decide what further action to take. Officials from the Home Office and Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) also met with British Telecom recently to discuss the challenges in this area.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many <i>(a)</i> police officers and <i>(b)</i> other law enforcement personnel are employed on a full-time basis to investigate online paedophile offences.  [121956]<P>

<P>
<a name="30701w19.html_spnew4"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 Investigations which are believed to involve paedophile activity or images, whether committed on or off line, are normally investigated by paedophile units, child protection or investigation teams. The allocation of officers to these units is a matter for individual chief officers, and information as to the staffing of these units is not held centrally.

<P>

 I am afraid the information requested on grants and refusals of visitor visas to Jamaican nationals is not available.
<P>

<a name="30701w19.html_para3">Visitor visas for Jamaican nationals were not issued until January 2003 when the visa regime was introduced. Prior to that, however, some Jamaican nationals chose to apply for entry clearance for temporary purposes to aid passage through the immigration control.
<P>

<a name="30701w19.html_para4">The published information relates to grants and refusals of entry clearance for temporary purposes, which includes visitors and others seeking temporary admission to the UK. The latest published information on grants and refusals of entry clearance (including visas), for settlement and temporary purposes, relates to 2000. Data for 2001 and 2002 will be published in November 2003 in the Home Office publication, "Control of Immigration: Statistics United Kingdom 2002", which will be available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="30701w19.html_para5">Decisions made on applications for entry clearance are recorded according to where the application is made rather than by the nationality of the applicant. The published information therefore relates to the number of applications made in Jamaica. It is not possible to identify separately Jamaican nationals applying for entry clearance, either in Jamaica or elsewhere in the world.

<P>
<a name="30701w22.html_spnew9"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 In 2002, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister commissioned Heriot-Watt University to examine the scale, nature and impact of the misuse of the Right to Buy policy by companies. The results were published in March 2003. The full report is available on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website at http://www.housing.odpm.gov.uk/information/rtb/index.htm; a summary is at http://www.housing.odpm.gov.uk/hrs/hrs177/index.htm.
<P>

<a name="30701w22.html_para7">The research found that some properties sold under the Right to Buy scheme had been acquired by companies offering tenants financial help to buy their homes on condition that they resold them to the company after the three-year discount repayment period had ended ('deferred resale' arrangements). Both tenant and company thereby evade the statutory requirement, in place since 1980, to repay discount where a property is resold within three years of being sold under the Right to Buy scheme, and the companies acquire former social homes at substantially less than their market value in order to rent them out. This means that homes formerly available at subsidised social rents then command substantially higher market rents, reducing the availability of affordable housing.
<P>

<a name="30701w22.html_para8">Such exploitation is prevalent in Inner London, where the report estimated that at least 2,000 properties had been acquired in this way by companies since 1998. It also noted that at least one such company was advertising nationally.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30701w23.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The setting-up costs of elected assemblies will vary from region to region, mainly because of the different sizes of their electorates. But the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister expects these to be around &#163;30 million in each region, including the north-west. This estimate includes all costs necessary to establish an assembly, including the cost of local government reviews, referendums and the first elections.
<P>

<a name="30701w23.html_para2">The Government's estimates of the costs of running a regional assembly were set out in our White Paper "Your Region, Your Choice". The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister estimates that the north-west assembly would cost around &#163;25 million a year to run. But about &#163;5 million of this cost will be directly offset because staff will be transferring from existing bodies, such as the region's Government Office. The remaining costs could be absorbed within the assembly's programme budget through efficiency savings of around 5 per cent.
