<i> [holding answer 2 March 2009]:</i> We do not have exact numbers of British nationals who were in Thailand and seeking to leave at the time of the airport closures but in normal circumstances around 1,000 British nationals would leave each day through Bangkok during late November and early December. Bangkok's commercial airports were closed from 26 November 2008 to 3 December 2008, so we estimate that up to 6,000 British nationals had their travel plans disrupted. About 1,300 British Nationals registered with the embassy using the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's on-line registration service, LOCATE, during the airport closures.</p>

Under leadership of the Home Office Departments across Government (including the Ministry of Justice, the Department for Children, Schools and Families, and the Department for Communities and Local Government) are working together to combat it. Over the past 10 years we have introduced a wide range of tools and powers to tackle antisocial behaviour which are being used by practitioners to bring relief to communities across the country.</p>

We also introduced premises closure orders to allow police forces and local authorities to take action on premises which cause significant and persistent disorder or serious nuisance to the community.

<i> [holding answer 2 March 2009]:</i><i> </i>The Government are committed to ensuring that policing is transparent and responsive and are taking a number of steps to achieve this. Key to ensuring the operation of policing meets this ambition is the Policing Pledge, which has now been implemented in all 43 forces. The pledge sets out a national standard on what the public can expect from the police, underpinned in each area by a set of local priorities, agreed by people in each neighbourhood. The views of local people must also be considered in the drawing up of local policing priorities. These priorities must be contained in the three year policing plan that each police authority is required to produce annually, explaining how they intend the force to realise their objectives.</p>

The unit will enforce compliance of scrap metal dealers with relevant existing legislation, including the Scrap Metal Dealers Act and Environmental legislation. The operation brings together all the agencies with enforcement powers around the scrap and waste recycling industry including, police, local authority, Environment Agency, HMRC, Trading Standards, Health and Safety. It will ensure compliance with existing legislation and demonstrate the positive affect of working with the legitimate businesses to reduce opportunities for thieves to dispose of their stolen material and profit from crime.</p>

As there is no link with actual market rates, the tariff income rates within the income related benefits remained unaltered throughout the period of rising interest rates, just as they have done more recently, when interest rates have been lower.</p>

The rate of tariff income applied to capital in pension credit, which was introduced in 2003, is half the rate of tariff income applied to capital in income support, at &#163;1 for each &#163;500 or part of &#163;500.   <br>

 One of the six largest energy suppliers has already reduced its prices, and a further four have announced that they will do so from the end of March. Recent high prices have been driven mainly by unprecedentedly high wholesale costs for both gas and electricity, which make up around 60 per cent. of the cost of an average domestic bill. Ofgem's estimations of the suppliers' purchasing strategies show that the supply companies' costs peaked towards the end of 2008 and, on the basis of current forward wholesale prices, are expected to decline throughout 2009. Ofgem are now reporting on a quarterly basis on the link between wholesale and retail energy prices as it is vitally important that energy suppliers pass further savings on to their customers.</p>

 At the outset of the programme the target was 78 weeks. To date, the average time taken by local authorities to procure their private sector partners to deliver their Building Schools for the Future projects is 102 weeks. This timing compares favourably to other PFI deals in the education and other sectors and is typical of procurement using European Union competitive dialogue or negotiated procedure processes for major procurements. Following a review of BSF procurement (completed in May 2008) we have introduced changes that aim to further significantly streamline the procurement process. As a result, the target procurement time will fall to 74 weeks for authorities just entering the programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_496"><a name="90305w0023.htm_para0"><a name="09030571000647">During the procurement period, local authorities engage with the private sector bidders and work towards the selection of a partner through competitive bid evaluation. The bidding costs during this part of the process are borne by the private sector, with the public sector incurring costs associated with the project management of the procurement. These costs can vary significantly depending on a number of project-specific factors, including the size of the project.</p>

 Data published by the Department as SFR 23/2008: &#147;Children looked after in England (including adoption and care leavers) year ending 31 March 2008&#148;, shows 47,600 children aged between five and 19 as being looked after by local authorities as at 31 March 2008. The source of this publication is the SSDA903, which does not collect information on whether a child is part of their school's gifted and talented cohort. Information on gifted and talented pupils is, however, collected in the School Census which also collects information on whether a child is in care whilst at their school.</p>

The School Census does not cover all looked after children; information is not collected for pupils in alternative provision, including pupil referral units, FE colleges, voluntary provision and those not in education or training. These differences in coverage will explain the different counts to an extent, but it is possible that the School Census undercounts the number of looked after children in primary, secondary and special schools.</p>

 The number of pupils achieving an A*-C grade in GCSE mathematics in each year since 2003 can be found through the following links. Prior to 2005, figures are available only for 15 year-old pupils. In 2005, figures are available for both 15 year-old pupils and pupils at the end of Key Stage 4. From 2006, figures are available only for pupils at the end of Key Stage 4. Care should be taken when constructing a time series, as figures for 15 year-old pupils are not directly comparable to figures with pupils at the end of Key Stage 4.</p>

 The leaflet for parents on talking to their teenage children about sex and relationships strongly encourages them to share their values with their children and that clearly includes their views about what's right and wrong. However, the leaflet also draws on research summarised in &#147;The Nature of Adolescence&#148; (John Coleman and Leo Hendry, 1999) which shows that the most effective way of communicating with teenagers is to encourage discussion rather than simply telling them what to think. Teenagers whose parents have an authoritative rather than authoritarian style are less likely to be involved in risky behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_527"><a name="90305w0025.htm_para0"><a name="09030571000865">The leaflet highlights the important role that parents&#151;fathers and mothers&#151;have in: helping their daughters and sons resist pressure to have early sex; to understand their feelings and the feelings of others; and to take responsibility for preventing pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) if and when they do choose to become sexually active.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_528"><a name="90305w0025.htm_para1"><a name="09030571000866">The leaflet was drafted by DCSF officials in conjunction with colleagues at Parentline Plus. The content was informed by research into parents' views and experiences of talking to their teenage children. There was no formal public consultation on the leaflet before it was published. The leaflet will be available in pharmacies from early March 2009. The total cost of design, print and production of the leaflet was &#163;14,427. A copy of the leaflet will be placed in the House Libraries.</p>

 We do not collect programme specific data about the reduction of surplus places linked directly to capital investment through either Building Schools for the Future or the Primary Capital Programme. We have nevertheless made clear in relation to both programmes that all local authorities should look for opportunities to remove excessive numbers of surplus places; particularly where these are linked to poor standards. Maintaining surplus places can represent a poor use of resources&#151;resources that can be used more effectively to support schools in raising standards and delivering better outcomes for children. That said, it is accepted that in order to preserve access for young children, there may be more empty places in schools in rural areas than in urban areas.</p>

 The distance between schools within a consortium is not stipulated centrally; a range of factors need to be taken in to consideration including transport and access and arrangements are determined locally. Through the Diploma Gateway process consortia are required to explain how the young people in their area will access the different institutions within the consortium.</p>

 Opening hours are a matter for local decision, taking account of the range of needs and resources to meet these. From April 2009 this Government are allocating over &#163;1 billion a year to local authorities to support services in Sure Start Children&#146;s Centres. And Sure Start Children&#146;s Centres have changed the way many parents access essential services during their children&#146;s early years by delivering them closer to where families live and in ways that suit families needs. Centres offering integrated early learning and day care facilities as part of their services are required to be open 10 hours a day, five days a week and 48 weeks a year. They also have flexibility to open at other times. Other centres  <br>

have more flexible opening hours but all centres will aim to provide services at times that suit the communities&#146; needs &#151; which can mean opening in the evenings and at weekends. Some centres have, for example, found that the best time to offer activities for fathers and their children is on Saturday morning. Guidance on opening times can be found in Chapter 3 of &#145;Sure Start Children&#146;s Centres Planning and Performance Management Guidance&#146; (2006).</p>

The subject also has a proportionately higher profile in the Training and Development Agency for Schools advertising and marketing activities. This includes specialised direct marketing materials being sent to all those who register an interest in teaching the subject. The latest published figures show that applications for postgraduate modern language courses at 3 February 2009 are up 11.7 per cent. on the same time last year.</p>
