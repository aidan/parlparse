 Boeing and Rolls Royce are already working to develop appropriate modifications to the B777 aircraft and the Fuel Oil Heat Exchanger on the Rolls Royce Trent 800 engine. Once the modifications have been developed they will need to be approved by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The Civil Aviation Authority will then ensure that UK airlines make the modifications within the timescale set by EASA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="90330w0001.htm_para1"><a name="0903303000075">Since the accident at Heathrow in January 2008 Boeing has developed a range of changes to the aircrafts operating procedures to ensure that aircraft crews can minimise and manage any risk associated with potential ice accumulation in the fuel system. These procedures have been approved by EASA and the US Federal Aviation Administration (US FAA) and have been made mandatory for all US and European airlines. Both EASA and the US FAA are content that, subject to the application of these procedures, B777 aircraft with Rolls Royce Trent engines are safe to remain in service. When a Delta Airlines Boeing 777 experienced an uncommanded power reduction in a single engine on 26 November 2008 the procedures were shown to be effective and thrust control of the engine was recovered.</p>

 We do not have designated car parking spaces for visiting members of the public or non-pass holders, because of security concerns and pressure on space on the estate.

 We do not estimate compensation spend solely on the basis of head of cattle since spend is demand led and much will depend on the disease situation and prevailing cattle prices (since compensation payments are linked to market prices).

While it is not illegal under wildlife legislation to move foxes from one place to another as long as the provisions of the Animal Welfare Act 2006 are complied with, there are welfare concerns with releasing foxes into areas unfamiliar to them and the potential to spread disease. Under section 9 of the Animal Welfare Act 2006 it is an offence for a person to fail to provide for the welfare needs of an animal under his or her control. This includes failing to take reasonable steps to ensure that an animal has the ability to fend for itself in the wild on release. If it were found that an animal had suffered unnecessarily after release, it could also be an offence of causing unnecessary suffering under section 4 of the Animal Welfare Act 2006.</p>

Experience has shown that the eradication of Rhododendron ponticum (the main host for the diseases) is the most effective control measure to reduce disease spread in the wider environment. At a selected number of woodland sites, the clearance of all rhododendrons, whether infected or not, has proved effective and appears to have prevented further infection of trees on those sites.</p>

The UN mission in the DRC (MONUC) made a team of military officers available to assist in planning the operations. Although the operations bore some successes, MONUC was less fully involved than we would have wished in planning and carrying them out. Our ambassador in Kinshasa called for co-ordination of the operations with MONUC, both publicly and in consultation with the DRC Government. We made clear our position that the operations should take proper account of humanitarian law and civilian protection.</p>

 Until recently, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) devolved responsibility for expenditure on ICT systems to individual directorates.

The E3+3&#146;s generous offer of June 2008 remains on the table, which offers Iran a wide range of political and economic benefits, together with all it would need to develop and operate a civilian nuclear programme. On the pressure side, the UN Security Council has agreed five resolutions on the issue, three of which put in place sanctions against Iran. The EU has gone beyond these to put in place further measures. We have been clear that if Iran chooses not to accept the US and E3+3 offers, further, tough measures will follow.</p>

 We do not collect data about the amount universities or further education colleges pay in value added tax. This is a matter for individual institutions. However, we have asked some of our key delivery partners to estimate the impact. The main benefit of the VAT reduction for universities and further education colleges will be to reduce the level of irrecoverable VAT they incur on the services they purchase. Using an estimate of the amount universities and further education colleges spend on services, our broad estimate is that this will save around &#163;185 million over the 13 months of the VAT reduction. This is an estimate, which is not based on forecast VAT expenditure, so the amount of actual savings could vary significantly.</p>

 A condition survey has been carried out on Service Family Accommodation (SFA) in England and Wales as set out in my written ministerial statement on 17 March. This confirms that the vast majority of properties fall within the two highest standards for condition. The National Audit Office has recently assessed independently that SFA in the two highest standards for condition meet or exceed the Government&#146;s Decent Homes Standard. We recognise that some properties do not meet the high standards to which we aspire&#151;and that Service personnel and their families deserve&#151;and more needs to be done, but we are making progress even though we are having to make good decades of underinvestment.</p>

 Entitlement to housing benefit is assessed by comparing a customer&#146;s net income with an amount intended to cover day to day living expenses called an applicable amount.

 Help is provided towards the interest on mortgages (known as support for mortgage interest (SMI)) as part of income support (IS), income-based jobseeker&#146;s allowance (JSA(IB)), income-related employment and support allowance (ESA(IR)) and state pension credit (SPC).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"><a name="90330w0017.htm_para5"><a name="09033030000295">Prior to 5 January, home owners claiming IS, JSA(IB), ESA(IR) generally had to serve a waiting period of 39 weeks before assistance was provided towards their eligible housing costs.

<p><a name="stpa_252"><a name="90330w0017.htm_para6"><a name="09033030000296">Some home owners, who were considered to be vulnerable, received help towards their housing costs earlier than 39 weeks. Help for these groups was provided at 50 per cent. of eligible mortgage interest after eight weeks then full eligible assistance after 26 weeks. The groups were: carers; widow(er)s or people who have been abandoned by their partner and who had responsibility for the care of a child; prisoners detained in custody pending trial or sentence upon conviction; and those who had been refused payments under an insurance policy due to either a pre-existing medical condition or because they were infected by HIV or AIDs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"><a name="90330w0017.htm_para8"><a name="09033030000298">This compares favourably with the previous position because although some customers received 50 per cent. of eligible housing costs after eight weeks under the old rules, they had to wait 26 weeks before receiving 100 per cent.

 Where a home owner is getting income support (IS), income-based jobseeker&#146;s Allowance (JSA(IB)), income-related employment and support allowance (ESA(IR)) or state pension credit (SPC) and they have a mortgage, those benefits may include an additional element called support for mortgage interest (SMI). SMI is meant to assist the home owner with the interest on their mortgage, and an additional amount is included in the applicable amount. It is not a separate benefit, rather an integral part of IS, JSA(IB), ESA(IR) and SPC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"><a name="90330w0017.htm_para9"><a name="09033030000301">The amount of SMI is calculated by applying a standard interest rate (SIR) to the capital outstanding on the mortgage, subject to upper limits on the amount of that capital.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many and what proportion of vacancies were advertised in job centres in each of the last 12 months for which figures are available. [263735]</p>

<p><a name="st_215"><a name="09033030000338"><a name="90330w0018.htm_spnew0"><a name="09033030000753"><b>Mr. McNulty</b>
<i> [holding answer 16 March 2009]:</i> We do not have a recent estimate of the proportion of vacancies in the UK economy advertised at Jobcentre Plus. There have been some one-off surveys that have estimated the Jobcentre Plus share of all vacancies. In 2002, ONS used one such survey to estimate the proportion of total vacancies advertised at Jobcentres at 44 per cent. Allowing for sampling variation, the ratio was likely to be in the range of around a third to a half. However, this estimate is likely to have changed over time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"><a name="90330w0018.htm_para0"><a name="09033030000339">The following tables show the number of live unfilled Jobcentre Plus vacancies in Great Britain in each of the last 12 months, and the number of unfilled vacancies in the economy according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Vacancy Survey. Both measures are snap-shots of the number of opportunities available at a particular point in time and do not reflect the dynamism of the labour market that sees thousands of new job vacancies come up every day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="90330w0018.htm_para1"><a name="09033030000340">The data from Jobcentre Plus and the ONS Vacancy Survey are not directly comparable, and so should not be used together to produce such an estimate. The Vacancy Survey is a sample based survey of businesses in the UK and is seasonally adjusted, whereas the Jobcentre Plus data are administrative data that are subject to a high level of seasonality. In addition, there are coverage issues, with the Vacancy Survey covering only civilian vacancies and excluding Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing, whereas the Jobcentre Plus data include non-civilian vacancies.</p>

Coverage relates just to vacancies notified to Jobcentre Plus and as such represent a market share of vacancies throughout the whole economy. This proportion varies over time, according to the occupation of the vacancy and industry of the employer, and by local area. Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) are available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.  3. The stocks of live unfilled vacancies reflect more accurately job opportunities available via Jobcentre Plus. In the case of unfilled vacancies, use of the figures on live vacancies is recommended (i.e. excluding suspended vacancies), and this is the default option. Live vacancies may still include some vacancies which have already been filled or are otherwise no longer open to recruits, due to natural lags in procedures for following up vacancies with employers.  4.

<i> [holding answer 23 March 2009]:</i> Under the Consumer Credit Act 1974, if a business wishes to be involved in consumer lending or related credit activities, including the collection of third party consumer debts, it must have a consumer credit licence. The Office of Fair Trading considers the fitness of businesses who apply for a licence and continues to monitor the fitness and conduct of those who are licensed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="90330w0018.htm_para5"><a name="09033030000472">The Office of Fair Trading debt collection guidance sets out the type of behaviour it considers to fall within the category of unfair business practices which will call into question fitness to be given or retain a consumer credit licence. The guidance applies to all consumer credit licence holders including lenders and debt collectors. It also makes clear that if consumer credit licence holders do business with third parties engaged in unfair business practices, then their own fitness will be called into question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="90330w0018.htm_para6"><a name="09033030000473">The Office of Fair Trading would consider any evidence it receives of consumer credit licence holders failing to adhere to its guidance and has a range of measures that can be applied against such businesses up to and including revocation of the licence. However, any action taken needs to be both evidence based and proportionate to the identified misconduct.</p>

 The Office of Fair Trading carried out a preliminary analysis in response to a complaint about the way in which certain trade unions collect contributions from members to political funds. The OFT decided not to pursue this issue for a number of reasons including a lack of evidence of widespread harm; the limited extent of the beneficial impact on consumers of any intervention; certain legal uncertainties which were finely balanced as to whether trade unions are &#145;suppliers&#146; or &#145;sellers&#146; and that members are &#145;consumers&#146;; and the need to prioritize its activities to best meet its prioritization principles. OFT lawyers contributed to consideration of the matter, but it is not the OFT&#146;s practice to release internal legal advice, in line with rules relating to legal professional privilege.</p>

 The Government and the BBC have set up a Digital Switchover Help Scheme which targets help for those groups likely to have the greatest need.

 The rate of global warming is reflected in the long-term trend in global average temperature. Observations collated at the Met Office Hadley Centre and the university of East Anglia Climate Research Unit indicate that this rate has been approximately 0.13° C per decade over the past 50 years. Natural weather variability will always mean that, despite the presence of an underlying warming trend, some colder than average winters will occur in the UK. These events are fully consistent with our understanding of climate change and are included in the underlying dataset that is used to calculate the rate of global warming at the end of each calendar year. However, they do not have a significant effect on the long-term trend in global average temperature and thus do not necessitate a change in our estimate of the rate of global warming. Furthermore, the scientific evidence indicates that global average temperatures will continue to rise in the long-term if greenhouse gas emissions continue.</p>

<i> [holding answer 26 March 2009]:</i> The Bali Action Plan recognised the relevant provisions of the convention on biological diversity (CBD) as well as other international agreements to ensure that the maximum environmental benefits of paying for the carbon mitigation services of forests are achieved. The UK has been leading the way in looking at this. Dr. Bob Watson, DEFRA Chief Scientist, chaired a meeting of experts on biodiversity and climate change to provide biodiversity-relevant information to the UNFCCC. The first part of this work was already presented to the UNFCCC in Poznan, and the next meeting will be held in April.</p>

This work has yet to be completed and the Department will continue to consult with trade unions as the plans develop. I will write to the hon.

 The National Offender Management Service has a broad, integrated and evidence-based prisoner suicide prevention and self harm management strategy that seeks to reduce the distress of all those in prison. This encompasses a wide spectrum of prison and Department of Health work around such issues as mental health, substance misuse and resettlement. Any prisoner identified as at risk of suicide or self-harm is cared for using the Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) procedures. Most self harm is not directly life threatening, but nevertheless can be extremely distressing for those who have to deal with it. A prisoner focused care planning system for those at risk, ACCT, (Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork), has helped prisons manage self harm. There are no easy answers to managing self harming behaviour but we remain committed to finding ways to improve further our management of it.</p>

1. Figures refer to total numbers of self harm incidents and not numbers of individual prisoners.<br>
2. Self harm incidents are as reported on the NOMS Incident Reporting System. Figures exclude recent numbers for C-NOMIS sites Albany, Camp Hill and Parkhurst.<br>
3. Self harm risk is unevenly distributed around the prison estate and changes over time.
