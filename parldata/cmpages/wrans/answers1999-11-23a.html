To ask the Chairman of the Accommodation and Works Committee if he will break down the total costs of refurbishing the Grand Committee Room into those costs which would have been incurred anyway as part of the planned programme of refurbishment, and those which arise specifically from the use of the Grand Committee Room for Westminster Hall sittings.  [98551]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91123w01.html_spnew0"><B> Sir Sydney Chapman: </B> 
 The total cost of &#163;882,000 for the refurbishment of the Grand Committee Room includes within it &#163;670,000 (at current prices) which had already been included in the 10 year rolling programme for Parliamentary works over the period 2002-06 prior to the House approving the Report from the Modernisation Committee which recommended using the room for Westminster Hall Sittings.
<P>

<a name="91123w01.html_para0">This latter amount covers works such as building services, replacement of fan coils, internal stone cleaning, cabling for the Parliamentary Data and Video Network, automatic fire detection and rewiring.

<P>
<a name="91123w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Savidge: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what progress has been made in his Department's plans to procure two new aircraft carriers.  [99741]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91123w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 I am pleased to be able to announce that competitive contracts were placed today with British Aerospace Land and Sea Systems Ltd. and Thomson-CSF NCS France for the Assessment Phase of the Future Aircraft Carrier (CVF) project.
<P>

<a name="91123w01.html_para1">The two contracts, each potentially worth &#163;29.4 million VAT inclusive, consist of two phases. The first phase of each contract, worth &#163;5.9 million, will involve work to examine a variety of aircraft carrier design options. This phase will also help inform the choice of the type of Future Carrier Borne Aircraft (FCBA). The second phase, worth a further &#163;23.5 million, will involve risk reduction on the preferred carrier design option when the decision on the selection of FCBA has been taken. Progression 



<P>
<P><I>23 Nov 1999 : Column: 58W</I><P>
to this second phase will be subject to BAe and Thomson-CSF satisfactorily completing the first package of work. The Assessment Phase will complete in 2003 when bids for the Demonstration and Manufacture Phase of CVF will be delivered. The two carriers are scheduled to enter service in 2012 and 2015.
<P>

<a name="91123w01.html_para2">The new carriers will form a key element of the modern force structure that emerged from SDR. They will be particularly relevant to the foreign and security policy demands of the next century and will ensure the UK retains one of the most powerful and effective navies in the world.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91123w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 The first C-130 J transport aircraft was delivered to RAF Lyneham today. Initially the aircraft will be used for maintenance training and groundcrew familiarisation only. The In-Service Date is defined as delivery of the twelfth aircraft, currently estimated to be in May 2000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what arrangements are planned for appointing the prime contractor for the Type 45 Anti-air Warfare Destroyer.  [99742]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91123w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 Our plans for the T45 Destroyer programme build on the work accomplished in the design definition phase of the tri-national Horizon frigate project and continuity of the UK contractor is an essential element for this. Marconi Electronic Systems has therefore been contracted to complete the next phase of the work on the T45 Destroyer. Under Smart Procurement principles this is known as the Preparation for Demonstration (PFD) phase and, subject to satisfactory progress, this will lead into the Demonstration and First of Class Manufacture phase.

<P>
<a name="91123w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 In order to secure a suitable alternative use for a redundant church, some churchyard land may be included in the disposal. Where such land contains burials, continued public access is normally reserved for the tending of graves. If necessary, rights of way can also be granted or reserved.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91123w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 Following publication of a draft Scheme to declare the church redundant the Commissioners received nine representations in favour of closure and four against, including a petition. After careful consideration, the Commissioners' Pastoral Committee, acting in its quasi-judicial role, concluded that the church was pastorally required and upheld the representations against the draft scheme.

To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, what proportion of Church of England liquid and fixed assets is represented by those held under freehold by the incumbent clerks in holy orders.  [99004]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91123w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 Parsonages represent about 15 per cent. of the Church's total assets. About 60 per cent. of parsonages are legally held under freehold by incumbent clergy. However, any holding by an incumbent is in a corporate capacity and so is not analogous to freehold ownership in the traditionally understood sense.
<P>

<a name="91123w01.html_para3">Parish churches also normally vest in the incumbent but are not valued in terms of disposal value as they are not usually realisable.

To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, to what extent the Commissioners take into account extra income earned by bishops <i>(a)</i> from giving lectures and <i>(b)</i> from other sources in determining their remuneration.  [99118]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91123w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 Bishops are advised that if they take on further, paid commitments, and that work involves time which would otherwise be used for episcopal responsibilities, they should inform the Commissioners of the gross annual amount. An equivalent sum can then be deducted from their stipend. This is on the same basis as the rules for other clergy.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91123w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, if he will list the expenses claimed by each bishop for the last year for which figures are available.  [99117]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91123w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 The Commissioners' current policy is not to make public the expenditure on individual bishops' working costs. The overall expenditure under this heading in 1998 was &#163;8.8 million. Of this &#163;5.1 million was spent 



<P>
<P><I>23 Nov 1999 : Column: 60W</I><P>
on staff salaries, pensions and fees; &#163;3.3 million on other working costs; and &#163;0.4 million on costs connected with last year's Lambeth Conference.
<P>

<a name="91123w01.html_para4">This expenditure is the necessary costs of supporting the bishops' ministry: principally the salaries and pensions of their staff, the costs of running an office, of official travel, of hospitality, and other miscellaneous costs. All this expenditure is subject to detailed and continuous audit to ensure that it is incurred in line with the Inland Revenue's requirement that it be "wholly, exclusively and necessarily" incurred in the performance of a bishop's duties.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91123w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 In the draft waste strategy "A Way with Waste", published on 30 June 1999, we have set a goal of recycling or composting 30 per cent. of household waste by 2010. We will aim to meet the existing target of recycling or composting 25 per cent. of household waste by 2005. By 2015 we expect to recover value from two thirds of our household waste, with at least half of this through recycling or composting.
<P>

<a name="91123w02.html_para0">The draft waste strategy also set a target for businesses to reduce the amount of industrial and commercial waste landfilled to 85 per cent. of 1998 levels by 2005.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he has reached conclusions on the options for changes to the preferential use of Heathrow's runways at night; and if he will make a statement.  [99589]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91123w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 On 17 November 1998, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions issued the second of two consultation papers on night restrictions at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports. It was in two parts. Part 1 was concerned with the night restrictions regime for the three airports, and on 10 June 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 378-80W, the then Minister for Transport in London, my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson), announced the new arrangements which came into effect on 31 October 1999. Part 2 examined options for changes to the preferential use of Heathrow's runways at night. The decisions I am announcing today are concerned with Part 2 of the consultation paper only.
<P>

<a name="91123w02.html_para1">The current pattern of use of Heathrow's runways has remained unchanged since the 1970s and is largely determined by three operational noise mitigation measures. The first and oldest is the Cranford Agreement, an undertaking given to local residents at a public meeting in July 1952 to avoid easterly take-offs from the northern runway during off-peak periods as far as practicable. Over the years it has come to be applied most of the time during easterly operations, so that easterly take-offs use the northern runway only exceptionally. It is possible that the long-standing preference for landing aircraft on the southern runway at night during westerly operations is also a legacy of that Agreement.
<P>

<a name="91123w02.html_para2">The second measure is westerly preference, which was introduced in 1962. This provides for westerly operations to continue where there is a light tail-wind up to 5 knots. While it is normal for aircraft to land and take off into the wind, it is safe to do so with a light tail-wind when the runway is dry and any cross-wind does not exceed 12 knots. The purpose of the westerly preference is to reduce the number of occasions that departing aircraft need to take off over the more densely populated areas to the east of the airport where it is not possible to design noise preferential departure routes which avoid heavily populated areas.
<P>

<a name="91123w02.html_para3">The third measure is runway alternation, which was introduced in 1972. It applies during westerly operations only. Westerly landings use one runway from 7.00 a.m. until 3.00 p.m. and switch to the other runway from 3.00 p.m. until 11.00 p.m. The pattern is reversed each week to achieve a fairer balance. Its purpose it to provide communities east of the airport under the final approach tracks with predictable periods of relief from the noise of landing aircraft. While runway alternation applies to landing aircraft only, it is generally the case that one runway is used for landings and the other for take-offs, 



<P>
<P><I>23 Nov 1999 : Column: 63W</I><P>
but take-offs are not precluded from using the runway assigned for landings. Runway alternation was confined to daytime operations to allow opportunities for maintenance of the runways and associated equipment at night. It was confined to westerly operations in order to continue observance of the Cranford Agreement.
<P>

<a name="91123w02.html_para4">In response to requests from local communities seeking a fairer distribution of aircraft noise at night, the Heathrow Airport Consultative Committee (HACC) and BAA plc, with approval from the then Department of Transport, undertook two trials of runway alternation at night for both westerly and easterly operations in 1996 and 1997. Independent surveys carried out for the HACC to assess local reaction to the trials showed there was a clear level of support in the vicinity of the airport for extending runway alternation into the night period. It was decided to consult more widely before reaching a final decision.
<P>

<a name="91123w02.html_para5">9,522 copies of the November 1998 consultation paper were issued and 2,803 responses commenting on Part 2 (32 per cent. of the total) were received by the closing date. These included responses from the HACC, 2,649 individuals, 43 local authorities, councillors and local authority organisations, seven Members of Parliament, 63 environmental and local interest groups, and 24 representing airlines, airport and aviation interests. Most respondents were concerned to have the least possible number of night flights overflying their particular areas or asked for a ban on such flights. Most also expressed a general view, either supporting or opposing runway alternation at night or modifying the directional preference. Comparatively few commented on the 10 options outlined in the consultation paper itself. Nine respondents called for the termination of the Cranford Agreement and eight called for its continued operation. However, the Agreement was not among the issues examined in the consultation paper.
<P>

<a name="91123w02.html_para6">843 respondents supported the extension of runway alternation into the night period, including most local authorities, the HACC and aviation industry respondents. The widely held view was that runway alternation at night would be fairer and provide for more predictable periods of relief from the noise of landing aircraft. 51 respondents disagreed because they wished to retain the current arrangements or anticipated that runway alternation at night would lead to an increase in aircraft noise over their area. 86 of the 843 respondents who support runway alternation at night (mainly residents and representative bodies) called for it to apply throughout the night until 7.00 a.m., while 29 of the 843 (mainly aviation interests) said it should operate until 6.00 a.m. to avoid increasing delays to arriving aircraft. BAA consider that it might be possible for runway alternation to operate throughout the night if the scheme allowed greater discretion to land aircraft on the second runway between 6.00 a.m. and 7.00 a.m., interspersed with take-offs, to reduce the likelihood of arrival delays accumulating through the morning peak period.
<P>

<a name="91123w02.html_para7">In view of the clear support for extending runway alternation to the night period, which is consistent with the findings of the earlier HACC surveys, we have decided to open discussions with BAA on its introduction at the earliest practicable opportunity between 11.00 p.m. 



<P>
<P><I>23 Nov 1999 : Column: 64W</I><P>
and 6.00 a.m. As with daytime alternation, it will be necessary from time to time for the pattern of alternation to be interrupted to allow for maintenance of the runways and engineering works.
<P>

<a name="91123w02.html_para8">There are real practical difficulties with extending runway alternation to the hour from 6.00 a.m. to 7.00 a.m. There are usually take-offs scheduled in this hour, so during easterly operations runway alternation is precluded by the Cranford Agreement. It is already established practice during this hour to make use of both runways for landings, interspersed with take-offs, to ensure that there are as few aircraft as possible holding in the stacks awaiting permission to land before daytime runway alternation starts at 7.00 a.m. BAA, NATS and the airlines are concerned that having only one runway available for landings during this hour may lead to a build up of holding delays before daytime runway alternation starts at 7.00 a.m. which could not be cleared until the afternoon. Such delays could also have knock-on effects beyond UK airspace. We are satisfied that there is a genuine cause for concern here, but it has not been possible to forecast with confidence either the frequency or extent of the delays that might occur. On the other hand, runway alternation during this hour would bring real benefits to people living under the final approach tracks.
<P>

<a name="91123w02.html_para9">We have decided that the only prudent way forward is to undertake a trial of runway alternation during the 6.00 a.m. to 7.00 a.m. hour. The details of the trial will be discussed with BAA, HACC and NATS, but will allow NATS the discretion to make use of the second runway for landings whenever arrival delays building up in the system are expected to give rise to holding delays of a given duration. It is likely that different criteria will need to be examined in order to reach a view on what is practicable. Weather conditions, both locally and encountered en route by long haul aircraft, can contribute to the build-up of arrival delays. For this reason the trial will need to look at the winter and summer seasons and may continue for up to two years.
<P>

<a name="91123w02.html_para10">The responses to the consultation paper on the options for modifying the directional preference at night do not provide a sound basis for reaching a final decision at this stage. Strong views were expressed east and west of the airport, and many respondents called for a complete ban on night flights rather than changes to the direction in which the runways were used. However, there was also a recognition among many of the organisations and representative bodies that the present arrangements are not fair and equitable and could be improved; that view is shared by the Government. We also consider that it makes no sense from a noise amelioration standpoint to increase artificially the number of occasions when early morning arrivals overfly the more heavily populated areas of London by maintaining the 5 knot westerly preference at times when there are few or no take-offs.
<P>

<a name="91123w02.html_para11">We have decided not to take forward the options set out in the consultation paper, which would have precluded the introduction of runway alternation at night during easterly operations, and which would have concentrated arrivals noise in areas under the approach track to the southern runway during easterly operations. While these options offered the greatest potential for improvement over the present position in terms of the numbers of 



<P>
<P><I>23 Nov 1999 : Column: 65W</I><P>
people affected, the outcome would not have been fair and equitable. For the same reason we have decided not to take forward the 5 knot easterly preference option, except as part of Proposal B below. Therefore, we will be inviting comments on two proposals. These are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) to suspend westerly preference at night after the last departure (including any delayed departures) until the first departure the next morning, but not later than 6.00 a.m.; this is expected to result in approximately 64 per cent. westerly operations and 36 per cent. easterly operations over the longer term;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) for the same period of the night, to put in place a fixed weekly rotation between westerly and easterly operations by applying a 5 knot preference, subject to overriding weather conditions; this is expected to result in approximately 53 per cent. westerly operations and 47 per cent. easterly operations over the longer term.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<P>

<a name="91123w02.html_para12">The Government are ready to proceed with either proposal. Full details will be set out in a DETR consultation paper to be issued today. A copy will be placed in the Library of the House. This further consultation will allow respondents to take into account the Government's decision on 10 June 1999 not to ban night flights.

<P>

<a name="91123w03.html_para0">I am delighted to say that the Conference adopted a Resolution, submitted by the United Kingdom, addressing the problem of by-catch of migratory species, particularly from longline fishing. The Resolution requires all Parties, as a matter of gravity, to strengthen the measures to minimise the incidental mortality of migratory species in fisheries under their control. The Resolution specifically refers to the threats which turtles, seabirds and dolphins face from fisheries by-catch. As well as action by sovereign states, the Resolution also seeks co-operation with the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations to protect these endangered species.

This complements &#163;26 million of other projects dealing with sexual health issues, TB and safe motherhood.

Initial UK emergency assistance of $1 million was distributed through humanitarian agencies, and assistance has been provided through the Small Grants Scheme for members of the Devon Fire and Rescue Service to work to improve the capabilities of their counterparts in Armenia.

<P>

<a name="91123w05.html_para4">The provisions of the 1951 Act, together with the Protection of Animals Act 1911, under which it is an offence to cause any domestic or captive animal unnecessary suffering, provide adequate protection for animals in pet shops.

<a name="91123w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 We have accepted that Section 5 (5) of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, as amended in September 1998, does not allow licensing of the Lethal Dose 50 (LD50) test for the purpose of meeting international regulatory requirements. The general principle is that a test will be licensed only where there is not a scientifically valid and reasonably practicable and accepted alternative.

<a name="91123w05.html_para5">One licence, issued since September 1998, has been varied. This was the point at which changes on the face of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 became effective. Authorities to use the LD50 test on a project due to expire in 2004 have been withdrawn, but alternative tests (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines 420, 423 or 425) are likely to be used instead. A total of 467 rats have been used under this licence and an earlier one for the same purpose, which it succeeded.
<P>

<a name="91123w05.html_para6">We have undertaken to review relevant licences issued before September 1998. All project licences authorising acute toxicity testing using protocols based upon OECD Guideline 401 will be reviewed and amended to prohibit the use of the protocols where suitable alternative methods are available. Amendments will be subject to the standard processes of representation. We accept there may be cases where no exact alternative is available and Guideline 401 (the LD50 test) can be lawfully licensed.
<P>

<a name="91123w05.html_para7">The review should be completed by mid-December 1999 on approximately 50 existing licences, issued before 5 September 1998. It has not, at this stage, been possible to make an assessment of the expiry dates of those licences or the number of animals affected.
<P>

<a name="91123w05.html_para8">Information relating to the numbers of animals used in LD50 tests each year is not available. Changes to data collection introduced in January 1999--for reporting in 2000--will separately identify different forms of acute toxicity tests.

<a name="91123w05.html_para9">We are pressing the European Commission to follow our lead in interpreting Article 7 of European Directive 86/609/European Economic Community.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department for what reasons the policy as to whether or not to disclose information has been changed from one based on substantial harm to one based on prejudice to the effective conduct of public affairs.  [99124]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91123w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Freedom of Information Bill translates the policy proposals contained in the White Paper, 'Your Right to Know', into legislation. It is necessary in the Bill to express the Government's intentions in language that is clear to those who are affected as well as the courts. The Government have therefore used in most cases a test of prejudice, as this test has been used in similar legislation such as the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Local Government Act 1972 and is well understood by the courts and practitioners. The

<P>
<P>
<a name="91123w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Nothing in the Freedom of Information Bill prevents the disclosure of information by public authorities if it is otherwise lawful. However, I am satisfied some information should be exempt from the statutory right to know where issues of privacy or confidentiality apply, where the effective conduct of public affairs is at issue or where prejudice would, or would be likely to occur to a specified interest.
<P>

<a name="91123w05.html_para10">In some cases, it is right that an exemption should apply in all circumstances. However, the Freedom of Information Bill provides that, in most cases, the public authority should further consider whether the public interest in disclosure outweighs the public interest in maintaining the exemption in question. In this way, the greater amount of openness can be delivered consistent with effective Government.

 We estimate that in 1998-99 around four per cent. of students with a dependent child received help with child care costs from the FE Access Fund or from the Further Education Funding Council tariff scheme, which provided approximately 18,000 students with free child care. In 1999-2000 the FE Access Fund will be increased almost four-fold to &#163;36 million and the FEFC direct child care support will be boosted by an additional &#163;5 million.

 As bodies receiving public funding, universities must ensure that they operate in a manner which adheres to the Human Rights Act 1998.

The Government and the Higher Education Funding Council for England, do not, at present, have any plans to investigate this issue.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91123w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 The Budget for 1998-99 would have provided an increase of just &#163;182 million for schools--a 1.5 per cent. cut in real terms. As a result of early action by this Administration, that increase was raised to over &#163;1 billion--an increase of 5.6 per cent., or 3 per cent. in real terms. In doing so we averted the potential loss of an estimated 15,000 teachers between 1997-98 and 1998-99 and saw teacher numbers rise by 4,000. This meant that instead of the pupil:teacher ratio worsening from 18.9 to an estimated 19.5, it improved to 18.8.
<P>

<a name="91123w06.html_para0">In addition, we introduced the New Deal for Schools, providing an extra &#163;1.1 billion for repair of school buildings. Between 1998-99 and 2001-02 we are doubling capital spending in schools.
<P>

<a name="91123w06.html_para1">The Comprehensive Spending Review, announced in July 1998, meant an extra &#163;16 billion for education in England over the three years from 1999-2000. By the end of the Parliament, we will be spending 17 per cent. more in real terms on education than in 1997-98. In the first two budgets of this Government, spending per pupil has increased in real terms by &#163;80 and by 2001-02 it will have increased by &#163;220. The 1997-98 budget was decided and allocated before May 1997 and is the responsibility of the previous administration.

 We strongly support G7 and EU efforts to improve nuclear safety in Central and Eastern Europe. Within the EU, the Commission is leading the negotiations with the Bulgarian Government over closure dates for units 1-4 at Kozloduy nuclear power plant, as part of the wider EU enlargement process. Our Ambassador in Sofia has encouraged the Bulgarians to work with the Commission on a realistic timetable for closure of units 1-4, in line with Bulgaria's international commitments, including its Accession Partnership within the EU. We strongly support the Commission's efforts to secure an agreement with the Bulgarians on this issue.

They discussed progress on follow up to the Cologne Declaration on strengthening the common European policy on security and defence in preparation for the Helsinki European Council. They considered the need for improvements to European military capabilities, including through the setting of targets for European forces capable of being deployed at short notice, and also the need for new structures within the

<BR>
<i>(B) Common Strategies</i>
<BR>
Ministers were briefed by the Presidency on the implementation of the Common Strategy on Russia and on preparation of further Common Strategies commissioned by the Vienna European Council.

<BR>
2. The Commission proposed maintaining the volume of the next European Development Fund (EDF 9) at the same level as the previous one in real terms. The Secretary of State for International Development, representing the United Kingdom, called for a more realistic assessment of needs to form the basis of discussion on replenishing the EDF. The Council will come back to this at the General Affairs Council on 6 December.
<BR>
Bananas
<BR>
3. The Commission presented its proposal for a new banana regime. The Council took note and referred the proposals to the relevant Council bodies for detailed examination.

<BR>
Northern Caucasus/Chechnya
<BR>
6. The Council expressed its deep concern over the continuing military campaign in Chechnya. It called on Russia to observe its commitments under international humanitarian law to avoid civilian casualties and to keep the Chechen-Ingush border open in order to ensure access to safety for IDPs. The Council strongly urged the Russian Government to seek a negotiated settlement and to use the good offices of the OSCE.
<BR>
Pakistan
<BR>
7. The Council discussed developments in Pakistan following the 12 October military coup. Ministers reiterated the EU's call for a speedy restoration of democratic civilian rule and urged the military to produce a timetable for this, with clear benchmarks for progress. The Council called for Nawaz Sharif to have a fair and open trial, and for Pakistan to sign and ratify the CTBT.
<BR>
Western Balkans
<BR>
8. The Council underlined its continued support for the Serbian people through humanitarian aid, help to democratic political forces and independent media organisations, and preparation for the reconstruction and international re-integration of a democratic Serbia. The EU will also continue to support the democratically elected government of President Djukanovic in Montenegro, including through technical advice and reconstruction aid.

The Council emphasised that Croatia should cooperate fully with ICTY, and can expect active support for a closer and deeper relationship with the EU only if it is willing to take the necessary steps. The EU also welcomed the constitutionality of the recent change in government in Albania, and called on Albania to pursue the priorities of democratisation and the fight against corruption.
<BR>
Indonesia
<BR>
12. The Council reviewed recent events in Indonesia and welcomed the establishment of a new broadly based Indonesian government. Foreign Ministers looked forward to working closely with Indonesia on a wide range of issues.

<BR>
AOB: Death Penalty
<BR>
14. The Council reaffirmed the importance of a common approach to the question of the death penalty, under consideration at the General Assembly in New York.

 <i>[holding answers 22 November 1999]:</i> We are determined to improve the prevention, detection and treatment of prostate cancer. The White Paper, 'Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation', which was published in July proposed a target to reduce the death rate from cancer in those under 75 by 20 per cent. by 2010 saving 100,000 lives.

<a name="91123w11.html_para4">We have already announced that by December 2000 all urgent general practitioner referrals of suspected prostate cancer should be seen by a consultant within two weeks of referral.

<P>

<a name="91123w11.html_para5">The Department provides information for the public, in leaflets and through health education campaigns. These encourage people to report to their GP or other health professional any persistent unusual symptoms which may indicate cancer or other disease. For example, the 'Europe Against Cancer' theme for 1998 was 'Cancer in Men' and a related leaflet included advice about symptoms that <i>may</i> indicate prostate cancer, including a change in urinary habits.

No formal minutes are taken by my officials, and the meetings provide an opportunity for the Association to discuss informally a broad range of procedural issues, principally matters relating to the introduction of the ELATE computer-based application

The meetings are not intended to serve as a forum for the discussion of Government policy with respect to the export of particular goods or exports to particular destinations and there has not been any discussion of the ban on the export of leg irons and other equipment that has been used in torture announced by my right hon.

 I consider each merger case on its own merits. I refer a case to the Competition Commission when I consider that there are sufficient competition or other public interest concerns to warrant such a reference. In those few cases where I have come to a different conclusion than that recommended by the Director General of Fair Trading, I have given reasons in the Press Notice announcing my decisions.

 The Office of Fair Trading does not make rulings on merger cases but provides advice.

It is the function of the Director General of Fair Trading to give Ministers advice. The decision as to whether to refer is for Ministers.
