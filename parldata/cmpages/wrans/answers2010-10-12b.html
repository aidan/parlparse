<i> [holding answer 11 October 2010]:</i> Decisions about the salaries of local authority chief executives and senior officers, and any early retirement payments which either fall within the appropriate pay negotiating machinery, or the appropriate regulatory framework are matters for each local authority employer to consider in the light of local circumstances. While the specific terms and conditions of current and future employment is a matter for the relevant local authority to consider, the Secretary of State has recently called for the most senior local government officers to take a voluntary reduction in pay and also stated that no new council chief executive should be paid more than the Prime Minister.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_402"><a name="101012w0001.htm_para0"><a name="10101250000028">The Government's view is that there needs to be greater local democratic accountability and transparency over senior remuneration arrangements and policies within local government. In order to achieve this, the Government intend to bring forward proposals to ensure that councillors are better able to be held to account for their decisions on senior pay by providing them with the power to vote on their council's remuneration policies. On senior pay transparency, the Local Government Association (LGA) recently published draft guidance to support councils in publishing their senior salary information online. The guidance was published on 1 October and can be viewed and commented on at:</p>

 Providing customers with information about their supplier's cheapest tariff is about giving them the information they need to take control of household energy costs. We are working on the details of this proposal, but we are clear that cheapest tariff information needs to be presented in a straightforward and meaningful way to consumers.</p>

 Since the establishment of the coalition Government, we have been looking at several aspects of the feed-in tariff scheme, including the treatment of installations commissioned before the announcement of the scheme. After careful consideration, we have concluded that the scheme as it relates to these early adopters should remain unchanged. Generators who had installed before 15 July 2009 will not be eligible for the full rate of FITs, but those that benefited from the renewables obligation will continue to be supported at an equivalent rate.</p>

The spending review is being run in an open, responsible and fair way that protects the poorest and most vulnerable in our society. We have consulted broadly with the public over the summer through the Spending Challenge. This has meant engaging and involving the whole country in the difficult decisions that will have to be taken.</p>

Database (GPRD) to ensure there is no conflict of interest. The GPRD is run by its own dedicated team who have no involvement with any regulatory work of the MHRA, and none of the MHRA regulatory staff have access to the administration of the GPRD. The GPRD Group reports into a non-regulatory Division of the MHRA, the Information Management Division. The GPRD group maintains its own separate management accounts. GPRD and MHRA data are kept on separate physical servers, accessed through separate logical domains. As a result of this separation of functions the Agency is confident that no conflict of interest exists.</p>

At that time the MCA took a decision to invest in the GPRD to develop it as a resource for medical and health research purposes undertaken in the public interest. This was an investment, not an 'initial funding loan' requiring repayment.</p>

It is essential that any future skills system gives a respected, credible vocational training offer that will provide people with a route into employment and help them progress in their careers. The new strategy, to be published after the spending review, will take account of views on how we can best achieve that.</p>

<i> Guide to Quality</i>:<br>
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV60 - for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5% we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220.<br>
<i> Key:</i><br>
* 0 = CV&lt;5%-Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered precise<br>
** 5 = CV &lt;10%-Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered reasonably precise<br>
*** 10 = CV &lt;20%-Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered acceptable<br>
**** CV ? 20%-Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered too unreliable for practical purposes<br>
CV = Coefficient of Variation<br>
<i> Note:</i><br>
It should be noted that the above estimates exclude people in most types of communal establishment (e.g. hotels, boarding houses, hostels, mobile home sites etc.).<br>

 The Government have been at the forefront of international support for the efforts of the Heart of Borneo project. Our missions in Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia have actively worked with their hosts to help turn the Declaration into co-ordinated action plans, and with non-governmental organisations and businesses (including Shell, HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank) to build public support for the initiative. Our work has focused on how management of the rainforest, and associated life science research, presents all three countries with ways to align their economies with the global trend towards high-tech/low-carbon.</p>

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) signed a contract with Cable and Wireless Worldwide on 13 September 2010 for the provision of global telephony, data and video conferencing services. The Echo programme is a framework agreement for a period of 5.5 years, against which the FCO and its partners (UK Border Agency (UKBA) and the Department for International Development) can call off services as required. The current expectation is that the FCO and UKBA will together call off £82 million for services over 5.5 years. This framework contract will provide faster, cheaper and more reliable video conferencing, telephony and internet. The contract will save the tax payer up to £90 million, and will reduce flights, travel and carbon emissions through the increased use of video conferencing.</p>

 In both 2008-09 and 2009-10, £6.1 million was originally allocated to the Human Rights and Democracy Strategic Programme Fund. These allocations were revised to £5.59 million in 2008-09, following an internal transfer to another Foreign and Commonwealth Office programme supporting human rights projects, and to £5.81 million in 2009-10 as a result of in year budget cuts.</p>
