that referrals to such services are not diverted via ear, nose and
throat departments (which are covered by 18 weeks) to benefit from the

costs and other direct costs. Showing full costs as the default would
result in this functionality not being used by the majority of

(CVO) is that we should not vaccinate poultry in advance of an avian
influenza outbreak, or as an immediate disease control response.
Although currently available vaccines are able to reduce mortality, it
is possible that some vaccinated birds would still be capable of
transmitting the disease if they become infected, but might not display
symptoms of disease. This would increase the time taken to detect and
eradicate the virus. High standards of surveillance and biosecurity,
early reporting of suspect cases and culling remain the most effective
ways of preventing avian influenza and tackling an outbreak.</p><br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 282W</b><br><p><a name="06071921000351">However, as I informed the House
on 11 July, in order to be fully prepared we have invited tenders to
supply us with a further 10 million doses of avian influenza vaccine
for potential use in poultry and other captive birds. This is not a
change in policy. The CVO has recommended this step as part of sensible
contingency planning in the light of uncertainties about the future
spread and nature of the virus, and the possibility of as yet
unforeseen circumstances. The vaccine would only be used if a risk
assessment and scientific evidence indicated it would help to prevent
disease
spread.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06071921000031">Fisheries</h3><p><a name="06071921000352"><b><a name="06071921005175">Mr.

United Kingdom ranked 17<sup>(th)</sup> of the 25 member states of the EU
in terms of the share of electricity from renewable energy to gross
electricity consumption. In 1995 the UK ranked 19<sup>(th)</sup> and if
all countries meet their 2010 targets the UK will move up to
15<sup>(th)</sup>. It should be noted that the countries that rank
highest (Austria, Latvia and Sweden) have significant and well
developed hydro resources and plentiful supplies of biomass (mainly
wood).</p><p><a name="06071921001053">The
International Energy Agency (IEA) produces statistics that exclude
hydro generation from the renewables share of electricity production,
but this is available for only 19 of the 25 EU member states that are
also IEA members. On this basis the UK ranked 13<sup>(th)</sup> out of 19
in the latest available year (2003) with Denmark the highest ranking
because of its well-developed wind power
sector.</p><p><a name="06071921001054">The IEA also
produces statistics on the contribution of renewable sources to total
primary energy supply for the 19 EU member states. Here the UK ranked
17<sup>(th)</sup> out of 19 in
2003.</p><p><a name="06071921001055">In the spring

what plans he has to make representations to his Russian counterpart

[85088]</p><p><a name="06071921001065"><b><a name="06071921005250">Malcolm
Wicks:</b> The UK's gas import dependence is set to rise to
80-90 per cent. by 2020, of which a significant proportion is expected
to be imported from the European mainland through existing and planned
interconnection capacity. The International Energy Agency forecast that
the EU will import 25 per cent. of its gas needs from Russia by 2030.
It is, therefore, possible that some Russian gas will be imported into
the UK, albeit indirectly and commingled with gas from other sources
(such as Norway, the Netherlands and LNG from outside Europe) as part
of the European gas
system.</p><p><a name="06071921001066">The
contractual origin of imports into the UK is a decision for companies
operating in the UK's liberalised gas market, taking into account
elements such as cost, reliability, availability and the need for a
diverse range of sources to provide security of supply. Given that
there is no direct physical interconnection capacity with Russia and
contractual flows do not necessarily follow physical flows, estimates
of the type requested are not
made.</p><p><a name="06071921001067">Given that the
UK does not import directly from Russia, any impact on the UK from
Russia's legislation or compliance with international agreements such
as the Energy Charter Treaty will be felt most directly through its
effect on European markets. As such, the 
<br><notus-date day="18" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>18 July 2006 : Column 301W</b><br>UK will continue to press for open, competitive and liberalised European
energy markets.</p><p><a name="06071921001068">In the
short term, we expect the Russian gas export laws to have very little
real effect on European security of supply, as Gazprom's already holds
a defacto monopoly on exports by virtue of their network ownership.
Longer-term effects are unclear, however, should gas transit through
Russia become too commercially unattractive, Caspian and Central Asian
producers will begin to seek alternative supply routes for their
products to European and global
markets.</p><p><a name="06071921001069">The proposed
legislative changes surrounding Russia's subsoil law continue to be
subject to discussion in the Russian government. The DTI and FCO are in
contact with UK businesses involved in the Russian Energy market, in
order to remain updated on the impact that any final series of laws may
have.</p><p><a name="06071921001070">The UK, with
other EU member states, will continue to encourage Russia to liberalise
its domestic markets and provide fair and open access to its resources
and pipelines in order to foster further competition in energy supplies
into Europe and to ensure best use is made of its finite
resources.</p><p><a name="06071921001071">The UK,
with other G7 members, has encouraged Russia to move forward during its
G8 presidency and ratify the Energy Charter Treaty, of which it is
already a signatory and applies on a provisional basis. We would
envisage that these Global Energy Security discussions will continue
during the Russian presidency of the
G8.</p><p><a name="06071921001072">Russia has called
for the negotiations on the Transit Protocol to be completed before it
can ratify the full Treaty. Through the EU, we continue to work with
Russia towards an agreed text for the Transit Protocol while at the
same time emphasising to Russia the importance of open, transparent,
efficient and competitive markets at all stages of the energy supply
chain as the key to global energy
security..</p><p><a name="06071921001073">Whilst the
absence of ratification may bring some uncertainty to the rights of
both foreign and domestic investors, it is important to note that the
UK has a separate bi- lateral investment Treaty with Russia that
protects the investment of UK
firms.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06071921000060">Sir Alistair

the maximum time period between date of application and exit was
reduced from 18 months to 12. This effectively compressed 18 months of

has been changed to voluntary outflow (VO) although the methodology
remains the same.  2. VO is defined as all applications and

is provided to older people who do not find work quickly. New deal 50
plus is a voluntary programme that provides people with advice and
guidance from personal advisers, and access to in-work financial help
through the 50 plus element of the working tax credit. Since April
2000, the programme has been successful in helping more than 150,000
older workers into employment, including 200 people in Yeovil. Once in
work, new deal 50 plus customers can claim a training grant of up to
&#163;1,500 for training of which up to &#163;300 can be used for
life-long
learning.</p><p><a name="06071921003923">People aged
50 and over, including those in Yeovil, are also eligible for help from
new deal 25 plus. People who have been claiming jobseeker&#146;s
allowance (JSA) for 18 months and who have not previously participated
on new deal 25 plus, are already required to attend the gateway stage

training to help people return to work.</p><p><a name="06071921003924">Since April 2004, we have been
piloting mandatory participation in the New deal 25 plus IAP for people

included in the pilot which offered people in this age group more
extensive help back to work. Interim results are positive and, as
announced in our Welfare Reform Green Paper, we intend to commence a
phased national
rollout.</p><p><a name="06071921003925">Between 1979
and the mid 1990s, the number of people on incapacity benefits trebled.
Since then, growth in the caseload has since slowed significantly and,
in November 2005, there were 2.71 million people claiming incapacity
benefits, a fall of 61,000 over the year. 46 per cent. of those
claiming incapacity benefits are aged between 50 and state pension age
although, between 2000 and 2005, the number of people in this age group
fell by 52,000. This has contributed to the overall reduction in the
incapacity benefits case
load.</p><p><a name="06071921003926">We still clearly
have more work to do and, like other age groups, people aged 50 and

customers early support from skilled personal advisers and direct
access to a &#145;Choices Package&#146; of employment programmes
and clear financial incentives to make work pay. Any IB customer will
be able to access the support and help available on a voluntary basis.

this, the penalty notice for disorder scheme was brought into effect in

the police are able to issue persons committing specified minor
offences with a fixed penalty notice. No admission of guilt is required
and payment of the penalty discharges all liability for the offence. In
2004 25,591 penalty notices were issued in England for the offence of
being drunk and disorderly. Provisional data for 2005 shows that 34,238
penalty notices were issued in England for this offence. It is not

factors (although sentencing policy will rarely, if ever, be a directly
contributory factor to a death in an individual case). In addition, the
Prisons and Probation Ombudsman conducts his own independent inquiry
into any death of a young person in a young offender institution or a
secure training centre; and the Local Safeguarding Children&#146;s
Board is likely to commission a serious case review under Part 8 of the
joint Department for Education and Skills/Home Office/Department of
Health guidance Working Together to Safeguard Children (1999). Many of
the young people who become involved in serious or persistent offending
are at risk of self-harm, whether or not they are in custody. It is not
possible to quantify how many young people&#146;s health, including
mental health, has been positively assisted by care received while in
custody. There is no reason to believe that sentencing policy is
increasing the rate of mortality of young people under
18.</p>

Pearson:</b> Figures for the effect on energy consumption
within the UK by energy saving measures for this particular period are
not readily available. However, for the climate change programme
review, we prepared estimates of the effects on carbon emissions for
the household sector in the 1990s and separately for the present
decade.</p><p><a name="0607208000552">The Government
estimate that energy efficiency improvements in the household sector in
the 1990s would have contributed around 4.5 million tonnes of carbon
(MtC) of emissions reductions, that is, some 12 per cent. of 1990
emissions. At the same time, growth in demand for underlying energy
services&#151;warmer homes, hot water&#151;would have increased
emissions by 11.5 MtC; the increase in the use of gas for generating
electricity instead of coal in the 1990s, which reduced emissions from
power stations, and so reduced the associated emissions from
electricity use in homes, businesses, etc, would have decreased
emissions by 8 MtC; and smaller factors, mainly fuel switching by
householders and changes to external temperatures, would have
contributed a further 1 MtC of reductions. The overall effect on
emissions was a net reduction of around 2.5
MtC.</p><p><a name="0607208000553">In the present
decade, before the effects of policies are included, we estimate that
background energy efficiency would save a further 4.5 MtC. Increasing
demand for energy services, together with the effects of the other
factors described earlier, means that the net overall reduction in this
period would be approximately 0.3
MtC.</p><p><a name="0607208000554">The estimated
effect of all the energy efficiency policies for households set out in
the new UK climate change programme 2006, is an additional reduction of
4.8 MtC by 2010. Most of these savings are expected to be delivered
between 2005 and 2010, through tighter building regulations and further
activity under the energy efficiency
commitment.</p><p><a name="0607208000555">Data are
not available to conduct similar analyses for the industry and service
sectors, but the contribution of energy efficiency is expected to be
similar in percentage
terms.</p>

people (IDPs) in Eastern Burma. These are (with the latest available
numbers, from October 2005): (i) people in temporary settlements in
ceasefire areas administered by ethnic nationalities
(340,000); (ii) villagers who have been evicted by the Burmese
Government and moved into designated relocation sites (108,000); and
(iii) civilians hiding from the Burmese Army in areas most affected by
armed conflict
(92,000).</p><p><a name="0607208000941">The recent
military offensive against the Karen people has swelled the number of
civilians hiding in conflict areas by at least 15,000. DFID's approach
to providing emergency assistance to these IDPs has been to work
through local community groups inside Burma. This is a complementary
approach to the use of relief teams operating cross-border from
Thailand, and it enables access to IDPs who would not be reached by any
other means, and through a mechanism which is much less-well supported
by other donors. The development of civil society within the country is
also a fundamental step in a successful transition to
democracy.</p><p><a name="0607208000942">The number
of IDPs that we can reach from inside the country is limited. Access is
difficult, and the small local groups with whom we are working do not
currently have the capacity to deliver greater volumes of emergency
relief&#151;although we are working to strengthen their ability to do
more. Those delivering assistance to IDPs cross-border from Thailand
face similar challenges. Therefore, we recognise the importance of
maintaining co-ordination with all donors (both those delivering
assistance cross border, and those working inside the country) to
ensure that together we manage to reach as many IDPs as possible.
</p><p><a name="0607208000943">DFID also provides

the Government fully supports international efforts, particularly

democratic freedoms and full respect for human rights. The UK has
co-sponsored successive highly critical UN resolutions on Burma and
played a leading role in drafting the resolution most recently adopted
at the UN General Assembly in December 2005. This expressed grave
concern at the attacks by military forces in violation of cease-fire
agreements and called on the regime to end the systematic violations of
human rights, including enforced displacement.</p><p><a name="0607208000947">UN Security Council members last
discussed the situation in Burma on 16 December under 'Any Other
Business'. In this discussion, the UK highlighted the on-going human
rights abuses, the detention of political prisoners, internal conflicts
and the spread of HIV/AIDS and other diseases. Though there was no
consensus to issue a presidential statement or other formal report, the
discussions reflected the concern felt in many parts of the
international community over the regime's failure to make progress
towards democracy and to respect international human rights norms. At
present there is no agreement within the Security Council, including
among the permanent members, to add Burma to the Council's formal
agenda, but the UK, through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, will
continue to co-ordinate closely with the UN and partners in the
Security Council and the region in considering how best to maintain
pressure for positive change in Burma.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0607208000070">Child

services that respond to the broad health needs of the population, and
palliative care clearly has a vital place in this. DFID support is
largely directed at countries where the health spend is less than $10
per person per year and often far less, the public spend in the Congo
is $2, in Ethiopia $1.50 and in Burundi $0.70. Clearly these countries
are not able to deliver the range of services that they would wish and
realistically are unlikely to invest significant public budgets in
palliative care. We support countries to deliver their health
programmes and the priority interventions defined in their national
health plan. Increasingly we provide resources through various forms of
flexible budget
support.</p><p><a name="0607208000954">DFID officials
have met staff from the hospice community on a number of occasions,
most recently during a public consultation on a revised DFID health
strategy. Many committed groups lobby DFID to make greater efforts on
what they see as neglected areas in the international health response.
Recent communications have challenged DFID to do more on palliative
care, cancer services, neglected tropical diseases, blindness,
disability, malnutrition and non-communicable diseases. DFID accepts
that palliative care services need to be better reflected in national
health plans and budgets and that realistically support needs to be
provided through home based rather than institutional
settings.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0607208000072">Iraq</h3><p><a name="0607208000955"><b><a name="0607208004306">Mr.

challenges which long pre-date the 2003 conflict. In the early 1980s,
Iraq enjoyed some of the best healthcare in the Middle East. However,
by 2000, international health indicators for Iraq were comparable with
some of the poorest countries in Africa. Under-five mortality had
increased from 50 per 1,000 in 1990 to 133 in 2001. One in four
children under five were chronically malnourished. Hospitals, clinics
and water and sanitation plants suffered from chronic lack of
maintenance.</p><p><a name="0607208000957">DFID has
given most of its assistance to the Iraqi health sector through
financial contributions to international organisations that have
particular expertise in health. These contributions
include:</p><a name="0607208003952"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#163;5 million to the
World Health Organisation (WHO), which has helped to fund the delivery

the United Nations and World Bank multi-donor trust funds for Iraq.
These trust funds finance reconstruction in a number of areas including
health. The UN trust fund has approved 10 health and nutrition
projects, in total valued at $96 million. The World Bank trust fund
also has a $25 million health rehabilitation project which finances
priority emergency services, including basic medical equipment and

Hughes</b><i> [holding answer 18 July 2006]:</i> We have a
target for 2,500 schools to be providing a core offer of extended
services by September 2006. This includes access to a varied menu of
activities, parenting support, childcare 8am to 6pm, swift and easy
referral to specialist services and wider community access. Currently,
we have over 9,000 schools engaged with their local authority on the
extended schools agenda with a representative split of primary and
secondary schools. This is encouraging progress against our September
target. We do not currently have data on the total number of schools
operating extended hours broken down by borough or region. However, we
do have data from a baseline survey of maintained schools published in
September 2005. This survey showed that 61 per cent. of secondary
schools and 40 per cent. of primary schools offer childcare or
activities before school. The survey suggested that more schools
offered activities after school hours&#151;a total of 87 per cent. of
primary, and 95 per cent. of secondary schools. In future we will be
able to draw on data from the school census, which will include
information about the extended services that schools are
providing.</p><p><a name="0607208001200">This
Government have published guidance for schools and local authorities on
planning and funding extended schools, including charging for extended
opportunities, on 5 June 2006. It is intended to help schools plan and
fund their extended opportunities in ways that will best support
children, young people and their families; reflect local needs and
circumstances; and build on existing provision offered by the voluntary
and private
sectors.</p><p><a name="0607208001201">The guidance
includes advice on what schools may and may not legally charge for. It
describes some typical extended activities and how they might be
funded. The guidance emphasises the need for schools to ensure free
access to extended activities for the most disadvantaged children and
young people.</p><br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 460W</b><br><h3 align="center"><a name="0607208000079">Institutes of

permanence for the child as early as possible. If a couple in an
enduring partnership can demonstrate that they can provide a child with
a secure and happy home, where that child can thrive and be cared for
into adulthood and beyond, the law should at least allow the couple to
be assessed.</p><p><a name="0607208001444">I am aware

them to address these, assess &#145;job-readiness&#146; and assist

innovative health rehabilitation programmes with a work focus, to help

the potential impacts on the client group in rural areas. It is
recognised that the costs of attending mandatory interviews are likely
to be greater for those living in rural areas so travel costs are paid

Northern Ireland Housing Executive also annually publishes a report on
the Northern Ireland Housing Market&#151;&#147;Review and
Perspectives&#148;. The report covering the period 2006-09 which
provides a range of housing statistics and analysis was published in
February 2006. A copy is available on its website at www.nihe.gov.uk
and can be found under the Publications/Reports/ Housing Market
Reviews. I will arrange to have a copy placed in the
Library.</p><p><a name="0607208001591">The review
indicates that since 1979 the Housing Executive has sold more than
110,000 dwellings to sitting tenants accounting for almost a quarter
(24 per cent.) of the owner occupied sector and 16 per cent. of the
housing market as a whole. The 2001 House Condition Survey provided the
first reliable estimate of what proportion of these had been resold on
the open market. In March 2001, some 94,000 dwellings had been sold and
approximately 18,000 (19 per cent.) of these had been resold on the
open market: two thirds to new owner occupiers and the remaining
one-third to private landlords, reflecting the fact that they generally
provide a good source of high quality affordable homes, particularly
for first time buyers and landlords who see them as a sound investment.
Between 2000 and 2004 the annual house sales figure remained at over
5,000 but in 2004-05 the number of dwellings sold fell by 24 per cent.
to 3,135. The reduction reflected the introduction of major revisions
to the House Sales Scheme and it is envisaged that house sales will
remain at between 2,500 and 3,000 over the next three year period.
Annual research carried out by the University of Ulster in relation to
sold Housing Executive dwellings confirms that they continue to perform
well on the open
market.</p><p><a name="0607208001592">The
co-ownership shared equity scheme remains the Department's main measure
for providing assistance to first time buyers experiencing
affordability problems. The scheme has been very successful assisting
over 19,000 households since 1978. In recognition of this 
<br><notus-date day="19" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>19 July 2006 : Column 474W</b><br>success, Government increased their funding by &#163;23 million over
the 3 year period to 2008 to provide almost &#163;39 million and this
will help support around 2,400 applicants over this period. A series of
changes to the scheme have also just been introduced to make it more
accessible for people on lower incomes: the basis of calculation of the
co-ownership rental charge will reduce from 3.5 per cent. to 2.75 per
cent. As a result a typical co-ownership home buyer with a
&#163;100,000 property on a 50:50 basis will see their monthly rental
reduce from &#163;160 to &#163;126. The professional fees
associated with buying a home through co-ownership are also being
reduced from &#163;400 to
&#163;250.</p><p><a name="0607208001593">Given the
sharp increase in house prices, the value limits that apply to
properties eligible for purchase through co-ownership have been
reviewed. The limit for the greater Belfast and Derry city council
areas has increased from &#163;115,000 to &#163;135,000 and from
&#163;102,500 to &#163;115,000
elsewhere.</p><p><a name="0607208001594">The
Department has also been examining recent initiatives which were
introduced to address affordability in rest of the UK. The Chancellor,
in his last budget, announced an increase in the stamp duty threshold
to &#163;125,000, and this will specifically assist first time
buyers.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0607208000098">Illegal

However, we regularly raise such matters with the Government of Brazil,

partners.</p><p><a name="0607208001865">Recently, at
the Human Rights Council, my right hon. Friend the Minister of State
for Trade, Investment and Foreign Affairs discussed with Paulo
Vannuchi, Brazilian State Secretary for Human Rights, ways in which our
countries could deepen co-operation. In April, on his visit to Brazil,
my noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign
and Commonwealth Affairs, Lord Triesman of Tottenham, also raised human
rights with Paulo Vannuchi and agreed that the protection of human
rights defenders was one of the key areas in which Brazil and the UK
could
co-operate.</p><p><a name="0607208001866">Animal
health is an issue taken seriously by the UK and the EU. In August last
year, the European Commission&#146;s Food and Veterinary Office sent
an inspection mission to Brazil. The findings were discussed in the
Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health in Brussels and
the committee was satisfied that no additional restrictions on imports
were justified at that
stage.</p><p><a name="0607208001867">The
UK has initiated a high-level dialogue on sustainable development with
the Brazilian Government to promote action on sustainable development
challenges&#151;including deforestation, whether it is caused by soya
production or cattle farming. The Government actively supports efforts
in Brazil to promote agricultural practices that reduce environmental
impact and levels of deforestation. For example, the UK, through the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office&#146;s Global Opportunities Fund, is
supporting an Amazon Deforestation Soya Certification Project which
aims to combat deforestation by developing and implementing independent
certification scheme for &#147;forest-friendly&#148;
soya.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0607208000127">Burma</h3><p><a name="0607208001868"><b><a name="0607208004442">Mr.

partners, to help the Government of Colombia tackle the scourge of drug
production and drug trafficking which have such a devastating impact on
many thousands of innocent Colombians. Clearly, we also have a strong
interest in helping Colombia fight the illegal drugs trade, not least
because an estimated 80 per cent. of the cocaine coming into Britain
originates from Colombia. All the three major illegal armed groups in
Colombia have been proven to be actively involved in the illegal drugs
trade which fuels the internal armed conflict in the country,
undermines political stability and contributes to human rights abuses.
Furthermore, the vast international income from cocaine leads to
extensive money laundering. Corruption and intimidation backed up by
violence is rife in
Colombia.</p><p><a name="0607208001881">With
international assistance, Colombia is taking great steps towards
tackling the international trade in drugs and other associated crimes.

confiscate assets, and tackles the interconnected problems of violence,
social and economic inequality, and abuse of human

Those with children also have a legal obligation as parents to ensure
that their children receive full-time education from the age of five
years. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) therefore helps staff
meet these potentially conflicting obligations in two
circumstances:</p><p><a name="0607208001897">Children
who accompany their parents on postings overseas are expected to use
free state schooling if it is available locally and is of a suitable
standard. At posts where no suitable schooling is available

to enable children to receive the level of education to which they
would be entitled in the
UK.</p><p><a name="0607208001898">Staff are liable to
move at regular intervals, every 12-48 months, often to locations where
schools offering English language education are unavailable or
inadequate. Providing continuity of education can therefore pose real
problems, particularly during the important examination years. The FCO
therefore provides an accountable allowance to enable children to board

Trade and Industry, the Medical Research Council, the Biotechnology and

other governments in capitals and in New York and received a range of
views in response. These discussions were held in confidence. We do not

Hoon:</b> The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) consults
the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names (PCGN) on issues
concerning foreign geographical names. The PCGN is an interdepartmental
body, whose principal function is to advise the Government on policies
and procedures for the proper writing of geographical names for places
and features outside the United Kingdom, excluding those of the
Antarctic. The final decision on the appropriate name to use, however,
rests with the lead section on geographical names within the
FCO.</p><p><a name="0607208002074">The policy for the
application of geographical names is to follow the practice of the
supreme administering authority of the country concerned. It is the
FCO&#146;s policy to recognise changes of geographical name where
these fall within the sovereign competence of a particular foreign
government. For example, in India the name change from Madras to
Chennai has been made according to due processes within the Government
of India and requires appropriate acknowledgement within the FCO. The
name Madras would therefore now be considered a former name for this
city, in the same way that Salisbury is a former name for
Harare.</p><p><a name="0607208002075">However, there
will be a number of occasions where a geographical name within the
sovereign competence of a particular foreign government is already
known in a traditional form in the English language and it would not be
unusual for this form to be used within the FCO for ease of
recognition. For example, the Burmese geographical name Yangon has long
been known in the English language as Rangoon, and that form continues
to be acceptable today. However, the use of English-language terms can
also alter over time. This could be considered to have occurred in the
case of Beijing, where the name Peking is today rarely encountered as
the English-language
name.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0607208000140">North

Watson:</b> We are working closely with the Department for
Committees and Local Government to enable service personnel to qualify
under the &#147;local connection&#148; provisions of the Housing
Act 1996, in order to overcome the barriers common to both servicemen
and their civilian counterparts in access to affordable or social
housing. The Joint Service Housing Advice Office offers advice and
information about mortgages and affordable home ownership solutions
including shared equity schemes. For those single personnel in danger
of homelessness, it can facilitate access to temporary

success of Service leavers who use the career transition partnership as
part of their resettlement preparation in securing employment after
discharge&#151;over 50 per cent. within one month of discharge,
rising to over 95 per cent. six-months after departure&#151;suggests
that there are few barriers to employment of most service personnel.
Coaching provided by the Partnership often gives service leavers a
competitive edge over other candidates and many of the personal
attributes inherent in service culture are highly prized by civilian
employers.</p><p><a name="0607208002157">The Career
Transition Partnership has an effective marketing arm that carefully
targets prospective employers who can offer quality jobs to service
leavers. Its marketing strategy includes dispelling negative
misconceptions about service personnel and their ability to adapt to
the civilian workplace. Employers who engage service leavers are seldom
disappointed and tend to seek more when vacancies
arise.</p><p><a name="0607208002158">Individuals who
depart under early service leaver arrangements may face more of a
challenge. Those that discharge from recruit and basic professional
training establishments before completing courses of instruction are
unlikely to have gained the transferable competencies and professional
qualifications of those service personnel who have entered productive
military service. They therefore are more likely to have to contend
with the same barriers to employment as confront civilians with a
comparable lack of marketable skills. However, on discharge all

Flint:</b> The Department recognises the key role that
effective pharmacotherapies, including substitute opiate prescribing
and medications such as naltrexone to assist relapse prevention, may
play in the management of opiate dependence. The Department published
its evidence-based Clinical Guidelines, &#147;Drug misuse and
dependence&#151;guidelines on clinical management&#148;, in 1999,
on the advice of an independent expert group and in conjunction with
relevant professional bodies. The 1999 Clinical Guidelines address the
use of methadone, buprenorphine (more recently with a marketing
authorisation for use as Subutex) and naltrexone. The guidelines
discusses the relative effectiveness of buprenorphine and methadone,
but as naltrexone is licensed only for use to support relapse
prevention, no direct comparison is feasible with the opiate substitute
methadone and buprenorphine. The guidelines do support the use of all
these drugs as potentially effective opiate misuse treatments when used
appropriately. The Department&#146;s clinical guidelines are due to
be updated in 2006-07 and this will take into account-planned guidance
on the use of all these drugs due to be published in 2007 by the
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence
(NICE).</p><p><a name="0607208002273">The Department
of Health has asked NICE, within a package of work that they will be
undertaking on drug treatment, to carry out a technology appraisal on
oral methadone and sublingual buprenorphine as opiate substitute
treatments. This appraisal will evaluate the clinical effectiveness and
cost-effectiveness of these drugs as substitute opiates for the
management of opiate misusers. The Department also asked at the same
time for a similar technology appraisal for &#145;naltrexone as a
treatment for relapse prevention&#146; for opiate misuse. This will
include appraisal of its clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.
Both these technology appraisals are scheduled for publication in March
2007.</p><p><a name="0607208002274">All three of
these drugs are currently prescribed for management of opiate
dependence. Given that the NHS are obliged to implement guidance
produced by NICE, the outcome of their work on drug treatment will be
an important support in enhancing the effectiveness of drug treatment
and in particular substitute
prescribing.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0607208000166">Hospital-acquired

of the kind described is when new systems, paid for under the
programme, have replaced systems that local national health service
bodies have previously been paying for. Across the whole of the NHS,
and over the 10-year life of the national programme, these savings will
be very substantial. In the case of the local service provider
contracts, local savings are expected to offset nearly half the local
costs over the lives of the contracts; a saving of some &#163;2.5
billion.</p><p><a name="0607208002293">In the case of

Ryan</b><i> [holding answer 17 July 2006]</i>: The Identity
and Passport Service (IPS) is engaged in a range of initiatives
designed to enhance the security of the passport issuing process and
the UK passport itself. Because of the nature of fraud and the way in
which criminals operate in seeking to obtain passports illegally, IPS
takes a holistic approach to enhancing security. The initiatives which
are under way are therefore designed to ensure that each part of the
passport operation contributes to the security of the whole system and
ensures the integrity of the UK
passport.</p><p><a name="06072023000582">The IPS
corporate and business plan for 2006-16 which was published on 21 April
2006 describes these initiatives and sets out its strategic objectives
for fraud prevention. This programme of work
includes:-</p><a name="06072023001040"><ul><p class="tabletext">Introduction of more
secure passports incorporating biometrics identifiers. The first UK
e.Passport was issued on six March, and rollout to all customers should

sharing and the positive validation of passport data is critical to the
fight against fraud. The IPS has developed Omnibase which provides
secure web access to passport information for FCO consular posts
abroad, UK&#146;s Border Control authorities, The Driver Vehicle
Licensing Agency, Criminal Records Bureau and other Government
Departments. From July of this year, and building on successful pilots,
IPS plan to extend this passport validation service (PVS) to financial
institutions who receive passports as evidence of identity from
customers opening bank accounts, seeking mortgages or undertaking other
financial transactions. The pilots have already shown that PVS can
support users in the identification of suspicious passports and prevent
fraud.</p><p><a name="06072023000584">Finally,
supported by the powers in section 25 of the Identity Cards Act that
