 It is not possible to categorise goods and services purchased for energy efficiency reasons without incurring disproportionate costs. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has undertaken some measures for energy efficient reasons, such as upgrading lighting systems and lowering the office heating temperature.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="90619w0005.htm_para1"><a name="09061950000539">Other measures have sustainable benefits but were implemented in response to a range of drivers including health and safety and estate rationalisation, for example the installation of more efficient hand dryers and the demolition of energy inefficient modular cabins. Energy efficiency is monitored though the Environmental Management Plan which sets out the actions required to meet the Sustainable Operations in the Government Estate targets. Future energy efficiency measures include installing more water efficient fittings, introducing ground source heat pumps, and putting in smart metering. Sustainability is one of the considerations in the business case for developments on the FCO estate.</p>

A change during 2003-04 caused an artificial fall in that year in the number of injury reports coded to education and that affects the data series to 2006-07. A subsequent adjustment to the database from the start of 2007-08&#151;to bring about a closer alignment with data prior to 2003-04&#151;has introduced a further discontinuity. HSE statisticians are working to redress these known issues.</p>

</td></tr></tbody><tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="11"><i> Notes:</i><i> Ungrossed data</i> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).  <i> Finished admission episodes</i> A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.  This table does not provide a total number of cases of stroke since those dying before reaching hospital or not being admitted to hospital will not be counted. As well as this, anyone suffering from a stroke whilst already admitted to hospital will not be included in the count.  <i> Primary diagnosis</i><i> </i>The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.  <sup>(1)</sup> The following ICD-10 codes have been used:  160 Subarachnoid haemorrhage  161 Intracerebral haemorrhage  162 Other nontraumatic intracranial haemorrhage  163 Cerebral infarction  164 Stroke, not specified as haemorrhage or infarction  <i> Data quality</i><i> </i>HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.  <i> PCT7 strategic health authority (SHA) data quality</i>  PCT and SHA data was added to historic data years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.  <i> Assessing growth through time</i>  HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.  Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.  <i> Small numbers</i>  To protect patient confidentiality, figures between 1 and 5 have been suppressed and replaced with &#147;*&#148; (an asterisk). Where it was possible to identify numbers from the total due to a single suppressed number in a row or column, an additional number (the next smallest) has been suppressed.  <i> 2006-07 data</i>  There is a decline in 2006-07 compared to previous years. This is due to an error made by Milton Keynes PCT when submitting their data for this year. Their submission was split into two parts, but unfortunately the second submitted file for the year overwrote the first, giving approximately half as many records as there should have been. For this reason it is advised not to compare this year to other years.  <i> Source:</i>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), the NHS Information Centre for health and social care.<br>

 The National DNA Database (NDNAD) was established in 1995, when responsibility for the operational management of the NDNAD rested with the Forensic Science Service (FSS) on behalf of the police service. No central records of costs relating to the maintenance of the NDNAD are held prior to 2002, as cost data was incorporated in other costs incurred by the FSS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="90619w0008.htm_para2"><a name="09061950001008">In December 2005 the FSS was vested as a Government Owned Company and responsibility for the NDNAD transferred from the FSS to the Home Office. On 1 April 2007 responsibility for the NDNAD transferred from the Home Office to the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="90619w0008.htm_para3"><a name="09061950001009">The costs relating to the maintenance of the NDNAD from 2002-09 are given in the following tables. The costs from 2006-07 are higher than for previous years, because of the complete separation of costs from the FSS, and because the increase in the number of forensic suppliers requires additional resources for accreditation and continuous monitoring. In addition, the costs for 2008-09 include the costs of transferring the physical operation and maintenance of the NDNAD from the FSS to the NPIA (&#147;NDNAD Transition&#148;).</p>

Beyond this claimants will be able to access support through pathways to work voluntarily and will also be able to receive help from the new specialist disability employment programme, which is due to be launched in October 2010.

 The provision of medical evidence from a person's GP is required under current regulations. This evidence is gathered as part of the process for claiming incapacity benefit before a personal capability assessment takes place. Additionally, the Department's external medical provider regularly requests additional medical evidence from GPs according to the circumstances of the case. All the available evidence is taken into account by the decision maker in deciding whether or not a person is incapable of work and entitled to incapacity benefit.</p>

 The table shows the relevant expenditure (actual and planned) for the financial years 2007-08 to 2010-11 inclusive. Figures for 2007-08 represent actual expenditure as published in the Departmental Report, and those for 2008-09 represent estimated outturn, pending final audit&#151;actual expenditure will be published in the departmental report later this year. Estimates have not been made beyond the current spending review period, so no figures are available for years from 2011 to 2015.</p>
