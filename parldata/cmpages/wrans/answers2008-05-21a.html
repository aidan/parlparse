<i> [holding answer 12 May 2008]:</i> The methodology recommended in the &#147;New Approach To Appraisal&#148; (NATA) does not treat a decision by an individual to leave his or her vehicle at home and use public transport as a disbenefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_369"><a name="80521w0005.htm_para4"><a name="08052175001144">Instead, an assumption of appraisal is that a decision of this sort largely reflects the individual comparing the advantages and disadvantages of the form of transport they choose, in terms of journey time, journey costs and, in some circumstances, measures of other journey characteristics such as crowding, and judging there to be an overall &#145;benefit&#146; through changing from one mode to another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_370"><a name="80521w0005.htm_para5"><a name="08052175001145">However, costs and benefits under the NATA methodology are not assessed only from the view of the transport user as there may be further impacts on transport providers, the Government, wider society or the environment.

 In November 2006, my right hon. Friend the then Secretary of State announced a package of measures to further prevent and tackle youth homelessness. This included: a commitment that by 2010, no 16 or 17 year olds should be placed in bed and breakfast accommodation by a local authority under the homelessness legislation, except in an emergency; improving access to family mediation; and establishing supported lodgings schemes for young people across the country. Since then significant progress has been made:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_388"><a name="80521w0007.htm_para3"><a name="08052175001483">We have provided significant investment for homelessness prevention. This includes &#163;200 million homelessness grant funding for local authorities and the voluntary sector over the next three years. This represents the biggest ever cash injection for homelessness services. We are aware that some local authorities will use their grant to target schools making pupils aware of the impact of homelessness, For example, the London borough of Lambeth will be using some of their homelessness grant towards the establishment of an educational trust to develop their innovative, young people led homelessness prevention resource, entitled &#145;The Prodigals&#146; into a national preventative programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_389"><a name="80521w0007.htm_para4"><a name="08052175001484">We established the National Youth Homelessness scheme (NYHS) jointly led by Centrepoint and YMCA England.

<p><a name="stpa_390"><a name="80521w0007.htm_para5"><a name="08052175001485">Through this Department's specialist advisers on youth homelessness, NYHS has supported local authorities to achieve these reductions in homelessness acceptances amongst young people and the use of bed and breakfast accommodation via four workstreams: local authority strategy and partnership; homelessness prevention; accommodation and support pathways; and addressing wider needs.</p>

 On the basis of current prices the Department for International Development (DFID) anticipates that the total costs for the 20 million bed nets over the three-year period 2008-10 will be in the region of &#163;90 million. This estimate is based on a bed net cost of around &#163;2.50 and a further &#163;2 per net for costs of programme administration, distribution and delivery.

 We worked with City Strategy Pathfinders during 2007 to look at what further enabling measures could be put in place to help people into work; this included looking at whether any further changes needed to be made to enable benefit claimants to be able to study or train full-time. This work concluded that a wide range of flexibilities already existed to enable full-time study, for example those on long-term incapacity benefit and people in vulnerable groups claiming income support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_425"><a name="80521w0011.htm_para3"><a name="08052184000097">In our joint report with DIUS, &#147;Opportunity, Employment and Progression&#148;, published on 26 November 2007, we indicated that we were removing the 16 hour rule in housing benefit for short term recipients of incapacity benefit and that we would consider whether it might be practicable to define limited exemptions from the &#145;16 hour rule&#146; for specific groups&#151;such as young people living in supported accommodation. We will report on progress on both of these in due course. We are also taking forward a proposal to allow more people on jobseeker&#146;s allowance to be able to access full-time, employment focused training for up to eight weeks by moving them onto a training allowance. We are planning to test a similar flexibility in a City Strategy Pathfinder area later this year and, learning the lessons from this, roll out nationally during the 2009-10 academic year. We are also looking at further ways of increasing access to full-time training for jobseeker&#146;s allowance claimants where this would help support their move into employment.</p>

 This information is not available. It could be obtained only by going through the files of every prisoner held in the open estate in the last 12 months, to do so would be at disproportionate cost. Prior to allocation to an open prison, prisoners are assessed to ensure that the level of risk that they present can be safely managed in open conditions. The assessment will take account of a range of factors including participation in activities such as offending behaviour and treatment programmes where appropriate. The risk assessment process for open conditions is stringent&#151;and becoming more sophisticated at assessing risk. As a result, abscond rates are falling: (financial years) 2003-04&#151;1,310; 2004-05&#151;877; 2005-06&#151;709; 2006-07&#151;555; 2007-08&#151;561 (annualised projection). Over 95 per cent. of those who have absconded are returned to custody.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_482"><a name="80521w0015.htm_para1"><a name="08052191000110">However, some programmes are also delivered in open prisons. There have been open prisons since 1936 and they are the most effective means of ensuring prisoners are tested in the community before they are released. To release prisoners directly from a closed prison without the resettlement benefits of the open estate would undoubtedly lead to higher levels of post-release re-offending.</p>

During the same period 1,256 lasting powers of attorney were registered by the Public Guardian. Currently we do not have figures for the total number of LPAs that were rejected during this period as the bulk of the 9,623 applications will still be progressing through the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_486"><a name="80521w0015.htm_para5"><a name="08052191000191">The OPG will only reject an application if it contains material errors that are not capable of correction.

<p><a name="stpa_487"><a name="80521w0015.htm_para6"><a name="08052191000192">The OPG recently carried out a sampling exercise that suggested around 40 per cent. of applications are valid on receipt and can be registered once the statutory waiting period has expired, around 30 per cent. of applications can be registered once further information has been provided and around 30 per cent. cannot be registered at all due to material errors in the application. In January the OPG also identified the main reasons currently why an LPA cannot be registered and made this information available on its website.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_488"><a name="80521w0015.htm_para7"><a name="08052191000193">A decision was also taken that where a fresh application was necessary and the invalid application was received prior to January the OPG would not charge an additional fee for registration. However, where a new application is required for invalid applications received after January an additional fee will be payable. Where all that is required is additional information, or where errors can be corrected without a fresh application being necessary, no additional fee is payable regardless of when the application was made.</p>

Although there are positive aspects to this&#151;for example it appears large numbers of people are planning ahead by making a new lasting power of attorney&#151;the high volumes have meant a dip in performance levels. Additional resources have been made available to manage the higher than anticipated workloads and these have been deployed across the organisation and in particular into the team that register powers of attorney. However it will inevitably take some time before the additional resources take full effect.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 24 April 2008]: </i>In July 2006, the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), the Association of Police Authorities (APA) and the Home Office jointly published the Information Systems Strategy for the Police Service (ISS4PS). The strategy advises police forces and their authorities, as well as organisations that deliver national projects and services to the police service, to use the ISS4PS as a reference framework to plan information and communications technology services. This includes the development and implementation of systems in accordance with agreed standards, including those for software.</p>

The responsibility for the management, and use of information within the police service, rests with the chief officer of the police force that owns the information. The Management of Police Information (MoPI) Statutory Code of Practice issued to forces in November 2005 sets out the key principles and processes for the management of police information. Guidance was issued on behalf of the Association of Chief Police Officers in 2006 to accompany the Code and the NPIA is helping forces implement that guidance in all forces by 2010 as part of the IMPACT programme.</p>
