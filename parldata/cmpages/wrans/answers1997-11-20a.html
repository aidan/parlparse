To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will provide funds to support a memorial to commemorate allied service men who, while prisoners of war, died during the construction of the Burma railway; and if he will make a statement. [14490]<P>

<P>
<a name="71120w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Government are very aware of the hardships and suffering endured by prisoners of war who were forced by their captors to build the Burma-Siam Railway during the Second World War.
<P>

<a name="71120w01.html_para0">While we have the greatest sympathy for those men and their families and acknowledge the need for remembrance and commemoration, it has been a long-standing policy of successive Governments that the cost of memorials is not usually met from public funds, but from private donations or public subscription.
<P>

<a name="71120w01.html_para1">The Ministry of Defence is, therefore, unable to assist with the funding of the memorial.
<P>

<a name="71120w01.html_para2">The organisers intend to site the memorial in Thailand and the Ministry of Defence would be happy to provide representation at any dedication ceremony, should the necessary funding be raised.

 My Department commissions research into a wide variety of what might be called genetic science applications, mainly in support of chemical and biological defence. Examples range from the use of gene probes to develop improved detection of biological warfare agents, to the use of genetic engineering for research into new vaccines. Most of this research is conducted at Porton Down, where an initial survey indicates that the number of genetic engineering projects undertaken since 1987 is as follows:

<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Borrow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the Army's engineer resources. [17550]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 My predecessor announced in August 1995 that the Army Engineer Resources Organisation, based at Long Marston in Warwickshire, would collocate with another Royal Engineers organisation--the Military Work Force--on a single site at Chilwell near Nottingham. A number of subsequent developments have led to a review of this decision.
<P>

<a name="71120w01.html_para4">In order to ensure that the Engineer Resources organisation was configured in the most efficient way for the transfer to Chilwell and subsequent Market Testing, a comprehensive business review of this organisation was carried out. This concluded that many of the Engineer tasks--notably storage, provisioning and repair--could be carried out more efficiently by other parts of the Army support organisation, for which they are core business.
<P>

<a name="71120w01.html_para5">In parallel, further work was undertaken on the Army's overall storage requirement. The Storage Rationalisation Study, about which we made a separate announcement on 13 November 1997, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>611</i>, concluded that the Army Base Storage and Distribution Agency had sufficient space to absorb the Engineer Resources storage task. In the light of this work, an investment appraisal has been carried out which has demonstrated that disaggregation of the Engineer Resources task is substantially more cost-effective by some 15 per cent. (approximately &#163;21 million over 25 years in net present value terms) than any option for collocation at Chilwell.
<P>

<a name="71120w01.html_para6">Obtaining greater efficiency from Defence spending is a central part of the Strategic Defence Review. All support activities are being rigorously scrutinised against the benchmark of value for money and the need to ensure that 



<P>
<P><I>20 Nov 1997 : Column: 245</I><P>
we retain only those assets which are essential for Defence needs. I have therefore accepted, as the basis for consultation, a recommendation to proceed with the disaggregation of the Engineer Resources tasks to other service providers. Long Marston will close by December 1999. Final decisions will be taken in the light of representations made during the consultation period. A copy of the consultative document is being placed in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w01.html_wqn5"><B> Ms Walley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will reduce the number of penalty points that result in disqualification; and if he will make a statement. [16344]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 There are no present plans to reduce the number of points which would result in disqualification. However, with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, I keep under review the number of points which may be imposed for individual offences.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w01.html_wqn6"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The Government have no plans to increase the penalties for poaching. Penalties were last amended by the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w01.html_wqn7"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what measures the Government will take to encourage and support Rural Watch and Farm Watch schemes. [16630]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Government recognise that, in rural areas, the police response to crime cannot always be as quick as they or the public would like and it is imperative that people take reasonable precautions against becoming victims of crime.
<P>

<a name="71120w01.html_para7">The most effective response to rural crime is a partnership approach between the police and local communities. We encourage schemes such as Farm Watch and Rural Watch which enable members of the public--with the support of the local police--to do something positive in the fight against crime.
<P>

<a name="71120w01.html_para8">In the Crime and Disorder Bill, we will introduce a new statutory duty for the police and local authorities jointly to analyse and identify local problems of crime and disorder and, together with the local community, draw up and implement strategies for tackling such problems. Schemes such as Farm Watch and Rural Watch will play a positive role in this partnership. The support of local communities will make a significant impact on crime in the countryside.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w01.html_wqn8"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what proposals the Government have to tackle rural crime. [16629]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Rural communities suffer from most of the same types of crime as, but have different needs from, urban communities. The most effective answer to rural crime is a partnership between the police and local communities.
<P>

<a name="71120w01.html_para9">The Crime and Disorder Bill will provide for new statutory duties for local authorities and the police jointly to analyse and identify local problems of crime and disorder. With input from local communities, a strategy will be drawn up and implemented to tackle those problems. This will apply in both rural and urban areas.
<P>

<a name="71120w01.html_para10">The partnership ideal is already evident in many rural communities, and the creation of many and diverse "Watch" schemes are testimony to the efficacy of this approach.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w01.html_wqn9"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will provide additional financial assistance to North Yorkshire Police for radio communications in remote areas. [16631]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 North Yorkshire Police Authority's spending capacity increased by &#163;2.8 million (4%) to &#163;72.4 million in 1997-98, which was an increase above the national average. The provisional police revenue settlement for 1998-99 is likely to be announced in December, along with capital funding allocations. Once the allocations have been made, it is entirely for individual chief constables and their police authorities to determine their spending priorities. This Government have undertaken to keep within the public expenditure limits we inherited from the previous Government and no allowance has been made for additional capital funding to be provided to North Yorkshire Police for radio communications in remote areas.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Beith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what <i>(a)</i> amount and <i>(b)</i> percentage of his Department's expenditure, in (i) the current and (ii) the next financial year, will be spent on crime prevention. [16540]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Home Office expenditure specifically allocated to crime prevention in 1997-98 is &#163;19.3 million. That figure is additional to &#163;7.2 billion public expenditure on the police service. The prevention of crime is one of the key functions of the police service and the Government are committed to encouraging a partnership approach to crime prevention.
<P>

<a name="71120w02.html_para0">It is not possible to identify the level of public expenditure on the police service or other programmes within the Home Office budget which is devoted to crime prevention. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a percentage of the overall budget devoted to crime prevention.

 <i>[holding answer 18 November 1997]:</i> There are no plans to contract out Prison Enterprise Services (which provides advice and support to prisons in managing their industrial and commercial activity) or to contract out industrial activity in other prisons.
<P>

<a name="71120w02.html_para2">My right hon. Friend and I have agreed to a partnership between Wackenhut United Kingdom and the Prison Service under which the company will manage the industrial work at Coldingley prison although the governor will be involved in decisions on major new lines of production and there will be a profit-sharing arrangement with the prison.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 I have no present plans to do so. I understand that approximately one third of straight- sided beer glasses in pubs are already made of toughened glass. The recommendation on 22 October by the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association that its members should use toughened glasses will very significantly increase their use. The Government will be monitoring developments closely.

[16985]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w02.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Declaration 11 to the Treaty of Amsterdam refers to the status of churches, religious associations and non-confessional organisations. It is non-binding and has no effect on national law.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the effect of the terms of the Treaty of Amsterdam on the death penalty in <i>(a)</i> the United Kingdom and <i>(b)</i> her dependencies. [17016]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Treaty of Amsterdam has no effect on the position in the United Kingdom or her dependencies so far as the death penalty is concerned. The policy of the Government remains that it is for Parliament to decide on the reintroduction or abolition of the death penalty in the United Kingdom.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department under what circumstances a licence can be awarded under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 in respect of a product or ingredient of a product already freely available on the United Kingdom market. [16458]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Other than finished cosmetic products, for which no new authorities to test will be issued, such authorities under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 are issued for testing only when there is a specific regulatory requirement: for example, to meet the requirements of the Dangerous Substances Directive, the Biocidal Products Directive or the Medical Devices Directive.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to increase the availability of public information under section 24 of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. [16459]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 There are no plans to change section 24 of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. It will therefore remain an offence to disclose information given in confidence. Such information includes the details of establishments and individuals licensed under the Act, and details of licence applications.
<P>

<a name="71120w02.html_para3">We do, however, plan to make more information available on how the Act is operated. The policy and procedures for handling infringements were described in the 1996 annual report of the Animal Procedures Committee. The Committee is also planning to produce an extended statement on the cost-benefit assessment required under section 5(4) of the Act and I understand that this will describe the process by which programmes of work are assessed.

<P>

<a name="71120w02.html_para4">The Committee does not grant or refuse applications. It can only advise the Secretary of State on whether licences should be granted. In these cases, the Home Secretary decided that the two licences should be granted.
<P>

<a name="71120w02.html_para5">The Committee also saw two applications to amend existing licence authorities. One requested an extension of the licence to the maximum allowed term of five years. This was granted by the Home Secretary. The other, requesting changes to the existing authorities, was considered on several occasions by the Committee during 1996. Some of the requested amendments were granted.

[16461]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Alice was used in a non-recovery procedure under anaesthesia in February 1996.

(The purpose was to investigate the way in which cells in the motor cortex address motoneurones controlling hand and forearm activity.) Alice was then given an overdose of anaesthetic.
<P>

<a name="71120w02.html_para8">Section 5(5) of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 requires that applicants give adequate consideration to the feasibility of achieving the purposes of the programme of work by means not involving protected animals. This work could only be undertaken in living animals because the complexity of the neurological processes cannot be reproduced by other means.

 The Director of Public Prosecutions was asked to consider whether the circumstances disclosed a possible offence under the Official Secrets Act 1989 such as to require a criminal investigation.

<P>

<a name="71120w03.html_para0">I considered the matter with the DPP and I then invited relevant colleagues to draw to my attention matters which the public interest required be taken into account in accordance with the long-standing procedures described to the House by my predecessor on 29 January 1951, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>683-684.</i> Following such consultation I concluded that intelligence and foreign relations considerations outweighed other public interest considerations which might otherwise have required a prosecution in respect of any offence established by a criminal investigation. It followed that no useful purpose would have been served for there to have been a police investigation in this matter.<i></i>

<a name="71120w03.html_para1">Although that view took account of the considerations advanced by Ministerial colleagues, the assessment of those considerations was my responsibility alone as a Law Officer acting independently of Government but after further consultation with the DPP, the DPP concurred with my view.

The meeting took place at the Lord Chancellor's Department Headquarters (Selborne House). The Lord Chancellor also met James Innes of Abbey Legal Protection Ltd. on 14 November 1997 in the Lord Chancellor's office in the House of Lords. Those meetings have been in addition to less formal contact over the telephone and in correspondence.

(1) This figure includes the cost of abolishing the additional personal allowance of &#163;220 million and the cost of abolishing the widow's bereavement allowance of &#163;25 million.<P>

(2) This figure allows for windfall gains arising from the disposal of shares issued in connection with building society and insurance company de-mutualisations. It is particularly uncertain due to the exceptional level of de-mutualisation activity during this year. This estimate represents the reduction in tax liabilities from the existence of the relief and cannot generally be interpreted as the yield from withdrawing it. In practice, withdrawing a relief would often result in significant changes to taxpayers' behaviour and might require changes to other reliefs.<P>

 The Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise have a statutory duty to collect tax that is legally due. It is their responsibility, to the Exchequer and to taxpayers generally, to do so speedily and effectively, taking the action they consider appropriate to obtain payment. However both Departments recognise the need to balance their duty to collect tax with the proper concern for the taxpayer to continue in business. Insolvency proceedings are only taken as a last resort, after all other attempts to secure payment within a reasonable time-scale have failed.

 Cases of this type are usually administered by UK registered charities which already benefit from a range of tax reliefs such as gift aid and the payroll scheme. These encourage donations to charity by focusing on what people give rather than what charities spend. Additionally, in his last Budget, the Chancellor announced a review of the taxation of charities and invited contributions from interested parties. Although the main focus of the review will be the current VAT arrangements, all aspects of the tax system will be taken into consideration.
<P>

<a name="71120w05.html_para0">The Government receive many appeals of this nature for relief of taxes and duties. While we are sympathetic to the causes it would be difficult to justify discrimination by granting relief in some cases but not in others.

 My right hon. Friend has set NHS Wales a number of targets to improve health and health services. These include a reduction in the number of people in Wales who smoke, including teenagers. Responsibility for achieving the targets to reduce smoking rests with Health Authorities working closely with the activities of other agencies such as the Health Promotion Authority for Wales.

<UL>(2) how many <i>(a)</i> injuries and <i>(b)</i> fatalities were caused by carbon monoxide poisoning from house fires in <i>(a)</i> houses of multiple occupation; <i>(b)</i> the rest of the private rented sector, <i>(c)</i> council housing and <i>(d)</i> other social housing in Wales in each of the past 10 years.[16512]<P></UL>

<P>
<a name="71120w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="71120w07.html_para0">The readily available information on fires in dwellings in Wales is given in the tables.
<P>

<a name="71120w07.html_para1">Casualties from carbon monoxide poisoning cannot be identified centrally. The data for 1994 and 1995 do not reliably distinquish houses in multiple occupation from other types of dwelling, such as flats and maisonettes.
<P>

<a name="71120w07.html_para2">Information for 1987 and earlier years is not available. Information for 1996 will be available early in 1998.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>First, I assume that your reference to Novella Road should be Movilla Road, Newtonards. The latter is linked to Moss Road, Millisle, by the Ballyblack Road East.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w09.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 A working document produced by the European Commission last year indicated that in 1995 compensatory allowances were payable in all other Member States to farmers in less-favoured areas on limited numbers of dairy cows. No more recent information is available.

<P>
<a name="71120w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 No research has been commissioned specifically to study the relationship between stocking density and the incidence of tuberculosis in cattle. However, several studies have examined the behaviour of cattle in herds. For example, as cattle numbers increase, cattle do not avoid grass contaminated by badger faeces as much as usual. Professor Krebs's Committee has examined current research on bovine tuberculosis and is expected to report shortly.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what research his Department has <i>(a)</i> evaluated and <i>(b)</i> commissioned on the levels and types of soil bacteria found in (i) organic agriculture and (ii) conventional agriculture; and what assessment he has made of the implications of that research for the eradication of tuberculosis in cattle.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 No MAFF-funded research has been commissioned to study levels and types of soil bacteria found in either organic or conventional agriculture in the context of tuberculosis in cattle. However, some research has been carried out on the survival times of bovine TB in soil under experimental conditions. Further work has been carried out in the south west of England on the effect of farming practices on environmental mycobacteria. It has been suggested that these mycobacteria can prime the immune response in animals and humans, and may alter their response to subsequent infection and pathogens. Professor Krebs's Committee has examined current research on bovine tuberculosis and is expected to report shortly.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what data he has collated concerning the existence of BSE in the United States cattle herd; and if he will make a statement. [16683]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 No cases of BSE in cattle have been reported by the USA authorities to the Office International des Epizooties (OIE). The USA has carried out detailed risk assessments which have been made available to us. It has traced, investigated and destroyed cattle imported from the UK and initiated surveillance for BSE in cattle presented for slaughter, concentrating particularly on adult animals with neurological symptoms.
<P>

<a name="71120w09.html_para2">The demography of the USA cattle and sheep populations, the regional nature of its distribution of rendered protein and its low incidence of scrapie suggest that the risk from BSE in the USA is low. Nevertheless, the presence of three transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, namely scrapie in sheep, CWD (Chronic Wasting Disease) in elk and mule-deer and more rarely TME (Transmissible Mink Encephalopathy), indicate that the risk cannot be zero.

<P>
<a name="71120w09.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 I represented the United Kingdom at a meeting of the European Union Agriculture Council on 17 and 18 November.
<P>

<a name="71120w09.html_para3">The principal task of the Council was to reach conclusions on the proposals to reform the Common Agricultural Policy in the context of the Commission's Agenda 2000 initiative. Discussions on these proposals have gone on in the Council since September. After long negotiations, it was possible to reach agreement on conclusions that met the key requirements which I had identified for the UK. These are, first, that there should be a rapid start to negotiating the necessary legislative changes to agricultural market regimes in order to give effect to CAP reform; second, that there should be recognition of the need for EU agriculture to be sustainable and competitive on domestic and international markets; third, that CAP reform should facilitate EU enlargement and allow the EU to take a positive negotiating stance in the next WTO round; and fourth, that there should be confirmation that the agricultural guideline imposes an absolute ceiling on spending in this sector. The Council confirmed the approach to reform along the lines I have advocated, namely reduced 



<P>
<P><I>20 Nov 1997 : Column: 277</I><P>
price-support, compensated through direct aid and complemented by reinforced agri-environmental and rural development measures.
<P>

<a name="71120w09.html_para4">The conclusions finally adopted fully achieved these objectives. They were endorsed by 14 of the 15 member states, Spain being unable to associate itself with the language reconfirming the unchanged nature of the agricultural guideline. The Council's conclusions will be passed to the General Affairs Council and ultimately to Heads of Government for consideration at their meeting in Luxembourg in December.
<P>

<a name="71120w09.html_para5">In my view, this Council marked an important step in the process of reforming the Common Agricultural Policy, which is a key Government objective in the EU. I look forward to beginning the process of detailed negotiation as soon as the Commission's formal proposals are available.
<P>

<a name="71120w09.html_para6">Aside from Agenda 2000, the Council had a detailed report from the Agriculture Commissioner on BSE, in the light of the European Parliament's recent report; and on the need to amend the July decision on specified risk materials in order to provide derogations for the imports of necessary pharmaceutical products. A proposal to this effect is to be made very shortly. I joined my Dutch and German colleagues in putting pressure on the Commission to bring forward proposals as rapidly as possible on battery cages for laying hens.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1) what estimate he received from the National Cattle Database Working Party on the annual running costs of the cattle passport scheme; [17005]
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w10.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 The National Cattle Database Working Party, which is a livestock industry body, submitted a report to MAFF in August 1996 on establishing a cattle tracing database. However, this report did not contain any estimates of costs of the database or the cattle passports scheme, or of the charge for a cattle passport.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what estimates he has made of the annual cost of the cattle passport scheme. [17003]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w10.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 The latest estimate for Great Britain for 1997-98 is in the region of &#163;7.2 million. This is an estimate of the cost of the current cattle passport scheme, and not of the new computerised cattle tracing system including cattle passports, which will be introduced in 1998.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w10.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Jack: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what calculations were involved in determining the charge level for cattle passports; and if the charge includes a contribution to the scheme's annual running costs. [17007]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w10.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 There will be a charge for cattle passports once a computerised cattle tracing system has been introduced in Great Britain. The charge level has not yet been determined, but is expected to be in the range &#163;5 to &#163;10 per animal.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what is the cost to public funds of producing each cattle identification document; and how many were issued in the last year for which figures are available. [17004]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w10.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 Cattle Identification Documents (CIDs) are issued only in respect of male cattle; cattle passports have been a requirement for all cattle born after 1 July 1996. As they form an integral part of the Beef Special Premium Scheme, it is not an easy matter to identify separately the costs relating to CIDs. However, taking account of relevant development, capital, maintenance and staff expenditure, our best estimate is that each one issued to date by the Department has cost in the region of &#163;1.88. A total of 1,034,552 were issued in England in 1996.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what will be the impact of the implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty on the live export of cattle from the United Kingdom to the European continent. [16949]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In general the European Union does not recognise animal movements from one Member State to another as in any way distinct from the generality of animal movements on EU territory, although, because of BSE, there is currently a ban on exports of live cattle to the continent. The Treaty protocol agreed at Amsterdam will not change this. However, it will mean that the EU will have to pay full regard to animal welfare in further developing the controls which it applies to the transportation of animals.

<a name="71120w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the United Kingdom's Second Report under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change which was published in February 1997. It reports the UK's progress in implementing its programme for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and gives a projection of what the programme is expected to deliver by 2000. The report projects forward to 2020 what the current programme is expected to achieve.

<a name="71120w10.html_para0">As regards developing country issues, our policy is to limit the growth of greenhouse gas emissions from developing countries through the conventions energy efficiency programme which encourages these countries to play an effective role in controlling emissions while continuing their economic development. Through this we have committed over &#163;311 million since 1992 on projects which improve the efficient use of energy resources, encourage the use of renewable sources of energy and conduct research into climate-friendly technologies. We have also committed over &#163;130 million to the Global Environment Facility which is the financial mechanism of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. We are prepared to make a substantial further contribution to the GEF at its current replenishment negotiations. Some 40 per cent. of these resources are allocated to climate change projects in developing countries and economies in transition. Data that quantify the effect of the above in terms of tonnes of greenhouse gases are unavailable.

The change allows for the take-up of an entitlement under end year flexibility arrangements. The increase will be charged to the Reserve and will not therefore add to the planned total of public expenditure.

<P>

 My Department is prepared to consider projects from any source provided it is driven by an industry demand. We are well aware of the important role that research organisations can and do play in developing and transferring technology to improve the competitiveness of UK industry, particularly SMEs. Our support for the exciting new TWI/BT concept, JOIN-IT, to deliver technical advice to SMEs via the Internet is an example of how we are prepared to support these organisations to develop novel technology which will benefit UK industry.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w11.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 Both the Scotland and Wales White Papers on Devolution indicated that there would be a concordat on financial assistance. We are currently preparing a concordat between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to ensure that financial assistance to industry remains within common UK guidelines and consultation arrangements. It will address the concern that public money should not be used to finance competition between different parts of the country.

<P>

 The Government are very concerned about the problem of prostitutes' advertising cards and support BT in its action unilaterally to bar incoming calls to the BT customers who repeatedly advertise in BT Call boxes.

BT has requested a licence amendment which would allow BT to extend its barring rights to calls from BT's kiosks to any advertised number, regardless of whether it belongs to a BT or a non-BT customer. Oftel will consult on this licence amendment very shortly as part of a more general consultation on Public Call Boxes. Such an amendment should strengthen the impact of BT's present scheme.

 The purpose of the proposed Directive is to establish a clear legal framework for the protection of biotechnological inventions through national patent law. Although the texts of Members States' patent laws are currently closely aligned with that of the European Patent Convention (an inter-governmental agreement dating from 1978), there have been differences in interpretation between Member states. Although no assessment has been made as to the direct effect this proposed Directive may have on enhancing competitiveness, the clarification arising from it will reduce current uncertainty in this area of law and harmonise EU law.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w12.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The European Commission's proposal for a Directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions is substantially consistent with current United Kingdom legislation (the Patents Act 1977). In particular, the proposal does not afford patent rights to anything which is not patentable under current law. It is therefore within the regime envisaged in the proposal that biotechnology has developed during the last 20 years in the United Kingdom. The European Commission has sought to harmonise patent laws in this area since 1988 when an initial proposal for a Directive emerged. Since enactment of current legislation in the UK and publication of the Commission's initial proposal, interest has grown and to date some 150 organisations are taking part in a consultation exercise. Such organisations include those concerned with the environment, health and patient care, industry, the professions, consumer interests, animal welfare and religious groups.

A number of Trade Associations represent firms which manufacture, install and service security products. However, although the Department has commissioned the collection of data on manufacturers of security products, which included closed circuit television equipment, a similar study has never been undertaken in respect of manufacturers of covert surveillance and listening equipment. To approach all the firms involved would incur considerable cost.

<a name="71120w13.html_para2"><i>Letter from Faith Boardman to Mr. Howard Flight, dated 19 November 1997:</i>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Social Security about telephone conversations, interviews and the income of parents without care (normally known as absent parents) dealt with by the Child Support Agency.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It may be helpful to outline the current situation with regard to telephone conversations and face to face interviews. When contact is made via the telephone, Agency staff are instructed to make a note of the relevant parts of the discussion. This can be done in one of two ways, either by recording details on the Child Support Computer System or by making a clerical note. Feedback from customers has made it clear that the majority of our customers prefer to be contacted by telephone. The Agency is currently piloting a scheme called Positive Customer Contact which maximises the use of the telephone to obtain information and to establish closer links with customers. Staff are instructed to maintain a brief but accurate record of the important elements of the conversation, namely the 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>20 Nov 1997 : Column: 290</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>information which enables a case to be progressed. Details of telephone conversations are not recorded by the Agency in any other way.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The second point you raised concerns face-to-face interviews. Although most contact between the Agency and its customers is by means of written correspondence or via the telephone there is sometimes a need to carry out face-to-face interviews. A customer can also repeat an interview, and where this is the best way to progress a case an interview will be arranged. Such interviews normally take place in DSS local offices.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The third point you raised concerned the calculation of income of the parent who does not have primary care. The income of the absent parent consists of the total income from all sources available to that parent as defined in the Child Support Maintenance Assessments and Special Cases Regulations 1992. This includes earnings from employment or self-employment (less tax, national insurance contributions and 50% of contributions made to an occupation or personal pension scheme); some social security benefits; income from capital; income from boarders or tenants; income from occupational or personal pension schemes; training allowances and student grants (providing the student has some other form of income in addition to the grant). Certain types of income are subject to a partial disregard, for example &#163;10 per week of a War Disablement or War Widows Pension is disregarded.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For an employed parent the average income derived from earnings can be calculated or estimated. The Agency will look at earnings received in a period beginning up to eight weeks before the Agency receives a maintenance application form or issues a maintenance enquiry form and ending with the date the assessment is made. If evidence is incomplete or considered to be unrepresentative of the normal earnings, the Agency will estimate the amount of earnings. Any payments of bonus, commission, or profit related pay are averaged over the year. Payments for expenses are ignored, provided they are necessarily incurred in carrying out the employment.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The calculation of earnings for the self-employed is intended to reflect the flow of cash through the business and the money available to the parent for the payment of child maintenance. The calculation reflects the difference between earnings from the gross receipts and expenses incurred in the running of the business. The assessment period is either a year, the period of self employment if less than a year, or a period that provides a more reliable calculation. However, the parent may provide the latest profit and loss account for a period between 6 and 15 months. Provided that period ends within 24 months of the date the maintenance enquiry form is sent, then earnings will be averaged over the period of the accounts.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A partner's income is calculated in the same way as a parent's. An absent parent's partner has no liability to maintain children from the absent parent's previous relationship, but her income is included in the calculation of disposable income (this is the total income of the household) which is required for consideration of the protected income provisions (this is an amount to ensure that the absent parent's household is left with sufficient disposable income, after paying maintenance, to meet their day to day needs and that of any new family.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are currently examining all aspects of the work of the Child Support Agency with a view to ensuring that the Agency provides a consistent, fair and efficient service to all its customers.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what progress has been made in replacing the Certificate of Fitness regime for offshore safety with verification schemes; and what requirement there is in such schemes for physical testing of materials used. [15957]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w15.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The legal requirement for offshore installations to have a Certificate of Fitness was replaced by legislation which came into effect on 30 June 1996. There are transitional provisions which allow the continued use of the Certificate of Fitness arrangements under certain circumstances until 30 June 1998; by that date every offshore installation operating on the UK Continental Shelf must be covered by a verification scheme. This involves scrutiny by an independent and competent person of the suitability of all safety-critical elements on the installation. Physical testing of materials is not specified in the legislation, but where the materials contribute to the suitability of a safety-critical element they would be expected to be subject to verification by appropriate means.

<a name="71120w15.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 All drivers, when renewing their licences (normally at the age of 70 and every three years thereafter), are required to declare whether they can meet the prescribed eyesight standard. They also have a statutory obligation, whatever their age, to meet the standard whenever they drive and, if they cannot do so, to cease driving and notify the DVLA. In particular, drivers should notify conditions affecting both eyes, such as glaucoma, cataracts or progressive retinal disease. A requirement for compulsory eye tests for all drivers over a certain age would place extra costs on elderly drivers and involve major additional administration. The Government are not persuaded that it would bring significant road safety benefits.

 The UK is leading the world in its efforts to combat the threat of climate change. Tackling emissions from transport will be a key element of the balanced climate change programme which we will be developing after the Kyoto conference. We are currently undertaking a fundamental review of transport policy as part of our commitment to develop an integrated transport policy. A number of transport measures are being considered carefully.

<a name="71120w15.html_para0">In the last Budget, the Chancellor made a commitment to increase road fuel duty by an average of 6 per cent. a year in real terms.

<P>
<a name="71120w15.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Following the loss of The Gaul, the Department of Trade, which was then responsible for marine safety, considered a number of proposals for searching for the wreck. Proposals from the Royal Navy and commercial sources were discussed, but were not pursued as it was decided then that the considerable cost of each proposal could not be justified.

 The Civil Aviation Authority, which is responsible for the management of UK airspace, seeks to maximise airspace capacity over the approaches to London airports to the greatest extent possible, commensurate with safety. The management of the flow of air traffic and the scheduling of incoming and outgoing flights should ensure that there is no overcrowding. The separation distance between aircraft conforms to internationally agreed standards. Under current procedures, aircraft do not have to hold as a result of missed approaches at London airports as they are integrated into the approach patterns, without impacting

 I am not aware of any discussions, although I know that Kent County Council is working with neighbouring areas of continental Europe to create an informal "Euroregion", for co-operation on issues of common interest, comprising Kent, Nord-Pas de Calais in France, and Belgium. Also, two English county councils, Kent and East Sussex, are involved with other local partners in the Interreg 2 programme, a Community Initiative which aims to increase transfrontier co-operation. Through these programmes the county councils are linked with their neighbouring French departments, Nord-Pas de Calais and Seine-Maritime/Somme, respectively.

 Under Planning Policy Guidance note 12, "Development Plans and Regional Planning Guidance", local planning authorities should consult all infrastructure providers, including water companies, when preparing their development plans. This process seeks to ensure that development does not exceed the capacity of existing or planned water supply systems. We will give further consideration to the need to consult on the impact of proposed development on water demand in our forthcoming revisions of PPG12 and the system of regional planning guidance. In the light of these arrangements, we see no need to make water companies statutory consultees in relation to individual planning applications.

 The Five-year Strategy which I announced on Monday is based on the introduction of new digital communications technology to replace outdated equipment. This will enable greater organisational flexibility without compromising safety. Indeed, the changes will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Coastguard Search And Rescue (SAR) co-ordination services. A document outlining the strategy will be published shortly. I will arrange for the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland to receive the document and will place a copy in the Library.

<P>

<a name="71120w17.html_para0">The proposed closure of a number of Coastguard stations, including Pentland, means that Coastguard officers will be co-ordinating search and rescue from fewer centres. Concentrating resources in this way will enhance the potential for watch keeping staff to become involved in vital accident prevention work during quieter periods. The number of coastal rescue teams will not be affected by these changes, but the number of sector managers will be increased through additional posts at the locations where centres are to be closed.
<P>

<a name="71120w17.html_para1">The current level of Coastguard radio coverage around the UK will remain unchanged. Vessels using the Pentland Firth will be able to contact the Coastguard on radio as now. Pentland's aerials will be monitored by Aberdeen and Shetland. Staff complements at these adjacent centres will be increased to appropriate levels.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how his Department, the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence performed against last year's targets for reducing empty government homes; and what new targets have been set for 1997-98. [17291]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w17.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The overall number of empty homes held by my Department, the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office fell by 754 between 1 April 1996 and 1 April 1997. This welcome reduction reflects a 5.7 per cent. fall in the number of empty Ministry of Defence properties. Against this there was a small increase in the number of empty homes held by both the Home Office and the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR), reflecting an unexpectedly high number of new vacancies coming on stream. The number of empty homes is still too high and this Government are determined to improve on these figures in the future. We simply cannot afford to have substantial numbers of Government-owned homes lying empty.
<P>

<a name="71120w17.html_para2">I have considered with other Departments and interested parties such as the Empty Homes Agency how we might make better use of these properties and have investigated every opportunity for setting new, more challenging targets for this year as well as improving arrangements for the disposal process.
<P>

<a name="71120w17.html_para3">The Home Office target for this year is more stringent than last year's. The high figure of empty DETR (Highways Agency) properties is due, mainly, to the rundown of the road programme, with properties which had been bought and were being let until needed, being vacated so that they could be sold. This year's targets for my Department reflect this fact and the failure to meet the April 1997 target. However, they represent a significant improvement over last year's achievements. The Ministry of Defence's target has been set at a level which will continue the disposal of surplus properties while retaining the flexibility to react to any changes to the demand for service housing which may emerge from the findings of the Strategic Defence Review, due to report next year.

<i>Notes:<P>

</i>1. Properties that are "habitable" include all properties except:<P>

 (a) derelict properties that await demolition (e.g. to make way for road schemes),<P>

 (b) those that are expected to be demolished in the near future where the expenditure required to make them habitable would be disproportionate to their expected life (e.g. where substantial investment would be required to connect essential services such as water, sewage or electricity),<P>

 (c) those that cannot be made accessible (e.g. due to adjacent construction works).<P>

<P>

(7) The Home Office has identified an under-reporting of this figure, because the Prison Service had previously understood that only homes surplus to operational requirements were to be included in the empty homes more than six months category. Consequently no central record has been kept of how long the non-surplus homes have been empty. The estimate is that up to 100 homes may have been missed from the previous reports, but that the current figure is considerably less than this as a result of a rigorous challenging of the non-surplus status. These homes will be included in future figures and are subject to 1997-98 targets.<P>

(8) Of the 13,142 properties empty: 1,755 have already been identified for disposal; 3,364 were allocated to incoming families; 2,533 were empty pending major upgrade work; 633 had been identified as temporarily surplus with action in hand to lease out to local authorities or housing associations and; 1,117 were not available to dispose of or lease out as they were on military bases and subject to security constraints. If these properties are excluded from the total number of empty properties it leaves 3,740 properties, which represents 5.86 per cent. of MOD stock.<P>

(9) 19 properties are in the process of being sold. Four being refurbished for reoccupation. Four under review for disposal. Five are in blocks of police quarters with police tenants being targeted.<P>

(10) All properties currently vacant are in the process of being sold or let through managing agents.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the research evidence relating to the dangers of using a mobile phone while driving. [17292] <P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w18.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 There has been much concern both in this country and elsewhere in the world about the road safety implications of using mobile phones while driving. My noble friend, the Minister for Roads therefore asked the Transport Research Laboratory to review the evidence currently available and the report it has prepared is being published today. Copies have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="71120w18.html_para0">The report concludes that the use of hand-held mobile phones while driving is widely regarded as unsafe. Most safety researchers regard this as so self-evident that there have been few specific studies. Hands-free phones have received the greatest attention and the debate in the research community centres on the extent to which hands-free conversations impact on driving performance. Studies suggest that the distraction effect of phones reduces as they are made easier to use. However, the distraction caused by the mental effort of telephone conversation is present, even with advanced devices.
<P>

<a name="71120w18.html_para1">Manual dialling and intense telephone conversations have been shown to cause considerable distraction and it is thought that this may impact on safety. Although the evidence is largely circumstantial, it all points in the same direction--there is an association between telephone 



<P>
<P><I>20 Nov 1997 : Column: 306</I><P>
use and increased accident risk. Furthermore, there is evidence that phone conversations are more stressful than equivalent conversations with passengers.
<P>

<a name="71120w18.html_para2">The results of this research are reflected in the revised draft of the Highway Code on which public comment was invited last week and which we hope to put before Parliament next year. It is also reflected in the draft Code of Practice on the use of mobile phones in vehicles, which is currently being discussed with the mobile phone companies and motoring interests.

 No, the Government have not yet taken a final decision on what target might be appropriate. In the meantime, the previous Government's target of 50 per cent. still applies. We are considering our policy on planning for household growth, taking into account the public consultation earlier this year, and will announce our decisions in due course. We remain committed both to protecting the countryside and to regenerating our towns and cities, by encouraging local authorities to make the best possible use of previously developed land. The presumption against inappropriate development within Green Belts remains in place.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the adequacy of the keeping of medical records concerning myelograms int he health service. [14609]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w18.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The preservation, retention and destruction of medical records is addressed in Health Circular HC(89)20, copies of which are available in the Library. This guidance satisfies the requirements of the Public Records Acts 1958 and 1967. While HC(89)20 recommends minimum retention periods, implementation of the guidance is for local interpretation. It is a matter for local management and professionals to determine which elements of the record may be retained, and which may be discarded before the end of the recommended retention period.
<P>

<a name="71120w18.html_para3">The radiologist's report on an x-ray procedure, including those for myelograms, is kept with the patient's medical record. Following a meeting with the Department of Health, the Royal College of Radiologists issued guidance in May 1991 advising that there was greater value in retention of the radiologist's report rather than the film. This was because the x-ray report was considered to be the permanent constituent of the record and the x-ray film was considered to be of transitory nature. Therefore the report should be kept for a period consistent with guidance. In most cases this is for a minimum of eight years after the latest treatment. Where a new episode of treatment begins during that eight-year period the retention period will be extended for a further eight years from that date. Therefore, where treatment continues indefinitely the record will be retained indefinitely.

We are committed to countering this by tackling the main risk factors associated with coronary heart disease, such as smoking, poor diet and physical inactivity. Smoking is the greatest single cause of preventable illness and premature death and kills more than 13 people an hour. The prevention of smoking is therefore a high priority for this Government. Details of the Government's strategy to reduce smoking will be set out in a White Paper, which will be published next year.

In a special exercise, we have also asked the Health Education Authority to investigate and report on the levels of physical activity appropriate for children and young people aged up to 16.

 The National Health Service provides a wide range of family planning services through general practitioner services and family planning clinics. This includes advice and counselling on family planning, as well as the provision of contraceptives. All methods of contraception available under the National Health Service are obtainable free of charge.
<P>

<a name="71120w20.html_para0">Doctors are entitled to provide any of the contraceptive methods available under the National Health Service providing they have the necessary expertise. Certain drugs and appliances are available by prescription only. These are listed in the British National Formulary at chapter 7.3. Copies have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="71120w20.html_para1">Confidentiality is an important feature of family planning service provision. Questions of anonymity are a matter for the professionals and individuals concerned taking account of particular circumstances as well as the type of contraception involved.
<P>

<a name="71120w20.html_para2">A review of the existing arrangements for prescribing is currently being undertaken. The issue of charging for prescriptions is also being examined within a comprehensive review of all National Health Service spending. However, the Government remain committed to a policy of access to treatment based on need and not on ability to pay.

 We understand that 16 National Health Service trusts in Northern and Yorkshire Region are currently considering mergers. If all these mergers were to be approved, then the 16 existing trusts would be consolidated into eight new NHS trusts.
<P>

<a name="71120w20.html_para3">All new trusts will be expected to achieve savings of around &#163;500,000 from management costs alone from merger. In some cases there is further potential for greater savings from rationalising non-clinical support services and making better use of clinical capacity.

<a name="71120w20.html_para4">The potential benefits to patients from merger will depend on the type of merger being proposed, but may include:

 Diet and physical inactivity are major risk factors for obesity and coronary heart disease. Details of the Government's proposed public health strategy, which will include proposals to combat these, will be issued for consultation in a green paper later this winter.
<P>

<a name="71120w20.html_para6">Meanwhile, we want to maintain the momentum of the excellent national and local work which is currently being done in the areas of increasing physical activity and reducing the level of obesity. We are, therefore, pressing ahead with plans within the "Active for Life" physical activity campaign to focus not only on people aged 50 and over but also young women aged 16 to 24 and disabled people in the coming year. In a special exercise, we have also asked the Health Education Authority to investigate and report on the levels of physical activity appropriate for children and young people aged up to 16. The consultation work is currently under way. In addition, we are liaising with colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, to play a key role in promoting active and healthy modes of transport through the national cycling and walking forums.

<a name="71120w20.html_para7">In addition to this, last month we published a review of effective interventions in the prevention and treatment of obesity and work is in hand to establish a directory of weight management services available across the National Health Service in England, and to evaluate a sample of these for their effectiveness.
<P>

<a name="71120w20.html_para8">Also, the Health Education Authority continues to promote the healthy eating message, which is that a varied and balanced diet, in particular one which is low in fat and rich in fruit and vegetables, should have a longer-term impact on combatting obesity.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71120w20.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 It is estimated that the direct cost of switching to chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) free products will be up to &#163;10 million per annum. This cost will be incurred because there will not be a generic version of one of the major "reliever" inhalers containing salbutamol so patients currently using these will have to be moved on to another product. However other costs may arise if doctors respond to the transition by prescribing patients more expensive products than before. Such indirect costs depend on how the behaviour of individual doctors and patients might change and are difficult to quantify.

 The set of returns from regional task forces for 30 September 1997 show overall compliance with limits on junior doctors' hours at 80.5 per cent.

<P>

<a name="71120w21.html_para5">It would not be appropriate to prescribe centrally one single method of monitoring hours. Task forces will advise individual trusts on the most suitable local method. Trusts are required to have their progress reports validated by a junior doctor representative locally to ensure that accurate monitoring has taken place. Also, before a trust can be accredited as complying in full with junior doctors' hours' limits the task force must be satisfied that robust internal monitoring is in place.

 Information on the numbers of patients treated from waiting lists is published annually in "Hospital Episode Statistics". The latest is for 1995-96 and copies are available in the Library. Removals are patients removed from the waiting list for in-patient treatment, in accordance with clearly defined guidelines set out in "The NHS Data Manual", for any reason other than admission for treatment from that list. This can be because they have already received treatment at another hospital or because the treatment is no longer necessary. Trusts are encouraged to validate their waiting lists on a regular basis to ensure they do not include any patients that should not be on them.
