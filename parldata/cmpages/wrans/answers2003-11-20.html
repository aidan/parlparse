<a name="31120w01.html_para0">The general policy on medals, which has been followed by successive Governments over many years, is that two separate medals are not awarded for any one exercise or campaign, In addition, except in cases where specific criteria are met as in the case of the Suez Canal Zone, proposals for new medals are not considered more than five years after the event.

 United Nations Security Council resolution 1483 affirmed the need for accountability for crimes and atrocities committed by the previous Iraqi regime. We fully support this, as do the US. We believe it is for the Iraqi people to decide how to bring those responsible to justice, with suitable international help. The Governing Council is developing the idea of a Special Iraqi Tribunal to prosecute those suspected of serious human rights abuses under the former regime. No final decision has yet been reached.

 The review of the BBC's Charter will be wide-ranging, with full industry and public consultation, and will, I hope, be characterised by vigorous and open debate.

<a name="31120w01.html_para3">My Department has already received numerous representations about a wide range of issues relating to the BBC.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Government welcomes in principle the efforts of individual tourism businesses who promote themselves under an eco-tourism banner. We regard such businesses as an important element of the mix of tourism products available to consumers.
<P>

<a name="31120w02.html_para0">There are no plans to introduce a national, Government-sponsored, eco-tourism award scheme. However, several such schemes do operate independently in the UK, often aimed at a geographical or product niche. The Government supports their aims. Indeed on 12 November 2003 I met the operator of one such conservation scheme, targeted at caravan parks, for a discussion about environmental tourism.

 Participation projects in golf are eligible for Sport England Lottery Funding, and golf received a total of 40 grants worth &#163;8.9 million between 1995 and May 2003.
<P>

<a name="31120w02.html_para1">Sport England also provides &#163;92,000 of Exchequer funding annually to the Golf Foundation for the development of Junior Officers. The role of Junior Officers is to encourage young people to participate in the sport, through schemes such as Tri-Golf which is now being delivered throughout primary schools and social inclusion partnerships bringing golf to young people in areas of social and economic deprivation.

 We are investing &#163;581 million through the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) in sports facilities for schools in England. The Space for Sport and Arts programme is putting &#163;130 million into primary school sports facilities in 65 of the most deprived LEAs in the country. (This includes &#163;25 million from NOF.)
<P>

<a name="31120w02.html_para2">We are investing &#163;459 million in the national strategy for PE, school sport and club links. This includes a further &#163;10 million to enhance primary-school playgrounds in 27 deprived areas and &#163;60 million for the Community Club Development Programme to improve amateur club facilities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Proposed fee levels and the expected costs of compliance with the Act were set out in the Regulatory Impact Assessment which accompanied the Licensing Bill and is available from the House Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w02.html_spnew4"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Lottery distributing bodies are required, under their financial directions, to attach conditions to each Lottery grant, enabling the distributor concerned to seek repayment of the grant, in full or in part, in certain circumstances. These circumstances include a breach by the recipient of any of the grant conditions; a material change of purpose, ownership or recipient during the project or after its completion; and cases where the recipient ceases to operate, becomes insolvent, fails to apply the grant for the purpose for which it was awarded, fails to complete the project, is found to have completed its application form fraudulently, incorrectly or misleadingly, or acts fraudulently or negligently during the completion of the project. The Department has issued guidance to the distributing bodies on the matters to be taken into account when they are considering seeking recovery of a Lottery award.

<a name="31120w02.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Sanders: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w02.html_spnew5"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Each Lottery distributing body's financial directions require the body to institute a system for project monitoring in respect of capital and revenue projects supported with Lottery funds, to monitor whether the objectives and terms and conditions of grant are being met. The exact nature of monitoring will vary in individual cases depending on the size, nature and complexity of the project concerned.

The competition attracted 1,100 entries generating community involvement in the bid, and was judged by a panel including athletes, designers, a school sports co-ordinator and a London black cab driver. The winning logo, which will be used on all bid materials and communications, from advertising and building wraps through to badges and pens, was produced by Kino Design. London 2012 Ltd have estimated that using a private design agency would have led to considerably higher costs.

 Performance targets for the department were agreed as part of Spending Review 2002. The monitoring and measurement of PSA targets forms part of departmental performance management. Performance management is an integral part of the day to day running of the department, and as such it is not possible to separate the specific costs out.

[137970]<P>

<P>
<a name="31120w02.html_spnew13"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Key performance targets for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport are agreed as part of the Spending Review and the latest set were published in Spending Review 2002: Public Service Agreements 2003&#150;2006 (Cm 5571). The department monitors progress towards the target along with HM Treasury and PMDU and progress is reported regularly.
<P>

<a name="31120w02.html_para3">Performance targets for the majority of the Department's non-departmental public bodies can be found in the 2003&#150;2006 funding agreements between the Department and the relevant body, which were laid in the Library of the House on 25, 26 and 29 of September 2003. Performance targets for English Heritage and the Historic Royal Palaces are contained in these bodies annual reports which have been laid in the Library of the House. Performance targets for Sport England and Arts Council England are still being formulated.
<P>

<a name="31120w02.html_para4">Achievement against the targets is monitored by the department, including through meetings between the Secretary of State/Ministers and relevant Chief Executives.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what discussions she has had since July with leaders of sporting bodies which are not in the list of 10 for prime funding with public money announced on 18 November by the Chairman of Sport England.  [140178]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 None. The list of sports which will qualify as priorities for Lottery funding at governing body level was and is entirely a matter for Sport England. The 10 sports announced on 18 November will be priorities for the 40 per cent. of total sports Lottery funding which will be allocated for governing body support at national level. The other 60 per cent. will be distributed through the nine Regional Sport Boards, which will consider projects on their merits and without regard to the national priority list.

 <i>[holding answer 19 November 2003]</i>: This Department has not undertaken any research in this area because broadcasters are generally free to respond to the needs and preferences of viewers in making their scheduling decisions. It is a well established principle of broadcasting that Government only intervenes in the sports broadcasting market to seek to ensure that all viewers, including the lower paid and the elderly, have "free to air" access to listed sporting events.

 Publicly funded legal help is available for those making an asylum application, provided the client is financially eligible. Where an asylum application is refused, further legal advice and representation is available for an appeal, although at this stage the availability of public funding is subject to a strict merits test.
<P>

An announcement on the way forward will be made separately. In addition, the Department, the Home Office and the Legal Services Commission are currently examining the initial decision-making stage of the asylum process with particular regard to the role that publicly funded legal advice plays.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs if he will require Government Departments to lay before Parliament each month from 1 January 2004 a written statement listing decisions <i>(a)</i> made and <i>(b)</i> implemented using the Royal Prerogative.  [140204]<P>
<P>
<P>

 No. As the Prime Minister has indicated previously to the House, records are not kept of the individual occasions on which powers under the Royal Prerogative are exercised, nor would it be practicable to do so.

 The Department's net expenditure with external consultants in the financial year dated 2002&#150;03 was &#163;5.7 million.

To ask the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs, if he will make a statement on the impact of <i>(a)</i> the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and <i>(b)</i> human rights legislation on disclosure of information from hearings under which access is restricted owing to Crown Property immunity from prosecution.

<P>

 Consideration is being given to the issue of the State's immunity from criminal proceedings. Both the Government's consultation paper on the reform of the law on involuntary manslaughter, in May 2000. and 'Revitalising Health and Safety' in June 2000, contained proposals for removing or modifying that immunity.
<P>

<a name="31120w04.html_para1">In the light of the responses to those publications, an inter-departmental working group was established. My noble Friend. the Under Secretary of State, Lord Filkin. will write to the hon. Member when further infomation is available.

<P>
<a name="31120w04.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Woodward: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what assessment he has made of <i>(a)</i> the impact on a marriage where one person is granted a full gender recognition certificate, <i>(b)</i> the effect on children in a marriage where one person is granted a FGRC and <i>(c)</i> the financial effects of one partner in a marriage being granted a FGRC.

 This Government are committed to understanding and recognising the needs and aspirations of transsexual people. We recognise that transsexual people face many challenges not least the 



<P>
<P><I>20 Nov 2003 : Column 1159W</I><P>
impact on their family should they decide to seek legal recognition in an acquired gender. The purpose of the draft Bill is specifically to give transsexual people legal recognition in their acquired gender, and with that legal recognition transsexual people will be expected to conform with gender specific arrangements that would apply to anyone sharing their legal gender.
<P>

<a name="31120w04.html_para2"><i>(a)</i> The issue of what to do with existing marriages is a complex one. The Government's policy is clear on existing marriages that involve a transsexual person. It is a policy founded on the fact that UK law does not recognise marriage between two people of the same legal gender and the Government do not intend to see that position charmed.
<P>

<a name="31120w04.html_para3"><i>(b)</i> Transsexual parents will no doubt consider carefully what impact their gaining legal recognition in an acquired gender might have on their children. A transsexual person will retain his or her parental status after being granted a full gender recognition certificate and, thereby, legal recognition in their acquired gender.
<P>

<a name="31120w04.html_para4"><i>(c)</i> The issue of an interim gender recognition certificate makes the existing marriage of the successful applicant voidable at the application to the Courts of either party to the marriage but has no effect beyond that. In granting the annulment, the Court will be able to make orders dealing with financial and other issues arising from the annulment of the marriage.
<P>

<a name="31120w04.html_para5"><i>(d)</i> The Government have conducted a consultation exercise for same sex civil partnership and will publish their response in due course. If a civil partnership scheme is created, an individual who has been married prior to receiving recognition in the acquired gender could, subsequent to receiving recognition, register a civil partnership with the same individual.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs how many house sales there were at more than <i>(a)</i> &#163;50,001, 



<P>
<P><I>20 Nov 2003 : Column 1160W</I><P>
<i>(b)</i> &#163;100,001, <i>(c)</i> &#163;200,001, <i>(d)</i> &#163;500,001, <i>(e)</i> &#163;750,001 and <i>(f)</i> &#163;1 million in London in each of the last six years for which figures are available.  [139932]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w04.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The figures for each completed calendar year are as follows. Land Registry collects residential property price data by specified price bands and it is not possible to provide figures for sales specifically at "more than &#163;750,001". An alternative range has therefore been provided.

: To ask the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs what the declared political allegiance of magistrate benches in Wales was in the last year for which figures are available.  [140367]<P>

<P>
<a name="31120w04.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 Applicants to the magistracy are no longer asked to declare their political affiliation. The most recent figures, however, give the position in April 2003. These show that, of those who declared any affiliation, 526 declared for Labour, 473 for the Conservatives, 240 for the Liberal Democrats and 126 for Plaid Cymru.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what proportion of pregnant women aged between 15 and 24 years in sub-Saharan Africa suffered from HIV/AIDS in the last year for which figures are available.  [139535]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 There is limited data on the prevalence rate among pregnant women in the 15 to 24-year-age group. However, the level of HIV infection among pregnant women is similar to that in the general female population and the latter can be used as a proxy for the prevalence in pregnant women of the same age.

<a name="31120w05.html_para6">The latest UNAIDS estimates of the prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS in women aged 15 to 24 years in sub-Saharan Africa range between a low of 6.4 per cent. and a high of 11.4 per cent. at the end of 2001.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 Comprehensive data showing prevalence rates for these vulnerable groups in Asia is not available for the whole period requested. What data is available comes mainly from internationally accepted sources e.g. UNAIDS (see www.unaids.org). It does suggest a clear trend of increasing HIV prevalence in specific vulnerable groups in several countries.
<P>

<a name="31120w05.html_para7">DFID is working closely with others, including UNAIDS, to improve data on HIV prevalence in these marginalised and often hidden population groups in China, India and other Asian countries.

<P>
<a name="31120w05.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if he will make a statement on illiteracy in developing countries in <i>(a)</i> 1980, <i>(b)</i> 1990 and <i>(c)</i> 2000.  [139621]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 The Dakar Goal on literacy calls for a 50 per cent. improvement in levels of adult literacy by 2015. The world is making steady but slow progress on this goal. In 2000, almost one fifth of the world's adults, 862 million people aged 15 and over, were illiterate. This means that over the last two decades we have seen an improvement of less than 10 per cent. in adult literacy rates, from approximately 70 per cent. in 1980 and 75 per cent. in 1990 to 80 per cent. in 2000. Women continue to be disproportionately affected and still account for almost two-thirds of the world's illiterates. Clearly, the world needs to intensify efforts if the Dakar literacy goal is to be achieved
<P>

<a name="31120w05.html_para8">DFID believes that literacy is key to enabling individuals to acquire the basic skills necessary to build and sustain a livelihood, and to participate in and shape society. To support national governments in their efforts to reduce levels of illiteracy, DFID focuses on strengthening education systems to increase access to good quality primary education for all children. Since May 1997 the Government have committed over &#163;700 million to support sustainable, high quality, primary education systems in developing countries. We will do more. Between 2002 and 2007 we intend to invest about &#163;1 billion in education.
<P>

<a name="31120w05.html_para9">At the same time, improving literacy practice for adults will continue to be an integral part of many different sectoral programmes supported by DFID, such as health, transport and water. We will continue to emphasise the need to ensure that all such efforts to improve literacy levels are given appropriate priority in poverty reduction strategies.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development pursuant to his answer of 1 September 2003, to the hon. Member for Edinburgh West (John Barrett), <i>Official Report</i>, column 809W, if he will make a statement on the work of the task force set up to remove radioactive material removed from the civil nuclear facility at al-Tuwaitha in Iraq.  [138617]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="31120w05.html_para10">The findings of the inspection team which assessed the extent and impact of the looting of the storage drums and containers from Al Tuwaitha has been reported by the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The inspection team found that approximately 200 containers, used for storing low-enriched uranium, had been removed and the contents dispersed. The quantity and type of compounds dispersed were not found to be sensitive from a proliferation point of view. The site has now been secured and the radioactive material sealed in concrete.
<P>

<a name="31120w05.html_para11">A second task force, consisting of the Iraqi Ministry of Health, Ministry of the Environment, World Health Organisation (WHO), Coalition Provisional Authority, IAEA and NGOs was convened to address the potential risk to public health caused by the residual radioactive materials within the looted containers. As a result, the MoH, MoE and WHO have initiated a survey, through local public health centres, to assess and monitor the population potentially affected. The survey, still in its preliminary phase, has been disrupted by the impact of the bombing of the UN HQ on 19 August 2003 and has yet to be completed. The UK Government has provided &#163;6 million to WHO in 2003 to support WHOs sectoral lead in health in Iraq.

<P>
<a name="31120w05.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if he will list the follow-up action taken by the countries which have completed poverty reduction strategy papers.  [139617]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w05.html_spnew8"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 So far, Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) are being implemented in 32 countries, three of which are in the process of implementing their second PRSP (Bolivia, Nicaragua and Uganda). Through its Country Offices and with international partners, DFID is working closely to monitor progress on implementation.
<P>

<a name="31120w05.html_para12">Preliminary evidence suggests that many of these countries are using their PRSPs to maintain processes for civil society participation; improve the framing of macroeconomic policies; improve policies for service delivery and governance; improve public expenditure management; and shift spending priorities towards poverty reduction.
<P>

<a name="31120w05.html_para13">According to the World Bank and IMF, expenditure on poverty-reducing sectors (e.g. health, education, water, sanitations) has increased in PRSP countries by 4 per cent. of total spending, and by 1.5 per cent. of GDP. However, implementation of these strategies remains at an early stage, and will require sustained support both from country governments and the

In June 2002 (when the Census was taken) some 64,000 seasonal and casual workers were employed. This figure will include both workers supplied by gangmasters to employers in agriculture and horticulture and workers who are employed directly by those employers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the regulatory impact of the UK regime for administering the Habitats Directive.  [138553]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Habitats Directive is principally transposed into UK law by regulations which came into force in 1994 and 1995. Since then no overall assessment has been made. Nature conservation is a devolved matter and therefore any assessment in Scotland, North Ireland and Wales will be a matter for the relevant administrations. In England, assessments are carried out before candidate Special Areas of Conservation are submitted to the European Commission under Article 4 of the Directive. My Department has also published Regulatory Impact Assessments on recently proposed draft amendments to the regulations in England, and on draft regulations to implement the Directive in the offshore zone.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the likely incidence of TB breakdown in cattle in Krebs reactive areas, if 100 per cent. culling of badger population in the areas had been carried out.  [140301]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Under the protocols for the Krebs trial, badgers are culled using cage trapping, which is estimated to remove around 80 per cent. of the badger population. Analysis of the trial data from reactive areas is therefore only able to indicate what effect this level of removal on and around farms which have had a TB breakdown will have on the incidence of TB breakdown in the reactive area as a whole. It is not possible to estimate what effect an alternative capture method, which would remove 100 per cent., rather than 80 per cent., of the badgers would have.

 It is highly likely that some cattle-to-cattle transmission of TB has occurred in all Krebs trial areas, although it is impossible to quantify the number of herd breakdowns which might have been due to this means of infection.

<sup>(15)</sup> In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) outbreak. Since testing resumed in 2002, resources have been concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk herds being tested post-FMD is greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, the number of TB reactors identified and slaughtered in 2002&#150;03 is not comparable to those identified and slaughtered in previous years.<P>

 We wrote to interested parties on changing the rules on the fat content of drinking milk in Council Regulation (EC) No. 2597/97 in February 2002, as part of our follow-up to the Milk Task Force and to prepare for possible Commission proposals to amend the regulations. The response we received was mixed. Whilst there was some support for liberalising the rules, there was also concern that it might undermine the well established categories of drinking milk to the detriment of consumers and dairy processors. The Commission in their report on these rules, which was published earlier this year, also found no consensus in favour of changes. It has therefore proposed no changes for the time being, but will initiate a review in 2007, with a view to harmonising rules across the enlarged Community in 2009 when the existing derogations from the rules for Finland, Sweden and several accession countries will expire.

<P>
<a name="31120w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr Bradshaw  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 18 November 2003]</i>: The Energy White Paper details the steps being taken to encourage greater energy efficiency in the UK, and sets out an ambitious strategy for energy efficiency up to 2010 and beyond. Energy efficiency is expected to deliver about half the carbon savings needed to meet our goals for 2020. This will mean roughly doubling the rate of energy efficiency improvement of recent decades.
<P>

<a name="31120w17.html_para0">A wide range of policies and measures have already been established to encourage energy efficiency across the economy. These include:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Climate Change Agreements, where companies can gain an 80 per cent. discount from the Climate Change Levy for eligible processes by entering into Agreements and meeting energy efficiency targets;
<P>
<BR>
the work of the Carbon Trust, which takes the lead on energy efficiency for business and the public sector, and supports the development of a low carbon economy in the UK. The Trust was launched in April 2001 as one way in which CCL receipts are recycled to business;
<P>
<BR>
the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), which will generate significant emissions reductions and is the first economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme in the world. The UK Government is also working towards implementing the European ETS, due to start on 1 January 2005;
<P>
<BR>
funding for the Energy Saving Trust to run a number of programmes to promote the sustainable and efficient use of energy in homes. The Trust also facilitates the Energy Efficiency Partnership for Homes, which brings together key stakeholders to support and promote domestic energy efficiency;
<P>
<BR>
encouraging improvements in product standards so that energy-using appliances operate more efficiently;
<P>
<BR>
the Building Regulations, updated in 2002, which are already delivering significant energy efficiency improvements in new and existing buildings.

<a name="31120w17.html_para1">Looking to the future, the White Paper proposes some key measures, including extension of the Energy Efficiency Commitment beyond 2005 at possibly twice its current level of activity; improvements in building standards through further revisions to the Building Regulations; and faster improvements in the standards of new household appliances.
<P>

<a name="31120w17.html_para2">In Budget 2003, my right hon. Friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced that he would consult further on specific fiscal measures to promote energy efficiency. This consultation closed on the 24 October and the Government is grateful to all those who contributed. All responses are being actively considered to help inform policy development.
<P>

<a name="31120w17.html_para3">The Government intends to publish an Energy Efficiency Implementation Plan within a year of the White Paper's publication, which will provide further detail on all of these policies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIAs) of new environmental protection measures are undertaken in accordance with the Cabinet OfficeGuidelines, "Better Policy Making: A Guide to Regulatory Impact Assessment". Among other things, this says RIAs should take account of the potential dynamic benefits of regulations and an assessment of all the business sectors affected&#151;both positively and negatively. As part of this process, policy-makers consult with relevant stakeholders, including where appropriate representatives of the environmental goods and services industry who will then have the opportunity to make the case for the benefits. Like other parts of Government with an interest, the Joint DTI/Defra Environmental Markets Unit will contribute as appropriate and as part of the policy-making process within Government.

<a name="31120w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 I attach great importance to finding and negotiating approaches which will promote the recovery of cod stocks whilst allowing fishermen the chance to exploit stocks which are abundant in themselves but caught in the same areas. To be negotiable, such approaches do need to be demonstrably workable. I will certainly ensure that MEPs are briefed on the UK's aims in this respect.

 The European Commission has commenced formal proceedings against the United Kingdom under Article 226 of the EC Treaty and Article 26(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No. 2371/2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the common fisheries policy. The Commission considers that:

 Algal blooms are a naturally occurring phenomenon.

<P>

<a name="31120w19.html_para7">Secondary treatment reduces the total nitrogen present in sewage.

These provisions require that where nitrate concentration levels in these waters exceed or could exceed 50 mg/l, if no protective action is taken, then nitrate reduction is to be achieved through further treatment processes.
<P>

<a name="31120w19.html_para9">Between February 1997 and June 2002 eight water bodies in need of protection from excessive nitrates levels were identified as Sensitive Areas (Nitrate) in England.

<a name="31120w20.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will publish the average price of milk for each month for the last five years at <i>(a)</i> farm gate, <i>(b)</i> processor and <i>(c)</i> retailer stage.  [139599]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The table gives figures for milk prices at farm gate and retailer levels from January 1998. Although we do not hold processor prices, the recent KPMG report into the pricing and profitability in the British dairy chain concluded that retail prices involved on average a 27.5 per cent. mark up on the processor price.

<i>[holding answer 19 November 2003]:</i> The Secretary of State has had no formal meetings with representatives of the dairy industry, either producers, processors or retailers to discuss milk prices. However, Ministers frequently meet with representatives from all parts of the dairy supply chain and are therefore aware of the issues. Matters affecting the whole dairy supply chain are regularly discussed at the forum chaired by my noble Friend the Lord Whitty.

<sup>(19)</sup> Defra was formed in June 2001. Defra continued programmes begun by the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions.<P>

<P>

<sup>(20)</sup> This is a change to the answer given in July 2002 to PQ65625. The figure quoted in that answer was &#163;2,952,000. This revised figure reflects the fact that, in year, Encams were awarded an extra &#163;1 million spread over financial years 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03 for the Local Environment Quality Pathfinder Programme.<P>

<P>

<sup>(21)</sup> This figure represents 7/12 of the 2003&#150;04 allocation.<P>

<P>

<sup>(22)</sup> Figures for 1997&#150;8 to 2000&#150;1 inclusive, show advertising expenditure only and include a small element of Scottish Executive support. Figures for 2001 onwards are total funded programme costs.<P>

<sup>(26)</sup> The Carbon Trust was formed in 2001&#150;02 but did not begin marketing activity until 2002&#150;03. Of the 2002&#150;03 total, &#163;750,000 was spent on the 'Thank You' campaign.<P>

<P>

<sup>(27)</sup> Figures for the latest 'Lifeblood' campaign are not yet available.<P>

<P>

<sup>(28)</sup> Most of the 'are you doing your bit?' campaign's planned resource was allocated in 2001&#150;2 to rural support during the foot and mouth disease outbreak.<P>

<P>





<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Where it has been possible, without involving disproportionate cost, costs have been broken down into resource, capital expenditure and staff. However, the majority of costs are aggregated.<P>

2. Expenditure at 2003&#150;04 prices has been calculated using the underlying Retail Price Index (RPIX).<P>

 This Department is currently carrying out a comprehensive research project into the use of motor vehicles, including motorcycles, on byways open to all traffic. Under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, roads used as public paths will shortly be reclassified as 'restricted byways' and vehicles will then no longer be able to use them unless it can be proved that the byway is a vehicular right of way.

[140319]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w21.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The information is as follows:
<P>

<a name="31120w21.html_para0"><i>(a)</i> All Plant Health and Seeds Inspectors are fully trained in the visual identification of potato ring rot and there is no evidence to suggest that this training is not effective although ring rot is known to exist sometimes in a latent, symptomless form, which is why visual inspections are supplemented by laboratory testing.
<P>

<a name="31120w21.html_para1"><i>(b)</i> An annual survey for ring rot is carried out by the Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate which involves taking samples of seed and ware potatoes from a representative sample of growers. The survey is a requirement of EC Council Directive 93/85/EEC of 4 October 1993 which also lays down details of the required testing methodology. In addition, all imported seed potatoes entering the seed potato classification scheme are tested for the presence of potato ring rot.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the risk of cross contamination to other seed potatoes following the recent outbreak of ring rot.  [140320]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w21.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 EC Directive 93/85/EEC on the control of potato ring rot lays down a series of measures to be taken at outbreak sites which take account of the 



<P>
<P><I>20 Nov 2003 : Column 1237W</I><P>
possible risks of cross contamination. Testing is still under way at the farm in Wales where the outbreak was discovered and it will be some time before we know whether the infection was restricted to the one stock. As a precautionary measure no other stocks of potatoes from the farm will be planted, whatever the results of the tests. Three premises in England to which stocks had already been sent from the outbreak farm have been put under statutory notice. We understand that the consignments sent to the Canary Islands have also been impounded. Any links which indicate a risk at other farms will result in similar restrictions at those premises.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w21.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what additional seed inspection procedures have been put in place following the recent outbreak of ring rot at <i>(a)</i> domestic sites and <i>(b)</i> points of import.  [140321]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w21.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The priority now is to determine the extent of the current outbreak and to trace and test other deliveries from the same and any related stocks. In the light of that information we will then review levels of inspection and monitoring of domestic and imported potatoes. This outbreak was detected as a result of our annual survey for the presence of potato ring rot under which 932 tests and 1,151 visual inspections are carried out last year.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w21.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what measures were taken to quarantine <i>(a)</i> the farm of Mr. John Morgan and <i>(b)</i> the four other farms to which he has sent seed potatoes possibly infected with ring rot.  [140322]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w21.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 As soon as the diagnosis of ring rot was made on a sample from the farm in mid Wales a statutory notice was served under the Plant Health (Great Britain) Order 1993 (as amended) to prevent movement of potatoes from that farm. The same measures were taken, on a precautionary basis, at each of the three farms in England to which seed had already been delivered. In relation to the delivery to the Canary Islands we notified the Spanish authorities and we understand the consignment has been impounded.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what research the Department has commissioned on the development of a bactericide for the elimination of ring rot in the past five years; and what the cost was.  [140323]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w21.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 There are no bactericides approved for use on any plant bacterial disease in the UK. Unlike fungicides bactericides are not generally effective against disease on growing plants. There are standard commercial disinfectants available for hygiene measures in stores and on containers and harvesting/grading machinery. The efficacy of these was recently investigated at the Central Science Laboratory as part of

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment the Government has made of the prevalence of ring rot in Europe and North America.  [140324]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w21.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 EC Council Directive 93/85/EEC on the control of potato ring rot requires member states to carry out regular surveys and report the results to the Plant Health Standing Committee. Equivalent information is now being required from accession countries. All member states, except Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg, and Portugal have reported outbreaks of ring rot. Prior to the adoption of the control Directive in 1995 there was a wide variation between member states in their policy on the disease and the level of official action against it. Ring rot is regarded as an established disease in the USA and in large parts of Canada, although there are certain seed growing regions such as Prince Edward Island where statutory measures are taken to exclude ring rot and eradicate it when it occurs.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w21.html_wqn16"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what advice the Government have sought from <i>(a)</i> European and <i>(b)</i> North American governments on the handling of ring rot.  [140325]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w21.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 UK scientists at CSL are closely involved in the group of plant bacteriologists from around the EU who provided technical advice on diagnostic tests and risk management measures during the development of the control Directive on Ring Rot. They also play a major role in the scientific panels of the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organisation. In 2002 experts from Canada and the USA met with EU experts to discuss ring rot controls. Defra's Central Science Laboratory is in regular contact with the experts from the eradication programme on Prince Edward Island.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in what condition each site of special scientific interest (SSSI) was in each year since 1997, broken down by local authority area; and what the total land area of SSSIs was in each category <i>(a)</i> in England and <i>(b)</i> broken down by local authority area.

<P>
<a name="31120w22.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 There are 4,112 Sites of Special Scientific Interest in England, covering over one million hectares. English Nature has been assessing the condition of SSSIs against rigorous and consistent standards, since 1997. It takes six years to complete fully the assessment programme across the whole of England, and although individual sites may be assessed more than once over this period, it is impossible to assess each site each year. The first full assessment programme was completed in March 2003, and showed that 598,000 hectares of SSSI land (56.9 per cent. of the total) was either in favourable condition or clearly on course to achieve it, on the basis of the latest information available at that time. English Nature will publish a report giving the full results of this programme next month. Full details of all the individual SSSIs, and their condition, will be available on English Nature's website early in the new year.

<a name="31120w23.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Neither the Waste Framework Directive nor the Nitrates Directive apply to the removal of silt from watercourses. However, Waste Management Licensing Regulations (1994) control the application of dredged material to land and the Government have made use of their discretion under Article 11 of the Waste Framework Directive to provide licensing exemptions for dredgings from inland waters. Where dredgings are to be spread on agricultural land, and the land falls within a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone, the requirements of the NVZ Action Programme Regulations must also be observed.

 There are currently 333 active vineyards in England and Wales, 317 of which are based in England, and 114 wineries.

<a name="31120w24.html_para0">English wine production is variable depending on the climate. Over the period 1999&#150;2001, the average production in the UK was 14,434 hectolitres. Total wine production for the UK in 2002 was 9,384 hectolitres which was lower than average. Wine production in England alone for 2002 was 9,334 hectolitres. This year's harvest is expected to be considerably higher than the previous year and of good quality. The domestic industry currently meets around 0.2 per cent. of what is a large, and sophisticated UK market. In recent years, the English wine industry has been remarkably innovative, having made particular progress with the development and production of sparkling wines, some of which have been internationally recognised.

<a name="31120w24.html_para6">Some early indicators were identified in our "First Reflections" report published in July.

 <i>[holding answer 10 November 2003]:</i> The Army's Harmony guidelines recommend a tour interval of 24 months between each six month operational tour for Army battalions, which equates to one tour in each 30 month period. Between first May 2001 and 31 October 2003 infantry battalions undertook an average of about 1.3 tours. This is primarily the result of the Army's commitments on Operation Telic in Iraq and we therefore expect the situation to improve as commitments reduce.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what percentage of RAF C-130J aircraft had been planned to be out of service in 2003 owing to maintenance; and if he will make a statement.  [135801]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w25.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The planned number of C-130J aircraft on routine, scheduled maintenance at any one time is normally one aircraft, equating to 4 per cent. of the 25 aircraft fleet. However, due to the heavy use of the fleet on Operation TELIC, this has been increased to a planned average of 1.5 aircraft; this equates to 6 per cent.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w25.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 "Chronic engine problems" has been taken to refer to significant faults such as turbine failures and generator problems that have caused engine rejections. Faults such as low oil pressure and other routine faults have not been included.
<P>

<a name="31120w25.html_para3">As at 0800 on 30 October 2003, nine RAF C-130J aircraft were out of service. Of these nine, two aircraft were back in service 24 hours later. The average number of aircraft unavailable due to routine maintenance and engine problems during the first 10 months of 2003 is provided in the following table. Some aircraft may have undergone routine maintenance at the same time as being out of service for engine related problems.
<P>

<a name="31120w25.html_para4">The figures in the table are not whole numbers because they are calculated as the number of aircraft that were unserviceable during the month multiplied by the proportion of the month that each aircraft was out of service. As an example, if one aircraft was unserviceable for 40 per cent. of the month then this would give an average of 0.4, as in January. These figures have then been expressed as a percentage in the second table.

 While no final decisions have been taken, our current planning assumption is that we will acquire up to 150 Short Take Off and Vertical Landing variants of the Joint Strike Fighter aircraft which is sufficient to meet our Future Joint Combat Aircraft (FJCA) requirements.
<P>

<a name="31120w28.html_para1">FJCA is not meant solely to be deployed on our future carrier. It will be a truly joint aircraft capable of operating from both land and sea. The precise number of FJCA we would deploy on future carriers would be dependent on the mission to be undertaken, other rotary wing and surveillance assets being deployed, and other operations being undertaken concurrently.

 When a claim from overseas is heard in the United Kingdom under both common law and Part III of the Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995 any aspect of damages to be regarded as quantitative will be governed by the law of the country where the case is heard.

 The investigation of a claim is tailored to meet the specific circumstances of each case.

<a name="31120w28.html_para2">In the case of Kenyan tribespeople claiming compensation for injuries allegedly caused by unexploded ordnance, the Ministry of Defence appointed a recently retired Brigadier and a serving Major to investigate the claims in both Kenya and the UK. In addition, a British Army surgeon was instructed to examine the medical evidence. Although the Ministry

<P><I>20 Nov 2003 : Column 1265W</I><P>
of Defence disputed liability in a number of cases, evidence based on inquest reports, Kenyan magistrates courts records, post mortem reports, police investigation reports, police post incident reports, certificates of death and medical reports indicated that some limited liabilities rested with the Department. A settlement was reached through mediation in July 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer to the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) of 27 October 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 6W, on life insurance, how many <i>(a)</i> regular and <i>(b)</i> reserve personnel serving in the Gulf have cover; and how many do not.  [139236]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w28.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Commercial life insurance is not part of the benefits the Ministry of Defence provides. For those who die in Service or leave the Service due to injury, the MOD's support is provided by the War Pension Scheme, the Armed Forces Pension Scheme and (for reservists) the Reserve Forces (Attributable Benefits Etc) Regulations. Moreover, as personal insurance is a complex area and one that is becoming increasingly regulated by the Financial Services Authority, it is MOD policy not to endorse, sponsor or recommend any commercial insurance scheme. Therefore, while MOD encourages regulars and reservists to ensure that they are appropriately insured for their particular circumstances, the decision whether to purchase cover, and which scheme to join, must be a matter for the individual, and as such is not monitored by the Ministry of Defence.

<P>
<a name="31120w29.html_wqn3"><B> Dr. Julian Lewis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence whether it is his intention that a reduction in the size of the two future aircraft carriers will lead to no diminution of military capability.  [139596]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w29.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 No final decisions have yet been taken on the main capability specifications for the Future Aircraft Carrier programme, currently in its Assessment Phase. The intention, as with any other new equipment project, has always been to use the Assessment Phase to refine the design in order to best meet our capability requirements and to ensure value for money.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w29.html_wqn4"><B> Dr. Julian Lewis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, what aspects of the designed capability of <i>(a)</i> Type 45 destroyers, <i>(b)</i> Astute-class submarines and <i>(c)</i> Joint Strike Fighters have been changed since 1998.  [139597]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w29.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The United Kingdom Type 45 destroyer programme began in late 1999, following completion of Phase 1 of the tri-national Horizon programme which was carried out in collaboration with France and Italy. Much of the designed capability under the Horizon programme is being developed further in the Type 45 programme and has increased in a number of areas. The most significant change from Horizon has been in the provision for growth so that equipments may be added later to meet future capability requirements. The Type 45 design also incorporates a number of features to enable it to support and deploy an Embarked Military Force of 60 troops. In addition, it includes improvements to the operational range in extreme environmental conditions and the development of an Integrated Electric Propulsion system, which will reduce through life costs.
<P>

<a name="31120w29.html_para4">The designed capability of the Astute class submarines has increased in some areas since 1998. These changes comprise: improved weapon handling and discharge; increased weapon stowage capacity, together with an additional torpedo tube; the fitting of Tomahawk missile capability; and the introduction of improved tactical data link capability, which allows joint operational planning to be conducted by co-operating forces and the UK HQ. Also under consideration are options for the inclusion of capability, such as improved navigation and data communications, in the first three boats which was originally planned for later submarines in the Class.
<P>

<a name="31120w29.html_para5">The Joint Strike Fighter project is currently in the Systems Demonstration and Development (SDD) phase. There has been no change in the designed capability of the aircraft since the contract for the SDD phase was let in October 2001. In the previous Concept Demonstration Phase, which began in 1996, the joint UK/US operational requirement was developed to arrive at an affordable solution to satisfy the needs of the UK and the three participating US Services.

 <i>[holding answers 10 September and 11 September 2003]:</i> The Chemical Weapons Convention prohibits the development, production and use of all toxic chemicals and their precursors, except where they are intended for purposes not prohibited under the Convention, as long as the type and quantities are consistent with such purposes. "Purposes not prohibited" includes protective purposes related to protection against chemical weapons, as well as "law enforcement including domestic riot control purposes". United Kingdom armed forces comply with the UK's obligations under international law. We therefore would only carry, and would only use, non-lethal chemical agents for protective purposes related to protection against chemical weapons and for "law enforcement including domestic riot control purposes".

<a name="31120w30.html_para0">Records of out-of-country operational deployments from 1983 to 2003 show only two deployments of 'non-lethal chemical agents' with UK Forces. These were to Bosnia in 1997, and to Kosovo between January and July 1999. UK troops in Bosnia and Kosovo were provided with CS or CR for activities relating to law enforcement activities. The delivery systems that could be used would be by shotgun cartridge or grenade.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to his answer of 30 October 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 320W, on weapons of mass destruction, from which parts of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty the Government derived the conclusion that the UK and other nuclear weapons states are legally entitled to possess nuclear weapons; and if he will make a statement.  [139421]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w30.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 As defined in Article 9(3) of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, the United Kingdom is recognised as one of the five nuclear weapon states.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w30.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Keetch: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what estimate he has made of the cost to the United Kingdom of <i>(a)</i> housing United States nuclear weapons and <i>(b)</i> the planned modernisation of storage facilities for United States nuclear weapons in the United Kingdom; and if he will make a statement.  [139679]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w30.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 All costs associated with the United States visiting forces based in the United Kingdom are subject to confidential cost sharing arrangements between the UK and US Governments. I am therefore withholding the information requested under Exemption 1 (defence, security and international relations) of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how much the Department spent on <i>(a)</i> maintenance, <i>(b)</i> renovation, <i>(c)</i> council tax and <i>(d)</i> running costs of residential properties used by ministers and officials in each year since 1997.  [134686]<P>

<P>
<a name="31120w30.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence provides accommodation for Service personnel (and for United Kingdom based civil servants serving abroad) as a condition of service. Within the Service Families Accommodation stock of some 75,000 properties worldwide are 37 properties known as Official Service Residences. These properties are maintained to a higher than normal standard, owing to the presentational role of the occupant and the requirement for them to host and sometimes accommodate guests of the most senior level, including representatives of overseas states, in their homes. The MOD is also responsible for costs associated with the Government-owned official residence assigned to the Secretary of State for Defence by the Prime Minister during 2002.
<P>

<a name="31120w30.html_para4">Costs for these 37 properties (excluding staff costs and income from charges paid), and those for the residence provided for the Secretary of State for Defence for the last two years are shown in the table. Data prior to this was not collected centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

However, local planning authorities should not create "buffer zones" around designated areas and apply blanket policies that prevent the development of renewable energy resources. Instead, planning authorities should set criteria based policies in plans to cover all parts of their area, including high value landscapes on the outside of National Parks. These policies should then be used for assessing any planning applications for renewable energy projects that are brought forward by developers.

<P>
<P>

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has had frequent meetings with US authorities and representatives of the Coalition Provisional Authority, at which a range of issues relating to Iraq are discussed. The formation of the future government of Iraq is a matter for the Iraqis. On 15 November, Jalal Talabani, President of the Iraqi Governing Council, announces a new plan for establishing a Transitional National Assembly formed through democratic caucus elections at provincial and local levels. At this point, the IGC will dissolve. There will also be an elected Constitutional Convention, leading to full national elections for a new representative Iraqi Government by the end of 2005.

expenditure accounts in respect of <i>(a)</i> sales of oil generated under the UN Oil for Food programme when it was in operation and <i>(b)</i> subsequent sales of oil on the world market; and if this information will be published.  [134992]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w37.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 Maintaining accounts of Iraqi oil sales under the United Nations Oil for Food Programme is a matter for the United Nations. Sales of Iraqi oil on to the world market since the liberation of Iraq have been undertaken by the Iraqi State Oil Marketing Organisation, 95 per cent. of revenues from oil sales have been transferred immediately to the Development Fund for Iraq for use in the reconstruction of Iraq, and 5 per cent. has gone to the United Nations Compensation Commission as required under the terms of UN Security Council Resolution 1483. The accounts of the Development Fund for Iraq are subject to audit by the International Advisory and Monitoring Board (IAMB), comprising representatives of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, United Nations and the Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development. The IAMB will make public all reports produced under its terms of reference.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of whether UN Security Council Resolution 1483 permits the 100 per cent. purchase by foreign companies of all Iraqi economic sectors, excluding only natural resources.  [135762]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w37.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 Resolution 1483 authorises the Coalition to undertake activities to promote economic reconstruction in Iraq, in co-ordination with the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General CPA Order 39 on Foreign Direct Investment permits up to 100 per cent. participation in a new or existing business in Iraq, but does not allow for foreign direct and indirect ownership of the natural resources sector involving primary extraction and initial processing. In addition, this Order does not apply to banks and insurance companies. Foreign direct investment is an important means of promoting employment opportunities and improving social welfare. This Order creates the conditions for much needed capita] to enter the Iraqi economy.
<P>

<a name="31120w37.html_para2">The Government are therefore satisfied that Security Council Resolution 1483 provides a sound legal basis for the policy goals of the CPA Foreign Investment Order. We have also satisfied ourselves through UK officials working within the CPA, and the office of the UK Special Representative for Iraq that co-ordination with the UN has taken place, in consultation with the International Financial Institutions.

In the period since the FCO Human Rights Report was drafted, we assess that there has been some deterioration in the overall human rights situation in Iran.

[139013]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w39.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 Initial reporting by the UN and other organisations indicates that the designation of a "Closed Zone" between the fence and the Green Line is severely hampering Palestinian daily life. Permits, issued by the Israeli authorities, are required for those Palestinians who live and work on land now designated as part of the Closed Zone.
<P>

<a name="31120w39.html_para3">We are concerned that a system of permits will not meet the legitimate needs of affected Palestinians. Other permit systems operated by the Israel Defence Forces can be unaccountable, inconsistent, unappealable and lack transparency. We understand that a number of permanent residents and Palestinians who work in the Closed Zone have been refused permits. Some permanent residents have received permits which are only valid for a limited period of time, and access for vehicles has been limited.
<P>

<a name="31120w39.html_para4">The effect has been to curtail the ability of Palestinians in the Closed Zone to travel and to access basic services. It has also hindered the cultivation and harvest of crops, and the care of livestock in this area. The designation of a Closed Zone is contributing to an already acute humanitarian situation. Staff from the ebassy and Consulate-General visited parts of the Closed Zone on 13 November to see the effect on Palestinians in the area.
<P>

<a name="31120w39.html_para5">We understand Israel's need to take steps, within international law, to protect itself from terrorist attack. But unilateral measures, such as the fence, will not provide lasting security. We are deeply concerned by the route taken by the fence, Its construction on occupied territory creates a further physical obstacle to a two-state solution. We have called on both sides not to take actions which pre-empt a final agreement.
<P>

<a name="31120w39.html_para6">My noble Friend, the Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean, raised our concerns about the Closed Zone between the fence and the Green Line on 22 October with the Israeli ambassador, and on 29 October with the Israeli Minister for National Infrastructure.

 Volunteers who receive motoring expenses are liable to tax only if the amounts received exceed actual expenditure and so they make a profit. Drivers for organised volunteer car schemes who are paid a mileage allowance may choose to calculate any profit by using tax free mileage allowances published by the Inland Revenue. These allowances are intended as a fair estimate of the costs of providing a car, including the costs of fuel.

<a name="31120w45.html_wqn0"><B> Ian Stewart: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what the estimated <i>(a)</i> national insurance contributions and <i>(b)</i> tax revenues would be of the 50,000 seasonal agricultural workers recommended by the Curry Report over their period of employment.  [140190]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w45.html_spnew0"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 People working under the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme are entitled to earn up to the single personal allowance tax free. Most are students engaged during their vacation periods and this is sufficient to remove them from any UK tax liability. SAWS students are not EU nationals and the majority are engaged in agricultural or similar courses in their home countries. This means there is no National Insurance liability for the first 52 weeks of their stay in the UK. It is therefore unlikely that there would be any additional tax or NICs revenue arising from proposals to increase the number of SAWS students.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the advice that has been given to those people who have received a tax credit overpayment of over &#163;5,000; and what alternative methods of repayment have been suggested to them.  [140244]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w45.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Advice on the recovery of overpayments of tax credit is provided by the Inland Revenue's code of practice 26 "What happens if we have paid you too much tax credit?", which is on their internet site www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/taxcredits. A copy of the code has also been placed in the House Library.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, what steps are being taken to increase the take up of child tax credit in Airdrie and Shotts constituency.  [140380]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w45.html_spnew6"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 There are now 5.9 million families benefiting from the Child and Working Tax Credits meaning that, after just seven months, we have reached 98 per cent. of those families we expected to reach over a whole year. National Statistics show that, as at 11 July, there were 5,800 families in Airdrie and Shotts receiving Child or Working Tax Credit, including 5,700 families with children, containing 9,800 children.
<P>

<a name="31120w45.html_para3">A high-profile publicity campaign has been running since September 2002 to alert people to their entitlement to Child Tax Credit (and Working Tax Credit) and to encourage them to claim.
<P>

<a name="31120w45.html_para4">The campaign has so far included national television advertising, local radio advertising across the UK, adverts in the national press as well as on-line publicity and the use of direct mail.

<a name="31120w48.html_para7"><i>Letter from David Anderson to Mr. Andrew Dismore, dated 20 November 2003</i>:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As Jobcentre Plus is an Executive Agency, the Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question about the Jobcentre Plus Vision for London and it's impact on our customers and staff. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It may be helpful if I explain that like the rest of my Agency, London region has embarked on a process of incremental change to deliver modern, effective and responsive services to our customers. Our priority is to provide the best possible service to our customers. The Jobcentre Plus London Vision is a generic title that encompasses a range of Department of Work and Pensions, National Jobcentre Plus and Regional change initiatives to achieve this aim. In general terms and by 2006, I aim to have in place a network of new modernised offices and support services which:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>enhance access and provide improved service to a much larger customer base;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>ensure better value for money through delivery of more efficient processes, and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>provide more satisfying and rewarding jobs for staff in more pleasant and professional working environments.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Part of the change programme which is included in the London Vision, includes initiatives that, over time, will offer wider choice to our customers about how they access support and services. I envisage, for example, that by 2006 many more of those who can will be able to access appropriate services remotely, via Jobseeker Direct, Employer Direct and our network of First Contact Centres for new claims to benefit. To provide the best possible service to our customers within our finite resource a number of our non customer facing roles will be delivered outside of London. The extent and numbers of jobs that will be relocated will be clearer in the new year, once some key decisions are taken about our backroom benefit processing roles. I would however stress that we plan to retain local capacity to provide face-to-face service for customers who cannot take advantage of other means of accessing the help and support they need.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You may be aware of the Department of Work and Pensions Departmental Plans. These plans show that the Department will see a reduction in the number of staff it employs from 130,000 in 2002 to 112,000 in 2006 as part of the Spending Review undertaken in 2002. Jobcentre Plus in London (including existing London region staff based in Scotland and North West England) will see a reduction in the level of full time staff providing services to London Customers from 12,318 in April 2002 to 10,769 in March 2006 according to our latest planning assumptions. Underlying these headline numbers is the ongoing impact of London's dynamic labour market. The region is currently looking to recruit up to 700 new staff into London this year and has a proven track record of recruiting ethnic minorities. I am confident further recruitment will be needed next year.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The introduction of the new Jobcentre Plus services will change the sorts of jobs available to staff in London. By 2006, more of my staff in London and other regions, will be providing face-to-face services to those customers who most need this form of help. It is true that over time the type and location of work will change, but I am confident that there will be jobs for everyone currently working in London.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I know that the London Field Director, Sheelagh Keyse, is keen to assess all aspects of her change programme. Consultation on individual initiatives takes place in the normal progress of business. In addition, and in order to assess the overall strategy, Sheelagh has commissioned a review of the entire London Change Programme led by DWP consultants. This review is due to report

<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w49.html_wqn3"><B> Andrew Selous: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions whether non-resident parents are required to pay child support when paternity is in dispute; and whether the non-resident parent pays the cost of testing to establish paternity, in the first instance. [135993]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w49.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Pond: </B> 
 If parentage is disputed at the outset, in certain circumstances the Child Support Agency can make a presumption of parentage and proceed to enforce a maintenance calculation. Parentage can be presumed where, for example, the alleged father was married to the mother at the time of the child's conception or birth, or where an alleged parent refuses to take a DNA test.
<P>

<a name="31120w49.html_para2">If parentage is questioned after a calculation has been made, the calculation will remain in force. If the alleged non-resident parent turns out not to be the parent of the child the agency makes a full refund of maintenance.
<P>

<a name="31120w49.html_para3">The agency can offer access to DNA tests at a discounted rate. The alleged non-resident parent pays for the test but if they are found not to be the parent of the child the fee is refunded. Where the alleged non-resident parent is unable or unwilling to pay for the test the agency may, in some cases, pay for it in advance. However if the test is positive, the full non-discounted fee will be charged.

 Government proposals for regulating occupational pension schemes are set out in the documents "Simplifying the taxation of pensions: increasing choice and flexibility for all" (published in December 2002) and "Working and Saving for Retirement: Action on Occupational Pensions" (published in June 2003). Where a scheme with a solvent sponsoring employer is winding-up the Government believe that the employer should ensure the scheme has sufficient funds, as assessed on a discontinuance basis, to secure scheme members' expected benefits in full. We therefore propose to introduce a requirement to ensure that, in this situation, the debt on the sponsoring employer will be calculated on a full buy-out basis.
<P>

<a name="31120w49.html_para6">More generally, we propose to replace the minimum funding requirement (MFR) for defined benefit schemes with scheme specific funding requirements. Under our proposals it will be the responsibility of each scheme's trustees, working with the sponsoring employer and the scheme actuary, to develop a funding strategy aimed at ensuring that the scheme is able to meet its long-term pension commitments. Where a scheme is not winding-up we do not believe it would be appropriate to introduce a requirement for its funding to meet any prescribed minimum level as assessed on a discontinuance, or any other, basis.
<P>

<a name="31120w49.html_para7">Improving member protection is a Government priority, which is why we are introducing the new Pension Protection Fund. It will enhance protection for pension scheme members and improve confidence in pension provision in general, by ensuring that members of defined benefit schemes will still receive a meaningful retirement income if their sponsoring employer goes bust and the scheme is under funded.

 The toner used as part of the printing process is an extremely fine powder which in itself is not classed as a substance hazardous to health. However, any dust in substantial concentration may be classed as hazardous as it may cause respiratory tract irritation. In these circumstances the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations (COSHH) place a duty on users of substances hazardous to health to carry out a risk assessment of their activity and to put in place appropriate control measures based on that assessment. Suppliers of substances for use at work also have a duty under the Chemicals (Hazard information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations (CHIP) to provide a safety data sheet with information to help users work with the substances safely.

<a name="31120w52.html_para2">The Cancer Plan gives a commitment to increase the number of cancer consultants working in the NHS by 1,000 by 2006.
<P>

<a name="31120w52.html_para3">Since 1999 the number of cancer consultants has increased by 734, or 22 per cent. This means that the NHS is on track to hit the Cancer Plan target. The National Cancer Director works closely with cancer networks, professional organisations and workforce development confederations to ensure that national decisions about workforce planning reflect the needs of the service.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w52.html_wqn1"><B> Dr. Gibson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to ring-fence spending for cancer services.  [138338]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w52.html_spnew1"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 13 November 2003]:</i> We do not believe ring-fencing money for a specific programme is the way forward. Our overall approach is to set a national strategic direction, underpinned by targets and to devolve greater freedom to front line staff and organisations to give them the freedom to innovate and improve care for patients based on local needs and circumstances.
<P>

<a name="31120w52.html_para4">On 22 May 2003 the National Clinical Director for Cancer published a report that showed that the new money for cancer services announced as part of the NHS Cancer Plan is reaching those services.
<P>

<a name="31120w52.html_para5">On 28 October 2003, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health, announced that this tracking exercise would be repeated for cancer funding allocated in 2003&#150;04.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what percentage of cancer patients received their first definitive treatment within 62 days of referral in each month of the last three years, broken down by cancer type.  [138632]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w52.html_spnew2"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The NHS Cancer Plan sets out our strategy to reduce waiting times for cancer patients. A maximum two-month wait from urgent referral to treatment was introduced for breast cancer in December 2002. Data on performance of this target are collected quarterly and were first published for quarter one, 2003&#150;04 (Apr&#151;Jun 2003), where 97 per cent. of women received their treatment within a month of urgent referral. This target will be in place for all other urgent cases of cancer by 2005. Targets of one month from urgent referral to first treatment were introduced in 2001 for testicular cancer, acute leukaemia and children's cancers. Data on NHS Cancer Plan waiting times targets are published on the Department's website at: www.doh.aov.uk/cancerwaits.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how much has been allocated by his Department to cancer prevention in each of the last three years; and how much was spent in each year.  [136731]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w52.html_spnew3"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Department funds an extensive health improvement and prevention programme aimed chiefly at preventing cancer and coronary heart disease, which are the two main causes of mortality. Funding for programmes on tobacco control and smoking cessation, improving nutrition and diet and increasing physical activity all contribute not only to cancer prevention, but also to preventing coronary heart disease. It is not possible to identify the amount of funding in these programmes that contributes solely to cancer prevention.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w52.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make it his policy to establish dedicated Positron Emission Tomography camera facilities to diagnose lung cancer and evaluate the success of treatment in sites across all strategic health authorities. [140112]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w52.html_spnew4"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 We are aware of the potential benefits Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning can offer patients with lung cancer. The Department is working with national health service specialised commissioners, the PET clinical community and research stakeholders to create a framework to enable the NHS to develop a clear national policy position. This will set out, from the evidence, which tumour groups would benefit from PET scanning, likely future demand, and the optimal configuration and location of PET scanners.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many trained cardiologists are practising in England; how many cardiology students began training in each year since 1997; how many cardiologists qualified in each year since 1997; and what assessment he has made of the optimum number of cardiologists required by the National Health Service.  [138919]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w52.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 As at 30 June 2003, there were 618 consultants in cardiology (trained cardiologists) working in the National Health Service in England.
<P>

<a name="31120w52.html_para6">As undergraduates, medical students do not undertake training in specific specialities, their medical training is of a general nature at this stage of their course. Specialty specific training begins in hospital at postgraduate level. Information on the number of doctors beginning and completing specialty training each year is not collected centrally. The number of postgraduate doctors in training and consultants in cardiology in each year since 1997 is shown in the table.

It is required to make annual recommendations to the workforce numbers advisory board. In its 2003 report, it recommended that there was a need to continue to substantially increase the number of cardiologists. Future growth requirements are being refined and will depend on growth in activity demands and on changes in clinical practice and ways of working.

 As part of the initiative to reduce the burden of bureaucracy on the national health service, the need for all departmental returns, including the KT23 chiropody statistics return, is being re-examined. An internal review is currently in progress. No decision has yet been made with regard to the KT23 return. In the event of a recommendation to amend or abolish the return, formal consultation with interested parties, including the relevant professional organisations, would take place before final decisions were taken.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what health care support services are given to children attending Condover Hall School, Shropshire; [135256]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will estimate the cost of upgrading the building of Condover Hall School to meet national care standards;  [135286]

<P>
<a name="31120w53.html_spnew6"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Non-maintained special schools such as Condover Hall have a general duty in law to supervise and care for the health of their pupils. The school must employ or otherwise secure the attendance of suitably qualified people, including professionals with expertise and experience relevant to the individual health needs of the children there.
<P>

<a name="31120w53.html_para3">Health care will be provided either by the Primary Care Trust (PCT) local to the school or by the child's "home" PCT, contracting with a NHS Trust providing community child health services where necessary. It is not possible to specify the health care support services received by pupils at Condover Hall School, since these will depend on each child's health needs. However, part of the school's continuing duty towards the health of its pupils is to arrange with the Primary Care Trust for periodic medical and dental inspections and for any treatment that may be needed.
<P>

<a name="31120w53.html_para4">Given that health care costs will be dependent on the health needs of each child it is not possible to make overall calculations of the health care costs of children attending Condover Hall School. My Department does not keep central records of the health needs of individual children in schools, including Non-maintained Special Schools; that is the responsibility of each individual school.
<P>

<a name="31120w53.html_para5">Condover Hall School offers 52 week per year placements to pupils and is therefore required to register as a Children's Home with the National Care Standards Commission (NCSC). We understand from the Shrewsbury office of the NCSC that Condover Hall School was inspected at the end of April 2003 and that the report has not yet been finalised. It is, therefore, not possible for me to comment on the school's compliance with the National Minimum Standards for Children's Homes.
<P>

<a name="31120w53.html_para6">As the controlling charity, the Royal National Institute of the Blind (RNIB) would have responsibility for any assessment regarding the impact of the school's closure on pupils' mental health. I understand that RNIB have carried out a full consultation with pupils, parents and staff regarding their plans to close the school.

<a name="31120w53.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The average waiting times for first consultant outpatient appointments following general/dental practitioner written referral in London since 1997 is shown in the table. Progress on reducing maximum waiting times do not necessarily translate into a reduction in the median waiting time, because of shifts in low waiting time bands. Over this period the number of people in London waiting over 26 weeks for their first outpatient appointment fell from 15,100 at end March 1997 to 6 at end March 2003. The equivalent figures for England are over 70,000 to 18 (counting only patients that are the responsibility of NHS Commissioners).

To ask the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to his answer to the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) of 14 October 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 214W, on consultant numbers, exactly how many consultants were planned in the substantial expansion; and exactly how many more new consultants the NHS Plan target provided.  [138194]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w53.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Subject to the necessary resources becoming available, the National Health Service was aiming to provide around 5,000 additional consultants between 1999 and 2004. The NHS Plan put in place the necessary funds and plans to deliver up to 7,500 new consultants between 1999 and 2004.
<P>

<a name="31120w53.html_para8">A range of initiatives has addressed the need for additional growth to achieve this target, including: speeding up specialist registrar to consultant conversion, encouraging the NHS to become a more flexible and diverse employer, increasing investment in training, investing in child care, attracting back returners and running national and international recruitment campaigns.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the effects of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill on dentistry patients.  [139684]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w54.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The Government are committed to rebuilding and restoring national health service dentistry to improve the oral health of the nation. The proposals in the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill, currently before Parliament, represent the most radical reform of NHS dentistry since 1948. Proposals in the Bill will underpin a modernised high-quality primary dental service properly integrated with the rest of the NHS, providing better access and improved patient experience.
<P>

<a name="31120w54.html_para5">Primary care trusts (PCTs) will have a duty to secure the provision of primary dental services to meet all reasonable requirements either through contracts with individual practices or by providing services themselves. PCTs will have a duty to publish information about the primary dental services for which it makes provision. With these new responsibilities will go the &#163;1.2 billion financial resources currently held centrally so that the NHS can secure services locally and develop them in line with local needs.
<P>

<a name="31120w54.html_para6">PCTs will be given directly conferred functions in relation to dental public health, including oral health promotion, surveys and school screening to make a real contribution to reducing oral health inequalities in relation to specific conditions or client groups.




<P>
<P><I>20 Nov 2003 : Column 1374W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31120w54.html_para7">PCTs will be able to commission specialist dental services, such as orthodontics or minor oral surgery from experienced "'high street" dentists operating in readily accessible settings, located for the convenience of patients.
<P>

<a name="31120w54.html_para8">Under proposals in the Bill, dental charges will no longer be related to the dentists' remuneration. The new arrangements will apply nationally and are intended to ensure there is greater clarity about the cost of treatment for both dentists and the public.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the cost was of the recent Doctors' Forum event held at the Novotel Hotel in Hammersmith; and what the <i>(a)</i> objectives and <i>(b)</i> programme for the event were.  [138934]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w55.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The cost of the 2003 Improving Working Lives for Doctors' Conference was &#163;125,000. The event was open to all doctors and to those working in national health service human resource departments as an opportunity to network and share good practice on progress towards our aim of improving the working lives of medical staff. The principal objective was to support our commitment to the development of well-managed, supportive and flexible working environments by showcasing achievements and providing an opportunity to discuss areas where more work is needed. The conference was also a platform to support and promote the work of the doctors' forum, which was established following the first IWL for doctors' conference in 2002. Those who were unable to attend the event can find out more from the summary information on the Department's website at: http://www.doh.gov.uk/conferences/improvingoct03.htm

<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w55.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 Regulations and National Minimum Standards governing domiciliary care were published in January 2003, to come into force from 1 April 2003. Their content followed wide consultation with groups representing service users, care providers, and local authorities. I am satisfied that they support good, professional practice.
<P>

<a name="31120w55.html_para3">The National Care Standards Commission (NCSC) is an independent inspection body. Its role is to ensure compliance with the regulations as part of the conditions for registration of domiciliary care agencies. From 1 April 2004, the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) will take over this role. I am satisfied that the NCSC currently, and the CSCI from April 2004, have the powers they need to monitor compliance and to raise standards.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate he has made of the change in cost to the national health service drug budget resulting from the focus on priority therapeutic areas, as outlined in the new general practitioner contract.  [137361]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w55.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Quality and Outcomes Framework which is part of the new General Medical Services Contract is just one of a variety of related policy initiatives that will impact on the national health service drug budget in the future. The publication of national services frameworks and determinations by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence are other examples. The NHS will take these and other factors into account when modelling future resource provision.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate he has made of the impact of implementing EU Directive 2001/20/EC on non-commercial drug research in the United Kingdom. [138989]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w55.html_spnew5"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 As part of the consultations on the UK regulations, a partial regulatory impact assessment (RIA) was provided revealing potential increased costs. Universities, national health service trusts and charities were invited to submit estimates on recurring and non-recurring compliance costs for non-commercial trials. The comments received revealed the difficulty of estimating costs with so much uncertainty surrounding the Commission Directives.
<P>

<a name="31120w55.html_para4">The Government have taken further steps to attempt to influence the Commission in its consideration of a Commission Directive on Good Clinical Practice and also in reviewing guidance that the Commission published earlier this year with a view to avoiding any unnecessary costs. This work is continuing.
<P>

<a name="31120w55.html_para5">In another initiative designed to reduce the cost impact, the Department and the Medical Research Council are working with experts to find practical solutions to the issues identified in the partial impact assessment. Details of the project can be found at www.ncchta.org/eudirective/index.asp.
<P>

<a name="31120w55.html_para6">Further information on the partial regulatory impact assessment and the proposed United Kingdom implementing regulations is available on the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) website at www.mhra.gov.uk and in the MHRA Consultative Documents: MLXs issued in 2003, MLX 287.

 The research we have commissioned has been on the general effects of fluoridation on health. "A Systematic Review of Fluoridation", carried out by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination of the University of York in the year 2000, cost &#163;79,648.00 and the study of the bio-availability of fluoride, which has just been completed by the University of Newcastle, cost &#163;47,934. In addition, the Medical Research Council (MRC) undertook the study "Water Fluoridation and Health", which was published in 2002, under concordat arrangements with the Department. York identified three studies of goitre and two of cancer of the thyroid gland, none of which showed a statistically significant association with fluoridation. The MRC also noted that attention has been given to cancers of the stomach, kidney and thyroid, because fluoride is usually absorbed in the stomach and can be concentrated in the kidneys and thyroid, but concluded that,

 It is for local organisations and health visiting teams to determine how they should best be deployed to meet local needs and circumstances. As primary care trusts have reviewed their services in the light of the national health visitor development programme and the primary care nursing framework, "Liberating the Talents", different models have emerged as most appropriate to the local situation. In some areas, health visitors have found that geographical working enables them to focus more readily on health determinants within the community and work with a range of partners to address these.
<P>

<a name="31120w56.html_para7">Geographical working may be particularly appropriate in some inner city areas where a number of general practices serve the same geographical population. In other places, where the general practitioner practice population corresponds more readily to a geographical area, health visiting teams have valued the close relationship with other primary health care team members that attachment or alignment with general practice can bring.

 The Department of Health no longer holds central records of the resources allocated to HIV treatment and prevention by primary care trusts (PCTs).

<a name="31120w57.html_spnew6"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Members of black and minority ethnic communities, including the Indian community, are not a homogeneous group for health status, disease patterns or health behaviour. A number of studies, including Sir Donald Acheson's 'Independent Inquiry into Inequalities in Health', have shown that there are significant health inequalities among people from black and minority ethnic communities. These inequalities relate to differences in disease prevalence, differential access to services and differential delivery and take-up of services.
<P>

<a name="31120w57.html_para8">According to the Health Survey for England (1999), Indians experience higher rates of heart disease, diabetes and strokes. Women born in India have a 40 per cent. higher suicide rate than those born in England and Wales. The survey also found that oral cancer has a very high prevalence among the South Asian community (Indian, Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Sri Lankan), and rates of uptake of cervical screening among South Asian women are less than half those amongst the general population.
<P>

<a name="31120w57.html_para9">The Department of Health's strategy for meeting the needs of minority ethnic communities is to set action on race equality within the overall framework for planning and delivering the Department's priorities.
<P>

<a name="31120w57.html_para10">The NHS Plan recognises that we live in a diverse society and that ethnicity can be a key factor in health inequalities. The plan sets out as core principles that the national health service will shape its services around the needs of the patient, be responsive to the needs of different groups and individuals within society, including challenging racial discrimination.
<P>

<a name="31120w57.html_para11">In October 2003 the Department published "Delivering Race Equality: A Framework for Action" as a consultation document on black and minority ethnic health setting out what those planning, delivering and monitoring local primary care and mental health services for people from black and minority ethnic communities.
<P>

<a name="31120w57.html_para12">The Department is committed to transforming the NHS so that it produces faster, fairer services with equity of access for all. The creation of more equal access for black and minority ethnic people is an integral and vital aspect of the Department's programme of investment and reform.

<a name="31120w58.html_para2">For doctors, the content and standard of postgraduate medical training is the responsibility of the United Kingdom competent authorities, the specialist training authority for specialist medicine and, for general practice, the joint committee on postgraduate training for general practice, which will both be replaced by the postgraduate medical education and training board. Their role is that of custodians of quality standards in postgraduate medical education and practice. They are independent of the Department. In addition, the General Medical Council's education committee has the general function of promoting high standards of medical education and co-ordinating all stages of medical education to ensure that students and newly qualified doctors are equipped with the knowledge, skills and attitudes essential for professional practice.
<P>

<a name="31120w58.html_para3">All of these bodies have a vested interest in ensuring that doctors are equipped to deal with the issues they will encounter in practice&#151;including where appropriate, those relating to infection control.

 The national service framework (NSF) for long term conditions will focus on improving the standard of neurology services across England.

<a name="31120w59.html_para4">Additionally, as part of the process of developing the NSF work is in hand to consider relevant work force issues such as the need for increased numbers of staff but also for new ways of working, including skill mix, role extensions and multi-disciplinary working, based around patient needs. We expect that the group looking at these workforce issues will make recommendations on the future supply of professionals and development of new ways of working to inform national workforce planning processes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the backlog maintenance cost to reach estate code condition was in each English region for <i>(a)</i> NHS trusts and <i>(b)</i> mental health trusts in the last six years.  [137367]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w59.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 10 November 2003]:</i> The backlog of maintenance should be seen in the context of a National Health Service estate in England comprising 25 million square metres, with a book value of &#163;24 billion and a replacement cost of around &#163;72 billion. Current record investment of &#163;4 billion in 2003&#150;04, rising to over &#163;6 billion in 2005&#150;06, will regenerate the NHS estate and reduce maintenance because by 2040, 40 per cent. of the estate will be less than 15 years old.
<P>

<a name="31120w59.html_para5">The information requested is shown in the tables.
<P>

<a name="31120w59.html_para6">Backlog maintenance covers a wide variety of conditions, including that which is just below compliance standard. The figures provided do not indicate levels of risk to patients. Trusts manage high-risk deficiencies as a priority in order to ensure that premises are intrinsically safe and not of concern to local enforcement bodies.

 The Department of Health does not capture central information about the numbers of people with depression that varies seasonally. Diagnosis of depression is a matter for the responsible clinician taking into account all the various factors that may contribute. Although seasonal affective disorder is not listed in the International Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders (ICD-10), we do understand that there are a number of people that appear to be affected in this way. Whatever the causes, and we do not fully understand them all, serious depression is a matter of

 I have been asked to reply.

<a name="31120w61.html_para2">No performance targets were set for the Adoption Register for England and Wales. It is expected that the Register will help us achieve our target to increase the number of adoptions from care by 50 per cent. by 2006. We have already increased adoptions by 25 per cent. and are on course to meet our target. Given the complexities governing the placement of children with adoptive families, we did not feel it would be appropriate to set a target for the Register. Our aim of course is to provide children with placements that meet their assessed needs. The needs of the children must be paramount in the process and it is vital that the Register provides viable links for suitable families who may be able to deal with the children's often very complex needs.
<P>

<a name="31120w61.html_para3">In just one year the Register has become an established part of the adoption process with a national co-ordinating role. The register has generated 1,250 viable links across England and Wales that were agreed as worth exploring in detail by adoption agencies. At the end of October there had been 48 matches made between children and families. This means that there are 48 children who have found families as a result of links generated by the Register.

 The Paddington Health Campus will have provision for 1088 inpatient beds.

The original forecast projected bed numbers was approximately 1,000. The campus that is now planned is 20 per cent, larger in size and will treat a higher number of acutely ill patients.

 The Department does not collect data on the number of patient advice and liaison services (PALS). Strategic health authorities (SHAs) are responsible for monitoring the implementation of PALS and in February 2003 they reported to the Department that 98 per cent. of NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) had an active PALS. In responding to the recent Health Select Committee Public Expenditure Inquiry in October 2003, the SHAs established that, of the 15 NHS trusts and PCTs that did not have an active PALS at the time of the February report, 14 now have a PALS in place. The remaining trust currently provides a limited service, which is expected to be fully operational by December 2003.

 An active Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) is a service identified by its trust as working to deliver the published core PALS service standards.
<P>

<a name="31120w63.html_para1">NHS trusts and primary care trusts are responsible for establishing PALS that deliver the core PALS service standards published by the Department.

 Following publication of the National Cancer Patient Survey in July 2002, the Department of Health commissioned a further analysis of the data to inform the development of future surveys. This was an exploratory piece of work to see if there were any inter-dependencies that might affect the patient experience. The output will not be a formal report but rather a series of detailed statistical tables.

<a name="31120w64.html_para11">The figures shown are estimates based on aggregate data, categorised into waiting time bands, and do not reflect shifts in the waiting time profiles within these bands, only between bands. The median is not very sensitive to reductions in maximum waiting times, and it is possible to see a rise in the median, while reducing maximum waiting times because of shifts in low time bands. Short-term progress on delivering maximum waiting times (including in-year tail-gunning) will not necessarily translate into a reduction in the median waiting time. Our policy, therefore, is to focus attention on the number of patients waiting the longest, and in each waiting time band.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

<i>Admissions</i><P>

Admissions are defined as the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<P>

<i>Grossing</i><P>

Figures are grossed for both coverage and missing/invalid clinical data, except for 2001&#150;02 which is not yet adjusted for shortfalls.<P>

<i>Main Operation</i><P>

The main operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set, and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, e.g. Time Waited, but the figures for "all operations count of episodes" give a more complete count of episodes with operations.<P>

<i>Time Waited</i><P>

Time waited statistics from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<P>

These re-designs were supported by usability testing (observing users carrying out specified tasks). Tracking research was conducted late in 2002 to assess progress and further inform future development.

<a name="31120w65.html_para2">In November 2002 the Department began working with the Office of the e-Envoy to migrate the Department's website to the new Central Government Infrastructure. As part of this process and based on the findings of the user research exercises and feedback from website users, all content was reviewed. The Department is now in the process of implementing major improvements which will address the key needs of site users, namely the site structure, more targeted quality content, improved searching, consistency of design and branding, improved navigation and meeting accessibility standards for users with disabilities. The new website will go live at the end of 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what percentage of UK funds directed towards the CERN project is being treated as capital against resource.  [139061]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w66.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 At this point in time, the UK subscription to CERN is not formally divided into capital and resource and is currently regarded as resource expenditure. This is an area of discussion between HM Treasury, the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council and my department. It should be noted that CERN is currently in the middle of a 12 year, Euro3.2 billion project to construct the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which will be the world's most powerful particle accelerator. Its expected commissioning date is April 2007.
<P>

<a name="31120w66.html_para0">Whilst capital spend at CERN will fall to almost zero in 2007 when the LHC machine is completed, CERN have negotiated a loan to facilitate the expenditure profile with a repayment schedule to 2011. This will mean that a proportion of the UK subscription will be used for capital repayment to 2011. In parallel, as the operations and exploitation phase begins, an increasing fraction of the UK subscription will be devoted to meeting the associated operating costs. The following table of capital expenditure is estimated by taking the UK's share of CERN's capital spending plans.

 The Government believes the key to protecting consumers from the adverse effects of such practices as the unsolicited sending of credit card cheques is ensuring responsible lending&#151;expecting the industry to carry out adequate checks before sending credit card cheques; and ensuring all information is adequate and transparent. We are not currently considering introducing measures to ban the unsolicited sending of credit card cheques. Our approach is to empower consumers to make informed decisions. To this end we will outline measures in the Consumer Credit White Paper to ensure responsible lending across the range of lending practices.

The industry is introducing measures to ensure greater transparency in the issuing of credit card cheques, including the information provided to consumers; and I have asked my officials to work with the industry to examine what further measures are necessary to address the concerns raised by the Treasury Select Committee.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment her Department has made of the effect of a failure of the continental gas interconnector on electricity generation in the United Kingdom.  [132437]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w67.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The DTI-Ofgem "Joint Energy Security of Supply Working Group" (JESS) monitors security of supply of gas and electricity in Great Britain. JESS's work has included discussion of NGT's "Winter Operations Report 2003/04" which assesses the outlook for electricity and gas supplies in the coming winter. The report was published on 14 October, and is available, with Ofgem's comments, on Ofgem's website (www.ofgem.gov.uk). It covered the interaction between electricity generation and gas supply.
<P>

<a name="31120w67.html_para1">NGT's overall assessment for electricity supply in the Great Britain (GB) for this winter was that while the generation margin has risen slightly, it was lower than in previous years, but there would be enough power to meet the forecast demand for electricity this winter under all but the most exceptional circumstances.
<P>

<a name="31120w67.html_para2">NGT's report noted that of the CCGT stations, all but 2.7 GW either have firm gas contracts or are able to use alternative fuels. This represents some 4 per cent. of the total generating capacity that NGT projected for this winter.
<P>

<a name="31120w67.html_para3">Since NGT's report was issued further generating plant has returned from mothball.
<P>

<a name="31120w67.html_para4">In prolonged severe winter weather, delivery of sufficient gas to meet demand (including for electricity generation) would depend on high production levels from the UKCS, and the availability of gas from storage and through the continental gas interconnector.
<P>

<a name="31120w67.html_para5">The interconnector has proved reliable when it is in import mode. As with any offshore infrastructure, the loss of a large supply source would reduce the resilience of the gas network and reduce the availability of gas-fired generation to the electricity network. However, there are strong financial incentives on parties to the 



<P>
<P><I>20 Nov 2003 : Column 1421W</I><P>
interconnector to reduce the incidence and extent of any failures. Furthermore, in recent winters the interconnector has operated mainly in export mode.
<P>

<a name="31120w67.html_para6">NGT are taking a number of steps to reduce the risks to electricity supply that they have identified in the Winter Operations report. For example, they have recently undertaken a tender for additional reserve generating capacity.

 The Department of Trade and Industry has not conducted a formal assessment of the costs of these events on electricity consumers.
<P>

<a name="31120w67.html_para7">The London event affected some 476,000 consumers and the Midlands event affected some 201,000 consumers. In both cases power supplies were restored to all consumers within an hour.
<P>

<a name="31120w67.html_para8">The Department recognises that the consequences of these power failures were serious, with disruption to surface rail, underground street lights and traffic systems, water supply and sewerage systems as well as to electricity users in homes and workplaces.
<P>

<a name="31120w67.html_para9">The Department submitted a memorandum to the Trade and Industry Committee on 14 November 2003 which explains the Department's role in investigating the circumstances of these events, and includes a discussion on specific lessons to be learned from these events and from other recent major power interruptions in America and Europe.

 Industry has been made aware of the new export control legislation proposals since they were first proposed in the White Paper in 1998, and all the major companies and organisations have been in direct contact with Government. The Government has provided a full six-month implementation period for the new controls it gives industry adequate time to understand them and prepare. The DTI has published detailed user guidance on the new controls, developed with industry input and including details of a number of new open licences available. The DTI is also running a series of seminars to raise awareness and understanding of the new controls, and how to comply. Further seminars, and also workshops and regional roadshows will be organised by Trade Associations with DTI participation in the New Year. The DTI is also enclosing notices with export licences alerting exporters to the new controls and sources of information. DTI Compliance Officers are advising companies of the new obligations during routine compliance visits. DTI officials will continue to work closely with industry representatives to monitor the progress of the awareness campaign during the implementation period.

 Responsibility for the control of arms manufacture in the UK is shared between several Government Departments. The Ministry of Defence takes responsibility for the markings required for defence equipment procured for use by HM Forces. The Home Office requires, under the Firearms Rules 1998, that all firearms manufacturers and dealers keep detailed records to include make, calibre, identification number and maker's name of all firearms. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is responsible for coordinating the UK implementation and support for the UN programme of action on Small Arms and Light Weapons. The DTI has responsibility for the export licensing of strategic goods and considers export licence applications in consultation with other Government Departments.

<a name="31120w69.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Earlier this month my Department and Ofgem published the third report by the Joint Energy Security of Supply Working Group ("JESS"). JESS was set up to assess the risks to the UK's future gas and electricity supplies.
<P>

<a name="31120w69.html_para5">The JESS report highlights both the level of existing potential gas capacity, and the very significant levels of proven, probable and possible future investments over the next 10 years. It identifies a number of potential supply-side developments, including additional import connections with Norway; new LNG import terminals; more interconnection with continental Europe; upgrades to existing interconnectors; and additional gas storage capacity.
<P>

<a name="31120w69.html_para6">The report concludes that the market can respond to the demand for gas in the next decade (including peak gas demand or sustained high demand), by drawing on maximum supplies from existing and proposed new developments, including some of those which at present are less certain.
<P>

<a name="31120w69.html_para7">Meanwhile the recent agreement with the Norwegian Government will facilitate the development of projects that could meet some 20 per cent. of UK gas demand from 2007.
<P>

<a name="31120w69.html_para8">JESS has also been considering demand-side flexibility, including the responsiveness of the market to high prices at periods of high gas demand. Voluntary reductions in consumption by major consumers, if technically and commercially feasible, could play a significant role in balancing the market in such circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w70.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 It is not possible to estimate the total number of people who have benefited from the minimum wage since its introduction. This is because the actual beneficiaries are likely to change each year as people move into or from low paid jobs. It is also not possible to provide specific estimates of the number of people who have benefited from the minimum wage by parliamentary constituency. However we estimate that around 1.2 million people stood to benefit when the minimum wage was introduced in April 1999 and that 1&#150;1.2 million people stood to benefit from the rate increases that took place last month.
<P>

 The arrangements in place for reprocessing of overseas spent fuel contain options for return of wastes. The Government intend that such options should be exercised and that wastes arising from reprocessing be returned to the country of origin. It has been the practice of successive Governments to obtain, before a contract for the reprocessing of foreign spent fuel is signed, assurances from the relevant government that it will take no legislative or regulatory steps to prevent the return of wastes arising under the contract.

 The Renewables Obligation, which requires licensed electricity suppliers to supply a specified proportion of electricity from renewable sources reaching 10.4 per cent by 2010, is our main vehicle for encouraging renewables. Under the Obligation companies generating electricity from eligible renewable sources for their own use, for example, in a factory they own, can benefit from the Obligation. They can do this by making an arrangement to sell that renewable electricity to a licensed supplier and to buy the same electricity back for their own use. The electricity sold and bought back will be eligible for Renewables Obligation Certificates.
<P>

<a name="31120w72.html_para4">In addition, electricity derived from renewable sources may be eligible for exemption from the Climate Change Levy.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport which British ports have facilities for treating ballast from ships.  [140421]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w72.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 All ports are required to provide waste reception facilities which are adequate to receive waste from ships normally using the port. However, the discharge of clean ballast water is not yet controlled by legislation and as such no ports in the UK have facilities for treating ballast water to reduce the threat of non-indigenous species invasion through ballast water exchange at sea.
<P>

<a name="31120w72.html_para6">If ballast water is contaminated by oil onboard an oil tanker then the discharge and treatment of this water is strictly controlled by oil pollution regulations. Some oil terminals, such as Flotta in Scapa Flow in Orkney, have 



<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many incidents involving ships clearing out their ballast tanks there have been in <i>(a)</i> British waters and <i>(b)</i> Liverpool Bay in each year over the past 20 years; how many prosecutions have resulted; and what actions he is taking to prevent ships from clearing out their ballast tanks in British waters  [140422]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w72.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The discharge of clean ballast water is not yet controlled by legislation and the UK do not keep records of this operation either in British Waters or in Liverpool Bay, or require that vessels do so.
<P>

<a name="31120w72.html_para7">However, existing legislation does impose strict controls on the discharge of oily ballast water. This is enforced by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) through means such as aerial surveillance and inspections on vessels. As of 1 August 1999, all discharges of oil are strictly controlled in North West European waters as designated under International Convention. In the prosecutions that the MCA have secured it is very difficult to apportion the discharge to contaminated ballast water.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport pursuant to his answer of 13 November 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 436W, on decommissioning (American ships), what steps he is taking to ensure further US ships follow the advice of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.  [139949]<P>

 The Maritime and Coastguard Agency has approved passage plans for the ships in question and will do so in future transits of this kind, as well as monitor ship movements against the approved plans. Flexibility must be provided for legitimate and safe alterations to the precise routes followed when circumstances justify such amendments. The Secretary of State can intervene only if the ships are in UK waters. At that point, he may give a direction only if it is necessary for securing the safety of the ship, other ships, persons or property or for preventing or reducing significant pollution.

 The Department for Transport was formed on 29 May 2002. It does not have any residential properties used by Ministers. A small number of residential properties are used by officials&#151;for example coastguards&#151;as an essential part of their operational duties. Details could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport pursuant to his answer of 30 June 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 2W, on driving licences, if he will make a statement on the nature of the detailed research to ensure ease of completion of the driving licence application form; what process was used to undertake the research; what the results were; and what measures he has taken to implement its findings.

<a name="31120w74.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 To improve customer service a new driving licence application form, fulfilling the functions of two previously separate forms, was introduced in May 2003. As part of its development research was conducted to assess the effectiveness and ease of use of the form and its accompanying information leaflet. Testing was supported by a specialist research organisation and the Plain English Campaign. DVLA 'road tested' the literature using a wide variety of suitable organisations in both the public and private sector, a cross section of members of the general public and, a selection of school children approaching driving age. Over 90 per cent. of participants found the form easy to complete. A number of suggestions from test subjects were also adopted helping to improve layout and content.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what the level of public subsidy is <i>(a)</i> per passenger mile travelled, <i>(b)</i> per passenger and <i>(c)</i> per head of population for (i) rail, (ii) light rail and (iii) bus passenger transport in (A) England and (B) each English region for the latest year for which figures are available. [135088]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w75.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McNulty  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 3 November 2003]:</i> The form subsidy takes differs from one transport mode to another. Information on each mode is not available in the form requested, but the available data shows:
<P>

<a name="31120w75.html_para0"><i>(i) Rail</i>
<P>

<a name="31120w75.html_para1">In 2001&#150;02 we provided public subsidy of just over &#163;1 billion for railways in Great Britain. It is not possible to give rail figures for England only, nor is it possible to give any regional breakdown for rail subsidy. In Great Britain, the rail subsidy per passenger mile was 4 pence. The subsidy per passenger journey was &#163;1.08. If calculated per head of population it was &#163;18.16.
<P>

<a name="31120w75.html_para2"><i>(ii) Light rail</i>
<P>

<a name="31120w75.html_para3">There is no subsidy payment from central government to light rail operators, although the promoters of the schemes pay a form of subsidy through additional Revenue Support Grant payments resulting from the previous issue of Private Finance Initiative Credits. The Tyne and Wear Metro differs from other light rail in that it is treated as part of the national rail system for the purpose of revenue support. In addition, all light rail operators receive reimbursement for concessionary fares for older people, disabled people and children, on the same basis as local bus services.
<P>

<a name="31120w75.html_para4"><i>(iii) Bus</i>
<P>

<a name="31120w75.html_para5">In 2001&#150;02 we provided public subsidy of &#163;1.2 billion for buses in England. It is not possible to give a regional breakdown, other than for London, as an element of subsidy, Bus Service Operators Grant, is paid directly to the operators. For England, bus subsidy per passenger mile is not available. Subsidy per passenger journey was 31 pence. If calculated per head of population in England it was &#163;24. For London, bus subsidy per passenger mile was 12 pence, or 27 pence per passenger journey. When calculated per head of resident London population, it was &#163;53.60. This appears high as population data exclude non-residents and tourists who use buses in London.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many miles of railway line there are in <i>(a)</i> the UK and <i>(b)</i> Scotland which are defined as (i) primary route, (ii) London and South East commuter route, for the UK, (iii) main secondary route, (iv) other secondary route, <i>(v)</i> rural route and (vi) freight route.

<a name="31120w76.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Strategic Rail Authority's Strategy 'Specification of Network Outputs' classifies heavy rail routes in Great Britain into six broad categories. The route lengths under each category for <i>(a)</i> Great Britain and <i>(b)</i> Scotland are as follows: (i) primary routes <i>(a)</i> 8,859 km <i>(b)</i> 527 km; (ii) London and South East commuter routes <i>(a)</i> 3,722 km <i>(b)</i> not applicable; (iii) main secondary routes <i>(a)</i> 4,487 km <i>(b)</i> 1,367; (iv) other secondary routes <i>(a)</i> 7,214 km <i>(b)</i> 1,205 km; (v) rural routes <i>(a)</i> 3,533 km <i>(b)</i> 715 km; (vi) other freight only routes <i>(a)</i> 2,565 km <i>(b)</i> 247 km. The SRA Strategy provides for the acceleration of maintenance and renewal activity on the busiest parts of the network. These carry 80 per cent. of all passenger traffic and 70 per cent. of freight traffic. Maintenance and renewal costs on other routes will be at an appropriate level to reflect their actual usage. It will not compromise safety. This approach makes common sense.

 In the Government's Green Paper "Every Child Matters" we set out our aim to share information across services and ensure professionals know of each others concerns at an early stage. To achieve this, we are proposing a local information hub in every local authority to enable professionals in all the local services which impact on children's lives to cross-reference knowledge, where appropriate, with other local children's services.

 Social Services Departments currently use a variety of methods for collecting and sharing information on children. The answer to ensuring child protection is not in the use of computer systems alone. We need practitioners to share information at an early stage about children who may be at risk of falling through the net. We propose in the Green Paper "Every Child Matters" to introduce local information sharing hubs in every local authority to help identify early indications that a child is in need of specialised support through the bringing together of the knowledge and expertise held by all local children's services.

 In considering applications for contact (visitation rights) the courts apply the principle, enshrined in the Children Act 1989, that any decision must be based on what is in the child's best interest. We have amended the Children Act 1989 to extend the definition of harm to include harm to a child caused by witnessing domestic violence. We will commence this new provision as soon as resources allow. In 2001 the Government endorsed guidelines on contact and domestic violence produced by the Children Act Sub-Committee of the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Board on Family Law. The guidelines have been promulgated and are being monitored and evaluated by research. I will shortly be announcing successful applicants for new supervised child contact centres, funded through joint Children's Fund/Sure Start funding.

We aim to announce early in the New Year which proposals will be proceeding in 2005&#150;06 and, in March, we will announce a further, larger group of LEAs for the following years. The Government have committed itself in BSF to a long-term programme of rebuilding and renewal to ensure that secondary education in every part of England has facilities of 21st century standard.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills whether the Project Board to integrate finance, communication, human resources and case recording systems has been established by CAFCASS.  [138759]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w78.html_spnew8"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 A project was started in 2001 to develop an integrated case management system, including finance and human resources. This project was stopped as it was judged to be too high a risk. Government best practice is to reduce risk by breaking down large IT projects into smaller, more manageable, parts. Separate finance and payroll systems have now been procured by CAFCASS.
<P>

<a name="31120w78.html_para2">A case recording project is now under way, to implement the key information elements for case management. A Project Board, chaired by the Chief Executive is managing this work. The case recording system is being designed to be compatible with the systems in place and those to be developed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w78.html_spnew9"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 In its first year, CAFCASS implemented an IT infrastructure giving all staff access to email, word processing, spreadsheet, internet and intranet facilities. By building on this infrastructure CAFCASS will be able to implement, from May 2004, a case recording system for &#163;125,000.
<P>

<a name="31120w78.html_para3">This will provide a national networked case database. Maintenance of the system, including amending children's records, will be an administrative rather than a practitioner function.

Once the case recording system is successfully implemented, further work will be done on the options and costs for further development and implementation of the remaining aspects of case management systems support.

<a name="31120w79.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The Government set out in the Green Paper "Every Child Matters" our intention to legislate for the appointment of a Children's Commissioner as a new voice for all children and young people. The Green Paper indicates that the Commissioner should advise Government and engage with others, such as business and the media, whose decisions and actions affect children's lives. The Commissioner would ensure that the views of children and young people are heard, and report to Parliament through the Secretary of State for Education and Skills on progress against the outcomes for children set out in the Green Paper. Further details on the responsibilities and resources of the Commissioner will be made available in the light of the consultation, which runs until 1 December.

 145 inspections of children's homes were carried out in Somerset during the year ended 31 March 2002. The number of homes due to be inspected in that year was 77, each home would expect to have

<P><I>20 Nov 2003 : Column 1466W</I><P>

<a name="31120w79.html_para1">In 2002&#150;03, NCSC Inspectors carried out 60 announced inspections and 30 unannounced inspections of children's homes in Somerset.
<P>

<a name="31120w79.html_para2">It is expected that the NCSC will perform two inspections per year (one announced and one unannounced). However, as 2002&#150;03 was the first year in which the NCSC was operational it should be taken into account that a large proportion of homes would not have been registered until the latter part of that year.

 There are six child contact centres in Wales that are members of the National Association of Child Contact Centres (NACCC). These child contact centres are run on a voluntary basis and raise funds from a variety of sources. Two benefit from partnership funding from the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service. All NACCC member child contact centres will benefit from funding by the Children's Fund of NACCC's Change Programme. NACCC is using this funding to develop clear accreditation standards for all its member contact centres. Child contact centres may also seek support from funds (such as Cymorth) provided by the Welsh Assembly Government, where centres provide or seek to provide services in line with the Assembly Government's devolved responsibilities. The Welsh Assembly Government is currently giving careful consideration to the way forward for supervised contact services in Wales.

It proposes the creation of Directors of Children's Services, accountable for local authority education and children's social services. This builds on practice in a number of local authorities. We are currently working with local authorities to identify how many authorities have integrated education and children's social services and have Directors of Children's Services.

<P>
<a name="31120w80.html_spnew13"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 Information on the cost of foundation degrees and honours degrees is not identified separately. The Higher Education Funding Council for England funds honours degree and foundation degree courses on the basis of the same formula which varies according to subject, institutional and student factors. This funding for teaching is allocated to institutions as a block grant and how they allocate this is for them to determine. Institutions also receive funding from other sources both public and private and may use it to subsidise some courses or faculties. The actual cost may therefore vary between institutions and subjects.
<P>

<a name="31120w80.html_para7">The Higher Education Funding Council for England are currently consulting on possible changes to their funding method for teaching and one proposal is that a 10 per cent. premium is introduced for foundation degrees for the short term. This would recognise the higher costs associated with partnerships between higher education institutions, further education colleges and employers. The consultation closed for comments on 14 November.

 The annual grant letter to the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) of 22 January 2003 set out the planned increases in full-time equivalent student numbers up to 2005&#150;06. The spending plans assume a national increase of 56,000 places between 2003&#150;04 and 2005&#150;06 compared to the plans for 2002&#150;03.

Of these 1,263 will be in higher education establishments in Merseyside. There are no higher education institutions in St Helens. No further education colleges in St Helens have been allocated additional places for higher education courses in this bidding round.

<a name="31120w82.html_para2">Spearheading action is the creation of a network of 400 Specialist Sports Colleges and School Sport Partnerships (families of schools that come together to provide additional sports opportunities for all children). A third of schools in England are already benefiting from being within a school sport partnership. All partnerships set specific targets to increase participation of groups (including girls) that traditionally can be marginalised by PE and sport. Additionally there are five girls' only sports colleges.

<P>
<a name="31120w84.html_spnew7"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Contact by Sure Start local programmes is defined to mean that a child aged 0&#150;3 and their parent or carer has taken up services. This might be a home visit, or participation in a centre based activity such as child care or a playgroup, parenting or smoking cessation class, or a child health check. Visits to families of new born babies include visits by programme staff, and routine visits by midwives and health visitors provided they inform the family about Sure Start services. Information is not collected separately on whether the visit to a family of a new born baby was by a member of the programme's staff, a midwife or a health visitor.

 The income of cohabiting partners and new partners is not currently taken into account in the assessment of residual income for the exemption or remission of tuition fees unless the student has been formally adopted.

<a name="31120w86.html_para0">For students entering teacher training courses, there has been a progressive shift over many years from BEd to PGCE courses; only the BEd courses are covered by UCAS. Following the Roberts Review, which looked into the supply of people with science, technology, engineering and mathematics skills, we have introduced a number of initiatives designed to improve staffing and the teaching environment of these subjects, including additional funding for pay and for the development of university science infrastructure.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what <i>(a)</i> representations and <i>(b)</i> discussions he has had in the last 12 months with <i>(i)</i> Connexions and (ii) other agencies on young people aged between 16 and 24 who are not in work, education, training or a new deal programme; what estimate he has made of the number of young people who fell into that category in the last year for which figures are available; and if he will make a statement.  [139446]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31120w86.html_spnew3"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 We have had no representations from Connexions or other agencies on this matter. We have set the Connexions service a target to reduce the number of 16 to 18-year-olds who are not in education, employment or training by 10 per cent. by November 2004. The baseline date from which this will be measured is November 2002.
<P>

<a name="31120w86.html_para1">The New Deal for Young People is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. Entry is mandatory for all 18 to 24-year-olds who have been claiming Jobseeker's Allowance continuously for six months. The scheme has helped nearly 450,000 young people move into work.
<P>

<a name="31120w86.html_para2">According to estimates from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) around 700,000 or 12.25 per cent. of 16 to 25-year-olds in England were not in Employment, Education or Training in winter 2002&#150;03. Around a third of these were women with dependent children.
