<p><a name="51012w01.html_spnew0"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 The information requested can be provided only at disproportionate cost. The Department would need to divert significant resources from day to day operational matters to compare the invoice and billing addresses on its financial systems of those companies with whom it trades, with the registered trading addresses of those companies held at Companies House and then, determine whether any contractors had their primary headquarters based in other EU states.

<p><a name="51012w01.html_spnew1"><b> Jim Knight: </b>

<p><a name="51012w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many vessels from countries which joined the EU in 2004 fished within the UK&#039;s 200 mile/median line limit in the latest period for which figures are available; and if she will make a statement.  [16847]</p>




<p><a name="51012w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The information as requested is not readily available, and as such what information is available is given as follows.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51012w01.html_para3">
On joining the EU, the new member states only received very limited allocations of quotas related to any fish stocks involving the waters within British fishery limits. Based on the information reported by these new and the existing member states on the activity by the new member states vessels in 2004, no reported catches of quota stocks involving the areas covered by British fishery limits took place. UK fisheries Departments have details related to activity by such vessels when it results in landings of fish at a UK port. For 2004, these show that while there were landings by some Polish vessels into the UK, they did not involve any activity within British fishery limits.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51012w01.html_para4">
Information is available from the UK fishing vessel monitoring system, which records observations of UK and fishing vessels registered in other countries while present within British fishery limits. These observations are based on satellite monitoring information for larger vessels and also aerial and naval sightings of vessels. The satellite reporting system does not cover the full fleets of the member states in question, but does cover the larger vessels that are more likely to make the journeys required to fish in UK waters. Similarly the system records the location of vessels but not if they were actually fishing at the time of the report. Based on the overall vessel monitoring reports available, since the accession of the new member states on 1 May 2004, there have been only three vessels from the new member states observed as present within British fishery limits&#151;one each from Estonia, Lithuania and Poland.

<a name="51012w01.html_sbhd3"><h3 align=center>Hazardous Waste Regulations</h3>


<p><a name="51012w01.html_wqn4"><b> Bill Wiggin: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what assessment she has made of the effects of the hazardous waste regulations on the construction industry;  [14999]
</p>



<p>(2) what the definition of occupy is for the purposes of the hazardous waste regulations, with regard to the mobile services tenure restriction for exemption from notification to the Environment Agency;  [15000]
</p>



<p>(3) whether construction contractors are considered for the purposes of the hazardous waste regulations to occupy the premises on which they work;  [15001]




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>12 Oct 2005 : Column 473W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>



<p>(4) whether the number of registrations anticipated by the Environment Agency as a result of the hazardous waste regulations includes construction sites.  [15002]</p>




<p><a name="51012w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Environment Agency are responsible for enforcing the new regulations and it has confirmed that, in some circumstances, it will consider sub-contractors working at construction sites to be mobile service operators. The agency would normally expect a construction company producing hazardous waste at a construction site to notify those premises. However, where a producer is genuinely carrying out a mobile service at a site, such as a painter and decorator, the mobile service provisions would apply as long as that person produces less than 200kg at those premises in any period of 12 months.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51012w01.html_para5">
As far as the tenure restriction (i.e. that the operator of the mobile service neither owns nor occupies those related premises) is concerned, the interpretation of the regulations is ultimately a matter for the courts. The term &quot;occupies&quot; is not defined in the regulations and it will therefore carry its ordinary meaning. In the Government&#039;s view, it would normally refer to the person in occupation and in many cases that will be the tenant or licensee of the premises. The effect would be that any contractor who is a tenant or a licensee would not satisfy the mobile service tenure restriction and would need to notify the premises. However, a sub-contractor attending a site to carry out a specific task (without occupying the site) would be able to operate under the mobile service provisions as long as they produced less than 200kg of hazardous waste at that site in any period of twelve months.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51012w01.html_para6">
The final regulatory impact assessment which assessed the impact of the regulations on a range of businesses and industry notes that the Environment Agency estimated that there would be 110,000 notified sites in year one. This estimate is based in part on the number of sites producing and consigning special waste under the previous regime. In so far as construction sites consigned special waste under the special waste regime, they will be included in the estimate of notifications under the hazardous waste regulations.

 The Environment Agency&#039;s hazardous waste data system on the movement of hazardous waste within England and Wales, which is based on statutory powers, does not record the route or method of transport used.

Progress continues on full implementation and financing of the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative. As a result of the extended HIPC sunset clause for which the UK lobbied, more countries are likely to become eligible for debt relief.

 We have secured agreement on the text of the main body of the film co-production agreement with India, and I hope to sign this at the next appropriate opportunity.

<p>
<a name="51012w03.html_para3">
<i>Letter from Karen Dunnell to Mr. Michael Meacher, dated 12 October 2005:</i>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking what the average income of each decile of earnings has been in each year since 1996&#150;97; and what the real terms annual growth in income of each decile was between 1996&#150;97 and the latest date for which this information is available. (16358)</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Currently average earnings are estimated from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE). Prior to 1998 average earnings were estimated from the New Earnings Survey (NES), and are provided for full time employees on adult rates of pay whose pay was unaffected by absence during the pay period. This is the standard definition used for ASHE and NES tables. The ASHE does not collect data on the self employed and people who do unpaid work.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Table 1 attached below contains statistics on earnings from the NES from 1986&#151;1998 and from ASHE for the years 1998&#151;2004. In table 2, the figures from table 1 are expressed in 2004 prices by uprating with the Retail Price Index (RPI).</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The ASHE, carried out in April of each year, is the most comprehensive source of earnings information in the United Kingdom. It is a one per cent sample of all employees who are members of pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) schemes, but because of its sampling frame, it has difficulty capturing data on people with very low pay. It is therefore likely to under-represent relatively low paid staff earning below the tax threshold.</p>

 The Independent Monitoring Board Secretariat, like all areas of the Home Office, is working to improve the quality and professionalism of the services it provides and the introduction of performance targets and better use of management information within the Secretariat is key to achieving this. The Secretariat is also subject to management supervision over the content of its annual business plan, including setting objectives and reporting on the achievement of those objectives within a given timeframe, and the effectiveness of its overall performance.

 Independent Monitoring Boards have an important role to play as the watchdog of the Secretary of State.

<a name="51012w06.html_para1">
Chaplaincy teams play an invaluable role in the life of the prison community. They are involved in a wide range of activities including provision of worship, and religious education, courses on restorative justice, bereavement and family issues. Schemes such as community based chaplaincy draw on the link that chaplains have with their faith communities to provide ongoing practical support and encouragement to help ex offenders resettle into their communities on release. All prisons have multi faith chaplaincy teams to meet the spiritual and pastoral needs of prisoners and staff.

 Her Majesty&#039;s Prison Service does not tolerate corruption by its staff and is totally committed to eradicating this wherever it occurs. A professional standards strategy was introduced in February 2003 in order to promote and support a culture that is hostile to corruption. The strategy includes a system that enables the reporting of wrongdoing and provides support for individuals who do so. It also lays out a policy framework and practical advice for gathering information and developing intelligence on staff suspected of wrongdoing. The Prison Service also has in place robust policies setting out how wrongdoing must be investigated and how staff disciplinary matters are to be dealt with.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51012w07.html_para4">
The YJB and National Treatment Agency (NTA) have agreed a joint performance indicator for youth offending teams (YOTs) which requires all young people supervised by YOTs to be screened for substance misuse including alcohol and to access intervention and treatment services without delay. The target is monitored quarterly and data for 2004 to 2005 identified that 11,551 young people supervised by YOTs had a substance misuse need requiring an intervention or treatment.

 The 2003 Energy White Paper makes it clear that the Government&#039;s priority is to strengthen the contribution that energy efficiency and renewable energy sources make towards meeting our carbon commitment. It therefore makes no proposals to build new nuclear power stations; but the possibility of new nuclear build at some point in the future is not ruled out.

<p><a name="51012w12.html_spnew0"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 The Department is monitoring the situation. There is a generally accepted view that, with no changes to the existing refineries, Europe will be short of about 50 million tonnes of diesel per year after 2012. Existing UK refineries have been developed to meet the demand for mainly petrol that was prevalent in the 1980s. Europe already has an excess of petrol and other market outlets are limited. Further investment in existing refineries could address some of the imbalance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51012w12.html_para0">
A further solution to the problem is to develop refineries to process heavy oil. This not only makes more diesel and jet fuel, relative to gasoline, but also gives access to oil supplies that are more readily available and cheaper than light, sweet crude.
