To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what her estimate is of the number of cetaceans killed as a result of fishing by catch in the last 12 months; and if she will make a statement.  [84463]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21204w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Information on the full extent of dolphin casualties caused by fishing is not available.
<P>

<a name="21204w01.html_para0">Sample surveys carried out by the Sea Mammal Research Unit on behalf of DEFRA on UK vessels have recorded 61 animals killed since January 2001 as a result of bycatch in the bass fishery, of which eight occurred in the last 12 months. In this period, no bycatch has been observed in any other fishery. We are currently conducting trials into the use of exclusion devices to reduce bycatch in the bass fishery.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when she expects to decide whether to allow the new rights of access under part 1 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 to be implemented on a regional basis; and if she will make a statement.  [83853]<P>

<P>
<a name="21204w01.html_spnew1"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 I am pleased to be able to tell my hon. Friend that this issue has now been resolved and I announced my decision to implement the new right of access on a regional basis via a written ministerial statement on 28 November 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 48&#150;49WS.

<P>
<a name="21204w01.html_wqn2"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what her policy is on the desalination of sea water for drinking water purposes.  [84743]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21204w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 December 2002]:</i> There are a number of sources for providing raw water for treatment to drinking water standards for the public water supply. The principal sources from which water is abstracted at present are surface waters (rivers and reservoirs) and groundwater (e.g. chalk aquifers).
<P>

<a name="21204w01.html_para1">Desalination of sea water is energy intensive and results in waste products that are difficult to dispose of, and is currently not viewed as a sustainable option. Desalination would need to be identified as an option in a water undertaker's water resources plan, and agreed with the Environment Agency, if it were to be considered an option for public water supply.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21204w01.html_wqn4"><B> Dr. Murrison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent assessment she has made of fuel poverty in rural areas.  [84137]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21204w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 A summary report published in August 2001, Fuel Poverty in England 1998, estimated that around 19 per cent. of rural households were in fuel poverty, compared with 15 per cent. of urban households. These figures will be updated in due course with the release of the 2001 English House Condition Survey.
<P>

<a name="21204w01.html_para2">The depth of fuel poverty in rural areas may be affected by a number of factors. These include the disproportionate number of households which are off the mains gas network and properties which are considered hard to heat.
<P>

<a name="21204w01.html_para3">A working group was established in 2001 to investigate extension of the gas network. There is evidence that lack of access to mains gas, which is currently the cheapest and most efficient fuel for domestic heating, contributes to keeping households in fuel poverty. The Working Group concluded that a full-scale extension of the gas network could not be justified on cost benefit grounds, but that extension to a more limited extent would be justified in certain cases. Work is progressing on identifying priority areas for any possible future extensions of the gas network.
<P>

<a name="21204w01.html_para4">My Department recently commissioned a scoping study which is looking at the potential for alternative technologies to help tackle fuel poverty. This could be of particular relevance for rural communities, especially areas without access to the gas network. The study will also consider alternative methods for the treatment of 'hard to heat' homes. The report is expected early in the new year.
<P>

<a name="21204w01.html_para5">The Fuel Poverty Advisory Group, which was set up to advise Government on achieving its goal of ending fuel poverty, is also looking at issues which effect rural areas. It has already considered a paper on households without access to gas and is due to discuss households which are considered to be 'hard to heat'.

<P>
<a name="21204w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Llwyd: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when she expects that the United Kingdom will meet its emission standards under the Kyoto Protocol.  [84191]

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21204w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 We expect to meet our current commitment under the Kyoto Protocol during the period 2008 to 2012. The UK is committed under the Protocol to achieve an emissions reduction of at least 12.5 per cent. on average over these five years. The reduction is relative to base year emissions in 1990 for carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, and 1995 for the fluorinated greenhouse gases. Compliance will be assessed after 2012. UK greenhouse gas emissions in 2000 were 13 per cent. below those in the base year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21204w01.html_wqn6"><B> Phil Sawford: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what measures are in place to ensure prompt payments to farmers in respect of the beef premium, suckler cow premium and slaughter premiums.  [84965]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21204w01.html_spnew6"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 EC rules do not allow payment of premium in respect of the Beef Special Premium, Suckler Cow Premium and Slaughter Premium to be made before 16 October of the calendar year to which payments apply.
<P>

<a name="21204w01.html_para6">The prompt payment of claims for advance payment of 2002 bovine premia depends on a number of factors including:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the animals must have completed their retention period;
<P>
<BR>
claims must be error free;
<P>
<BR>
the animals must have completed their cross check against the Cattle Tracing System database.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="21204w01.html_para7">To date, payment has been made on 48.54 per cent. of Beef Special Premiums and 33.04 per cent. of Slaughter Premiums claims. The remaining unpaid claims have been delayed because they have failed to meet one of the criteria outlined above.
<P>

<a name="21204w01.html_para8">No payments have yet been made on the Suckler Cow Premiums because of the need to re-write the Suckler Cow Premiums IT system. Payments are however expected to begin in late December.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will list her official engagements in the week commencing 25 November 2002.  [84229]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21204w01.html_spnew7"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The Secretary of State makes it a practice not to publish her diary. Much of her time this week has necessarily been taken up with essential meetings with ministerial colleagues and officials on the

<P><I>4 Dec 2002 : Column 790W</I><P>
various aspects of this Department's wide ranging portfolio. In addition to this, she had speaking engagements on both Monday and Tuesday. Immediately after Cabinet on Thursday, she travelled to Brussels, to attend the monthly Agriculture Council for the remainder of the week.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21204w01.html_wqn8"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment has been conducted for <i>(a)</i> her Department and <i>(b)</i> the Environment Agency on sites which <i>(i)</i> have been damaged by water abstraction and (ii) are threatened by continued water abstraction since 1995; and if she will list the locations of these sites.  [84734]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21204w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 December 2002]:</i> The Environment Agency has set up the Restoring Sustainable Abstraction Programme to co-ordinate the assessment of the impact of water abstraction upon the environment. The programme brings together work relating to:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the review of consents required on European designated sites under the Conservation (Habitat &c.) Regulations 1994
<P>
<BR>
the statutory duty under Section 28G of the Countryside Rights of Way Act 2000 in relation to Sites of Special Scientific Interest
<P>
<BR>
non-designated sites.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="21204w01.html_para9">The aims of the programme are to identify and investigate sites, both rivers and wetlands, where water abstraction may potentially be causing an impact upon the environment. Where it is demonstrated that such an impact is taking place, steps are taken to identify, justify and develop alternative, more sustainable sources of water.
<P>

<a name="21204w01.html_para10">The Agency is working closely with English Nature and the Countryside Council for Wales to identify designated sites that should be included in the programme. Sites within the programme are prioritised according to their importance, i.e. the level of designation, and urgency, i.e. the environmental risk posed. The Agency is developing a timetable for progressing investigations of these sites taking into account its available resources.
<P>

<a name="21204w01.html_para11">Until the investigation work has been completed there is no definitive list available of all sites which have been, or are threatened with damage as a result of abstraction except for a list of SSSIs where investigations have shown that abstractions are having a detrimental impact. The table details sites where investigations have shown that abstractions are having a significant detrimental impact and remedial action has been taken and completed.

 As described in the national aviation consultation documents, forecasts of unconstrained passenger demand out to 2030 are the starting point for assessing demand for airport capacity. However, this is not a 'predict and provide' approach: the forecasts only identify what additional capacity would be needed if demand were to be met, either fully or partially, so that the positive and negative aspects of that additional capacity can be appraised so as to reach a view on what, if any, degree of airport expansion is appropriate. The passenger forecasts are long term forecasts, anddepend on key factors influencing demand such as GDP and fares; they do not use aircraft orders to assess supply over shorter periods ahead since the availability of aircraft is not assumed to be a constraint.

On Monday the position, which had been kept under review, began to deteriorate further. Taking into account the fact that delay would prolong the closure the decision was taken to close the carriageway that afternoon. This was done and the carriageway remained closed from 4 pm on Monday to 6.45 am on Wednesday. It closed again briefly later that night to allow clearance of the remaining traffic management.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In taking the decision the Agency took into account the severe congestion that the closure could cause in the area. Local authorities and the Police were informed of the closure as soon as the decision was taken. They assisted with traffic management using the Urban Traffic Control systems to adjust timings on traffic signals in the area. Local and long distance diversion routes were put in place and the closure was publicised through press, radio and the Agency's own website and information line. The information was updated throughout the time the carriageway was closed. Further works on the northbound carriageway will involve a series of closures starting mid February as part of the strengthening works.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what measures he is taking to increase the local authority resources and to provide the expertise required to identify and implement the major local transport improvements envisaged in the Ten Year Transport Plan.  [83801]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21204w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The primary responsibility for equipping themselves to deal satisfactorily with their responsibilities for transport rests with local authorities themselves. We recognise that there is currently a shortage of personnel qualified in a number of disciplines relevant to local transport. My Department is therefore helping to fund the Transport Planning Skills Initiative, which is examining how more people can be attracted into the transport profession together with questions of staff training and retention. We are also funding the provision of 111 travel plan co-ordinators at 84 local authorities at a cost of &pound;9 million over three years, to promote the widespread adoption of travel plans in order to help tackle congestion. It is important, too, that the most effective use is made of the available expertise. Our Centres of Excellence initiative is designed to disseminate best practice in the preparation and implementation of Local Transport Plans (LTPs). We are funding the authorities responsible for 17 of these plans to undertake a programme of dissemination covering a range of local transport issues.

<a name="21204w06.html_para8">The latest published figures, for 1 October 2002, show that during the 12 months to 30 September 2002 the rate of outflow has slowed to 400 officers and 3,230 ratings/other ranks, and this favourable trend is expected to continue.
<P>

<a name="21204w06.html_para9">The rate of outflow is reducing, but retention is still recognised as a major challenge. A range of measures are in hand to address the issue holistically throughout the service.

 The Sea Dart missile system has undergone a number of modifications and updates to improve its reliability and capability. The final element of the programme incorporates an infra red fuse in the missile. This fuse, which has now come into service, will improve the Royal Navy's medium and long range defence against aircraft and missile threats.

 The value of property sold is eventually determined by the market at the time of sale, and is clearly subject to many uncertainties. However, the Ministry of Defence is conducting a review of its estate to determine which are its long term core sites that are to be the focus of future investment. Those sites that are non core will come forward for disposal in the medium to long term. In the meantime, the Department agreed to generate income of &pound;500 million from the disposal of surplus land and property over the next three years.

<P>
<a name="21204w07.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Urban Battlefield Trainer (URBAT) is a computer system facilitating procedural training in an urban environment up to company level. It is designed to test and practice procedures through the generation of a battle picture, rather than having to deploy men and equipment physically. In particular, it tests headquarters in the timely issue and dissemination of orders, monitoring the effective flow of information and reaction to the unexpected. The current URBAT is located at Copehill Down training village on Salisbury Plain training area and is the only computer training system able to provide the required level of terrain definition to allow urban operations to be exercised effectively. A new system, known as URBAT 2, is currently being procured and should be in service by the end of July 2003. It will significantly enhance the training benefit by making use of different urban terrain mapping and increasing operator participation.

 In addition to the White Paper public consultation on the proposals now contained in the Licensing Bill, Ministers have had numerous discussions and entered into a great amount of correspondence with a variety of different organisations and individuals. As the new regime proposed in the licensing Bill will cover all premises where licensable activities take place, discussions have focused on how the system will work for all types of premises, and of course the impact on village halls has been considered.

Over the last two years, my Department has worked closely with HM Treasury, Sport England, the Central Council of Physical Recreation and sport's governing bodies on the provision of financial support for such clubs. In the course of that work, my Department has received a large number of formal and informal representations on club numbers from the Council, governing bodies and other interested parties.
<P>

<a name="21204w07.html_para1">Following detailed work with the Charity Commission, amateur sports clubs have had the opportunity to apply for registered charitable status under new guidance announced in April. Clubs who successfully apply will benefit from mandatory 80 per cent. business rate relief, tax exemption for trading income, and Payroll Giving, and tax reliefs for gifts by individuals and companies.
<P>

<a name="21204w07.html_para2">Clubs who do not wish to apply for charitable status can apply for a package of tax reliefs available direct from the Inland Revenue. For the majority of amateur sports clubs these two packages offer an excellent way forward, potentially saving them millions of pounds a year in tax.

<a name="21204w07.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The most accurate estimate of the numbers of amateur sports clubs in the UK was obtained by my Department earlier this year following a wide consultation of governing bodies. Based on those discussions, 110,000 departmental guidance leaflets on the benefits of charitable status were sent to individual clubs.
<P>

<a name="21204w07.html_para3">Earlier work by the Central Council of Physical Recreation was based on random sampling and suggested that sports club numbers had fallen slightly over recent years. Neither the Council nor Sport England holds details of the numbers of sports clubs in England, or in York and North Yorkshire, or of numbers of purely social clubs.

 The Government's contribution to the English National Stadium project is Limited to a grant of up to 20 million towards non-stadium infrastructure. The London Development Agency is also granting up to &pound;21 million and the Sports Lottery Fund's grant of &pound;120 million has already been paid and spent by Wembley National Stadium Limited. Full details of the National Stadium project's costs and funding are set out in the final report of the English National Stadium Review led by Patrick Carter, copies of which were placed in the House Library on 16 October and which can be downloaded from my Department's websiteat http://www.culture.gov.uk/sport.

<P>
<a name="21204w07.html_spnew10"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 There are no data available for the numbers and the costs associated with the collection of abandoned vehicles for the years 1997 to 1999. However, at the start of this year the Environment and Heritage Service of the Department of the Environment commissioned a survey to obtain data and information about End of Life Vehicles (ELVs), including abandoned vehicles, in 2000.
<P>

<a name="21204w07.html_para4">In 2000, the number of abandoned vehicles disposed of by district councils was 2,899 and the direct costs associated with collection and disposal of these ranged from &pound;0 to &pound;50. The average cost was &pound;40.67. Additional costs, including the costs of storage and officer time, increased the average cost to &pound;53. The total cost to councils for collecting all abandoned vehicles in 2000 was estimated to be &pound;117,902.
<P>

<a name="21204w07.html_para5">An Executive Summary of the survey will be published in early 2003.

 In 2002&#150;03, Staffordshire's average funding per pupil aged 11&#150;15 is &pound;3,440, and for Birmingham it is &pound;4,230. We do not identify separately the amounts for individual constituencies. The reason for the difference is the higher levels of deprivation in Birmingham as a whole. Funding is distributed to schools and children through local education authorities' own funding formulae: these formulae can be a significant cause of the differences in funding between similar schools in neighbouring authorities, since they often do not take enough account of the needs of deprived children. We have issued guidance to LEAs about their use of deprivation funding in order to persuade them to target funding for deprivation at those children and schools that most need it.

<P>
<a name="21204w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Currently the only readily available source of data on the GCSE attainment of young people excluded from school is the Youth Cohort Study (YCS).
<P>

<a name="21204w09.html_para6">The latest data available from the YCS is for people who took their GCSEs in the summer of 1999. This shows that of those who were excluded from school in years 10 or 11, 17 per cent. gained five or more GCSEs at grades A* to C and 90 per cent. reported gaining at least one GCSE.
<P>

<a name="21204w09.html_para7">Figures for more recent years will become available from the National Pupil Database in due course.

 I have been asked to reply.

<a name="21204w10.html_para3">The Secretary of State has no proposals for recommending that all four year olds should attend primary school. Compulsory school age remains the term following the child's fifth birthday.
<P>

<a name="21204w10.html_para4">Some primary schools do operate an early admission policy. Where this is the case, the School Admissions Code of Practice encourages admission authorities to allow parents who have secured a place for their child to defer entry until later in the same academic year if they wish to do so.
<P>

<a name="21204w10.html_para5">Admissions policy has recently been reviewed and following consultation, a new, revised Code has been produced. This is currently before Parliament for consideration. The new Code includes a stronger message on deferred entry making it clear to primary school admission authorities that the Secretary of State expects them to offer parents the option of deferring entry.

 The DfES does not procure educational buildings. In the schools sector, this is the responsibility of local education authorities, school governors and trustees. For this sector, the relevant recommendations of the CABE/OGC report have already been, or will be, taken into account and reflected in updated DfES project design, procurement, funding and asset management plan appraisal guidance.

 The figure relates to the proportion of a company's activities which are not trading activities. The Inland Revenue will publish guidance in Tax Bulletin 62 (to be issued in December 2002) on how to determine for Capital Gains Tax taper relief purposes whether a company's non-trading activities amount to more than 20 per cent. of its total activities. This guidance, which updates the earlier guidance published in June 2001 in Tax Bulletin 53 by reflecting changes to the legislation which were introduced in Finance Act 2002, is available now on the Revenue website at:

 Organisational groupings of Inland Revenue staff were significantly changed in 1993. Consequently the fully-trained inspectors fell mostly into a new Band B group, and the general group of inspectors was mainly replaced by a much broader grouping of them and other staff in a new Band C group.

 The UK windspeed database is available on the DTI website at 
http://www.dti.gov.uk/renewable/ windspeed/online.html. The database contains estimates of the annual mean windspeed throughout the UK. The data is intended as a guide as on-site measurements are needed for a proper assessment of any individual site. It does not set scenarios for onshore wind targets.
<P>

<a name="21204w14.html_para3">The British Wind Energy Association estimates that wind turbines start operating at wind speeds of 4 to 5 metres per second (around 10 miles an hour) and reach maximum power output at around 15 meters/second (around 33 miles per hour).

 For solar photovoltaics there is no specific funding from central Government for training and skills development. However, funding is available through the Department of Trade and Industry's Renewable Energy Programme and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council's Supergen Programme to support research and development projects. In addition, the Faraday INREB (Integration of New and Renewable Energy in Buildings) Partnership has a particular focus on training. A UK company is also involved in an EU ALTENER project to develop a training course for PV installers under City & Guilds, and there are a number of other training courses being developed in response to the DTI's Major Photovoltaics Demonstration Programme (PV MDP). Finally, the DTI is running an Installer Accreditation scheme under the Management Contract for the PV MDP.

There is also a network of Solar Clubs around the country, which aim to teach their members the basics of how to install a solar water heating installation for themselves. Finally, it is also the intention that the forthcoming Community and Household Renewables Scheme will also operate an installer accreditation scheme for the installers of small-scale renewable technology installers, including solar water heating systems.

<i>[holding answer 28 November 2002]:</i> On 5 March 2001, President Bush announced the imposition of increased duties on imports of a wide range of steel products following a safeguard investigation under Section 201 of the US 1974 Trade Act. Based on 2001 figures, 46 per cent. of UK steel exports equivalent to around 215,000 tonnes were covered by the measures. This equates to approximately 2 per cent. of UK producers' total sales of steel industry products. Subsequently the US Authorities announced exclusions resulting in 70 per cent. of UK steel trade with the US being unaffected by the US safeguard action. The Government will continue to take close interest in the US response to further requests from UK companies for exclusions, and will intervene with the US Authorities if necessary.

In the negotiations we are pushing for a presumption of conformity between WTO rules and specific trade obligations in specific MEAs. This would cover trade measures in existing international MEAs on trade in endangered species, ozone-depleting substances, hazardous waste and chemicals. The Doha mandate also ensures that the issue of farm animal welfare will be taken into account as part of the current agreement on agriculture negotiations.

 In September DFID provided an additional &pound;11 million to be disbursed to address humanitarian needs over the winter months. This money has now been disbursed. The majority has been provided to support the work of major UN agencies, including the World Food Programme, UNHCR, UNICEF and the UN Joint Logistics Centre (UNJLC), as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross and is intended to help fill gaps in relief assistance for food, water, health care, clothing and shelter.

 During 2001 all assistance given to Afghanistan by the UK was for humanitarian activities. In the current financial year we have allocated &pound;65 million to humanitarian and reconstruction assistance. So far we have disbursed over &pound;52 million, this includes &pound;10 million to the Afghan Reconstruction Trust Fund and over &pound;12 million to meet repayments of Afghan arrears to the international financial institutions.

 During my recent visit to Afghanistan I had several discussions with Afghan Ministers and UN agencies regarding the transition from humanitarian to reconstruction assistance. This needs to be managed with care because the transitional Administration has very limited capacity to deliver services outside Kabul and humanitarian needs remain considerable not least because the south of Afghanistan

is suffering its fifth year of drought. My Department is providing &pound;10 million to the Afghan Reconstruction Trust Fund.

 Since the start of 2002, nearly two million refugees are reported to have returned to Afghanistan from neighbouring countries; in that same period approximately three million children have returned to school. From October 2001 to December 2002, UNHCR have received over $245 million of funding, resulting in their appeal for funds being just under 91 per cent. funded. UNICEF, which is providing, among other things, support to education in Afghanistan, is reporting that their appeal for 2002 has raised just over $137 million, which equates to 72 per cent. of funds requested. In addition to this, funding money is also being directed to education and refugee support via other routes, including bilateral support and through NGOs. In comparison to donor appeals in previous crises the appeals for Afghanistan are in the most part well funded.

 Both the UN agencies and the NGOs have done an excellent job in delivering much needed humanitarian assistance quickly to Afghanistan. To date we have directed the majority of our aid through the UN system and NGOs. We have also placed &pound;10 million in the Afghan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) to provide the Afghan Transitional Administration with funds to support what it has identified as priorities for development. However, most of these funds are being spent on pay for very small salaries for large numbers of civil servants that provide very limited services to the people of Afghanistan. We hope that as the Transitional Administration continues to build its capacity it will be better placed in the future to channel development assistance direct and focus it on areas of greatest need.

 My Department is aware of reports from UN agencies indicating that there are shortages of medicines in the Central African Republic, particularly in hospitals and health centres in CAR's northern provinces. According to a report on 28 November, two major health zones remain cut off from a re-supply depot in the capital, Bangui, due to the closure of the main road route on security grounds. The result of this has been a shortage of essential medicines and vaccines (e.g. for tuberculosis, polio and yellow fever) in the regional pharmaceutical depots. UK support to CAR is provided through multilateral agencies such as the European Commission.

 DFID's programme has more than doubled since 1996 (to &pound;70 million per annum). It is concentrated on health, education, governance and sustainable livelihoods support. One of the important lessons of effective development is that bilateral agencies should not seek to work in all sectors but should co-operate with others in supporting reform efforts in different sectors. Japan, Canada, Norway, UNICEF and the World bank are currently engaged in Malawi's water sector.

 Mauritania is a low-income food deficit country which is vulnerable to drought and desertification. Late and erratic rainfall in southern regions this year has aggravated an already poor food situation in the country.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21204w17.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The history of Rinderpest outbreaks points to the potential for rinderpest to undergo resurgence wherever the virus persists within a population.
<P>

<a name="21204w17.html_para0">Investigations by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, Operation Lifeline Sudan and the Pan-African Programme for the Control of Epizootics (PACE) indicate that eradication campaigns have now been successful in removing persistent foci of Rinderpest virus in Southern Sudan, although definitive confirmation is not yet possible. The main challenge is therefore the South Somali pastoral ecosystem that has shown itself to have the potential to infect populations in both Kenya and Tanzania. Unregulated trade&#151;particularly the Informal' trade routes&#151;could potentially export the disease further afield.
<P>

<a name="21204w17.html_para1">In addition to the funds that the UK provides to pan-African Programme for the Control of Epizootics (PACE) by way of the EC, DFID also directly funds the Community-based Animal Health and Participatory Epidemiology unit of the African Union's Inter-African Bureau for Animal Resources. This unit is developing community-based animal heath delivery and surveillance systems which enable rinderpest vaccination and early warning of potential outbreaks to be carried out in the remote areas where rinderpest has persisted.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what precautionary steps are being taken to ensure the trade of cattle across the Red Sea does not result in the spread of Rinderpest disease.  [84634]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21204w17.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The sanitary control of livestock imports remains the responsibility of importing countries. Saudi Arabia has banned the import of cattle from Somalia, but informal trade, which is much less susceptible to regulation, probably persists across the Red Sea. Efforts are therefore needed to identify and control the persistence of Rinderpest virus at source. To this end DFID and the EC have been working in partnership with the African Union's Bureau for Animal Resources, the EC-funded pan-African Programme for the Control of Epizootics (PACE) programme and the Office International des Epizooties (the O.I.E.&#151;the world organisation for Animal Health) to assist African countries in Rinderpest eradication, and subsequently in meeting the requirements of the O.I.E. 'Pathway', which leads to international recognition of Rinderpest freedom for the benefit of importing countries.
<P>

<a name="21204w17.html_para2">In particular, through its DFID-funded Community Based Animal Health and Participatory Epidemiology (CAPE) initiative AU/IBAR has developed service delivery systems that are capable of delivering mass vaccination in marginal areas such as the Somali pastoral eco-system, even in the presence of conflict, and of maintaining disease surveillance and early warning systems that feed into national systems.

 Southern Somalia and Northern Kenya together comprise the Somali Xpastoral ecosystem". Following the successes of recent years in eliminating the virus elsewhere, the Somali ecosystem constitutes what is probably the last reservoir of Rinderpest infection in the world.
<P>

<a name="21204w17.html_para3">Through DFID's long-standing involvement in Rinderpest control our understanding of the factors underpinning the disease and its persistence within pastoral ecosystems highlights the importance of several factors. These include:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The periods of drought which affect both Northern Kenya and South Somalia (forcing herders to migrate further with their livestock when they occur);</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Conflict and civil war, which hamper control and surveillance efforts-particularly in Somalia.</FONT></UL>

<a name="21204w17.html_para4">DFID's direct involvement in efforts to eradicate the virus (which comprises financial support to the African Union's Inter-African Bureau for Animal Resources and partnerships with EU-funded regional disease control programmes) has therefore been complemented by broader programmes in the fields of sustainable development, of vulnerability management through good governance and of conflict resolution.
<P>

<a name="21204w17.html_para5">The fact that the Somali ecosystem is now believed to contain the last remaining foci of the disease underlines the considerable achievements that have been made in the field of Rinderpest eradication in the last fifteen years. The target for global eradication stands at 2010. The indications are that this target is achievable.

DFID has committed &pound;450,000 so far this year for humanitarian supplies, and we continue to monitor the situation very closely with international partners and the Government of Uganda. We are currently considering additional proposals in the light of recent appeals.

 The UK continues to support Uganda's efforts to deal with regional conflicts through dialogue with its neighbours. DFID is also providing assistance for the implementation of the Amnesty Act and the Defence Review, plus support to local civil society to strengthen networking, advocacy and lobbying for peace.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what response she will make to the 2002 consolidated appeal by the United Nations for <i>(a)</i> Eritrea, <i>(b)</i> Burundi and <i>(c)</i> Uganda.  [84948]<P>

<P>
<a name="21204w18.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The UK does not usually intervene directly to address humanitarian crises, but contributes funding to specialist organisations. These contributions are made through responses to the United Nations Consolidated Appeals, to appeals by the International Committee of the Red Cross and from international relief agencies.
<P>

<a name="21204w18.html_para0">We contributed &pound;1,350,000, &pound;850,000, and &pound;611,000 for humanitarian work in Eritrea, Burundi and Uganda respectively, in 2002. The 2003 appeals have now been issued and we are giving consideration to our response. Actual support in 2003 will depend on the level of humanitarian needs.
<P>

<a name="21204w18.html_para1">Additional funding is provided through core support to international organisations including the UN, and through the European Commission. Nearly 20 per cent. of EC funding is paid for by DFID contributions.

 I discussed funding of UNHCR when the High Commissioner for Refugees visited London in July. Subsequent meetings have taken place between officials in Geneva and London, where funding of the agency was one of the items under discussion. We 



<P>
<P><I>4 Dec 2002 : Column 858W</I><P>
provided advice to UNHCR on the availability of funds from our regional programmes in response to local need.
<P>

<a name="21204w18.html_para2">We are aware of the immense needs which UNHCR is mandated to address and the financial constraints within which it operates.
<P>

<a name="21204w18.html_para3">Our core unearmarked contribution for 2002 is &pound;14 million. In addition, we respond as appropriate to direct appeals from UNHCR for assistance with specific short-term refugee emergency situations and reintegration programmes. In 2002 this assistance amounts to &pound;3.925 million to date. The UK share of EC Development Assistance, including humanitarian, in 2001 was 18.9 per cent. making the UK one of the EC's largest donors. In 2001 therefore, the UK provided &pound;7.9 million for UNHCR through the EC's overall contribution of &pound;41.8 million.
<P>

<a name="21204w18.html_para4">I have also recently approved an extra &pound;1 million to fund UNHCR's community services activities in Africa. This will help underpin UNHCR's key protection activities: prevention of sexual and gender based violence, HIV awareness, self-reliance, youth education and capacity building of refugee social support networks.
<P>

<a name="21204w18.html_para5">The UK has a strong record of support to UNHCR, both in response to emergency appeals and through longer-term institutional strengthening, focusing on helping the agency improve its management, working partnerships and programming. These partnership principles underpin DFID's Institutional Strategy Paper (ISP) for UNHCR, agreed with the agency in December 2001, and which forms the basis of our funding arrangement.

<i>National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS)</i><P>

The Home Office counting rules have again been revised as from April 2002, in order to incorporate the new National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS), which aims to introduce a greater degree of consistency to the ways in which crime is recorded in different police forces and to take a more victim orientated approach to crime recording. The effect will be to increase significantly the number of crimes in the recorded crime count.<P>

Avon and Somerset (from October 2000), Lancashire (from August 2000) and Greater Manchester (from January 2002) introduced the new standard in advance of national implementation, and the recorded crimes in these forces may be significantly affected. West Midlands adopted the Standard in April 1999, and hence the figures given will not be influenced by the Standard.<P>

The other SCI forces adopted the Standard in April 2002.<P>

 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has had no formal contacts with his Irish or Swedish counterpart on this issue, but his officials and those of other Departments monitor the work of other jurisdictions when looking at how the courts in England, Wales and Scotland should respond to those whose offending is linked with a drug habit.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the balance, in terms of Government support, between the harm reduction and harm prevention approaches to drug education.  [84221]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21204w20.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Government have a holistic approach to achieving quality standards in the delivery of drug education through the development of a framework of personal, social and health education supported by the National Healthy Schools Standards. This is only one of the many Government initiatives to improve the quantity and effectiveness of drug education.
<P>

<a name="21204w20.html_para4">Substance misuse education mainly involves harm prevention. However with children of secondary school age and particularly those at greater risk, such as school excludees and young offenders, this is balanced with harm reduction messages. These young people are more likely to be experimenting with illegal drugs and so need more detailed information. The Department for Education and Skills are currently reviewing guidance to schools on drug education and new guidance will be issued by the academic year 2003.

For example, we are both signatories of the United Nations' Conventions on narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, we both participate in meetings of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) and we both co-operate through various UN programmes.

 We are committed to tackling the administrative burdens and inefficient working practices that keep officers off the streets. Sir David O'Dowd's task force was commissioned to give the Government a police service view of what could be done to tackle the administrative burdens and inefficient working practices which keep police officers off the streets. The task force report, published on 17 September, highlighted ways to free up significant amounts of officers' time. A steering group, co-chaired by the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Home Office, is taking the task force recommendations forward. This is a vital opportunity to bring about a real difference to the everyday lives of officers on the front line.
<P>

<a name="21204w21.html_para3">We have turned around the decline in police numbers that started under the last Government. The investment has been made to deliver a record number of police officers and there are now 5,400 more officers than two years ago. We are on course for our targets of 130,000 officers by March 2003 and 132,500 in 2004. We have also reached agreement on a package of reforms to police pay and conditions of service that is good for the service, for rank and file officers and for the public. We will ensure that officers know and feel that they are valued.

<a name="21204w22.html_para2">The Prison Service, with the support of the Youth Justice Board, is developing a suicide and self-harm prevention strategy. This is being taken forward through a three-year programme which runs to April 2004. Work is being targeted where the risks are highest&#151;in local prisons, on remand, in the early weeks and months of custody&#151;within a broad preventative approach. An all-round pro-active approach will encourage a supportive culture in prisons based on good staff-prisoner relationships, a constructive regime and a physically safe environment. Six pilot prisons including Feltham young offender institution are testing the full range of new safer custody policies and standards, and the results of the programme will be subject to independent quantitative and qualitative evaluation.

 The Youth Inclusion Programme is part of the Government's approach to reducing youth offending by working with young people to prevent them being drawn into crime in the first place. There are at present 70 Youth Inclusion Programme schemes across the country, with nine schemes running in the West Midlands. Each scheme targets the 50 young people, aged 13 to 16, living in the local area who are considered to be at the greatest risk of social exclusion, crime and antisocial behaviour. The schemes in the West Midlands are running in Coventry, Sandwell, Stoke, Walsall and Wolverhampton, with four schemes in Birmingham. Between July and September 2002, 542 young people under 17 participated in these nine schemes.

<a name="21204w22.html_para6">The period coincided with the Commission taking on a number of new responsibilities, including those derived from the Local Government Act 1999 on local authority performance. This included the auditing of best value performance plans and the setting up of the best value inspection service. More recently, the Commission has taken the lead role in developing a comprehensive performance assessment process, the results of which are expected shortly. In 2000, the Commission also took on new responsibilities with regard to the National Health Service, involving the review of NHS performance at national as well as local levels.

<a name="21204w23.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister by how much total expenditure would be increased if all parish and town councils in England increased the maximum &pound;3.50 per elector multiplier as specified in section 137(4) of the Local Government Act 1972 up to &pound;5.00 as specified in the draft Local Government Bill; and by how much audit best value and other compliance costs for parish and town councils have increased in each of the last two years.  [84421]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21204w23.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The maximum expenditure by English parish and town councils currently permitted under section 137(4) of the Local Government Act 1972 is estimated to be about &pound;45 million per year. It is estimated that this would increase to about &pound;65 million per year as a result of the maximum amount increasing from &pound;3.50 to &pound;5.00 per elector.
<P>

<a name="21204w23.html_para0">Not all parish and town councils make full use of the existing &pound;3.50 amount, but we are increasing it because it has been in place since 1990, and consultation responses to the XModernising Local Government Finance" green paper have shown that it has been inhibiting expenditure for some councils.
<P>

<a name="21204w23.html_para1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not hold information on the total cost of financial audit for parish and town councils. For parish councils, the Audit Commission's 'lighter touch' regime aims to develop a proportionate audit approach as well as a reduction in audit fees for most councils.
<P>

<a name="21204w23.html_para2">The exact costs of best value are not known. However, the duty of best value should not have added excessive costs when a council is well organised and managed. Any additional costs should have been offset by gains in economy, efficiency and effectiveness and by the new opportunities provided by innovative service delivery through for example by partnership arrangements.

 Since August 2001, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has received 12 representations from members of the public about the council tax exemption for premises occupied by students. Nine of those believed that landlords should be made liable for the council tax in properties occupied only by students, while three suggested that students should be made liable for the council tax.

 The report on the Fire Cover Review was commissioned by the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council and it is for the council to decide whether or not to endorse the report and publish its findings. It was expected that the council would discuss the report at a meeting on 12 November2002, but this was cancelled as a result of the fire service pay dispute. The next meeting is currently scheduled to take place on 12 February 2002. If the Council endorses the report a copy will be placed in the Libraries of the House. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will give a response to the report in the light of the discussion in the Council and after wide consultation.

<P>

 Local authorities employ a wide variety of indicators to measure their performance across a range of activities, and no central record is kept of them.Where indicators are prescribed by Government under the Local Government Act 1999, these are published annually following consultation with local government and others. The attached table summarises the number of such indicators in 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03 by type of authority. Full details are contained in SI 2001 No 724 and SI2002 No 523, copies of which can be found in the library of the House. A similar number of indicators was previously prescribed by the Audit Commission: these were replaced entirely in 2001&#150;02 by those prescribed by Government under the 1999 Act.

 On 2 December, the Government launched a soundings exercise on the level of interest in each English region (outside London) in holding a referendum about establishing an elected regional assembly.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will reimburse actual lost pay of lay magistrates, rather than a sum based on average earnings; and if he will make a statement.  [84723]<P>

 The Financial Loss Allowance is based on average earnings and is paid from cash limited budgets of the Magistrates' Courts Committees allocated from public funds granted by my Department with the concurrence of Her Majesty's Treasury. This method is considered the most equitable way of striking a balance to cover the differing trades and professions within the magistracy.

 Training of magistrates is the responsibility of Magistrates Courts Committees (MCCs) who are required to work within a framework approved by the Lord Chancellor. Under the Magistrates National Training Initiative, the Lord Chancellor requires MCCs to follow the training syllabus produced by the Judicial Studies Board.
<P>

<a name="21204w24.html_para4">The JSB syllabus requires newly appointed magistrates to attend a series of training sessions covering the essential aspects of magisterial work including 'The Obligations of the Judicial Oath', 'Bail', 'Mode of Trial', 'Evaluation of Evidence', 'Verdict and Sentencing'. It is also expected that magistrates make at least one visit to a local court and to a penal institution.
<P>

<a name="21204w24.html_para5">A newly appointed magistrate is supported during his or her first two years of sitting by an experienced and trained magistrate acting as a mentor.

 The Inner London Magistrates' Courts Service (ILMCS) became part of the amalgamated Greater London Magistrates' Courts Authority (GLMCA) on 1 April 2001.

<a name="21204w25.html_para4">The table only covers those unaccompanied children who are looked after by local authorities. It does not cover those who are supported without being looked after. The Children in Need in England survey, published by the Department in October, provides information about numbers of asylum seeking children receiving a service as children in need in a sample week in September/October 2001. However this survey does not distinguish between unaccompanied children and those with their families. Nor does it give details of the type of support, such as bed and breakfast accommodation, provided. The information can be accessed at www.doh.gov.uk/cin/cinlatables.htm.

 Two large European studies were commissioned in the early 1990s to study the possible health effects of Chernobyl fallout in the European childhood population. The United Kingdom population is included in these studies. The studies are known as the European Childhood Leukaemia-Lymphoma Incidence study (ECUS) and the European Childhood Abnormality Study (EUROCAS). The results produced so far show no health detriment linked to Chernobyl fallout. Results are consistent with current estimates of risk from radiation exposure. However, further work continues and more detailed results are expected in the future. The thyroid cancer research group, which made a valued contribution to the investigation of the increased incidence of thyroid cancer in children in Belarus, Ukraine and the Russian Federation following the Chernobyl accident, is

<P>
<P>
<a name="21204w27.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 It is the responsibility of individual national health service trusts to ensure that an appropriate security strategy is in place to provide a safe and secure environment for patients, staff and visitors in NHS hospitals.
<P>

<a name="21204w27.html_para11">Procedures to be put in place are made at a local level, as they depend very much on the design and physical layout of the individual hospital sites. Additional funding is being made available to the NHS as part of the average annual real terms increase of 7.4 per cent., across England over the years 2003&#150;08. Trust management will decide what funding levels will be needed to meet their security needs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health whether it is his policy that the Medicines Control Agency should limit the maximum number of authorisations for imports of MMR SepVax (Mumps) doses; what the equivalent is in daily individual doses of the number of authorisations of MMR SepVax (Mumps) vaccines which the MCA is approving; and if he will make a statement on <i>(a)</i> the availability of MMR SepVax (Mumps) in relation to demand for vaccination and <i>(b)</i> the delays which customers are experiencing in obtaining supplies of MMR SepVax (Mumps) vaccines.  [82704]<P>

<P>
<a name="21204w28.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Single mumps vaccines being prescribed and administered, as part of single measles, mumps and rubella vaccination programmes such as MMR SepVax, are unlicensed imported medicines. Medicines legislation allows a doctor or dentist to prescribe an unlicensed medicine to meet the special clinical needs of his individual patients, on his direct personal responsibility. Importers of all unlicensed medicines, who are licensed by the Medicines Control Agency (MCA), must notify the agency on each occasion they intend importing an unlicensed medicine and there is a legal restriction on the maximum quantity they may import per notification. The MCA can object to importation if it has safety concerns or if an equivalent licensed medicine is available. This applies to all imported unlicensed medicines; there is no policy of specifically restricting unlicensed single measles and mumps vaccines.
<P>

<a name="21204w28.html_para1">The average numbers of notifications per month received by the MCA to import all brands of single mumps vaccine during the last three years were as follows.

 It is not feasible to monitor centrally every clinical decision for consistency with National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance. Clinicians have to make independent clinical judgments, taking due account of NICE'S advice and the strength of evidence which lies behind it. They may depart from the advice if in their view the circumstances of the individual patient justify doing so, but they will be held accountable (through clinical governance arrangements) for their clinical decisions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21204w29.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 We are taking specific action to increase the number of donors available by investing in initiatives to raise public awareness and the benefits of organ transplantation, particularly in the ethnic populations where there may be a greater need for transplantation, implementing measures to ensure that potential donors are identified and that we increase the use of both living and non-heartbeating donation.
<P>

<a name="21204w29.html_para1">Nearly &pound;4 million is being invested in the national health service through UK Transplant to boost the number of life-saving organ transplants. This is funding 35 donor liaison schemes to improve procedures for identifying possible organ donors and the steps to take, so that relatives are approached and given the opportunity to decide about donation. It is also supporting 25 living donation programmes, 10 additional transplant coordinators and six non-heartbeating donor programmes.

<P>

 Following the devolution of power to locally-run services, it is the role of primary care trusts (PCTs) to develop such local prescribing guidelines to suit their needs in conjunction with appropriate local clinicians. Local treatment guidelines, including those for powerful pain relieving and sedative medicines, should be in place and overseen by local drug and therapeutics committees.
<P>

<a name="21204w29.html_para2">We are supporting good local prescribing in a number of ways. The systems for clinical and cost effective use of medicines are covered by the Department's medicines management performance management framework. This framework focuses on secondary care and has been developed recently to strengthen working links with PCTs. We have also commissioned the National Prescribing Centre to produce guidance on good practice in managing controlled drug issues in primary care in the national health service. It is hoped to publish the guide in spring 2003. In addition, we are developing a guide, for use by PCTs and out-of-hours primary care providers, which will contain a minimum list of drugs that patients should be able to access from all such providers during evenings, weekends and bank holidays.

<a name="21204w31.html_wqn1"><B> Keith Vaz: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on the report of the National Audit Office on the failure of pensioners to claim their entitled benefits.  [83663]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21204w31.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The National Audit Office report entitled XTackling pensioner poverty: Encouraging take-up of entitlements", recognises the good progress the Department has made in helping pensioners to take up their entitlements. The Government are committed to tackling pensioner poverty.
<P>

<a name="21204w31.html_para0">We have already made substantial progress in taking forward the NAO recommendations, and welcome the contribution the NAO have made to informing the on-going development of take-up strategies and the Pension Service more generally. Our strategies focus on overcoming the barriers to take up and one of our key mechanisms for driving take up is the Pension Service, a new customer focused organisation dedicated to the needs of pensioners. This provides a major opportunity to further enhance the quality of our customer service by actively promoting take up. In addition to processing pension entitlements, staff will be trained to identify possible entitlement to other benefits such as housing benefit and attendance allowance. Local service staff in particular will have a significant role in encouraging take up in local communities, and work in partnership with organisations that deal with older people, as the NAO proposes.
<P>

<a name="21204w31.html_para1">We have introduced a range of initiatives designed to encourage take up activity among pensioners: for the minimum income guarantee (MIG) we have undertaken a national advertising campaign, which resulted in almost an additional 140,000 claims with an average gain of &pound;20 per week; reduced the claim form from 40 to 10 pages; introduced a MIG specific leaflet, and we are identifying potential beneficiaries through key events, such as claiming retirement pension.
<P>

<a name="21204w31.html_para2">A key priority, for both Government and the Pension Service is the successful take up of the new pension credit which will enhance and replace the MIG. It has been specifically designed to be easy for pensioners to claim and to be less intrusive. The weekly means test will be abolished for the over 65s and be replaced by a 



<P>
<P><I>4 Dec 2002 : Column 915W</I><P>
statement of their circumstances every five years. Capital rules will be relaxed and the upper capital limit abolished.
<P>

<a name="21204w31.html_para3">In addition we have taken this opportunity to align the eligibility rules for housing benefit and council tax benefit with pension credit. DWP staff can now verify information on behalf of the local authority and we will be introducing legislation shortly that will enable local authority staff to do the same for DWP. This means pensioners will in time only need to report their changes in circumstances to one organisation (unless tenancy or dependant related). We are also removing the need for pensioners to re-claim housing benefit every 12 months. We will cut out duplicate claim forms so from April 2003, it will be necessary to complete just one housing and council tax benefit form. These changes are a significant step to simplifying the process and we are examining the scope for introducing further simplifications over the next few years.
<P>

<a name="21204w31.html_para4">Our take up plan for pension credit is extensive and makes use of a range of channels. We will transfer existing MIG recipients to pension credit, ready for payments to be made from October 2003; write to all pensioners not already receiving MIG by June 2004 to alert them to possible pension credit entitlement, supported by a national publicity campaign; work with local partners to help support the communications to pensioners, and tailor marketing and communications activity accordingly. We are setting a demanding PSA target to be paying pension credit to at least 3 million pensioner households by 2006.
<P>

<a name="21204w31.html_para5">With attendance allowance and disability living allowance (AA/DLA), we are trialling new claim forms to significantly improve the way claims are made. Both claim forms were reduced from 44 pages to 34 in 2001 and we are currently trialling a shorter attendance allowance 16 page form. We are also developing a new claiming process for DLA for working age customers. First tests of the new claim pack started on 26 November. The claim form will be personalised and be the minimum size necessary for that individual's needs. If successful this approach will be extended to pensioners.
<P>

<a name="21204w31.html_para6">We have accepted the NAO's recommendations for making further progress. This demonstrates the importance that the Department attaches to tackling pensioner poverty.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will re-calculate the figures in the table in the answer of 27 June 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1050W, assuming <i>(a)</i> that the fund remains in equities until the annuity is purchased and including also figures assuming retirement on 31 December 2001 and 30 September 2002, <i>(b)</i> retirement on (i) 31 December 2001 and (ii) 30 September 2002 and <i>(c)</i> that the fund remains in equities until five years before the annuity is purchased when half is satisfied into gilts and the remainder remains in equities until retirement, including figures assuming retirement on 31 December 2001 and 30 September 2002.  [83135]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21204w31.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The available information, is in the tables. Table 2, includes the data underlying the graph on page 19 of 'Modernising Annuities' published by Inland Revenue and the Department for Work and Pensions in February 2001.
<P>

<a name="21204w31.html_para7">It is not possible to provide information, where the date of retirement is after December 2001. This is due to data and model restrictions.
<P>

<a name="21204w31.html_para8">Although a stylised model, it is the data in the second table that we believe best characterises the investment strategy of many pension funds.
<P>

<a name="21204w31.html_para9">Investors will also be interested in expected pension income throughout their retirement and not just the income in the first year. The information does not give an indication of how this first figure may have increased for successive cohorts of pensioners due to increased life expectancy.
<P>

<a name="21204w31.html_para10">The following assumptions have been made.

 <i>[holding answer 2 December 2002]:</i> The freedom of movement and employment of UK workers in Switzerland is governed by an agreement between the European Community and its member states, and the Swiss Confederation which came into force on 1 June 2002, with final implementation in 2007.
<P>

<a name="21204w32.html_para0">The agreement accords UK workers a right of entry, residence and access to work as employed persons or the right to establish themselves on a self-employed basis.
<P>

<a name="21204w32.html_para1">Given the short period of time since it came into force, no assessment has been made of the effect of the agreement.
