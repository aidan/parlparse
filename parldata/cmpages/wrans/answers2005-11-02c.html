 The spokesman of the UN, Secretary General Kofi Annan gave a briefing in New York on Monday 31 October, expressing the deep concern about the humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe. The UN continues to receive reports that tens of thousands of people are still homeless and in need of assistance, months after the eviction campaign, called &#039;Operation Drive Out Rubbish&#039; began in May 2005. DFID has already provided &#163;1 million to UN agencies to provide emergency food, blankets, medical assistance and other 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>2 Nov 2005 : Column 1037W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
non-food items to the victims. The Government of Zimbabwe have now formally rejected offers of UN assistance to provide temporary shelter for these victims, stating publicly that there is no humanitarian crisis. The Secretary-General made a strong public appeal to the Government of Zimbabwe to ensure that those who are out in the open, without shelter and without means of sustaining their livelihoods, are provided with humanitarian assistance in collaboration with the United Nations and the humanitarian community.

<p>
<a name="51102w02.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_10">In terms of the broader humanitarian situation, despite compelling evidence of a very low grain harvest earlier this year, the Government of Zimbabwe similarly denies that the country needs international assistance to address food insecurity. Independent surveys indicate that between three and five million people will face food shortages in the coming months. The UN, through the World Food Programme, has secured agreement from the Government of Zimbabwe to distribute 300,000 tonnes of food to the most poor and vulnerable households. DFID has already pledged &#163;10 million for this programme.

 The Ministry of Defence is currently undertaking one formal consultation the title of which is the Met Office Proposal for Changes to its Civil Centre Network&quot;. It is being carried out by the Met Office, which is a Trading Fund of the Ministry of Defence.

<a name="stpa_76">The consultation period began on 5 July 2005 and the original deadline for responses was 20 October 2005. However, as a result of the comments received during the consultation period, and based on further analysis and research undertaken by the Met Office with its commercial customers (particularly in respect of potential impact on revenue), I have agreed that the Met Office should further develop an additional option. As a result, a consultation document (Met Office Proposals for changes to its civil centre network&#151;Consideration of further option&quot;) with further details of this new proposed option was issued on 24 October and the consultation period has been extended until 15 November to allow comments on it.

 Neither the Ministry of Defence, which is responsible for veterans matters, nor the former Department of Social Security, which was responsible for the War Pensions Scheme until 2001 and remains responsible for the related civilian Industrial Injuries Scheme, have commissioned medical or scientific research on this issue. However, the Government&#039;s approach to noise-induced sensorineural hearing loss assessment is based on contemporary scientific evidence and understanding. This has been confirmed in recent years by several reviews carried out by independent audiological experts including the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council which confirmed the appropriateness of the threshold in November 2002.

They have also publicly claimed responsibility for mounting suicide attacks against the American and Israeli Embassies in Tashkent in July 2004. It is not our policy to provide intelligence available on groups that have been proscribed in the UK, but we assess that IJU poses a threat to Western interests in Uzbekistan.

 The Government&#039;s long established policy has been to remove itself from substantive decisions about the application of competition law. It is for the relevant independent competition authorities to consider individual competition cases. This policy is reflected in the UK&#039;s competition legislation. Where Ministers do retain statutory powers and responsibilities, these may be used in accordance with the relevant applicable law. For example, the scope for Ministers to refer a market to the Competition Commission is defined in Section 132 of the Enterprise Act 2002.

 The Government take alcohol-related crime and disorder extremely seriously. That is why we introduced the Violent Crime Reduction Bill on 8 June 2005 which proposes a new package of measures to reduce alcohol-fuelled violence. The proposals, which are based on those outlined in the consultation document &#039;Drinking Responsibly&#039; which was published on 21 January 2005, include: a new power for the police and local authorities to designate alcohol disorder zones in areas with a significant problem; a new drinking banning order which would exclude individuals responsible for alcohol-related disorder from certain areas and licensed premises; a new power for the police to ban the sale of alcohol at licensed premises for up to 48 hours if they persistently sell to under 18s; and a new power for the police to exclude individuals at risk of carrying out alcohol-related disorder from a specific area for up to 48 hours.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51102w19.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_123">These new powers build on the range of measures already available to the police and licensing authorities to tackle alcohol-related crime and disorder.

<p><a name="st_204"><a name="51102w22.html_spnew2"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 The electronic monitoring contracts in England and Wales are monitored by a dedicated team within the Home Office National Offender Management Service. The two companies with responsibility for delivering electronic monitoring are required to meet a number of service standards. Performance is rigorously monitored and robustly enforced, with financial deductions for underperformance.

<p><a name="st_208"><a name="51102w22.html_spnew6"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s approach to dealing with this problem focuses on three main areas. First the legislative framework where we have taken steps to strengthen the laws governing the possession of firearms which are already among the toughest in the world. We have introduced a mandatory five year minimum sentence for anyone convicted of possession of an illegal firearm, made it an offence to carry an imitation or air gun in public without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, banned the sale, manufacture and import of guns that use self contained gas cartridge systems, and strengthened the law on airguns. The Violent Crime Reduction Bill builds on these measures.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51102w22.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_138">Secondly, we have worked closely with law enforcement agencies to strengthen enforcement action.

<p>
<a name="51102w22.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_139">Thirdly, we recognise the key part played by communities in addressing the wider issue of this underlying gun culture. We have put &#163;2 million from recycled criminal assets into anti-gun crime projects across the country this year. In addition, the Connected Fund launched last year, provides grants to small voluntary groups working on gun crime, knife crime and gang-related issues. This has proved very successful, supporting over 150 community groups across the country to date.

<i>[holding answer 24 October 2005]:</i> The information requested is not collected. It is for chief officers of police and their police authorities to determine the mix of staff employed by a police force. The police service efficiency strategy expects the service to work towards increasing the amount of police officer time spent on front-line policing to around 72 per cent. by March 2008, from nearly 64 per cent. in March 2004. This equates to an extra 12,000 police officers being freed up from back-office tasks over the next three years.

 The National Security Framework, the core security document for the Prison Service, requires that prisoners are risk assessed on reception and induction and are accommodated in line with a number of risk assessments. This includes the reception health screening process, which incorporates an assessment of mental health, and a cell-sharing risk assessment. The latter must be completed for every new prisoner received into custody on the first night of reception before allocation to his/her cell. Any prisoner identified as being at high or medium risk of harming others has a risk minimisation plan, which, along with the cell-sharing risk assessment, is re-consulted every time that a prisoner moves location within the prison or to another prison.

 CCTV footage is assessed by senior members of the Secure Training Centre operator&#039;s staff, to evaluate an event or incident either as it occurs, or following a complaint. Such footage will also be made available to the local child protection team and/or to the police in connection with the investigation of a complaint, and may be used as evidence in criminal proceedings.

1. The total actual cost of drugs and appliances prescribed by general practitioners/nurses within England plus any central budget expenditure or locally authorised payments. NB. Primary care actual drug cost = Net ingredient cost + VAT + container costs&#151;discount allowance.<br>

2. Primary care NET figures include pharmaceutical price regulation scheme (PPRS) receipt savings.<br>

3. Hospital and community health services expenditure on drugs includes medical gases.<br>

4. From 2000&#150;01, figures are in resource terms, prior to this figures are in cash terms. Cash figures relate to February to January prescribing due to delay in prescription processing and payment calculations. Resource figures represent the actual cost between April to March.<br>

The role of ACRA is to oversee the development of the weighted capitation formula to ensure equity in the allocation of resources to the NHS. Rurality has been looked at by ACRA on a number of occasions. As a result of work commissioned by ACRA to look at the effect of rurality on the cost of providing certain services, an adjustment was made to the weighted capitation formula in respect of the unavoidable geographical cost differences in the provision of emergency ambulance services. The emergency ambulance cost adjustment was introduced from the 1998&#150;99 health authority allocations.

Only those tests offered and taken in GUM clinics are recorded in the KC60 return, testing undertaken in other clinical settings, such as general practice, are not recorded in the dataset.

Notes:<br>

1. Expenditure is taken from audited health authority summarisation forms, which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The figures have not been adjusted for inflation.<br>

2. Figures have been adjusted to eliminate expenditure which would be double counted where an authority acts as a lead in commissioning health care or other services.<br>

3. The majority of expenditure of the SHAs is for education, training and research.<br>

4. Reductions in expenditure between 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 are caused by the further transfer of commissioning from SHAs to primary care trusts.<br>

This measure will therefore achieve consistency in the reporting of public funds received by political parties, ensuring that Policy Development Grants, like the money received by opposition parties in Parliament and the devolved legislatures to assist them in carrying out their duties as opposition parties, are reported to the Electoral Commission and recorded on the register of donations.

Its key message is for children to report bullying to someone they trust and not to suffer in silence.

The Department is currently reviewing the material to provide teachers with the most up-to-date information.

 Work force reform, including statutory non-contact time, is about more than additional funding.

Schools will need to consider their own circumstances and the opportunities available to them&#151;some strategies may be easier to implement than others.

 We do not hold information centrally on the numbers of excluded pupils who are without a place in school. However, from September 2002 all local authorities (LAs) have been committed to providing suitable full-time education for permanently excluded pupils from the sixteenth school day of their exclusion. Since then all but a handful of LAs have met this commitment and the Department works with any that are not meeting it to help them achieve it.

 Until October 1998, only grant-maintained schools needed to obtain the Secretary of State&#039;s consent before disposing of any land, including playing fields. Prior to October 1998, there was no regulation of the sale of school playing fields at local authority controlled schools. If a local authority wanted to sell a school playing field there was nothing to stop it and it could spend the sale proceeds as it wished.

<a name="stpa_289">Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 was introduced in October 1998 to stop the indiscriminate sale of school playing fields. Since October 1998 we have ensured that only sports pitches that are surplus to the needs of local schools and their communities are sold and all the money is ploughed back into improving sports or educational facilities.

<a name="stpa_290">Since 1997, two applications involving the loss of an area of school playing field capable of forming at least a small sports pitch have been approved in Gravesham. An application to sell an off-site playing field at Chantry Primary School in Gravesend was approved in November 2000. The money raised from the sale has been used to improve the school&#039;s on-site sports provision. More recently, in October 2005, we approved an application to dispose of the site, including the playing fields, of the former Southfields School in Gravesend. As part of the proposed development of this site, the purchaser has agreed that the playing fields will be retained, and improved, for use by local schools and the community.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills further to her oral statement of 25 October 2005, <i>Official Report,</i> column 185, on the Schools White Paper, what steps schools will be required to take to ensure fair access to them for all pupils living in the relevant community.

 Schools&#039; admission arrangements are determined locally. Admission authorities for schools are already required to ensure that their admission arrangements comply with Equal Opportunities legislation.

However, the White Paper proposes making it easier to introduce pupil banding. This provides a means of ensuring that a school&#039;s intake is representative of the full ability range of either applicants for a particular school, of children in the area as a whole, or of the national ability profile&#151;depending on the type of banding adopted.

 Schools and local authorities have considerable resources available to them: since 1997/98, funding per pupil has increased in real terms by 36 per cent. The Department&#039;s strategy to improve school attendance is proving successful: absences from school have fallen for four consecutive years to record low levels. There are 50,000 more pupils in school each day than would be the case if absence rates were still at 2000/01 levels. Tackling truancy, particularly persistent truancy, requires carefully focused work by schools working in partnership with their local authorities and other agencies, as set out in Every Child Matters&quot; and Youth Matters&quot;.

 The Schools Commissioner will encourage potential Trusts to focus their interest on weaker schools and schools in disadvantaged areas which are in greatest need of support. Trust schools, like all maintained schools, are required to comply with the law on admissions and to have regard both to the School Admissions Code of Practice and to their Admission Forum&#039;s advice. They must participate in co-ordinated admission arrangements and may be subject to investigation by the Local Government Ombudsman if parents complain of either maladministration or of unfair treatment.

DARD is committed to delivering an ongoing cycle of simulation and desktop exercises as part of epizootic disease preparedness. In June 2004, the Department tested the efficacy of its generic epizootic disease contingency plan for epizootic disease (CPED), on which the AI plan is based. In addition, over the past months DARD has tested several aspects of its avian influenza plan. In December 2004, an operational partners seminar was held to discuss the AI plan with partner organisations and stakeholder representative bodies. In June 2005, an exercise was carried out over two days to test the adequacy of Health and Safety guidance and the health services procedures to be used in the event of an outbreak. A desktop exercise was also carried out in conjunction to test the emergency procurement arrangements set out in call-off contracts. Tests were also carried out on 15 March 2005 and on 20 September 2005 on humane slaughter techniques. This involved a broiler flock and caged layer flock respectively. In October 2005, an exercise was carried out to test communication arrangements and how the command structures operate. The plan is subject to an ongoing process of review and updating.

<a name="stpa_347">Since 2001, there has been a decline in the number of patrols by 50, 35 and 6 in the Belfast, South Eastern and North Eastern boards respectively. Similar information is not available for the Southern and Western Board areas. The decline in numbers is due to a number of factors, including: the replacement of patrols with light-controlled crossings; recruitment difficulties; and, changes in the nature of hazards. In the case of the latter, Boards employ a set of guidelines adapted from those developed by the Local Authorities Road Safety Officers Association (LARSOA). These guidelines permit Boards to make an objective assessment of dangers and hazards, and to determine whether a patrol should be provided, retained, or removed.
