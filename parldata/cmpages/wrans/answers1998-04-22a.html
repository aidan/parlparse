To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what plans he has to introduce training programmes for the judiciary on international human rights standards and on the jurisprudence of international human rights bodies. [38915]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80422w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 This question was originally tabled for answer by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, but has been transferred to the Lord Chancellor's Department which has responsibility for judicial training in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="80422w01.html_para0">Arrangements for judicial training are undertaken by the Judicial Studies Board for Northern Ireland, which is serviced and funded by the Northern Ireland Court Service. On 20 February the Lord Chancellor delivered the Board's Annual Address on "The Incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights". The Board's current programme includes a series of training events on the Convention and future events are planned.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what representations he has recently received on the question of the payment of translators to and from the Welsh language in family courts; and if he will make a statement.  [38018]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80422w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I have not recently received any representations about the payment of Welsh language translators, but I am aware that court staff occasionally receive representations about this. The Court Service will arrange and pay for translators in all family proceedings where necessary in county courts and the High Court. Magistrates courts are considering whether to introduce this facility.

<a name="80422w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Forth: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department, pursuant to his answer of 6 March 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>788-89</i>, concerning information, promotional marketing and opinion survey contracts, if he will provide a breakdown of the item 1999-2000, information meetings.  [38447]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80422w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 When Part II of the Family Law Act 1996 is implemented, all married people wishing to divorce will be required to attend an information meeting. A series of pilots are being run in a number of areas throughout England and Wales aimed at finding the best system for delivering the information meeting.

<a name="80422w01.html_para1">All aspects of the pilot projects are being objectively tested through a major evaluation programme which is being conducted in five phases between March 1997 and May 1999. The views of the public who attend meetings, those involved in the organisation and delivery of the pilots and all relevant professionals and organisations within the pilot areas are being sought as part of the evaluation programme. The item referred to is the projected grant in aid expenditure for the evaluation programme and is broken down as follows:

<P>
<P>
<a name="80422w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Llwyd: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department how many representations he has received on the subject of contingency fees payable to lawyers; and if he will make a statement.  [38453]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80422w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I do occasionally receive letters about contingency fees. However the Government propose to extend the types of proceedings for which conditional fee agreements are available. Those proposals were set out in the consultation paper Access to Justice with Conditional Fees which was published on 4 March. The consultation paper invited responses and thirty-five have been received to date.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what steps he will take to ensure access to legal aid for children involved in personal injury claims.  [38586]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80422w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Government's proposed reforms to legal aid and conditional fees will increase access to justice for everyone, young or old. We believe that it will be possible for people regardless of age or financial standing to find lawyers to take P.I. cases through conditional fee agreements. It is important that we re-focus the Legal Aid Fund towards the areas where it can bring greatest help and do most good, and in which there is no alternative to publicly funded help with legal fees.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what percentage of the United Kingdom primary trunk road network is currently maintained to the 45HB standard.  [39040]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80422w01.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 April 1998]:</i> For trunk roads in England, for which the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions has responsibility, our best estimate is that approximately 80% of the network is currently maintained to the 45HB standard.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80422w01.html_wqn6"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will introduce measures to limit the generation of toxic smoke and fumes from building products.  [39296]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80422w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Building Regulations 1991 are intended to secure the health and safety of people in and around buildings, and paragraph B of Schedule 1 to the Regulations makes functional requirements to cover fire safety. Guidance on how these requirements may be met are given in Approved Document B, and, as far as materials used in construction are concerned, performance standards are set based on recognised test methods.
<P>

<a name="80422w01.html_para2">With regard to the generation of toxic smoke and fumes from building products, there is no recognised method of test as yet that provides a practicable performance standard that would be satisfactory for regulatory purposes. Although the Single Burning Item test being developed in support of the Construction Products Directive does address smoke production, it does not consider toxicity.

<a name="80422w01.html_sbhd7"><H4><center>Child Restraints</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="80422w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Nicholls: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is his assessment of the level of compliance with the legislation relating to safety restraints for children in the rear of motor vehicles; if he will take steps to monitor compliance with the legislation; if he will introduce legislation to make the fitting of child restraints in the rear seats of motor vehicles compulsory; and if he will make a statement.  [38931]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80422w01.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Transport Research Laboratory survey seat belt wearing rates in motor vehicles twice yearly on behalf of the Department. The latest results--for October 1997--show that for children aged 0-4 years the wearing rate was 85% observed in all cars (ie including those not fitted with rear restraints), and that for children aged 5-13 years was 71%.
<P>

<a name="80422w01.html_para3">We have no plans at present to make the fitting of child restraints in the rear seats of motor vehicles compulsory as this would be harsh on parents who depend on others for lifts, or who have older cars without rear seat belts or anchorage points. But, serious injuries to children can be significantly reduced if they are in a suitable seat restraint and we strongly recommend they should always be used wherever fitted. We are also planning a publicity campaign later in the year to encourage seat belt wearing, particularly in the rear of motor cars.

<a name="80422w01.html_sbhd8"><H4><center>London Underground</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="80422w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on developments on London Underground since his statement on 20 March.  [39422]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80422w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Prescott: </B> 
 I have decided to restructure the London Transport Board, bringing in a part-time non-executive Chairman. The present Chairman of London Transport (LT), Peter Ford, who is a full-time executive Chairman, has therefore been asked to vacate the chairman's job. Mr. Ford will therefore leave LT today.




<P>
<P><I>22 Apr 1998 : Column: 612</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80422w01.html_para4">I should like to pay tribute to the commitment Peter Ford has shown to London Transport over the past three and a half years. His period as Chairman has seen a marked increase in the number of passengers using the Underground and the London buses, reaching record levels. There has also been a major improvement in the financial performance of both businesses, and of LT as a whole, such that LT now makes a substantial contribution to its investment programme. Peter Ford has been an untiring advocate for London Transport, and his contribution to thinking and debate about the future has been significant. I am grateful to him, and wish him well for the future.
<P>

<a name="80422w01.html_para5">The changes I am making will cover the period during which we will be implementing the London Underground Public Private Partnership which I announced last month, and the run up to the creation of the Greater London Authority. I have concluded that the best arrangement will be to move to a new senior management structure. I shall be announcing new appointments to the LT Board in due course. Mr. Brian Appleton, currently non-executive Vice chairman of the LT board, has agreed to act as Chairman until a permanent appointment can be made.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80422w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Information on the use in practice of medicines which are not licensed for children is not collected centrally. Doctors have access to clinical guidance on the use of specific medicines which are not licensed for children--to enable them to have sufficient knowledge to take responsibility for treatment. Most medicines prescribed in these circumstances are used in accordance with practice established by specialists in the field, where there is evidence or a sound theoretical basis for the use of the medicine in children and where therapeutic benefit has been established. We do not propose to undertake an investigation but understand the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health is giving this matter further consideration. We shall be guided by any recommendations made by the College.

<a name="80422w02.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Health authorities are able to include osteopathy services within the range of health services commissioned to meet local health needs, if they wish to do so. Availability of osteopathic treatment within the National Health Service depends, therefore, on the decisions taken locally by health authorities and general practitioners about the clinical and cost effectiveness of such services, and the priority to be given to their provision in the light of other competing demands for the resources made available for local health needs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80422w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 Whether or not to charge for parking is a matter for hospitals to decide in the light of local circumstances--for example the space available for car parking and the location of the hospital. Where charges are introduced patients who are eligible to claim reimbursement of travelling expenses under the hospital travel costs scheme may have the charges reimbursed. Good practice guidance on the wider issues surrounding car parking in the National Health Service has been issued to all trusts in Health Facilities Note 21. Copies have been placed in the Library.

 Policy on Value Added Tax is a matter for the Her Majesty's Treasury. Condoms fall within the definition of medical devices under the terms of the European Directive 93/42/EEC which is implemented in the United Kingdom by the Medical Devices Regulations (Statutory Instrument 1994 No. 3017). The UK has no plans to seek to redefine the status of condoms.

 In this financial year, the DTI will spend some &#163;50,000 on relevant activity including our contribution to a European Space Agency (ESA) study into improved monitoring of Near Earth Objects (NEOs) from space. In addition, the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC) will spend &#163;1.6 million this financial year on instruments for the ESA Rosetta mission. This will land a probe on the comet Wirtanen in 2011 and analyse the internal structure of the comet.

<a name="80422w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Issues relating to nuclear materials and technology smuggling--export controls, nuclear materials accountancy and control and physical protection--would, by virtue of competence falling to the Community under the Euratom Treaty for nuclear materials accountancy, or because the issues come under discussions held under the Common Foreign and Security Policy, normally fall within the remit of the General Affairs rather than Energy Council.
<P>

<a name="80422w03.html_para1">However, because it is important to continue worldwide efforts to prevent and, when it occurs, combat nuclear materials and technology smuggling, discussion of an agreement on appropriate measures occurs primarily amongst G8 and within the IAEA. The Government believe these wider international fora remain appropriate for ensuring continuing effective collaborative international action.

<P>
<a name="80422w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 The police are aware of developing trends in crime and can gear their response accordingly. For example, Lothian & Borders Police, in recognition of attacks against homosexuals, have for some time now had an officer with particular responsibility for liaising with gay and lesbian groups. This approach has encouraged the gay community to come forward with information about assaults which were not hitherto being reported to the police and has allowed the police to respond appropriately. Other Forces are following suit in the light of the scale of the problem in their respective Force areas. We will keep the matter under review in consultation with the Police.

 The tax regime provides that only those expenses which are revenue, not capital, in nature and which are incurred wholly and exclusively for business purposes may be allowed as a deduction when calculating trading profits for tax purposes. The Inland Revenue view is that an in-house or contracted out software project to ensure that existing systems can be

 The tax treatment of child care benefits is explained in the Inland Revenue leaflet IR115 "Tax and Childcare". An article in issue 34 of the Inland Revenue's Tax Bulletin magazine, published on 20 April sets out the Inland Revenue's view on what is required to satisfy the conditions of the workplace nursery exemption (Section 155A ICTA 1988) where an employer gets together with others to provide child care.

 A list of herbal stimulants is not held centrally, but the general rule for VAT purposes is that herbs supplied for culinary use are zero-rated. Decisions on the liability of herbal stimulants and remedies are taken case by case if they fall outside the guidance given in Customs and Excise VAT Notice 701/38, which sets out the liability of seeds and plants. The test is whether or not they are "food of a kind use for human consumption" within the normal meaning of those words.

 In accordance with Protocol 11 of the Treaty on European Union, the UK Government have informed the Council that they do not intend to move to the third stage of economic and monetary union on 1 January 1999. The Government will consider the question of how the exchange rate for sterling's entry to EMU will be determined if and when we decide to join.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on how the forthcoming legislation reforming the regulatory system for financial services will affect the role of auditors and actuaries. [39559]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80422w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The relationship between auditors, actuaries and the regulators is an important feature of the supervisory system in the UK. The financial services regulators take into account the role and responsibilities of both auditors and actuaries when determining the appropriate nature and intensity of regulatory supervision both at firm and industry level. I intend that the proposed new legislation to be published in the Summer will build on, and strengthen, this special relationship.
<P>

<a name="80422w06.html_para1">As now, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) will continue to be able to make rules requiring authorised firms to appoint an auditor where they are not already under a duty to do so. The legislation will also allow the FSA to make rules regarding the appointment of actuaries on the same basis. Where there is a need for an investigation or report on any aspect of an authorised firm's business, the FSA will continue to be able to either appoint, or require firms to use the services of, a qualified auditor, actuary or other professional.
<P>

<a name="80422w06.html_para2">I also propose that the FSA's current powers to sanction auditors should be extended to cover actuaries. This will allow the FSA to disqualify an auditor or actuary from

being the auditor or actuary of any firm regulated by the FSA for a specified period where they have failed to inform the regulator about matters of regulatory concern uncovered in the course of their duties. The provisions which disapply any confidentiality requirements an auditor might breach in passing on such information would also be extended to actuaries. Although I would expect this to be a little used power, it is vital that the FSA should be able to rely on auditors and actuaries, with their expertise and special access to information, to let them know of any such concerns.

<P>

<a name="80422w06.html_para3">Most respondents welcomed the move to a statutory basis for the Banks collection of information for monetary policy purposes. They acknowledged that as it was intended largely to place the existing scheme on a statutory basis, it did not imply any increase in costs for the foreseeable future.
<P>

<a name="80422w06.html_para4">The Government also assured respondents that the Bank would continue to consult on any major changes to the statistical system. The Government are concerned to ensure that the cost of supplying statistical information is kept to a minimum, consistent with meeting the information needs of the Bank. And the Act also requires the Treasury to consult appropriate representative institutions if any changes are proposed to the range of financial affairs, or to the categories of institutions from which information can be collected.

<P>

 The Commission and the Council are committed to the principle of allowing the public the widest possible access to documents held by the Commission and Council. Details on how to access information are contained in the Code of Conduct concerning public access to Commission and Council documents. This covers all types of information about a project, but does contain a list of exceptions--documents considered commercially or politically sensitive do not need to be released. This can include some aid documentation such as aid strategy agreements with third countries and project financing proposals put to the Management Committees (whose dealings are confidential).
<P>

<a name="80422w06.html_para7">All commercial tenders (whether restricted or open) have to be published in the Official Journal which is available on the Internet: by this means a lot of information about aid projects is put into the public domain. The Commission is generally regarded as getting better at improving its efforts to provide information in this area too. However, although the principles on releasing information are the same across all the external relations Directorates General (DG) each can interpret them differently. This can cause confusion, but the establishment of the Common Services Directorate

(SCOOP) should help to standardise procedures and increase transparency. There are also designated information officers in each DG for the public to contact.

 Where permitted by law and provided in line with appropriate medical practice, manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) can have a useful role in protecting the health of a woman who seeks to terminate an unwanted pregnancy. MVA is also a valuable technique for treating incomplete abortions, whether spontaneous or induced.

 The Attorney General's Department of New South Wales issued a discussion paper in August 1996 entitled a "Review of the 'Homosexual Advance Defence'". The paper reviews recent cases in New South Wales and discusses the use of the defence where it is pleaded as part of a defence of self defence or provocation. It did not recommend any legislative changes in New South Wales, but suggested some changes in the model directions for judges, and greater education within the criminal justice system and the wider community.

 From the information collected centrally, it is not possible to determine offences or incidents of homophobic crime which, like a number of other identifiable categories such as domestic violence or 



<P>
<P><I>22 Apr 1998 : Column: 637</I><P>
violence between neighbours, cut across different categories of offence depending on the seriousness of the event or the nature of the evidence. Whilst the Home Office collects statistics on the number of recorded offences of, for example, violence against the person, indecent assault on a male, indecency between males and rape of a male, there is no way of identifying which offences within any offence type had a homophobic element. This makes it impossible to give a proper estimate concerning under-reporting.
<P>

<a name="80422w07.html_para5">In 1996, the Association of Chief Police Officers published a set of Good Practice Guidelines for Dealing with Homophobic Incidents. This included a definition of what should be regarded as a homophobic incident: "Any incident which appears to either the victim, investigating officer or any other person to be motivated by homophobia, that is, animosity towards lesbians and gay men". The guidelines also recommended that police forces should record and monitor such incidents.

The report recommended that forces should establish policies and strategies for the policing of incidents and crimes against the gay community, acknowledging their vulnerability as a minority group, and establish systems and practices to deal effectively with homophobic attacks including monitoring arrangements. Her Majesty's Inspectorate will be looking at what forces have done to implement the report during their programme of force inspections.

<P>

<a name="80422w07.html_para11">Consultation with gay and lesbian groups is recognised as an important means by which police officers can gain an understanding of the problems and issues that exist for lesbians and gay men, thereby engendering trust between that community and the police. The crime audits which the police and local agencies will be obliged to carry out under the Crime and Disorder Bill proposals will provide the means to get gay and lesbian issues onto the community safety agenda. The extensive guidance which will accompany the legislation will include references to the importance of involving these groups in this process.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what guidelines are given to police authorities on the <i>(a)</i> type and <i>(b)</i> amount of special training that must be given to police officers before they are allowed to drive police vehicles in emergency situations.  [38538]<P>

<P>
<a name="80422w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) has provided forces with detailed guidelines on police driver training. ACPO's police driving report published in May 1989, made recommendations on the grading of drivers and the core elements and minimum lengths of training courses. Such training is progressive and is designed to develop the skills of drivers so that they increase their awareness of the range of factors that affect their own training, their own capabilities, the characteristics of the vehicles they drive, and road and traffic conditions. However, it is ultimately for individual chief constables to determine the extent of training received by their officers and how they are deployed.
<P>

<a name="80422w08.html_para0">Under current arrangements, officers attend Standard or Advanced driver training courses either in-force or regionally. They progress from Standard to Advanced driver training through patrol experience and driver ability.
<P>

<a name="80422w08.html_para1">Driver training is based on "Roadcraft", a published manual available to the public, the 1989 police driving report and the Horner Report of 1995 on pursuits. Following the death of Judith Hood, killed as a result of a collision with a police car driven by a driving instructor on a training exercise, ACPO set up a working party to examine police pursuit driving training. The working group has examined the recommendations of both the 1989 and 1995 reports which it considers to be good practice but the group has yet to complete its work. The key issue is the need to train officers so they are capable of understanding modern road conditions and exercise all due care when travelling at speeds and in conditions beyond those experienced by the general motorist. Attitudes of police drivers and computerised driver simulator training are key areas currently being explored by the working group.

 Winter Fuel payments are one of a number of initiatives the Government have taken to help vulnerable people, especially the elderly, keep warm in winter. A total of &#163;400 million has been committed for two years (1997-98 and 1998-99), to help pensioners with fuel bills to pay. This is the first time any Government have provided additional help with heating costs to all pensioners living in the United Kingdom who receive a retirement pension or one of a number of other qualifying benefits.
<P>

<a name="80422w09.html_para0">The making of this year's payments has been an enormous and unprecedented exercise. In order to establish all eligible pensioners, correctly identify pensioner households, and determine the amount each should receive, it was necessary to correlate data in around 15 million computer records, involving 15 qualifying benefits, across nine computer systems. Overall, almost 10 million pensioners, in over 7 million households, have received a payment.

 It is our policy that States Parties to the treaty establishing the International Criminal Court should not have a right of national veto over a prosecution.

The Medical Assessment Programme (MAP) was established by my Department in 1993 with the aim of providing veterans who are concerned about their health following service in the Gulf conflict with a clinical diagnosis of their medical conditions. As at 2 April 1998, 2,285 patients had attended at least one consultation at the Programme and a further 132 had been given appointments and were waiting to be seen. The vast majority of those who have attended the MAP are Gulf veterans themselves. However, where medically appropriate, veterans' partners are also welcome to attend and a small number have done so.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what work is being carried out by his Department to analyse the chemical warfare mental incapacitant Agent 15; where this work is being conducted; and what is the scientific name of Agent 15.  [38606]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80422w11.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence announced on 9 February 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 3-6, that the Ministry of Defence was considering how best to investigate Agent 15 further. This process continues; we are currently reviewing all available information on this agent and related compounds, with the assistance of CBD Porton Down. No laboratory work is being carried out at present. I expect to make an announcement when this process is complete.
<P>

<a name="80422w11.html_para5">Agent 15 is one of a large group of chemicals known as glycollates (esters of glycollic acid). Its scientific name remains classified for non-proliferation reasons, because it reveals details of the agent's chemical structure and would thus be of value to a country which wished to produce it.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales if he will make a statement on the prospects for the Welsh sheepmeat industry.  [39277]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80422w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 Slaughtering of lambs to date in 1998 has been significantly higher than last year due to farmers holding lambs back which would normally have been sold earlier. Low producer returns were a major factor. The high volume and in many cases the poor quality of animals marketed have depressed prices paid to producers. The Government's recent decision to introduce private storage aid for the sheepmeat sector in the UK should help to bolster prices and improve short term returns to producers.
<P>

<a name="80422w13.html_para0">Latest agriculture census figures show an increase in the breeding ewe population in the UK. This is expected to lead to a 12 per cent. increase in lamb production in 1998. As a result, supplies of sheepmeat are forecast to increase by 4 per cent. in 1998 in the UK. This is likely to continue to put pressure on producer prices throughout the year. However, the Meat and Livestock Commission (MLC) expect a return to a more orderly supply in the Autumn; this should improve matters although prices are not expected to attain the levels of two years ago.
<P>

<a name="80422w13.html_para1">On a more positive note, the latest available MLC data indicate a 10 per cent. increase in household lamb purchases in February compared to last year.
<P>

<a name="80422w13.html_para2">The Welsh Office, through its funding of Welsh Food Promotions, will continue to ensure that efforts are maintained to promote and market Welsh lamb at home and abroad. Given the general over supply in the market and the strong pound, it will be important to emphasise the farm-assured quality and wholesome image of Welsh lamb in order to stimulate demand.

<P>
<a name="80422w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 Although my right hon. Friend and I have received numerous representations regarding the problems in the beef and sheep sectors since January this year, some of which also mentioned milk prices, we have received only 10 written representations referring specifically to the dairy sector.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80422w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 The Welsh Office does not make such estimates. However, the Welsh Institute of Rural Studies, Aberystwyth published a report on 20 April on "LFA Policy in Wales: A Review of the Socio-Economic and Environmental Effects of the HLCA Scheme" sponsored by the Welsh Office which provides such estimates. It states that using 1991 estimates for the milk production sector for every on farm job there are 0.25 jobs in other industries in Wales.

<P>

<a name="80422w13.html_para8">The current system of post-16 LEA discretionary awards fails many students.

[38737]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80422w13.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The maximum amount that a student can borrow will depend on the length of the course and the place of study, as well as the student's and his or her parents' or spouse's income. Under the Government's proposals, a student completing a three year course outside London which began in 1999 and who took out the full loan available each year might expect to have borrowed a total of &#163;10,165 in 1998 prices. The comparable figure under the Dearing Committee's proposals would be &#163;8,083.
<P>

<a name="80422w13.html_para9">Repayments under our proposed system will be made only when a graduate's income exceeds &#163;10,000 a year and the level of repayments will then be linked directly to the individual's income above that amount.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what plans he has to allow mature students attending higher education institutions on undergraduate courses to access <i>(a)</i> grants and <i>(b)</i> loans in 1998 and 1999.  [39023]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80422w13.html_spnew14"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Students entering full-time undergraduate courses in 1998/99 will have access to maintenance grants for one year only at a reduced rate, regardless of their age. Increased loans will also be available to students aged under 50 at the start of their courses.
<P>

<a name="80422w13.html_para12">While we have no plans to extend the eligibility for loans to those aged 50 and over for 1998/99, we intend to review the eligibility requirements for 1999/2000 and subsequent years when grants will no longer be available. The recent consultation paper on lifelong learning, "The Learning Age," invited views on extending loans to those in their early 50s who wish to enter higher education, for example, to retrain following redundancy. Final decisions will be taken in the light of the responses to that consultation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what plans he has to allow mature students attending higher education courses who are in receipt of income support to retain their full benefit entitlement and access the full income contingent loan.  [39024]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80422w13.html_spnew15"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Government have no plans to change the way student loans are treated in assessing eligibility for benefits. The student loan is a normal means of funding students and although repayable, it is still real income intended to support students in higher education. It would be wrong to treat students who do have access to benefits more favourably than others by ignoring the availability of this source of income. Mature students aged 50 or over at the start of their course are currently ineligible for loans and therefore no account is taken of this form of income when assessing their entitlement to benefit.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="80422w14.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The current welfare code for domestic fowl reminds farmers of the need to take care to avoid injuring birds or causing them to panic during handling and catching. Failure to observe these and other provisions of this code may be used as evidence in proceedings under Section 1 of the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1968 which makes it an offence to cause or allow livestock on agricultural land to suffer unnecessary pain or unnecessary distress.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80422w14.html_wqn14"><B> Mr. Etherington: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will implement the recommendation made by the Farm Animal Welfare Council in 1992 on the treatment of broiler chickens with physical conditions which limit their ability to reach food or water; and if he will make a statement.  [37778]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80422w14.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Failure to take appropriate action to treat broiler chickens with physical conditions which limit their ability to reach food or water would give rise to offences under existing legislation which requires that livestock on agricultural land are protected from unnecessary pain or unnecessary distress.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what steps he is taking to ensure that broiler breeders are given sufficient food; and if he will make a statement.  [37777]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80422w14.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Welfare of Livestock Regulations 1994 (Statutory Instrument 1994/2126) already require that all livestock (including poultry) are fed a wholesome diet which is appropriate to their species and which is fed to them in sufficient quantity to maintain them in good health and to satisfy their nutritional needs. The Farm Animal Welfare Council is currently reviewing all aspects of the welfare of broiler breeders including current feeding regimes and will report later this year. I shall examine their recommendations carefully before deciding whether further action needs to be taken.

<P>
<a name="80422w15.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what EU fisheries restructuring and modernisation funds will be available to the United Kingdom once agreed United Kingdom fleet reductions have been achieved.  [37566]




<P>
<P><I>22 Apr 1998 : Column: 664</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80422w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 EU funds for structural assistance in the fisheries sector are administered under Council Regulation EC No. 3699/93, which required Member States to submit Sectoral Plans setting out detailed programmes of aid taking account of the provisions of their Multi-Annual Guidance Programmes (MAGP) for improving the balance between catching capacity and available stocks. Regulation 3699/93 does not, however, allow the granting of any aid for vessel construction which does not comply with a Member State's global, intermediate MAGP objectives and its final objectives by segment within the stated time limits. Aid for any modernisation likely to result in an increase in fishing effort is similarly precluded.
<P>

<a name="80422w15.html_para0">Because of the extent of the fleet reductions required to meet UK MAGP III targets, the Sectoral Plan submitted by the previous administration in March 1994, copies of which are available in the Library of the House, gave priority to expenditure on decommissioning and vessel safety grants. Some &#163;14.8 million remains under these headings in the current programming period, which ends on 31 December 1999, subject to the required nationally funded contributions being available to draw down these EU funds. But the previous administration made no provision for UK expenditure to comply with MAGP targets after the end of the 1997-98 financial year.
<P>

<a name="80422w15.html_para1">The question of what EU aid might be available for other restructuring and modernisation measures once fleet reduction targets have been achieved accordingly depends both on any necessary further expenditure towards meeting those targets and on new resources being found in UK national spending plans, which are still in the process of being examined in the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review. Entitlement to such aid would not, however, be automatic, but would require revisions to the UK's Sectoral Plan which the Government would propose only if they considered such measures justified in the circumstances then prevailing.

<a name="80422w15.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Dafis: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1) what is his timescale for the introduction of an early retirement scheme for farmers;  [37954]
<P>
<UL>(2) what plans he has to link the proposed early retirement scheme for farmers with measures to assist young people to enter the industry.  [37953]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80422w15.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Responses to the consultation document issued on the principle of whether or not to introduce an early retirement scheme or other measures have been requested by 30 April. If the Government decide, in the light of these responses, to introduce such a scheme prior approval must be sought from the European Commission. The Commission could take up to six months to grant such approval. Any scheme is therefore unlikely to be introduced before the end of 1998.
<P>

<a name="80422w15.html_para2">The Government will consider carefully any representations that an early retirement scheme should be linked to measures to assist young people to enter farming.

The Court made no specific reference to paragraph 26 of the President's order.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1) if he will make a statement on the dumping at sea off the Essex coast of material dredged from Harwich harbour;  [38943]

 A site known as Rough Towers, some 15 kilometres south-east of Harwich, has been used for disposal of dredgings from a number of ports including Felixstowe, Harwich and Ipswich for many years.
<P>

<a name="80422w15.html_para3">Monitoring at this disposal site has been, and will continue to be, carried out by the Ministry's scientists at the Centre for the Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science as well as by Harwich Haven Authority. Inevitably, disposal of large quantities of dredgings has had a localised effect at the site itself but there is also some evidence that fine sediments from the disposal of maintenance material have dispersed from the site. Fishermen have expressed concern that the deposit of fine sediment has altered adjacent crustacea fishing grounds.
<P>

<a name="80422w15.html_para4">Harwich Haven Authority has applied for licences under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 to dispose of dredged material arising from the deepening of the approach channel serving the Ports of Felixstowe and Harwich. A detailed assessment is currently being made of the applications and of the accompanying Environmental Statement, paying particular regard to the potential impact upon the marine environment and crustacea fisheries. Harwich Haven Authority, in consultation with the Ministry, are investigating a possible new disposal site further offshore to accommodate silty maintenance dredgings.
<P>

<a name="80422w15.html_para5">The Ministry requires particular emphasis to be given to the search for alternatives to sea disposal for dredged material. In conjunction with the Environment Agency, English Nature and local authorities, several areas have been identified where the material may be used beneficially to enhance marine and inter-tidal habitats and for coastal defence works, thus minimising the quantity to be disposed of to sea.

 I chaired the fifth meeting under the United Kingdom Presidency of the European Union Council of Agriculture Ministers on 20-21 April in Luxembourg. My noble Friend, Lord Donoughue, The Parliamentary Secretary responsible for the farming and food industry, represented the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="80422w15.html_para6">The principal items for discussion at the Council were Commission proposals on amendments to the EU banana, tobacco and olive oil market regimes; and its proposals in respect of common agricultural policy (CAP) prices for the 1998-99 marketing year. The Council marked an important step forward in the negotiations on all of these. On bananas, I was able to conclude that the Council would work towards an agreement in June on the basis of the Commission's proposal for changes to the EU banana regime to bring it into line with the ruling of the WTO appellate body. I was also able to conclude, in relation to both tobacco and olive oil, that intensive work would continue at expert level in the light of the guidance given by the Council, with the aim of reaching early conclusions on these proposals if possible. The Council also

I concluded that the Commission should continue its scientific work on this issue as a matter of urgency.
