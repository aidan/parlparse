<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether she has established the penalties that will apply from the failure of the UK fully to <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;implement and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;enforce the Animal By-Products Regulations.  [158747]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The UK has provided for the administration and enforcement of the EU Animal By-Products Regulation (EC) No. 1774/2002 by the Animal By-Products Regulations 2003. These came into force in England on 1&nbsp;July 2003, in Scotland on 1&nbsp;October 2003, in Wales on 31&nbsp;October 2003 and on 3&nbsp;December 2003 in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="40330w01.html_para0">Had any part of the UK failed to observe our EU obligations, this could have led to enforcement action being taken by the European Commission in the European Court of Justice (ECJ). If a Member State fails to take the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the European Court of Justice within the time limit specified, the Member State may incur either a lump sum penalty or a daily penalty payment. The penalty payment would be based on a uniform flat rate amount, multiplied by two coefficients, one reflecting the seriousness of the infringement, and the other the duration. This would then be multiplied by a factor reflecting the ability to pay and the number of votes the UK has in Council.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what discretion she has under European Union law to delay full <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;implementation and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;enforcement of the Animal By-Products Regulations.  [158748]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 As the EU Animal By-Products Regulation (EC 1774/2002) is directly applicable in all Member States, no discretion is available to delay either the implementation or the enforcement of the Regulation. However, where possible the UK secured transitional measures where it was clear that sectors of industry needed further time to comply with the requirements of the Regulation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what representations she has made to the European Commission concerning the payment to farmers of consequential losses arising from the imposition of TB restrictions on their farms.  [157987]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 No such representations have been made.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether live cattle imported from mainland Europe are tested for TB infection prior to being imported into the UK.  [158595]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Where the Member State, or the part of the Member State where the herd is situated is recognised as being officially free of tuberculosis (as defined by EU Directive 64/432/EEC), a TB test is not required prior to import to Great Britain. This applies whether for breeding, production or slaughter. All cattle must be tested if they do not come from a officially TB-free area.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what advice was given in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;1999 and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;subsequent years to the Veterinary Investigation Service by the Health and Safety Executive concerning the safety of their laboratories handling TB contaminated material; what action was taken as a result of that advice; and what the cost of that action was.  [158671]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Veterinary Investigation Service merged with the Central Veterinary Laboratory and became the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) In 1996.
<P>

<a name="40330w01.html_para1">VLA in Truro was served with a Crown Prohibition Notice by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) on 16&nbsp;August 1999. The HSE considered that it was unsafe to work with TB-infected badger carcases without the provision of "local exhaust ventilation".
<P>

<a name="40330w01.html_para2">VLA commissioned contractors to construct ventilated down-draught autopsy tables. The prototypes were installed at the Truro Regional Laboratory and were approved for use by the HSE. Subsequently, further autopsy tables were installed at all the remaining Regional Laboratories. The total cost was around &#163;90,000. An additional sum of about &#163;20,000 was spent on refurbishment of the Truro badger autopsy room.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what measures have been taken to assist farmers suffering multiple breakdowns safely to dispose of milk produced from reactor cows.  [158699]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 No particular measures are required as, currently, milk from reactor cattle can be sold for human consumption, provided it has been heat-treated.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to what extent reactive culling undertaken in the Krebs trials is comparable with reactive culling trials undertaken previously.  [158749]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The randomised badger culling trial is the first culling trial in Great Britain to include scientific controls, allowing a rigorous estimation of the impact of a reactive culling protocol. No other such reactive culling trials have previously been undertaken in Great Britain.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how the Government reconciles its commitment to protect the badger populations with its commitment to maintain biodiversity in indigenous birds and mammals.  [158752]




<P>
<P><I>30 Mar 2004 : Column 1295W</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 As has been previously explained the badger benefits from legal protection introduced to outlaw cruelty towards animals. For example, the Protection of Animals Act 1911, which among other things, made the baiting of animals illegal, and the Wild Mammals (Protection) Act 1996, which made certain specified acts of cruelty illegal.
<P>

<a name="40330w01.html_para3">There is no reconciliation to be made with our stated commitment to biodiversity. The Department has put in place 391 species action plans, which are designed to help those species whose populations that are endangered or vulnerable.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether all TB hotspots in the UK have been identified.  [158754]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 There is no universally accepted definition of a "hotspot". Testing cattle herds for TB at regular enough intervals will, combined with other methods of surveillance, allow identification of areas of emerging infection in cattle.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the consequences for the spread of bovine TB are of badger migration into areas which are already colonised by established badger social groups.  [158755]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 There will be some movement of badgers even within areas of high density where social groups are virtually contiguous. However, rates of movement between groups are likely to be lower at high population density. Wherever movement between groups occurs there is the potential for disease transmission.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of whether the Krebs trials should be halted immediately.  [158760]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT) is under constant assessment. The Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISG) carry out periodic interim analyses of RBCT data. If the ISG's analyses were to reveal any significant findings they would be reported to Ministers. An Independent Review Group, chaired by Professor Charles Godfray, has just completed an assessment of the RBCT and associated work, and the state of progress. The Review Group's report is expected to be published soon.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the PathMan project to which her recent consultation document Preparing for a New GB Strategy on Bovine TB refers is; and when results are expected from it.  [158761]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The 'PathMan' project is not referred to in the consultation document "Preparing for a new GB strategy on bovine TB".
<P>

<a name="40330w01.html_para4">'PathMan' is a web-based data capture and project management system specifically developed for a complex project involving collection of data from multiple collaborators or sites. It is being used to collect project data (epidemiology, pathology, bacteriology, histopathology and immunology) from the examination of 200 tuberculin skin-test positive and 200 suspected 



<P>
<P><I>30 Mar 2004 : Column 1296W</I><P>
false negative cattle in order to understand the pathogenesis of naturally infected animals. The project is due to end in September 2005.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what assessment she has made of the reasons why the Krebs reactive trials led to an increase in bovine TB;  [158793]
<P>
<UL>(2) whether the Krebs reactive trial proved conclusively that badgers are involved in the spread of TB among cattle.  [158799]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The report of the review group chaired by Sir John Krebs, published in 1998, concluded that "there is strong evidence for an association between TB in badgers and cattle". The result from the reactive element of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial adds to the sum of that evidence. Further research and analysis is under way to investigate the reasons for this finding.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what factors in the Thornbury trial contributed to the success of the trial in reducing bovine TB.  [158794]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Both the gassing method of culling to thoroughly eliminate the badgers, and the steps taken to prevent recolonization for several years, were factors likely to have maximised the reduction of any effect of badgers on cattle TB in the Thornbury trial area.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_wqn14"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs which voluntary groups have made representations to her Department on the welfare of badgers.  [158795]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Defra periodically receives representations from a range of organisations on issues relating to badgers. Unfortunately, information is not kept in a form that would allow us, without disproportionate effort, to identify which representations specifically concerned badger welfare.
<P>

<a name="40330w01.html_para5">However, I can reveal that the following organisations contributed to the recent public consultation exercise on licensing under the Protection of Badgers Act, 1992. The welfare of badgers was a central issue of this exercise.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has to create partnerships with farmers by means of granting them licences to kill badgers in TB-infected areas as a means of improving control strategies for TB in cattle.  [158797]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We have no current plans for such partnerships. As the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs made clear at the recent National Farmers Union AGM, we are open to radical solutions. If scientific evidence suggests that badger culling would be effective we will want to consider whether we can develop a practical and cost-effective policy.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_wqn17"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the likelihood of eradicating bovine TB by concentrating on biosecurity measures in the cattle industry without taking measures to eliminate the disease in the wildlife reservoir.  [158798]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w01.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 None. The control of TB in cattle is a complex problem and there is no single solution.

<P>
<a name="40330w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Bellingham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what measures are being taken to improve coastal defences in East Anglia.  [163615]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I understand that over the next 10 years the Environment Agency (EA) is planning to spend about &#163;70&nbsp;million on coastal defence projects on the East Anglian coast to provide increased protection to some 25,000 residential properties.
<P>

<a name="40330w02.html_para0">The EA is carrying out significant works at Hunstanton to Heacham; Happisburgh to Winterton; Great Yarmouth; Felixstowe; and Tilbury. Defra is also grant aiding Waveney district council for major works to protect against coastal erosion on Corton seafront, north of Lowestoft, and will consider applications from coast protection authorities for other works that meet the Department's criteria for funding.
<P>

<a name="40330w02.html_para1">Five Shoreline Management Plans (SMPs) cover the East Anglian coast. These are all to be reviewed and second generation SMPs produced by 2008. SMPs are high-level plans that recommend policies for flood defence and coastal protection for the future. They take account of erosion and pressures on existing defences and the need to work more in keeping with natural processes. They outline the management policy for each area of the coastline for the next 100 years, and will provide predictions of the implications of these policies over the next 20, 50 and 100 years. The first of these, SMP3b covering the coast from Kelling to Lowestoft Ness, is currently being developed by North Norfolk district council as the lead authority, along with the EA and Great Yarmouth borough council. The draft policies for this SMP will be available for consultation later this year.

<P>
<a name="40330w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department's priority scoring system for the funding of flood defence and coast protection capital works was introduced in 1997 and revised in the light of experience following extensive consultation. The new system became operational from April 2003. There is no intended bias against coastal erosion schemes in the new system. If any unintended bias emerged the Department would be willing to consider changes to the system. Officials have agreed to hold a workshop with representatives of coast protection authorities to consider whether alternative approaches could inform the allocation process in future years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether the Risk Assessment for Strategic Planning database held by the Environment Agency has been updated to take account of the performance of demountable flood defences in Bewdley; and when insurers will receive these data.

 The Risk Assessment for Strategic Planning (RASP) method was used to produce the National Flood Risk Assessment 2002. The flood probability data arising from that exercise were provided under licence to the Association of British Insurers (ABI) in July 2003. That database has not been updated to take account of the successful use of demountable defences in Bewdley.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department has no current plans to re-examine the policy on flood protection for mobile homes in flood risk areas.
<P>

<a name="40330w02.html_para6">Defra provides funding to the relevant operating authorities for capital works where an area at risk of flooding is of sufficient national priority, and where it is possible to provide a technically sound, economically viable and environmentally sustainable scheme to reduce flood risk. For mobile home sites, one of the considerations in determining whether the cost of protection is reasonable will generally include whether it would be more cost effective for the site to be moved to a lower risk location. Clearly site owners may choose to implement measures to reduce flood risk at their own expense (subject to necessary consents) and, as landowners, they are ultimately responsible for protecting their property against flooding.
<P>

<a name="40330w02.html_para7">Advice to the owners of caravan parks and campsites can be found in "Planning Policy Guidance 25: Development and Flood Risk", published by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. PPG25 emphasises that owners should prepare safe and effective plans for action to be taken in the event of a flood at the site and ensure that any person who resides in a caravan or tent on that site is informed of the degree of risk and the action they should take in a flood event.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The costs of evacuation of people from their homes because of flooding or risk of flooding is a matter for local authorities. The provision of temporary accommodation for people who have been evacuated is a matter for individuals and their insurers, although local authorities can assist in cases where there is a need for their further assistance.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Somerset levels are a flood plain where flooding is part of the natural cycle.
<P>

<a name="40330w02.html_para8">While there is no general right to flood protection and no provision to compensate land owners or occupiers for flood damage, there are existing examples of cases where farmers have received payment for additional intentional flooding that forms a part of justified new flood defence measures. There is no intention to give farmers specific help with flooding under CAP reform.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the cost-benefit analysis undertaken by her Department regarding the impact on the UK economy of adding each new GM crop.  [164021]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 As part of the GM Dialogue the Strategy Unit carried out a study of the costs and benefits of GM crops. Their report 'Field Work: weighing up the costs and benefits of GM crops' was published on 11&nbsp;July last year. The report concluded that GM crops could offer some cost and convenience advantages to UK farmers, although any economic benefit is likely to be limited in the short term as only a narrow range of existing GM crops are currently suited to UK conditions, and weak consumer demand may limit take-up. In the longer term it concluded that future developments in GM crops have the potential to offer more wide-ranging benefits, to both farmers and consumers.
<P>

<a name="40330w02.html_para10">We will agree to the commercial cultivation of a GM crop only if we are satisfied that it is safe, and we will provide genuine choice for consumers.

 <i>[holding answer 29&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> The GM maize Chardon LL will not be grown commercially in the UK before spring 2005 at the very earliest. The Government aim to have co-existence measures in place before then. We are proposing that GM growers should follow a code of practice which has statutory backing, based on the 0.9&nbsp;per cent. EU labelling threshold for GM presence. It is envisaged that the code will include measures such as crop separation distances to minimise GM cross-pollination. We will consult stakeholders on the details of this as soon as possible, on whether a threshold below 0.9&nbsp;per cent. should apply for organic production, and on options for providing compensation to non-GM farmers who incur a financial loss because a GM presence exceeds statutory thresholds.

 No. The procedures for assessing individual applications to grow GM crops are set out in EU Directive 2001/18 and in the implementing UK legislation.

 We continue to have concerns about Iran's work on uranium enrichment, which, under the agreement signed by Iran and the Foreign Ministers of France, Germany and the United Kingdom on 21&nbsp;October 2003, Iran undertook to suspend.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w11.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Beggs: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what the total financial cost has been of investigations into the murder of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;Mr. Patrick Kelly on 10&nbsp;August 1974 and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;Mr. Robert Jameson on 17&nbsp;January 1974, both of Trillick.  [162708]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w11.html_spnew0"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 In view of the significant time which has elapsed since these two murders, an estimate of the costs of the associated police investigations could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w11.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Iris Robinson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, whether relatives of those who had coroners' post mortems will be invited to planned memorials for the victims of organ retention in Northern Ireland. [164577]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w11.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 The Department is engaged in ongoing discussions with Belfast city council, Derry city council and the Relatives' Reference Group about the location of suitable memorials for those affected by the retention of human organs and tissue. Relatives of those who were affected, whether through coroners' or hospital post mortem examinations, will be most welcome to attend any future service of dedication of the memorials.

<a name="40330w11.html_sbhd2"><H3 align=center>Phoenix Natural Gas</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w11.html_wqn2"><B> Lady Hermon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what discussions he has had with representatives of Phoenix Natural Gas on the recent increase in gas prices; and if he will make a statement.  [164390]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 I have met with the Chairman and Chief Executive of Phoenix Natural Gas to express my deep concerns over proposed gas price increases in Northern Ireland. I have also been in contact with all the parties concerned including the Northern Ireland Authority for Energy Regulation (NIAER), the General Consumer Council (NI), National Energy Action and the Department of Social Development who have responsibility for the Northern Ireland Housing Executive and Fuel Poverty. I have also met a delegation of NI political representatives from all the major political parties to hear their concerns. I have asked NIAER to carry out an urgent investigation into the proposed increase and the circumstances leading up to Phoenix's announcement on 19&nbsp;March, and to report to me by 31&nbsp;March 2004.

<a name="40330w11.html_sbhd3"><H3 align=center>Post Mortems</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w11.html_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Iris Robinson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, what procedures relatives will be required to use to obtain tissue from consented hospital and coroner post mortems when the new legislation is implemented. [164576]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w11.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 In January 2004 I launched a public consultation document entitled "Post Mortem Examinations&#151;Good Practice in Consent and the Care of the Bereaved". It contains new draft consent forms and guidance, which address relatives' wishes for the return or disposal of tissue. It also takes account of the provisions of the new Human Tissue Bill currently 



<P>
<P><I>30 Mar 2004 : Column 1334W</I><P>
before Parliament. The consultation period ends on 27&nbsp;April 2004 and it is anticipated that the Department will issue final guidance to the HPSS towards the end of 2004. This will be made available to relatives through the Relatives' Reference Group and the Department's web site. It is too early at this stage to say what the new procedures will be but the principle of consent will underpin them all.

<a name="40330w11.html_sbhd4"><H3 align=center>Pulmonary Hypertension</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w11.html_wqn4"><B> Lady Hermon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on the provisions in Northern Ireland for sufferers of pulmonary hypertension.  [164541]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w11.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 Pulmonary hypertension is a rare abnormality and is managed within existing specialty areas including cardiology, general medicine, respiratory medicine and in the case of children, paediatrics. Each case is managed individually, with treatment provided appropriate to the patient's particular needs.

<a name="40330w11.html_sbhd5"><H3 align=center>Royal Ulster Constabulary</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w11.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Beggs: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland whether the search and log records of the Royal Ulster Constabulary for the night of 17&nbsp;February 1978 are still held.  [162688]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w11.html_spnew5"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The Police Service of Northern Ireland has carried out a review of the investigation file and HM Coroner's reports relating to the La Mon bombing. However search papers and logs for the night of 17&nbsp;February 1978 have not been retained within these papers.

<a name="40330w11.html_sbhd6"><H3 align=center>Unionist Paramilitaries</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w11.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what assistance Unionist political parties are giving the police in curbing the criminal activities of Unionist paramilitary groups.  [162594]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w11.html_spnew6"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The Police Service of Northern Ireland does not categorise any paramilitary group as Unionist. The category used is Loyalist. Unionist political parties have publicly stated their support for the police in their efforts to tackle the criminal activities of Loyalist paramilitary groups. Representatives of Unionist parties also sit on the Policing Board and show their further support for the police at community level by participating in the local District Policing Partnerships.

<a name="40330w11.html_dpthd0"><H3 align=center>WORK AND PENSIONS</H3>



<a name="40330w11.html_sbhd7"><H3 align=center>Benefits</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w11.html_wqn7"><B> Bob Spink: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make it his policy to pay <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;bereavement benefit and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;invalid care allowance without deductions arising from the payment of both benefits; and if he will make a statement.  [164035]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w11.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Pond: </B> 
 It is a basic principle of the social security system that two benefits at a time cannot be paid for the same purpose. Even though the circumstances which give rise to entitlement to Carer's Allowance and Bereavement Benefit are different, they are both 



<P>
<P><I>30 Mar 2004 : Column 1335W</I><P>
designed to provide a degree of replacement for lost or foregone income. Carer's Allowance replaces income where the carer has had to give up the chance of working to look after a severely disabled person, while Bereavement Benefit replaces income following the death of a spouse.
<P>

<a name="40330w11.html_para0">Carer's Allowance is therefore not payable, or not payable in full, in addition to Bereavement Benefit. The payment of Bereavement Benefit takes precedence, either extinguishing or reducing the payment of Carer's Allowance. Nevertheless, the income of a person in these circumstances will be at least as high as the rate of Carer's Allowance, and is usually higher. In addition, where the benefit cannot be paid, the person will keep underlying entitlement to Carer's Allowance, which gives them access to the carer premium in the income-related benefits such as Income Support, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit.
<P>

<a name="40330w11.html_para1">We have no plans to change these arrangements.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w11.html_wqn8"><B> Hugh Bayley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (1) how many individuals living in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;York and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;North Yorkshire were in receipt of (i) state retirement pension and (ii) other benefits in (A) 1997 and (B) each year since then;  [162961]
<P>

 As at 27&nbsp;December 2003&#151;the latest available date for which data are available&#151; 120 individuals recorded as having sought asylum were detained in prisons in the UK. Of these, less than five were detained at HMP Maghaberry, all of whom were adult males. Minors may not be held at HMP Maghaberry. Information on the number of people detained as at 27&nbsp;March 2004 will be published on the Home Office website (www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration1.html) on 25&nbsp;May 2004.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether asylum seekers detained at Maghaberry Prison are <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;subject to normal prison rules and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;held separately from (i) sentenced and (ii) remand prisoners.  [162168]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w13.html_spnew3"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Immigration detainees held at HMP Maghaberry are located on a separate landing in Mourne House and are separate from the main prison population. Detainees are subject to prison rules but are managed as untried prisoners, with a more favourable regime that is more akin to that of enhanced prisoners.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w13.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. McGrady: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department for how long Maghaberry Prison will be used to detain asylum seekers.  [162235]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w13.html_spnew4"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Individual detainees are held for no longer than is necessary and we seek to ensure that any period of detention is kept to the minimum. An individual detainee who initially elected to remain at HMP Maghaberry rather than be transferred to an Immigration Service removal centre in Great Britain may at any time request to be transferred to such a removal centre.
<P>

<a name="40330w13.html_para2">More generally, we have no plans at present to end the use of HMP Maghaberry for the very small numbers of immigration detainees who express a preference to remain in Northern Ireland rather than be transferred to an Immigration Service removal centre in Great Britain. The small numbers of individuals concerned, usually less than 10 at any one time, would not be sufficient to make a dedicated detention facility in Northern Ireland viable to establish or operate.

<P>

 On 15&nbsp;March 2004 the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit published a "Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy for England". The Strategy sets out the Government plans to combat the range of problems caused by alcohol misuse in England. The majority of London Drug Action Teams (DATs) have already drawn up local alcohol misuse strategies, as part of their plans to tackle wider substance misuse. Officials are working with DATs and Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs) to ensure that all London boroughs prioritise alcohol misuse in the next round of crime and drugs strategies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w14.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Criminal Records Bureau scans application forms into its secure system and the address details are compared against a piece of software that identifies whether a legitimate address has been entered. Should an address not be recognised, the form is sent to members of staff who will check the details against a standard verification system known as "Post-Code Lookup". If the address details cannot be verified, the CRB sends a letter to the applicant to seek clarification.
<P>

<a name="40330w14.html_para0">Enhanced Disclosure Applicants are asked to provide details of their addresses, which cover the past five years. This information is used to determine which police force(s) need to be contacted to obtain details of any information held that is not on the police national computer. In such circumstances, the police will check local records to see whether information about the applicant, can be linked with any criminal activity, or any other information that might be pertinent to the position applied for.
<P>

<a name="40330w14.html_para1">Occasionally, an applicant may send with their application form details of any convictions they hold. These are returned to the applicant with a letter informing them that such details are not required for CRB purposes, however the applicant is required to declare such convictions to the registered body.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w14.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) received an Enhanced Disclosure Application Form in respect of Helen Livett on 28&nbsp;August 2002. The CRB will not issue a disclosure as a result of this application because it has been withdrawn. In January 2003, the bureau conducted an exercise to identify the number of old applications that had been suspended, awaiting further information and Helen Livett's was identified as one such application.
<P>

<a name="40330w14.html_para2">The CRB wrote to Helen Livett and her Registered Body to advise that further information was required in order to process her disclosure application. These letters stated that the application would be withdrawn if this information was not received within six weeks of the date of the letters. No reply was received; consequently Helen Livett's disclosure was withdrawn on 11&nbsp;April 2003.
<P>

<a name="40330w14.html_para3">Should Helen Livett require a disclosure, she will need to re-apply, ensuring that she provides further payment and sufficient information to enable the CRB to process it.

<P>
<a name="40330w15.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 General grant funding for police authorities is allocated on the basis of an estimate of relative need for police resources, taking into account local resources. Resident population is the most significant single factor in the estimate of need. The latest population estimates available from the Registrar General are used.
<P>

<a name="40330w15.html_para0">The Chief Constable and the Police Authority allocate resources at force level according to local plans and operational priorities.
<P>

<a name="40330w15.html_para1">Lancashire Police Authority's grant in 2004&#150;05 will be &#163;182.9&nbsp;million, an increase of &#163;5.8&nbsp;million or 3.25&nbsp;per cent. over this year. It will also receive over &#163;17&nbsp;million for targeted programmes and capital provision.
<P>

<a name="40330w15.html_para2">I understand from the Chief Constable that Lancashire Constabulary have embarked on a significant community engagement programme. Additional community beat officers have been put in place across the constabulary over the last 12 months, including in Chorley. The constabulary plans to deploy an additional 15 officers to the Southern Division over the next 12 months, who will be split equally across each of the three borough areas. In addition, community support officers are in place. The constabulary has recently launched the Community Safety Accreditation Scheme to improve the quality of service to local communities.

 The Government announced in the Budget that, owing to continued high levels of spirits duty fraud, it would legislate to implement the Roques report recommendation to introduce tax stamps for spirits. In doing so, the Government will help the trade financially with compliance costs by deferring payment for tax stamps, assisting firms with capital investment and freezing spirits duty for the remainder of this Parliament. Further announcements will be made once detailed options have been considered in discussion with the trade.

 There has been extensive consultation with the spirits industry since December 2001 when a formal consultation on tax stamps issues was launched. Following the Chancellor's announcement in last year's Pre-Budget Report (Cm 6042) that he would implement at the Budget the Roques report recommendation of tax stamps for products subject to the spirits rate of duty when an equally effective alternative could be found, Ministers and officials have received a wide range of representations and held more than 40 meetings with industry representatives. These discussions are continuing and joint industry Government working groups have been established to progress the implementation of tax stamps.

 The consultation process on pre-owned assets was open to all interested parties, and the Chancellor took account of all responses received when settling the details announced in his Budget. How readily any particular tax avoidance scheme using trusts can be dismantled will depend on the scheme; in the case of schemes involving pre-owned assets the Chancellor concluded, with the benefit of consultation, that dismantling them would often be difficult. Provision to address this is among the matters covered by his Budget announcements.

 The DTI is working with the devolved Administrations and regional development agencies to extend the availability of broadband still further with a view to broadband being available in every community by the end of next year. We have given them &#163;30&nbsp;million for pilot schemes to extend the availability of broadband in areas not currently served by the market. This has helped to stimulate further regional schemes across the UK worth at least &#163;377&nbsp;million over 2000&#150;06.

<a name="40330w17.html_para7">In England, the Broadband Aggregation Project will make sure that the &#163;1 billion Government spend on broadband connectivity for the public sector between 2003 and 2006 will offer the best value for money and widen availability to surrounding communities.

<P>

<a name="40330w17.html_para9">With regard to digital TV, we said in 1999 that before we switch off analogue transmissions everyone who could receive the main public service broadcasting channels in analogue form must be able to receive them on digital systems, and that switching must be affordable for the vast majority of people. These criteria still hold true. However, the Government consider that the advantages of digital television are such that the question is not whether, but how and when we should switch off analogue transmissions.
<P>

<a name="40330w17.html_para10">One of the main arguments for switching off analogue transmissions is that until we do so around 25&nbsp;per cent. of households will not be able to receive digital services through an aerial. This is because if the power of digital transmissions were increased to enable more complete coverage this would interfere with analogue transmissions, thereby degrading the quality of analogue television reception. Full digital coverage therefore depends on switching off the analogue signal. We are currently working with broadcasters and other stakeholders (including consumer groups) under the Digital Television Action Plan (available at www. digitaltelevision.gov.uk) on an analogue to digital switchover implementation plan. One of the deliverables under this plan will be a region by region timetable for switchover.

<P>

<a name="40330w17.html_para11">Many rural areas are already able to receive digital television signals. Whether a particular household can receive them depends on whether that household is in the reception area of one of the 80 main transmitters from which digital signals are currently broadcast, not on whether it is in a rural or urban area. Digital terrestrial television reception can be checked by entering the viewer's postcode on either the Freeview or the Digital Television Group (DTG)'s websites www.freeview. co.uk or www.dtg.org.uk. Additionally, retailers are advised to check whether customers can receive digital terrestrial television where they live before buying, and most retailers normally bring this to the customer's attention at the point of sale.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many employers, and in which sectors, have conducted equal pay reviews in each year for which figures are available.  [163542]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 Research published by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) in 2003 has found that 36&nbsp;per cent. of large organisations (500 or more employees) in their main survey had either conducted an equal pay review (EPR), were in the process of conducting one, or were planning to do so before the end of 2003. 27&nbsp;per cent. of medium-sized organisations (100&#150;499 employees) had conducted, were conducting, or were planning to conduct an EPR by the end of 2003.
<P>

<a name="40330w18.html_para5">There is no information available on which sectors have conducted equal pay reviews, nor is there information available on organisations conducting pay reviews prior to 2003. However, the EOC survey found that in the manufacturing sector 57&nbsp;per cent. of organisations had an equal pay policy, in the private services sector 54&nbsp;per cent. had a policy and in the public sector 69&nbsp;per cent. had an equal pay policy.

 This Government are committed to British manufacturing and helping manufacturers in Britain to compete successfully for public contracts.
<P>

<a name="40330w18.html_para6">That is why the my right hon. Friend Prime Minister has asked me to chair a cross-government ministerial team to deliver the agenda set out in the Government's Innovation Report, building on work to identify areas where public procurement can better facilitate innovation and how this can be achieved, particularly through developing guidance for public procurers on how to procure innovative solutions and working with NHS Estates to draw innovation through the supply chain.
<P>

<a name="40330w18.html_para7">This is also why in October 2002 this Government launched their Defence Industrial Policy, which commits us to become more innovative in the awarding of major defence contracts and which was the context for the decision to award the contract for Hawk.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when she expects the research on the way interest ceilings work in other EU countries will be completed.  [164656]<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w18.html_wqn5"><B> Harry Cohen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what requirements are in place to ensure that job references provided by employers are accurate and not misleading; what assessment she has made of the adequacy of remedies for those who may be a victim of an inaccurate reference and may be temporarily unemployed as a consequence, with particular reference to the cost of obtaining a remedy; and if she will make a statement.  [164083]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 Employees can take action in the employment tribunals if they consider that a reference discriminates against them unlawfully, for instance on grounds of sex or sexual orientation. Employers also have a common law duty to take reasonable care in supplying references. An employee provided with a misleading or inaccurate reference could consider taking action in the civil courts against its supplier. The Department has made no specific assessment of the potential cost involved in seeking redress for a misleading reference or the remedies available.

[164554]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 It is not possible to provide estimates specifically for the constituency of Ogmore or Bridgend county borough. Based on the Office for National Statistics' Low Pay data released in 2003, the DTI estimates that between 90,000 and 110,000 people in Wales stand to benefit directly from the October 2004 uprating of the National Minimum Wage (that was recently announced).

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will take steps to ensure that the next generation of PIN pads introduced into post offices will be fully accessible for disabled people, with particular reference to those with sight problems.  [163643]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w18.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The design and operation of the Post Office card account, including the use of PIN pads, is a commercial matter for Post Office Ltd. I can confirm, however, that the Post Office is working to ensure its services are as accessible to as many customers as possible. To this end it has already made improvements to its PIN pads. It has: (i) developed a key guard for the PIN pad which clips over the unused keys to simplify its appearance and help guide customers; and (ii) added a

<P><I>30 Mar 2004 : Column 1364W</I><P>

Further improvements are planned including: (i) producing a guide with RNIB to enhance the enter, clear and cancel keys by inserting tactile symbols next to each of these keys; (ii) different beeps for the enter, clear and cancel keys; and (iii) large print, tactile maps and audio guides to be available in post offices to assist customers to use PIN pads. The Post Office is in consultation with the Disability Rights Commission (DRC) and other representative groups about these adjustments.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps the Government have taken to help small businesses in Crosby since 1997.  [160582]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w18.html_spnew8"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 In his Budget statement the Chancellor announced a number of steps to help small businesses including an increase of capital allowances to 50&nbsp;per cent. and raising VAT registration threshold to 58&nbsp;per cent., all of which helps Small Businesses in Crosby. In addition since 2001 the Business Link Operator for Greater Merseyside has contributed &#163;13,700 consultancy subsidy to help 126 businesses, which includes three organisations who have shown an interest in improving their business through developing their people. Two of these are now preparing towards obtaining the Investors in People standard.
<P>

<a name="40330w18.html_para8">A number of organisations have taken advantage of Business Link for Merseyside's subsidised consulting programme under Objective One, one of which wished to establish a scenic/prop workshop for the film and media industry, the subsidy helped the organisation draw up a business plan and raise the finance to develop their business idea. A day Nursery who have expanded into new premises were helped by using this subsidy to help promote their new premises by a production of a new brochure. Two financial service companies have benefited, one by using the subsidy to develop their website to promote financial services, the other to obtain a network solution to provide more efficient and effective ICT services within the business. Another Merseyside company is looking to expand their business and will use the subsidy to develop a marketing plan.
<P>

<a name="40330w18.html_para9">One organisation has used the Business Link's Supply Chain Programme and has just signed up for a second year, part of the programme puts interested businesses on a database and matches them up with purchasers further up the supply chain, this gives the business greater opportunity to grow.
<P>

<a name="40330w18.html_para10">The Business Link has assisted a number of businesses to start-up, this includes helping to draw up a plan to restart a business following pregnancy of the owner, helping identify and obtain funding to allow an employee of a small business to buy out from the retiring employer, assisting a new business to access growth finance, providing an action plan to a business wishing to recycle computers to charities.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment she has made of the reasons for <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;the fall in the number of VAT registrations and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;the increase in the number of VAT de-registrations since 1997.  [162689]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40330w19.html_spnew9"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 VAT registrations and de-registrations do not capture all start-up activity. Businesses are unlikely to be registered if they fall below the compulsory VAT threshold, which has been rising in each year since 1997. Similarly, businesses that de-register will not necessarily have closed. Only 1.8&nbsp;million out of 3.8&nbsp;million enterprises were registered for VAT at the start of 2002.
<P>

<a name="40330w19.html_para14">Barclays Bank's latest survey of business creation includes non-VAT registered firms and shows that there were 93,100 business start ups in England and Wales in the third quarter of 2003. The latest yearly figures show 384,900 business start ups in England and Wales in the 12 months ending in September 2003. This represents a 3&nbsp;per cent. increase on the year before.

 <i>[holding answer 29&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> Suppliers invited to participate in an e-auction are initially subjected to a traditional tender process, where product quality issues are assessed. Only those suppliers who meet the minimum criteria on both commercial viability and product quality and standards are invited to submit an initial tender and to participate in any subsequent e-auction event. The award of contracts following an e-auction is not based on the lowest bid price, but on a combination of factors including quality, service and price.

 Training courses to allow front tine ambulance staff to respond safely and effectively to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear incidents have been, and are being, conducted by each ambulance service to a standard syllabus delivered by nationally trained local instructors. That syllabus was developed, and the instructors trained, through the police national training centre at Winterbourne Gunner, with combined input from each of the three main blue light services. The course content places particular emphasis on multi-agency aspects and requires input from the other emergency services at local level.
<P>

 The Ambulance Service Association reports that, to date, specialist training in the use of personal equipment has been provided for 2,500 front-line ambulance staff and that number is expected to increase to 3,000 by early summer 2004. The target is to create and maintain a trained cadre of 3,000 staff, which represents about 20&nbsp;per cent. of front-line accident and emergency staff from ambulance services in England by the end of the year.
<P>

<a name="40330w22.html_para1">The Government have provided equipment and an additional financial contribution of &#163;5,454,200 in 2003&#150;04 to enable ambulance services to continue to develop and maintain specialist teams and training activities.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is creating a resilient national network of regional fire and rescue control centres which make possible more effective responses to local, regional or national incidents of significant/substantial scale or complexity. This approach strengthens the ability of the service to maximise national capacity to deal with exceptional call volumes, improve resilience and provide more effective fallback arrangements, and address business continuity requirements. The net effect of the improved arrangements will be a reduction in the threat to life, not just from fire, but from a wide range of other threats, not envisaged when the existing infrastructure for call handling and mobilising was developed.

 Communication skills are an important and integral part of every pupil's learning experience. The general teaching requirements of the National Curriculum, which apply across all areas of the curriculum, state that pupils should be taught to express themselves correctly and appropriately and to read accurately and with understanding.
<P>

<a name="40330w25.html_para0">The programmes of study for English at Key Stage 3 and 4, state that pupils should learn to communicate confidently in a wide variety of contexts, adapting what they say and how they say it to different situations and people. English is one of the strands of the Key Stage 3 Strategy in which we are investing &#163;670&nbsp;million up to the end of March 2005. This aims to improve teaching and learning to develop pupils, at age 14, into independent learners and confident, effective communicators.
<P>

<a name="40330w25.html_para1">Some pupils have significant communication difficulties as the result of acquired or inherited conditions. We have established the Communication Aids Project (CAP) with &#163;20&nbsp;million funding to March 2006 to help such pupils through the provision of high technology communication aids.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how much Devon schools have received in Standards Fund Grant in each year since its introduction.  [164786]<P>

<P>
<a name="40330w25.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Standards Fund grants are allocated to local education authorities (LEAs), not directly to schools. It is not possible to identify separately the amounts allocated to schools by LEAs. The following table shows allocations for the Standards Fund for Devon local education authority since the Standards Fund was introduced in 1998&#150;99. The allocations include both Government and local authority contributions. The figures for 1998&#150;99 to 2002&#150;03 include class size grant, worth &#163;2.9&nbsp;million in 2002&#150;03. Since 2003&#150;04, funding for class size grant is distributed via Education Formula Spending Shares (EFSS).

<a name="40330w25.html_para4">From the information available to the LSC it has not been feasible to obtain estimates at constituency level or separate figures by subject without incurring disproportionate cost. Likewise it has not been feasible to obtain comparable figures for periods before April 2001 when the Skills for Life strategy was launched and the LSC was formed, but information shows it was considerably less than at present.

<a name="40330w25.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 There are no annual data available on levels of literacy and numeracy levels in Greater London since 1995. However the DfES Skills for Life survey published in October 2003 provides estimates of the numbers of people who are at various literacy and numeracy skill levels for Greater London Local Learning and Skills Council Areas. The findings are summarised in the following tables. For London as a whole 46&nbsp;per cent. of the population are at level 2 <sup>1</sup> , 35&nbsp;per cent. are at level 1 <sup>2</sup>  and 19&nbsp;per cent. at entry level 3 or below <sup>3</sup> , which roughly equates to below a G grade at GCSE, for literacy. The figures for the London Local Learning and Skills Council Areas should be treated with caution since they are based on small sample sizes.

 The information is not held centrally. Within the context of the statutory National Curriculum, where music is compulsory for pupils aged 5 to 14, and Physical Education (PE) is compulsory for pupils aged 5 to 16, it is for individual schools to use their budgets as they judge appropriate.
<P>

<a name="40330w27.html_para2">The Government are investing more than &#163;1 billion in England to transform PE, school sport and club links. The funding will help deliver an ambitious Public Service Agreement target, shared with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, to increase the percentage of 5 to 16-year-olds who spend a minimum of two hours each week on high quality PE and school sport within and beyond the curriculum to 75&nbsp;per cent. by 2006.
<P>

<a name="40330w27.html_para3">The Department is providing &#163;909,086 to support the delivery of 2 School Sport Partnerships in the North Tyneside LEA area. The partnerships include 12 secondary and 51 primary schools and provide enhanced sports opportunities for all young people and ensure that their pupils spend a minimum of two hours a week on high quality PE and School Sport.

 Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 requires local authorities and schools to obtain the written consent of the Secretary of State before they can dispose of any part of a school's playing field. Schools are only allowed to dispose of genuinely surplus areas of playing fields. All sale proceeds from approved applications are used to provide new or improved sports or education facilities at maintained schools.

Some 19 of these cases are at closed or closing school sites. Of the 21 cases at operating schools, 18 of them included proposals to provide better sports
