[164249]</p>








<p><a name="40422w01.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 I have had informal discussions with ministerial colleagues in the Netherlands on matters relating to coastal defences. However, officials from the two countries meet on a regular basis. Recognising the benefits to be gained by shared experiences both in respect of policy and engineering solutions, officials from the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Denmark and England agreed to meet on an annual basis more than five years ago and so formed the North Sea Coastal Managers Group. The English delegation is led by my Chief Engineer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40422w01.html_para2">
Meetings of the group have proved an invaluable forum for the exchange of information on the subjects raised by the right hon. Member. However it is important to recognise that there are differences between the Netherlands and England both in terms of the geography of the coastline and the proportion of the economic wealth at risk of flooding.

 The Government recognise the benefits of local food and is keen to encourage a flourishing local food sector. In recognition of this, provision is available under the England rural development programme for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supporting activities such as the establishment of farmers&#039; markets, the development of regional and local&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;branding of foodstuffs and the formation of collaborative groups to market quality products. For example, within the last year we awarded &#163;100,256 to the National Association of Farmers&#039; Markets to raise the profile of farmers&#039; markets across England and to increase public awareness of them.

Defra has also helped finance a number of local sourcing workshops organised by the Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD) designed to bring together supermarkets and small local producers to explore how barriers to local sourcing can be overcome. Following on from this, we helped fund the Business in The Community (BiTC) and IGD guide for small businesses looking to work with large food retailers and food service companies&#151;&quot;Local Sourcing&#151;Opening the Door for Small Business&quot;. In addition to this, our Public Sector Food Procurement Initiative is designed to encourage public sector bodies to procure their food in a manner that promotes sustainable development and to encourage more small and local businesses to compete to supply them with food.

 The Crown Prosecution Service makes the determination in all cases where criminal charges are being considered. The Crown Prosecution Service informs us that matters in respect of two of the 10 officers are the subject of further investigation. Once this investigation has been completed a file will be submitted for the Crown Prosecution Service&#039;s further consideration.

 The White Paper The Future of Air Transport, published in December, recognised the benefits to the local economy resulting from the expansion of Liverpool Airport and supported its further growth to accommodate increased demand.

 I welcome the simplification and rationalisation of existing rules relating to professional recognition, in particular new flexibilities proposed for temporary, cross-frontier provision of services.

As you will be aware, my letters of December 2003 and February 2004 to all firms of solicitors handling these claims asked that those who had unfairly taken a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proportion of miners&#039; compensation to repay the money. I wrote to the Law Society asking them to take action to ensure that their members voluntarily refund any fees taken, rather than wait for miners to contact them. I also passed the names of all firms who did not reply, to the Law Society asking them to take urgent action to ensure that the firms comply with my request.

After looking into the issue, the Law Society has concluded that such double charging is unlikely to be justified, and is &#039;likely to give rise to a finding of inadequate professional service&#039;.

<p><a name="40422w09.html_spnew4"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 Global steel prices have risen sharply in recent months as a result of rising input costs and market demand. This is causing difficulties for certain steel using industries where they have limited scope for passing on the increased cost to customers. There have been reports of tightness in the steel supply market, with imports to the EU reduced, but I understand that all types of steel remain available, although prices are high. There is no shortage of supply from UK steel producers.

 The Energy White Paper published in February 2003 set out the Government&#039;s energy policy to tackle the crucial environmental challenge of climate change.

Renewable energy will make an important contribution to the Government&#039;s wider climate change programme. It is estimated that increased renewable energy generation, to meet the 2010 target, will deliver additional carbon savings of some 2.5&nbsp;million tonnes of carbon per year by 2010, and that doubling this by 2020 would achieve further cuts of some 3 to 5&nbsp;million tonnes of carbon per year above that by 2020. Wind power is expected to make the largest contribution of between 7 and 8&nbsp;per cent. towards the 2010 renewable electricity generation target and the positive environmental impact that will make.

With the introduction of the National Day Care Standards and the transfer of responsibilities for registration and inspection to Ofsted, childcare places are classified according to whether they are full day care, sessional day care, childminder, out of school day care or cr&#232;che day care places. Previously, childcare places were classified according to whether they were provided by day nurseries, playgroups and pre-schools, childminders, out of school clubs or holiday schemes. Figures for 2003 are not directly comparable with figures for earlier years because they are collected on a different basis. Some playgroups and pre-schools provide full day care and some former playgroups and pre-schools have converted to day nurseries.

Statistics on the number of childcare places registered in England were published on 19&nbsp;February 2004 in a report by Ofsted &quot;Registered Childcare Providers and Places in England, 31&nbsp;December 2003&#039;. The report is available on the Ofsted website www.ofsted.gov.uk/publications.

: My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills and I are in regular contact with the National Assembly on these issues. Data from the Higher Education Statistics Agency shows that the percentage of Welsh-domiciled full-time undergraduate students studying in Wales rose from 57&nbsp;per cent. in 1997&#150;8 to 62&nbsp;per cent. in 2002&#150;03: the proportion of English-domiciled full-time undergraduates studying in Wales has remained at 3&nbsp;per cent. over the same period.

raising and deferring a fee of up to &#163;3,000 suggests the impact of higher fees on these trends is unlikely to be significant. If the Higher Education Bill currently before Parliament proceeds to Royal Assent, future decisions on tuition fees will be for the National Assembly. The Assembly has already committed to providing Welsh students who study in England with a package of financial support that is similar to that available to English students, including fee deferral and a grant worth up to &#163;2,700 for low income students.

 Following wide consultation with local authorities and others last year, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister announced changes to the distribution of management and maintenance allowances within HRA subsidy to take effect from April 2004. Full details of each authority&#039;s allocation and the new methodology were published on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s website on 18&nbsp;December 2003, as part of the General Determination of Housing Revenue Account Subsidy for 2004&#150;05. We are considering some minor, technical improvements to the new formulae for 2005&#150;06 and will of course consult before introducing any further change.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40422w15.html_para1">
The changes are purely about distribution and have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not made any difference to the total resources available for management and maintenance allowances. Transitional arrangements mean that all authorities will receive at least inflationary increases in their allowances in both 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06, with most receiving more.

 It is too early to take any view about the implications of the Barker report for any particular area. Kate Barker&#039;s report sets out a challenging agenda for change which will help to carry forward the objectives of our Communities Plan. The Government agrees that, in order to deliver long term stability in housing markets where demand is highest, a substantial increase in housing supply is needed.

<a name="40422w17.html_para1">
This needs to be delivered as part of a package which includes planning reform, a more responsive house building industry and more investment in affordable housing and infrastructure.

The Barker report looked at the national picture. Any plans to implement its recommendations will also have to take account of the widely differing housing market conditions across the country and our consideration will include the regional and sub-regional dimension.

 Government policy on the proportion of affordable housing to be provided in new developments is set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 3: &quot;Housing&quot; (2000). This states that local planning authorities should identify suitable areas and sites on which affordable housing is to be provided and the amount of provision which will be sought. Additional infrastructure required by new developments varies from site to site and is a matter for agreement between the parties. Former Ministry of Defence sites are treated in the same way by the planning system as any other development site.

Many pre-applications are made by developers purely speculatively, and there is no data currently available to show how many pre-applications to which the Department does not state an objection are actually followed through. Where the Department does raise an objection MOD officials are always willing to work with the developer in order to determine whether a mutually acceptable solution can be found to enable a development to go ahead.

From 1996, the employment provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act required most employers of 20 or more staff not to discriminate against, and to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make reasonable adjustments for, disabled job applicants or employees; in December 1998, we reduced this threshold to 15 employees.

This list is based on the best possible match between information from our systems to monitor DWP Modernisation projects and separate systems to monitor all use of consultancy across DWP.

Notes:<br>

1.&nbsp;Figures are shown in thousands and rounded to the nearest hundred.<br>

2.&nbsp;These figures have been updated to include late notified commencements. All figures back to 1995 have been revised, and may be subject to further change; figures prior to 2002 are subject to minor changes; figures for 2002 include fewer late notifications than previous quarters and will be subject to greater change in future; figures for the latest quarter do not include any late notifications and are subject to major changes in future quarters. For illustration purposes, total commencements for November 2002 increased by 15&nbsp;per cent. in the year following their initial release.<br>

<p><a name="40422w22.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Goodman: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions whether the expansion of the specialist personal adviser service to support longer-term incapacity benefit recipients announced in the Budget will be available <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;for the Jobcentre Plus pathways to work pilots and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;to all New Deal for Disabled People programmes.  [167241]</p>








<p><a name="40422w22.html_spnew3"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 In his recent Budget statement, my right&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hon. Friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced new measures to be piloted in the seven Jobcentre Plus Pathways to Work areas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40422w22.html_para0">
We will provide three additional mandatory work-focused interviews (WFIs) for those incapacity benefits claimants who started a claim in the two years before the pilots started, excluding the most severely incapacitated cases. These interviews will be designed to identify those who retain an interest in getting back to work and to provide effective support to enable them to do that. In addition, we will offer a new job preparation premium of &#163;20 per week, payable for a maximum of 26 weeks to encourage participation in relevant activity that supports a return to work. These measures will be brought in from early next year and will be fully evaluated.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40422w22.html_para1">
Existing IB recipients attending WFIs will be offered access to New Deal for Disabled People as part of the range of provision currently available in Pathways to Work areas.

<p><a name="40422w23.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Webb: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will list the categories of pension credit recipient who are entitled to a level of guarantee credit in excess of the standard level.  [167319]</p>








<p><a name="40422w23.html_spnew0"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 The guarantee credit provides, or contributes towards, a guaranteed minimum level of income of &#163;105.45 a week for single people aged 60 and over (&#163;160.95 for couples). These standard amounts may be more for people who have caring responsibilities, are severely disabled or have certain housing costs.
</p>


<p>

For some people who were getting transitional protection in their income support or jobseeker&#039;s allowance before they started to get pension credit a transitional extra amount may be included.
