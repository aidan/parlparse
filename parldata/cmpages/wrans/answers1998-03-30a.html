To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will now extend legal aid to cover the cost of legal representation at appeal hearings for destitute asylum appellants ineligible for benefits on appeal against refusal of refugee status. [35906]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80330w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Our proposed reforms of the legal aid scheme are designed to get legal aid expenditure under effective control and to ensure that it is directed to areas of greatest need. As part of the reform package, we will consider whether extending legal aid to cover representation at hearings before the immigration adjudicators and the Immigration Appeals Tribunal is the best way of meeting that need.

<P>
<a name="80330w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State explained to the Lockerbie relatives the high priority which this Government attach to ending their ordeal by seeing justice done. She was grateful for the opportunity to hear their views. No new specific undertakings were given, but Baroness Symons has briefed the Foreign Secretary on the views of the relatives; he looks forward to addressing their concerns at a meeting on 8 April. The Prime Minister will be glad to meet them after the Foreign Secretary has reported to him.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80330w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="80330w01.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Results from a study of motorists in a report entitled "Responses to Congestion" have been used as the basis for Guidance on Induced and Suppressed Traffic, published in February 1997, in the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges. A brief description of that study is given in Volume 12.2.2 Annexe C of the Manual. That advice recommends using predicted changes to travel times by car and public transport as standard inputs to well established mode choice models, where complex changes to behaviour are expected.

 The minimum spacing between motorway service areas (MSAs) was reduced from 30 miles to 15 in 1993. Since then, exactly 100 MSA planning applications have been referred to the Highways Agency by local planning authorities. 52 of them were subsequently the subject of public inquiries and, of those, 8 were granted planning permission and 44 refused.

 Not yet. My previous reply was based on calculations derived from LAMOD, the Department's model for estimating the public expenditure effects of a change in guideline rent policy for local authorities. The model uses a Housing Benefit Ready Reckoner, which will be updated in due course to reflect the Chancellor of the Exchequer's proposals for tax and benefit changes. We would not expect these changes to have a significant effect on the figures in my previous reply.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what assessment he has made of the environmental health impacts of infiltration into public and private sewers; and if he will make a statement;  [36203]
<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment he has made of the environmental health impacts of the leakage of sewage into the ground from public and private sewers; and if he will make a statement.  [36204]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80330w02.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 I understand that experience within the water industry shows that the level of infiltration into sewers normally represents a very small proportion of the total flow a sewer can carry. Infiltration into sewers therefore has an insignificant bearing on such issues as sewage treatment, the operation of combined sewer overflows and flooding from sewers.
<P>

<a name="80330w02.html_para0">My Department held a meeting with the Sewer Renovation Federation at the end of last year to discuss a number of issues, including claims that leakage from sewers might be causing problems. The conclusion of that meeting was that there was no evidence that leakage is causing significant health or pollution problems at present.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80330w02.html_wqn4"><B> Ms Walley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what estimate he has made of the number of premises incorrectly connecting surface water drainage to foul only sewers; who has responsibility for securing remedial action by property owners in such circumstances; and if he will make a statement;  [36205]
<P>
<UL>(2) what proportion of the public sewers in England and Wales are <i>(a)</i> combined foul and surface water, <i>(b)</i> foul water only and <i>(c)</i> surface water only; and if he will make a statement.  [36202]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80330w02.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Information is not held centrally on the numbers of foul and surface water sewers or the numbers of illegal connections involving such drainage systems. I understand that sewerage undertakers normally require separate foul and surface water drainage systems where new sewers are to be adopted on completion. Sewerage undertakers are responsible for taking action under provisions in the Water Industry Act 1991 against illegal connections.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 19 December 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>349-50</i>, if his Department classified those dwellings with water supplies with a lead concentration exceeding 50 g/litre, on the basis of information up to 



<P>
<P><I>30 Mar 1998 : Column: 360</I><P>
1995, as being unfit for human habitation; what assessment he has made of the public health implications of such lead concentrations; and if he will make a statement.  [36199]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80330w02.html_spnew5"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The current housing fitness standard requires a dwelling to have an adequate piped supply of wholesome water but does not specify concentrations of contaminants that may render a dwelling unfit for human habitation.
<P>

<a name="80330w02.html_para1">At sustained concentrations exceeding 50 g/l, drinking water is likely to be the major source of lead intake. But is unlikely to contribute significantly to those exceptionally high levels of intake of lead which result in clinical lead poisoning. I understand that the lower levels of exposure which are experienced are associated, in epidemiological studies, with small subclinical changes, including decrements in neuropsychological development in children and increased blood pressure in adults.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80330w02.html_wqn6"><B> Ms Walley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 19 December 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>349-50</i>, how and where he proposes to test drinking water for compliance with the proposed EC Drinking Water Directive; when he expects this Directive will come into effect; if standards will apply when water enters a property; what will be the impact of the directive on his Department's assessment of the future fitness of dwellings; and if he will make a statement. [36201]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80330w02.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The proposal for a revised Drinking Water Directive is at the stage of the Council having agreed a Common Position, and is being considered by the European Parliament. After their Second Reading, it will come back to Council for consideration of any amendments. We hope that the Directive will be adopted this autumn. Under the present draft, Member States will have 5 years from adoption to meet the interim standard for lead of 25 g/l and 15 years from adoption to meet the standard of 10 g/l.
<P>

<a name="80330w02.html_para2">The present draft of the Directive requires sampling at the tap, but provides that Member States will generally have fulfilled their obligations if it can be established that non-compliance with a parametric value is due to the domestic distribution system. This is defined as the part of the supply system that is not the responsibility of the water supplier. The draft Directive requires treatment measures to reduce the risk of non-compliance due to the domestic distribution system, and that the property owner is advised of possible remedial action that they could take.
<P>

<a name="80330w02.html_para3">It is too early to judge the impact of the Directive on the assessment of the future fitness of dwellings. We are currently reviewing the housing fitness standard. A consultation paper issued on 10 February 1998 invited comments on a number of proposals and options for change. A copy of the paper has been placed in the Library.

 The Institute of Hydrology and the British Geological Survey publish jointly a monthly <i>Hydrological summary for Great Britain</i>. This contains full information on reservoir stocks and on groundwater levels at representative sites during the last 12 months. That for February 1998 states that reservoir stocks remain healthy, while groundwater levels are within the normal range throughout most of the country but remain very depressed in parts of the English lowlands.
<P>

<a name="80330w03.html_para0">The Environment Agency keeps my Department informed on a weekly basis of the water resources position in England and Wales. We expect water companies to maintain supplies at all times and we do not currently envisage them having any general difficulty in doing that, although exceptionally low groundwater levels in some areas will require careful resource management. At the beginning of February, we commissioned the Environment Agency to prepare a more detailed report on prospects for water supplies this year, to be based on the resources position at 31 March. We expect to receive that report towards the end of April.

Domestically our aim is to reduce emissions of CO <sub>2</sub>  by 20% below 1990 levels by 2010, as set out in our Manifesto. We intend to issue a consultation paper in the summer, focusing largely on how we can ensure we meet our legally binding target, but also considering how we can move beyond that towards our 20% aim.

<a name="80330w03.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Provision for the carriage of bicycles is an important issue which ministers have raised on a number of occasions with the train operating companies. Under their franchise agreements, train operators are required, so far as reasonably practicable and subject to the availability of appropriate space on their rolling stock, to ensure that facilities for the carriage of bicycles are made available, at reasonable charges (if any) to passengers wishing to use their services. The Objectives Instructions and Guidance (OIG), issued on behalf of the Secretary of State to the Franchising Director on 6 November 1997, require him to discuss with train operators who plan to order new rolling stock the provision of suitable space for accompanying bicycles on trains, and to encourage operators to provide suitable facilities for cyclists at the stations they manage.

<P>
<P><I>30 Mar 1998 : Column: 366</I><P>
a statement about the financial management and policy review of the Health and Safety Commission and Executive.  [36885]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80330w03.html_spnew10"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 As part of the Government's programme of regular five-yearly financial management and policy reviews of non-departmental public bodies, my Department has conducted a thorough review of the Health and Safety Commission and Executive. The resulting report is published today, and a copy has been placed in the Library of each House. In accordance with the guidance on such reviews, we have assessed the extent to which the Commission and Executive's functions are necessary for the achievement of the Government's policies, and whether there is scope for privatising, contracting out or transferring all or part of its functions to another body.
<P>

<a name="80330w03.html_para3">In carrying out the study, my Department has consulted widely with relevant organisations with an interest in the Commission and Executive's work, and held a public consultation. We are grateful for their contribution. The Review found that Government needs to take responsibility for setting health and safety standards and enforcing compliance with these standards. The public consultation endorsed the importance of the work of the Commission and Executive and the professionalism with which they carry it out. We considered HSC/E's approach to contracting out, looking in particular at their inspection and permissioning regimes, and concluded that it was not appropriate to ask them to change their current policy.
<P>

<a name="80330w03.html_para4">The Review found scope for further work in spreading best practice in consistency of enforcement by local authorities, and for considering extension of the range of work for which the Executive charges to the assessment of safety cases and the costs of inspection of those sites and installations which submit safety cases. It also made a number of minor recommendations. Work on these is being taken forward.
<P>

<a name="80330w03.html_para5">This Government attach great importance to maintaining and improving health and safety standards at the workplace. We fully support the vital work carried out by the Health and Safety Commission and Executive in setting and enforcing those standards and in underpinning employer's responsibilities to prevent accidents and ill-health at work. Because good standards of health and safety at the workplace are a higher priority for this Government, we have approved an extra &#163;4.5 million for HSE's work in 1998/99. Funding for HSC/E's work in the longer term is being considered within the Comprehensive Spending Review for all the Department's activities. The creation of DETR has brought together a range of responsibilities for safety, particularly in the transport field, which will provide new opportunities to consider how best practice should be shared between the different modes. We are determined not to become complacent about health and safety, and will continue to work with the Commission to ensure that we are prepared for the health and safety challenges which will face us into the new millennium.

 <i>[holding answer 25 and 26 March 1998]:</i> The responsibilities of the Director General of the National Lottery are the same in all parts of the United Kingdom. He must exercise his functions in the manner he considers is most likely to secure that the National Lottery is run, and every lottery that forms part of it is promoted, with all due propriety, and that the interests of every participant in a Lottery that forms part of the National Lottery are protected; and, subject to the foregoing he must seek to secure that the amount the National Lottery raises for good causes is as great as possible. He must also comply with any directions he is issued by the Secretary of State under section 11 of the National Lottery etc Act 1993;
<P>

<a name="80330w04.html_para0">The head office of the Office of the National Lottery (OFLOT) is located in central London. A further officer is located in Watford. OFLOT's total running costs (excluding salaries) for the current financial year are

 In common with all other Government Departments, the Department for Culture Media and Sport has been undertaking a comprehensive spending review. This has looked at objectives, policies and spending priorities across all the Department's responsibilities.
<P>

<a name="80330w04.html_para1">The Department has also conducted a number of individual reviews alongside the spending review. These were:

<P>
<P>
<a name="80330w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 I have received no representations from Mr. Murdoch or News International on this subject.

<a name="80330w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 I appointed the members of the Advisory Group on Listed Events.

The members of the group, however, come from a variety of different backgrounds and from many different regions of the United Kingdom.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80330w04.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Jim Murphy: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, pursuant to his answer of 26 February 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>322,</i> how much was spent on administration of each of the sports organisations listed in the last year for which figures are available; and if he will separately identify the costs relating to the governing bodies.  [33541]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80330w04.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 This information is not collected centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. The United Kingdom Sports Council has advised me that to obtain this information it would need specifically to examine the annual accounts of each of the 414 governing bodies, and to assess against an agreed definition of administration the total amount expended by each body on administration.
<P>

<a name="80330w04.html_para2">Funding by the Sports Councils is for carefully targeted programmes, with agreed objectives. It may be used to contribute towards the administrative costs associated with these programmes but governing bodies are not required to identify separately the administrative costs in their grant agreements. Support is sometimes given for the appointment of key personnel at Chief Executive, Director of Finance, Coaching or Development level, and the administrative support staff for these officers, to ensure that a sport is well managed, particularly where it is in receipt of complementary funding from the National Lottery.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80330w04.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 None. The management and development of the core public library service is the responsibility of local authorities. The Government have announced that the New Opportunities Fund, as part of its educational remit, will provide &#163;50 million of Lottery money to support the digitisation of lifelong learning and educational material which is held to a great extent in public libraries. This will support the development of new IT-based services, additional to the existing core library services.

 A &#163;25 million support programme is being targeted at the rehabilitation priorities of the Government of Rwanda.
<P>

<a name="80330w05.html_para0">Technical support is helping the Ministry of Finance to address the key objective of increasing revenue; support for the Ministry of Gender and Social Affairs is helping to tackle problems faced by the large number of female-headed households and support for the Ministry of Education is helping to strengthen their planning and resource allocation capacity. We are providing financial support for the Government's efforts to establish an unarmed community police force and to demobilise members of the armed forces. We are the largest bilateral donor in the area of human rights monitoring and protection in Rwanda.
<P>

<a name="80330w05.html_para1">In addition to our rehabilitation support, we continue to respond to requests for humanitarian assistance and are providing financial support to NGO's involved in food security for vulnerable groups.

<P>
<a name="80330w05.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 My Department has no projects dealing directly with primary or adult basic education in Bosnia. As a single donor it is not possible for us to tackle every sector. Our contributions in selected sectors have been very large, and other donors have focused on other sectors such as education. That said, we have made substantial contributions to education through our community micro-projects. This has included repair and refurbishment of many primary and secondary schools and provision of materials and school equipment over a wide area of Western Bosnia, in both entities.

<P>

<a name="80330w05.html_para3">Following consultation with the authorities in Bosnia, the focus of our activities for the forthcoming year will be refugee return and reconciliation, health system reform, media training, development of the small and medium sized enterprise sector, regional development, management training, and institutional development. We shall also conclude activities in inter-entity electricity transmission reconstruction. In addition we expect to provide advice and support to the Government of Republika Srpska and we are considering how we might help further with demining.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The above figures relate only to projects handled by Locate in Scotland (LIS) and The Scottish Office. The figures are based on information provided by the companies themselves at the time of the investment decision and take no account of subsequent developments. A few projects may not have proceeded and others may have been reduced in scale as a result of changes in the commercial environment. Equally, however, some projects may have led to more investment and more jobs than originally anticipated; and the figures take no account of the substantial number of new jobs created indirectly in supplier companies. Experience over a number of years indicates that, on average, around two-thirds of planned direct jobs are created.<P>

2. Figures for years prior to 1991-92 relate to projects with a Glasgow postcode and may therefore include a few projects outwith the City of Glasgow Council area.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="80330w08.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Universal provision of education in the pre-school year is a key part of our drive to raise standards in education, to tackle social exclusion from the earliest age, and to provide integrated early years services to support working parents. It is also a crucial component of the Government's national childcare strategy.
<P>

<a name="80330w08.html_para4">Having considered the responses to the consultation paper on pre-school education which I issued last November, I now announce the detailed arrangements under which local authorities will lead the further expansion of pre-school education in the 1998-99 school session. Letters have been issued today to all local authorities and provider representative organisations explaining these arrangements in detail. The key points are as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>&#163;46.6 million will be distributed as grant under the Education (Scotland) Act 1996 among local authorities for the first two terms of the 1998-99 school session, on the basis of the participation of eligible children in provision.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The latest GRO estimate of pre-school year children in 1998-99 stands at 61,371; and funding will be geared to cover this number of children. Estimated population figures for each authority, together with indicative grant figures, are today being issued to all authorities.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Local authorities will be funded at an enhanced rate of grant of &#163;1,140 over the school year 1998-99 for every eligible child occupying a part-time education place of at least 412&#189; hours over the year, whether in their own centres or in a centre with which they are in partnership.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Local authorities and their prospective partners will be free to negotiate the price at which places will be purchased under partnership arrangements. The principles of 'best value', taking full account of quality as well as price, should obtain. As a guideline, and taking account of the need to ensure adequate remuneration for staff in partner centres, I suggest that a quality partnership place is unlikely to be obtained for less than &#163;850 over the year, after allowing for the recharging of any quality support services. I intend to review in the autumn authorities' progress with partnerships.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am introducing simplified eligibility rules for pre-school grant for ease of local authority administration. Greater latitude will be given to local authorities in the configuration of education hours, so that they may respond more fully to the needs of children and their parents.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I expect all authorities, and their partners, to strive to achieve fully loaded places of at least 412&#189; hours education by the end of the 1998-99 school session. Where places offer less education, grant will be proportionately reduced.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In some rural areas the cost of provision can be prohibitively high. I am keen to ensure that children from rural areas should have access to the same opportunities as other children and I am therefore making an additional, one-year grant of &#163;4 million available to 24 authorities with gaps in provision in rural areas to assist them to complete provision in their area. These resources will be used to create new provision, taking account of the needs and preferences of children and their parents and ensuring so far as possible that existing provision in registered voluntary and private centres is not displaced or replicated.</FONT></UL>

 <i>[holding answer 5 March 1998]:</i> Action 2000 aims to ensure that all businesses realise the need to take action on millennium compliance in time. Enterprises working towards millennium compliance will, of course, need to take account of other information technology developments, including any relating to the launch of the single currency. The nature and extent of other work will vary very significantly between businesses and will depend on decisions taken by those businesses.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade what assessment she has made of <i>(a)</i> the impact of electronic home shopping on agency and direct sales, <i>(b)</i> the need for protection against unfair sales pressures in the homes of consumers in respect of home shopping and <i>(c)</i> future price movements in the home shopping market.  [36317]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80330w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 Consumers must be protected against unfair sales pressure, particularly in their homes. I consider that existing provisions could be improved, and plan to publish a consultation paper setting out proposals to strengthen the consumer protection provided by the Consumer Protection (Cancellation of Contracts Concluded away from Business Premises) Regulations 1987. I shall also be consulting on the implementation of two EU Directives which provide protection for consumers using mail order, telephone sales, electronic commerce and other methods of distance selling. These are the Distance Selling Directive, which covers all organised methods of selling where the consumer and trader do not meet, up to and including the conclusion of the contract and has to be implemented by June 2000, and the Telecoms Protection Directive which protects consumers against unsolicited telephone calls and faxes and will be implemented this October.
<P>

<a name="80330w09.html_para0">While my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade has not carried out any studies of future price movements in the home shopping market, the development of electronic commerce seems likely to be an important competitive element in retailing in the future.

Both Acts apply to the newspaper industry.

The Prison Service drug strategy review which incorporates research into MDT should provide a clearer picture on how these encouraging trends might be maintained.

 For 1997/98, Essex Police received &#163;1.1 million in what was described by the previous Government as funding for extra officers. In fact, Ministers have no direct control over police numbers. Legislation passed by the previous Government in 1994 left it to individual chief constables to determine the number of officers in their force.

 Provisional figures indicate there were 2,559 young people aged under 18 in prison custody on 31 January 1998. Two thousand, four hundred and fifty-three of these were young men, of whom all but 277 were held in prison establishments for young offenders, not in adult prisons. Of the 277 young men held in adult prisons, all but two were held in accommodation separate from adult prisoners. The Government are currently reviewing the secure estate for juveniles as part of their Comprehensive Spending Review.
<P>

<a name="80330w11.html_para0">There are no young offender institutions for young women which are entirely separate from adult prisons.

 The Crime and Disorder Bill contains proposals which will both increase the range of community sentences available to the courts and create a new framework for the effective supervision of community sentences for juvenile offenders. Confidence in community sentences will be further helped by implementing recommendations from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Probation about supervision programmes which are effective in reducing repeat offending and via the existing Community Sentence Demonstration Projects.

 Information on complaints to the police of low-flying aircraft is not held centrally. I understand that on the evening of 24 March 1997, South Yorkshire Police received reports of a low-flying aircraft which was thought to have crashed. An investigation by the police and other authorities failed to find any trace of the aircraft.

 The Government have no plans to extend the use of polygraph machines in criminal cases. The admissibility of evidence in criminal proceedings is a matter for the courts.

 The information in the Drug Prices Guide was collated from material supplied by dedicated points in 16 police forces in England, Wales and Scotland and by Her Majesty's Customs and Excise. The guide is intended to provide information that can be used by law enforcement officers who need to give expert witness in court on drug prices. It also provides general intelligence on price trends. As various factors are likely to affect prices locally, it should be seen only as a rough guide.

 Most of the extradition arrangements define "an extradition crime" by the length of the sentence served, and white-collar crime needs no special provision. The most obvious exception is the 1976 United Kingdom/United States Treaty, which still relies on a list of extradition crimes. Amendments are necessary to the 1989 Extradition Act and longer-term, to the Treaty itself.

Immigrants from high prevalence areas for TB and asylum seekers are recognised as high risk groups for TB. We have a two pronged approach to prevention and control of TB in new immigrants to this country. The first is to screen those at highest risk at ports of entry, and the second is to offer more detailed screening, including skin testing, locally when they arrive at their destination. This second part of the procedure allows detection not only of active cases but also those who would benefit from the preventive measures such as chemoprophylaxis and those with negative skin tests to be protected by immunisation with Bacillus Calmette Guerin. The Department and the Home Office are presently reviewing these procedures and looking at ways of improving screening for tuberculosis.<P>

 The Nomenclature of Units of Territorial Statistics (NUTS) was established by the statistical office of the European Commission (Eurostat) to provide a breakdown of territorial units for the production of regional statistics for the European Union. The criteria used in subdividing national territory into regions are set out in the Eurostat publication <i>Regions, Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics</i>, a copy of which is in the Library.

<a name="80330w14.html_para0">A revision of the UK NUTS classification started at the end of 1995 to take account of the use of Government Office Regions for the presentation of statistical information and of the Local Government Review which resulted in the creation of unitary authorities. In June 1996 the Office for National Statistics issued a consultation document which included more information on the criteria and other aspects of the revision. A copy of this document

 There is no Directive on Autistic Children. The European Written Declaration on the Rights of People with Autism was adopted by the European Parliament on 9 May 1996. This called on member states, through appropriate legislation, to enhance the right to accessible and appropriate education. Under the Education Act 1996 schools and local education authorities are under a duty to identify children with special educational needs, including those with autism, and to provide an appropriate education for the individual child which gives him or her access to a broad and balanced curriculum.

The Department has consequently funded an urgent review of the research findings on educational programmes for children with autism, preparatory to research the Local Government Association will be commissioning on the comparative outcomes from these programmes. In the light of this work, we will consider what further guidance to offer on how best to meet the needs of children with a broad range of autistic disorders.

A continued improvement is expected for the future. The section shows that almost two thirds of UK herds with adult breeding cattle have never had a case of BSE. Furthermore 84 per cent. of beef suckler herds have never had a case of BSE.

<a name="80330w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 When the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP) met on 19 March it considered that further information was required before it could complete its assessment of oil obtained from genetically modified (GM) herbicide tolerant cottonseed. The Committee was however satisfied as to the safety of peeled and comminuted GM tomato products and will be finalising its report to the EC Commission on these shortly. This will be published and a copy made available in the Library of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80330w16.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Reid </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 March 1998]:</i> The Ministry of Defence Police is a civilian police force constituted under statute by the Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987. The Chief Constable is independent of Ministerial, Departmental and political influence in the exercise of his constabulary powers. In specific cases questions about procedural applications in the exercise of the constabulary responsibilities of the Ministry of Defence Police are a matter for the Chief Constable.
<P>

<a name="80330w16.html_para7">In England and Wales, police procedures in respect of property taken from others in the course of an investigation are controlled by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Paragraph 6.8 of Code B of the Codes of Practice requires police, on request, to provide a list or description of the property within a reasonable time to the person who had control of it. Ministry of Defence Police use a 'best practice' policy and normally provide a list of property, so taken, at the time of seizure.
<P>

<a name="80330w16.html_para8">The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 does not apply within the Scottish legal system. There are no provisions or requirements within the Scottish legal system to provide a receipt to the owners of property taken into police possession. When operating in Scotland, Ministry of Defence Police are required to use the documentary systems and procedures adopted by all Scottish Police Forces. It would not, therefore, be appropriate for the Ministry of Defence Police to use the supporting forms which are used by them in England and Wales.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Future Infantry System Technology (FIST) programme was established in Autumn 1994. DERA is highly focused to meeting the needs of its customer on what is a most demanding systems project. There are three main thrusts to the programme: research on technologies likely to benefit the individual soldier, development of the systems engineering approach to soldier modernisation, and operational analysis studies and trials to establish the operational requirement.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The initial aim of the FIST programme was to demonstrate the potential of technology to enhance soldier effectiveness. Experimental hardware was designed and developed by a small team within the Guns Department at DERA Fort Halstead, with extramural support from Pilkington Optronics, to determine the feasibility of possible sub-systems. Test and trials of this early equipment, many highly successful, were undertaken during 1995 and in the summer and autumn of 1996.</FONT></UL>




<P>
<P><I>30 Mar 1998 : Column: 413</I><P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A Technical Demonstrator (TD) programme, in place since April 1997, has built on the success of earlier hardware trials. This is a jointly funded programme between MOD and a UK consortium led by Pilkington Optronics. Separate from the TD, a systems engineering approach, identified as necessary by DERA/MOD to underpin cost effective procurement, has been adopted for the FIST research programme. A research strategy has been developed, linking study methodologies to trials and other analysis.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The current FIST research programme covers operational modelling and field trials. The trials provide data for validation of the models being used to examine the operational need and identify capability deficiencies. Operational analysis supports the formulation of the Staff Target and will lead to cost effectiveness analysis to support the decisions of the Equipment Approval Committee. The FIST programme also includes work on human factors, which are particularly important in relation to the individual soldier's effectiveness on the battlefield.</FONT></UL>

 A number of military aircraft were booked to carry out low flying training in northern England on the evening of 24 March 1997. The Ministry of Defence received 13 complaints about aircraft activity for that date from locations across the UK. No reported sightings of "UFOs" on 24 or 25 March 1997 were received by my Department. A Temporary Danger Area was established on 25 March, centred on Howden Reservoir, to allow an RAF Search and Rescue helicopter,

(22) Evaluation is taken to mean the periodic review of the Agency, which involves a performance evaluation, the re-visiting of the Prior Options process, and the re-issue of the Framework Document. Initial Policy was this should take place at not more than 3 year intervals, but this was later extended to 5 years, with some specified exceptions. As the process takes a period of some months, only the year in which the review is expected to take place is given. Where the first review is described as "ongoing" the second review would normally be expected to take place 5 years after the re-issue of the Framework Document.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if those lone parents currently claiming the lone parent rates of <i>(a)</i> family premium, <i>(b)</i> child benefit, <i>(c)</i> housing benefit and <i>(d)</i> council tax benefit will be paid the increases in these benefits announced in the Budget.

<a name="80330w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Field: </B> 
 Lone parents who are currently receiving the higher lone parent rates of family premium in Income Support, Jobseeker's Allowance, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, and the higher rate of Child Benefit, will continue to receive the higher rates. Those current lone parents with children under 11 who are receiving any of the income-related benefits will also receive the &#163;2.50 increase in the under 11 child allowance rate.




<P>
<P><I>30 Mar 1998 : Column: 421</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80330w19.html_para0">The increases in the family premium and Child Benefit announced in the Budget will be paid to lone parents who are not already receiving the higher lone parent rates, and to all couples with children. The Government believe it is right to increase support for all families with children, and the measures we announced in the Budget will help tackle child poverty. The increase in the under 11 child allowance will protect vulnerable families with young children. These families can face particular difficulties as the need to balance the dual responsibilities of parenting and working can restrict their opportunities to maximise income from work.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80330w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Field: </B> 
 The full, independent evaluation of the New Deal for Lone Parents, which will report in autumn 1999, will contain information on the average earnings of lone parents who have participated in the programme and found jobs.
<P>

<a name="80330w19.html_para1">In the meantime, administrative data do not enable the calculation of robust average salaries or weekly earnings.

 The proposed changes to employer's National Insurance contribution from April 1999 are revenue neutral for employers as a whole.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80330w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We are modernising National Insurance contributions to encourage employers to take on staff and to make work pay for employees. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a series of changes to promote these aims in the Budget on 17 March. Changes to the National Insurance scheme provide an opportunity to update the contributory principle. We will examine the link between paying contributions and earning entitlement to benefits with a view both to simplifying further the administration of the scheme for employers, and emphasising the link between work and earning benefit entitlement.

 It is right to ensure that people who are in receipt of benefit are entitled to it and that they remain so. The Benefit Integrity Project is designed to help ensure that payments of Disability Living Allowance (DLA) are correct.
<P>

<a name="80330w20.html_para0">Since taking office last year, we have made a number of improvements to the way in which the Project operates. Most recently, on 9 February, we introduced an extra safeguard to help ensure that we get decisions right and restore confidence.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80330w20.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Field: </B> 
 The Department has commissioned &#163;367,254 worth of focus group research since 1 May 1997 (including VAT) although not all this work is yet completed. Further such research will be conducted in future, but costs are not available until contracts are let.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80330w20.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Field: </B> 
 Under the previous administration's market testing programme 1992-95, the Department awarded two contracts to Group 4 for accommodation and office services, including security services. In both instances, the terms and conditions of the TUPE regulations applied.
<P>

<a name="80330w20.html_para5">From 1 April 1998, Group 4 will provide all security services to the Department under the PRIME contract. The PRIME contract, which will transfer the ownership and management of the Department's Estate, was awarded to PPM (Partnership Property Management), following a tender exercise in which they were fully evaluated in line with this Government's new strengthened criteria and concern for staff issues. In appointing Group 4 as their sub-contractor to deliver security services, PPM worked in close partnership with the Department to ensure our new criteria were fully met.
<P>

<a name="80330w20.html_para6">Staff transferring to Group 4 will not only have their employment rights fully protected by the TUPE regulations but, by virtue of arrangements made with PPM, will also be entitled to join a new pension arrangement which has been certified by the Government Actuary as being comparable with the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security (1) how many letters the Benefits Agency and the DSS have received from members of the public about the winter fuel payments scheme;  [36511]

<P>
<P>
<a name="80330w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Winter Fuel payments are one of a number of initiatives the Government have taken to help vulnerable people, especially the elderly, keep warm in the winter. A total of &#163;400 million has been committed for this winter and next, to help pensioners with fuel bills to pay. This is the first time any Government have provided additional help with heating costs to all pensioners receiving a retirement pension or one of a number of other qualifying benefits.
<P>

<a name="80330w21.html_para2">The making of this winter's payments has been an enormous and unprecedented exercise. In order to establish all eligible pensioners, correctly identify pensioner households, and determine the amount each should receive, it was necessary to correlate data in around 15 million computer records, involving 15 qualifying benefits, across nine computer systems. Overall, almost ten million payments will have been made to over seven million pensioner households by the end of March.
<P>

<a name="80330w21.html_para3">So far, within the Department's Headquarters, around 400 letters have been received direct from members of the public and a further 150 from hon. Members regarding the scheme.
<P>

<a name="80330w21.html_para4">The administration of winter fuel payments is a matter for Peter Mathison, Chief Executive of the Benefits Agency. He will write to the hon. Member.
<P>

<a name="80330w21.html_para5"><i>Letter from Peter Mathison to Mr. Simon Burns, dated 27 March 1998:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent parliamentary questions asking how many letters the Benefits Agency (BA) and the DSS have received from members of the public about the winter fuel payments; how many calls the Winter Fuel Payments Telephone Hotline has received to the latest available date; and if she will provide a breakdown of the nature of the calls received by the Winter Fuel Payments Hotline.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The making of almost 10 million winter fuel payments to over seven million pensioner households before the end of March 1998 has been a challenging task for the Benefits Agency. This will have been achieved whilst maintaining normal benefit business.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Around one and a half million of the poorest pensioners, those receiving Income Support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, received their payment of &#163;50 during January. Other eligible pensioners are entitled to a payment of &#163;20 or &#163;10. Where they live alone, are the only eligible pensioner in a household, or are of no fixed abode, they are entitled to &#163;20; otherwise, they are entitled to &#163;10.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The information requested relating to the number of letters received by the BA from members of the public about Winter Fuel Payments is not available at present. We are currently compiling statistics on the number of enquiries received about Winter Fuel Payments, in addition to the statistics collated by the Winter Fuel Helpline. As the payments exercise is still ongoing, it is anticipated that the information will be available some time after the end of April. I will provide the number of enquiries received once the information is available.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Between 5 January and 20 March 1998 the Winter Fuel Payment Helpline has received a total of 136,284 customer calls.

 Unfortunately, the causes of chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) are not understood, nor is there a generally agreed method of treatment. Treatment to relieve the various symptoms is, therefore, a matter for individual doctors to decide in consultation with their patients. The National Health Service provides a wide range of services to which sufferers from CFS/ME have access, and such patients are seen within a wide range of hospital specialties. Patients can discuss the options available to them with their general practitioner, and they may also request an assessment of their needs by local authority social services departments.
<P>

<a name="80330w21.html_para8">The training of doctors is a matter for the medical schools in collaboration with the General Medical Council's Education Committee, the relevant Medical Royal Colleges (MRC) and, in the case of general practice, the Joint Committee on Postgraduate Training for General Practice. All of these have a vested interest in ensuring that doctors are equipped to deal with the problems they will encounter in practice--both in hospital and in general practice. It is not however practicable or desirable for the Government to prescribe the exact training that any individual doctor will receive.

 The number of vouchers issued for wheelchair services from April 1997 to March 1998 is forecast to be 1,238, with 418 issued between April 1997 to December 1997. This information was not available before April 1997 because the voucher scheme has been phased in since 1996. No targets have been set for the uptake of vouchers over the four year period. Our objective is to extend choice to service users and uptake will therefore depend on how many wheelchair users choose the vouchers option.

<a name="80330w22.html_para1">Notifications of TB in England and Wales fell from 49,358 cases in 1950 to their lowest level of 5,085 in 1987. There was a small increase in cases in the early 1990s, but figures have now levelled out. This success is against a worldwide resurgence in TB which is having a small but important impact on trends in the United Kingdom. The UK has an excellent record of TB control and we are determined this should remain the case.

 Currently some vaccines against infectious disease are provided free for travellers as a matter of public health policy, others are not. Broadly speaking, those vaccines provided free offer protection against diseases which might be spread on return to the United Kingdom. Immunisation in these cases benefits not only the recipient but also the community at large, since each individual immunisation contributes to the general control of disease. We recognise that inconsistencies and ambiguities have arisen over the years in the arrangements for travel vaccines and the way they are interpreted and are seeking to resolve these anomalies as part of an

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what representations he has received from other member states of the European Union concerning the current system of budget rebates for the United Kingdom and the date when the current period of that arrangement expires.  [37212]<P>

<P>
<a name="80330w24.html_spnew10"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend has not received any formal representations on this subject from any other Member State, though we understand that a number of other countries have asked the Commission to propose a rebate system which would also apply to them.
<P>

<a name="80330w24.html_para6">The UK's abatement remains in force indefinitely. The unanimous agreement of Member States including the UK would be required to amend the legislation governing our abatement. As the Government have frequently made clear, the UK abatement remains fully justified. We cannot see circumstances in which it would not continue to be warranted in its present form.
