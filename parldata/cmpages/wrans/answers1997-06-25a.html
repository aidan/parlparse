<a name="70625w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Gunnell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to give local authorities a statutory obligation to co-ordinate local initiatives to prevent crime and develop plans to make them more effective. [4811]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70625w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 We intend to place a new responsibility on local authorities and the police service jointly to develop statutory local partnerships for crime prevention and community safety and to agree, with the key partners, local community safety targets. Our proposals will be developed on the basis of full consultation with all interested parties. This will be included in the forthcoming Crime and Disorder Bill.

<P>
<a name="70625w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Kidney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what instructions he has given to the Prison Service to ensure that wherever possible convicted prisoners should serve their sentences in prisons within reasonable travelling distance of close relatives. [4610]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70625w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Joyce Quin: </B> 
 Prison Rule 31 provides that special attention should be paid to the maintenance of such relationships between a prisoner and his family as are desirable in the best interests of both. Circular Instruction 7/1988, a copy of which is available in the Library, sets out the principles governing the allocation of convicted adult male prisoners. Similar instructions exist for women and males under 21 years of age. The needs of the individual prisoner, including the facilitating of visits, is one of four priorities governing allocation.
<P>

<a name="70625w01.html_para0">Wherever possible, prisoners are located close to their home and family. However, security is the primary consideration in a prisoner's allocation and account must also be taken of the need to maintain good order and control and, particularly because of the current population pressures, the need to make best use of the estate.

<a name="70625w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Sheerman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is his Department's estimate of the percentage of content providers on the Internet who publish material unsuitable for children but are currently taking part in voluntary self-certification. [4902]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70625w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Information is not available in the form requested. However, I understand from figures compiled in April by the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), the independent industry body set up last year, that some 7 per cent. (1,419) if sites which are rated with the Recreational Software Advisory Council (RSAC), the voluntary content ratings system developed by the RSAC

in the United States of America, are in the United Kingdom. There is no United Kingdom rating system available, although the IWF hope to report shortly on their recommendations for the development of a self-rating system suitable for the United Kingdom, to which major Internet Service Providers would subscribe.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70625w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what was the tariff recommended by <i>(a)</i> the trial judge, <i>(b)</i> the Lord Chief Justice and <i>(c)</i> the Home Secretary in the case of Patrick Nichols; what length of sentence he has already served; and what are the reasons for his continued detention. [3517]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70625w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Joyce Quin: </B> 
 The trial judge and the Lord Chief Justice both recommended 13 years, and that was the period set by the then Home Secretary.
<P>

<a name="70625w01.html_para1">Mr. Nichols has served 22 years in custody. For reasons which have been explained to him, the Parole Board has not considered it appropriate to recommend release. Without such a recommendation, my right hon. Friend has no power to release Mr. Nichols.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70625w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many years have elapsed since the maximum penalties in force on the statute book for <i>(a)</i> treason and <i>(b)</i> piracy were applied. [4647]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70625w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Michael </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 June 1997]:</i> The last execution for the offence of treason was 41 years ago in 1946. In 1945 there were three persons sentenced to death for treason. One of the sentences was commuted to penal servitude. William Joyce (Lord Haw Haw) was executed in 1946 for treason. The other offender, Thomas Cooper, who had joined the German army at the age of twenty (his mother was of German origin) was reprieved in 1946 and ended up with a life sentence, of which he served seven years.
<P>

<a name="70625w01.html_para2">Historical records indicate that the last two executions for the offence of piracy took place 167 years ago in 1830.

Where no application or appeal is pending, applicants may re-apply for entry clearance in the normal way.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70625w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 As the Deputy Prime Minister announced at the Water Summit, the Government is to review the system of charging for water in England and Wales. I am launching that review today. The purpose of the review is to ensure that we have a fair and sustainable system of charging for water and sewerage services.
<P>

<a name="70625w02.html_para2">The review will be conducted jointly by my Department and the Welsh Office, in consultation with the Office of Water Services. My Department will be writing today to interested bodies with details of the main issues which the review will address and inviting their representations. A copy of the letter has been placed in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="70625w02.html_para3">There is public concern about the system of charging for water. Water and sewerage services have to be paid for, but customers are entitled to expect that the basis on which their charges are levied is a fair one. The method of charging should have the support of customers as well as water companies.
<P>

<a name="70625w02.html_para4">The review will look at the various methods of charging for mains water and sewerage services, including both unmeasured and measured systems. Under Section 145 of the Water Industry Act 1991, water companies must not base their charges on rateable values after 31 March 2000.

 The Environment Agency keeps the environmental effects of organophosphates under review through its monitoring programmes. I have arranged for a copy of its recently published report "Pesticides in the Aquatic Environment 1995" to be placed in the Library. The Wildlife Incident Investigation Scheme, run by the Agriculture Departments, monitors the impact of agricultural pesticides, including organophosphates, on wildlife. Approvals of organophosphate pesticides and veterinary medicines are reviewed by the Advisory Committee on Pesticides and the Veterinary Products Committee. Agricultural pesticides including organophosphates are also subject to the European Community rolling review programme under Council Directive 91/414. The Veterinary Products Committee reviewed organophosphate sheep-dips earlier this year and its recommendations are currently being put into place. There are also many research projects addressing the effects of organophosphates on the environment including those funded by the Natural Environment Research Council. The Government is considering whether any further action to reduce the effects of organophosphates on the environment is necessary.

Road Lighting is provided over 30% of the motorway network in England. A list and a map illustrating the lit sections of motorway is attached for your information. Copies of the attached map will be placed in the Library. All other sections of motorway are currently unlit.
<BR>
Lighting is provided in high accident risk areas. The decision on whether to provide lighting is based on an economic assessment of the capital, maintenance and energy costs set against the potential savings as a result of the reduction in night time personal injury accidents. A full environmental assessment is also incorporated.
<BR>
New motorway lighting is being provided in conjunction with motorway widening schemes currently under construction. Apart from this, there is no programme to extend road lighting to unlit sections of motorway. The situation is however kept under review in light of historic accident rates and availability of funds.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will consider renegotiating river cruise licences with a view to safety. [4022]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70625w04.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 This is not a question which necessarily falls to my Department as the description of "river cruise licences" does not conform to any particular licence or certificate which is currently issued.
<P>

<a name="70625w04.html_para2">Local authorities issue licences allowing the operation of vessels which carry passengers and these licences would seem to be the most similar to those referred to in the question. There is an administrative charge relating to such licences and limited safety implications are involved.
<P>

<a name="70625w04.html_para3">The Marine Safety Agency (MSA) is responsible for issuing Passenger Certificates to vessels operating on inland waterways and the Environment Agency (EA) formally the National Rivers Authority (NRA) operates a Boat Safety Scheme with the emphasis for both being safety.
<P>

<a name="70625w04.html_para4">If you have any questions relating to either of these areas, I am sure that the Chief Executives of the MSA or EA will be able to help.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70625w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradley: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="70625w05.html_para0">The present disregard aims to strike a balance between acknowledging the special reasons for payment of the pension and the proper use of public funds. War pensioners already receive preferential treatment and benefit from many advantages over their Social Security counterparts.




<P>

<P>

<a name="70625w05.html_para1">To increase the disregard of the special treatment already afforded to war pensioners and war widows could be done only at the expense of other deserving groups.
<P>

<a name="70625w05.html_para2">We therefore have no plans to change the current disregards for war pensioners.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70625w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 The Government is keen to improve opportunities for women at all levels in sport, whether as participants, competitors, coaches or administrators.
<P>

<a name="70625w05.html_para3">The four Home Country Sports Councils, which are funded by central Government, actively encourage the involvement of women in all sports. Other sporting agencies, such as the Womens Sports Foundation are also doing much to underline the significant achievement of women in sport and help improve levels of participation.
<P>

<a name="70625w05.html_para4">Organisations are required to include ways of encouraging the participation of women when applying for monies from the National Lottery Sports Fund. This is helping to increase participation levels, particularly in those sports that have traditionally been male-dominated. These sports will be carefully monitored to ensure that the increased access is delivered.
<P>

<a name="70625w05.html_para5">The Government will explore ways to build on this and further extend opportunities through a national strategy for sport which will embrace all sections of the community regardless of where they live, social background, age or ability.

 It is the Government's intention to support Millennium events throughout the UK through the Millennium Commission. In announcing his support for the Millennium Exhibition on 19 June the Prime Minister said that the Exhibition must be a truly national event, with links across the whole of the UK.
<P>

<a name="70625w05.html_para6">The addition to the Exhibition in Greenwich the Millennium Commission has to date awarded grants totalling &#163;994 million to 112 capital projects on 2,036 sites across the UK. These range from landmark projects,

<P>
<P>
<a name="70625w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Banks </B> 
 <i>[holding answer Monday 23 June 1997]:</i> Local Education Authorities are not required to report their disposals of playing fields to Central Government and consequently no central record of playing field sales exist. Provided their schools continue to comply with the requirements for minimum playing field area in the Education (School Premises) Regulations 1996, Local Education Authorities may dispose of land belonging to them without reference to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment.
<P>

<a name="70625w05.html_para7">The Government intends to make sure that those playing fields which schools and their local communities need are not sold in the future.

 The Government is determined to see improvements in accommodation standards. The AA, RAC and ETB announced in February plans for a new harmonised scheme which for the first time would give a single rating for hotels according to both the quality of their service and the facilities they offer. They will be consulting the industry on the details of this and on a scheme covering non-hotel accommodation such as guest-houses, B and Bs, farmhouses and inns. The introduction of these voluntary measures will be an important first step in raising standards.

<P>
<P>

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has no current plans to use the powers in the Broadcasting Act 1996 to amend the minimum requirements for sign language on digital terrestrial television. The Government will, however, monitor this issue closely taking into account, in particular, any technological advances which would make on screen signing easier for the broadcasters to provide. The Independent Television Commission has undertaken that it will regularly review all aspects of its Code on Subtitling, Sign Language and Audio Description on Digital Terrestrial Television.

<a name="70625w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Banks </B> 
 <i>[holding answer Monday 23 June 1997]:</i> The Government does not regulate kick boxing--or indeed any other sport in this country. This is a matter for the relevant governing body, or bodies, acting within the bounds of the law. However, I believe that those in charge of such sports have a duty to ensure they are conducted safely, particularly where there is a risk of injury, and that governing bodies of sport should have the appropriate medical and safety regulations in place. The tragic death of Sean McBride, following his participation in a kick boxing bout in Northern Ireland, highlights the need for governing bodies to take urgent and appropriate action.

 I will be looking very carefully at how best to achieve an end to the advertising and promotion of tobacco at sports events in a way that will minimise any damage to the sports concerned. Clearly we will do all we can to help the sports concerned identify alternative sponsors.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer in what respects the Bank of England would need to be reformed to meet all the requirements for central bank independence in the Maastricht treaty; and when legislation would need to be passed if the United Kingdom wished to join a European single currency at the beginning of 1999. [4243]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70625w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The proposed changes to the Bank of England will not make it compatible with the requirements in the EC Treaty which would apply if the United Kingdom were to adopt the single currency. In particular, the Governor would need to be fully independent when carrying out his tasks in the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, and the Bank of England would need to be able to play a full role in the European System of Central Banks and the formulation and implementation of the single monetary policy.
<P>

<a name="70625w06.html_para0">The Treaty provides for the ECB to take responsibility for the monetary policy of the single currency on 1 January 1999. The legislative framework enabling the Bank of England to play its part would need to be in place by 1 January 1999 at the latest if the United Kingdom were to adopt the single currency. Progress towards making the Bank of England compatible with the Treaty will be assessed by the Commission and the European Monetary Institute as part of their reports made in accordance with the procedure under Article 109j(1) of the Treaty probably in spring 1998.

 The foreign reserve assets to be held and managed by the European Central Bank (ECB) will be provided by the national central banks of countries which adopt the single currency in accordance with Article 30 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) annexed to the EC Treaty. The amount to be 



<P>
<P><I>25 Jun 1997 : Column: 531</I><P>
provided by each national central bank will depend on the size of its country's population and national income. It is not possible at this stage to say precisely how much the Bank of England would need to provide if the United Kingdom were to join. The amount required in total by the ECB and its precise composition will be decided by its Governing Council, within a ceiling provided by the Treaty.
<P>

<a name="70625w06.html_para1">Foreign reserve assets held and managed by the ECB will be "pooled", in the sense that the central banks which provide them will have in turn a proportionate claim on the assets of the ECB. The Governing Council will decide the degree of decentralisation of the activities of the ESCB. There are likely to be good reasons for some or all foreign reserve assets to remain in individual national central banks, so that they can be used more effectively in local financial markets for example.
<P>

<a name="70625w06.html_para2">The Treaty provides no mechanism or sanction specifically for use against a national central bank which fails to provide the required amount of foreign reserve assets.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked me to reply as the Director of the Office for National Statistics to your recent question on the numbers of 17 to 25 year olds claiming unemployment benefit in Portsmouth in June of (a) 1974, (b) 1979, (c) 1988, (d) 1992, (e) 1993, (f) 1994, (g) 1995 and (h) 1996; and what percentage of the total number of those in this age group these figures represent.
<BR>
The data you have requested can only be derived from the monthly count of people claiming unemployment-related benefits (i.e. Unemployment Benefit and Income Support which were replaced by Jobseeker's Allowance in October 1996, or National Insurance credits). Essentially, all people who attend an Employment Service office to sign on the designated day are counted.
<BR>
These figures by broad age group for Local Authority Districts have been available quarterly since 1983. The corresponding figures by age are only available quarterly and not seasonally adjusted, and are based on particular age bands. The data given in the attached table, relating to claimants aged 17 to 24 inclusive in July each year, correspond as closely as possible to your request.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked me to reply as the Director of the Office for National Statistics to your recent question on what percentage of households have no one in full-time employment.
<BR>
Estimates available from the Labour Force Survey for non-pensioner households are shown in the attached table using the new Government Office Region (GOR) geography.
<BR>
It is widely accepted that analyses of households with no one in employment or, in this case, no one in full-time employment, should exclude pensioner households. This area of analysis is relatively new for the LFS and the definition of non-pensioner or working age households is not yet firmly established. The table provided is based on the same definition of non-pensioner household as previous responses to parliamentary questions to this topic. The ONS has been assessing the various alternative definitions and expects to publish its recommendations in the September issue of Labour Market Trends.

sound economic policies, as part of a wider commitment by debtors to balanced transparent economic reform programmes which encourage economic and social development and thus create the conditions in which poverty can be alleviated.

 I am very pleased to announce that agreement has been reached between the European Commission and the Government on the signature of Protocols between the Financial Controller of the European Commission and the Accounting Officer and Heads of Internal Audit of UK Departments with responsibilities for Structural Fund expenditure. These Protocols provide for an enhanced level of co-operation between the Commission's Financial Control and the Internal Audit Units of UK Departments in the control and auditing of Structural Fund expenditure. This will lead to a better use of the resources available for this purpose, agreement on common standards, and the exchange of relevant reports, without prejudicing the independence or statutory responsibilities of either party.
<P>

<a name="70625w07.html_para0">This is an important contribution to the improvement of the Community's financial management systems within the context of the Commission's strategy for improving and modernising financial management, Sound and Efficiency Management (SEM) 2000, which the Government strongly supports. Similar Protocols have already been agreed between the Commission and a number of other Member States, and I understand that discussions are under way between the Commission and further Member States.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what arrangements exist for the long-term safety monitoring of MMR vaccines. [4920]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70625w07.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Before measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination was introduced into the United Kingdom immunisation programme in 1988, there was extensive experience of its use in many other industrialised countries. The United States had been using MMR routinely since the early 1970s and around 100 million doses have been administered. By the time a two dose programme was introduced in the UK, in 1996, there was extensive experience of two dose programmes in many other countries. For example, a two dose programme of MMR in place in Finland since 1982 has 



<P>
<P><I>25 Jun 1997 : Column: 537</I><P>
led to the elimination of these diseases from that country. The vaccine was reported to have an excellent safety record.
<P>

<a name="70625w07.html_para2">In the UK the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) collects information from many different sources to monitor the safety of all medicines, including vaccines, in clinical practice worldwide. Spontaneous reports of suspected adverse drug reactions are submitted to the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) and MCA by doctors, pharmacists, coroners and dentists under the voluntary 'yellow card' scheme in the UK. There is a statutory requirement for pharmaceutical companies to report reactions to their products on a world-wide basis. Companies also provide regular safety updates for their products to the MCA. The number and pattern of suspected adverse reactions reports from all data sources are regularly reviewed, and appropriate action initiated if there is any indication of a safety hazard. The safety of vaccines is carefully monitored both by the CSM and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation which advise UK Health Ministers.

<a name="70625w07.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Public Health Laboratory Service is investigating adverse events associated with immunisation in children under two years of age, using hospital admissions data and child health immunisation records. Pilot studies in single districts have been published and copies of this paper have been placed in the Library. Their latest work, using regional data, will shortly be submitted for publication. Unfortunately, the results from studies using general practitioners' records do not so far suggest that this will be a useful source of data for identifying adverse reactions to vaccines.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70625w07.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will set out the criteria used for the testing of vaccines for immunogenicity and reactogenicity; what discussions his Department has had with the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control over the product licensing of vaccines; and when he next plans to meet the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation to discuss the administration of the MMR vaccine. [4921]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70625w07.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Before a new vaccine is licensed in the United Kingdom all of the information on its safety, quality and efficacy is evaluated by the Government's Medicines Control Agency and by the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM), an independent advisory committee. For a vaccine this will include assessment of clinical trials investigating the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of the product. There are no specific criteria laid out for the clinical testing of vaccines and each application for licensing by the MCA is taken on a case by case basis, depending on the type of vaccine.
<P>

<a name="70625w07.html_para3">The National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC), as a European Official Medicines Control Laboratory, carries out the batch release testing for certain biologicals, including vaccines, which is required as a condition of the European or United Kingdom licence granted for the product in question. Such testing is aimed at assessing the purity and potency of each batch of the product against specifications defined in 



<P>
<P><I>25 Jun 1997 : Column: 538</I><P>
the product licence. NIBSC also reviews manufacturing protocols as part of the evaluation of batch release. NIBSC also provides expert advice on vaccines and some of its staff are members of the biologicals sub-committee of the Committee on Safety of Medicines. The Director of the NIBSC is a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI); any concerns NIBSC may have would be brought to the attention of that committee.
<P>

<a name="70625w07.html_para4">We have no plans to meet the JCVI, but, as with all vaccines, the JCVI will keep the benefits and risks of MMR vaccination under review. We have asked to be kept informed of any developments.

 The EC novel foods and novel food ingredients regulation 258/97, which came into force on 15 May, lays down an EU wide pre-market approval system and labelling requirements for novel foods and novel food ingredients including those containing, or produced from, genetically modified organisms (GMOs). All applications for approval will be considered by the UK's independent Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes.

 The Government is determined to see a flourishing horticulture industry in the United Kingdom. We will therefore be spending some &#163;12.7 million in 1997-98 under our research programme, directed at improving the competitiveness and market responsiveness of the sector. Priority areas are those showing the greatest potential for growth and added value, especially where there is a clear trade gap opportunity such as extending our own growing seasons.
<P>

<a name="70625w09.html_para0">The financial assistance available to recognised producer groups under the reformed regime for fresh fruit and vegetables will also enable growers in the sector to improve their competitive edge. We are seeking to ensure that growers in the UK benefit fully from EU funds available under these new arrangements.

 Countryside Stewardship is the main environmental land management scheme providing incentives for farmers and land managers in England outside the Environmentally Sensitive Areas. It provides a very important mechanism for helping to fulfil our Biodiversity Strategy commitments as well as offering benefits for landscape, history and public enjoyment of the countryside.
<P>

<a name="70625w09.html_para2">The scheme will continue to expand with &#163;5 million available for approval of new agreements in 1997-98 and a further &#163;5 million 1998-99 when the total annual expenditure on the scheme will have risen to &#163;21 million.

<BR>
I am replying to your question to the Secretary of State for Defence about the quantities and types of chemical weapon agents imported from the United States held in store by the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment as this matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief Executive of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency.
<BR>
Two chemicals are recorded as having being imported from the United States and are currently held in store at CBD. They are Methyl phosphonyl (or phosphonic) dichloride and Methyl phosphonous (or phosphinyl) dichloride. The current holding is 215kg and 1.018 tonnes respectively. These chemicals were included in the UK's declaration under the Chemical Weapons Convention. In addition to these transfers there have been a number of others over the years with the US, which fall below the chemical weapons convention threshold and for which it would involve disproportionate costs to identify.
<BR>
The declared materials were imported in March 1955 and June 1964 and were transferred to CBD Porton from CBDE Nancekuke, Cornwall when it closed in 1980. They are awaiting disposal and are stored in airtight chemical drums in a controlled storage area. The condition of the containers is checked regularly. We anticipate disposal soon.
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.

I am replying to your question to the Secretary of State for Defence about landfill locations used for the disposal of heavy metals extracted from chemical weapons munitions as this matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief Executive of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency.
<BR>
The chemical weapons munitions being disposed of at Porton Down do not contain heavy metals so the question of landfill sites does not arise.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what environmental and safety information has been provided to his Department by those contracted to destroy outstanding British chemical weapon grenades, 9140-M6-CN-DM, held at RAF base Bad Wulfen. [4302]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70625w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The destruction of outstanding British chemical weapon grenades at BAD Wulfen, is being conducted in accordance with German environmental legislation. Frequent meetings between my Officials, the German Authorities, selected German Army specialists, and the Contractor, have ensured this to be the case. A safety plan was also agreed following detailed discussions between local German government officials, the Contractor, and ammunition specialists from both the British and German Army. The stringent safety regulations already in force within the Ammunition Depot assisted this process. Whilst no specific information has been received by my Department from the Contractor on matters of environment and safety, the Contractor has, as a matter of course, contributed to the procedures which have been put in place.

 No decisions have been taken on which countries will accede to NATO membership, when and on what terms.

Subject to that caveat, we expect the costs of enlargement to be manageable.

 Responsibility for education in Wales is a matter for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales. There are currently 1188 grant maintained (GM) schools in England. They receive two types of recurrent grants: annual maintenance grant (AMG) in respect of general school running costs and special purpose grants (SPGs) paid for specific purposes. The AMG that GM schools receive includes elements to cover school meals and the central administration and services provided directly by LEAs to LEA maintained schools. These are additional to the school budget shares which LEA schools receive through their LMS schemes.

 Responsibility for this subject has been delegated to the Planning Service under its Chief Executive, Mr. T. W. Stewart. I have asked him to arrange for a reply to be given.

<BR>
Lord Dubs has asked me to reply to your questions about the Down and Newry and Mourne area plans, and also about the publication of the Planning Service's Corporate and Business Plan 1997-98.
<BR>
Only Development Plans which were to be adopted in 1996-97 were included in the Agency's Business Plan for that year. The position is the same for the 1997-98 Business Plan, published ealrier this month, a copy of which is available in the Library. When drawing up plans for 1998-99 and future years, the programming of work on both plans will be taken into account in accordance with competing priorities and available resources. At present, there is no agreed time-scale for the commencement and execution of the work.
<BR>
Although the notional end date for the Down Area Plan is late 1997 and for the Newry and Mourne Area Plan late 1999, they will remain material planning considerations in the determination of any planning applications submitted after those dates.

<BR>
The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question requesting the value of fraudulent claims uncovered by the Benefit Agency (BA) in each of the 13 area directorates for each of the last five years for which figures are available (a) in terms of the cash value of benefits saved and (b) as a percentage of total payments made for each of the benefits administered.
<BR>
The information is not available in the format requested. Fraud savings are derived from more than one source including the Benefit Fraud Investigation Service (BFIS), Organised Fraud Investigations (OFI), Central Benefit Directorates and, from 1995/96, the Security and Control Programme. The differing organisational set up within these sections do not match the Area Directorate structure. However figures are available for total fraud savings for the BA and are shown in the attached Annex.
<BR>
The savings are shown as Weekly Benefit Savings (WBS) and not in strict cash terms. WBS are calculated by multiplying the actual amount of benefit saved by 32 (32 weeks being the average length of time that benefit would have been paid, if it had not been reduced or withdrawn following the intervention of a fraud officer.) 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>25 Jun 1997 : Column: 565</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>While this gives an assessment of the amounts of benefit saved by counter fraud activity, it does not show the public expenditure savings accruing in that year from current and previous activity.
<BR>
Changes were introduced in the 1996 budget to try and refine the way savings are accounted for in the public expenditure plans. Savings are no longer attributed wholly to the year in which the fraud is detected, but spread over the period which the fraud would otherwise on average have continued. Due to changes in accounting methods a direct comparison in cash terms with previous years is not possible.
<BR>
We do not collate fraud savings separately by benefit type. Therefore fraud savings are expressed as a percentage of the total programme spend on all benefits for the last five years.
<BR>
I hope you find this reply helpful.

<P>

<a name="70625w16.html_para2">In Jobseeker's Allowance, which was introduced in October 1996, there is a common rule which ensures that all unemployed people aged 18 to 24 are treated the same, regardless of their contribution record.

<a name="70625w16.html_para3">In Housing Benefit, the main change was the restriction of the amount of rent which can be used to calculate benefit entitlement.

<BR>
I am replying to your Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Social Security about Child Support Agency accuracy levels.
<BR>
The 1997-98 Secretary of State target set for the Agency relating to accuracy is for the cash value of all assessments checked in the year to be correct in at least 85% of cases.
<BR>
Performance against this target is determined by examination of a statistically valid sample of maintenance assessments, which are checked to ensure that the cash value of the assessment (or change to the assessment) is correct within one penny. To satisfy the target 85% of all cases checked throughout the year must be correct to the last penny.

The accuracy of the cash value maintenance has improved over recent years for 79% reported for March 1996 to 87% reported for March 1997. Performance against the target in this financial year has been maintained at this level, with accuracy running at 86% in April and 88% in May.

The Agency does not collect general information on average processing times, but measures performance against its Secretary of State target relating to the clearance of applications. In 1996-97, the target was to clear 60 per cent. of new maintenance applications within 26 weeks, with no more than 10 per cent. of outstanding applications to be over 52 weeks old. Over the full year, 54 per cent. of new maintenance applications were cleared within 26 weeks, and 12 per cent. of all applications were over 52 weeks old at 31 March 1997. Performance improved towards the end of the year, so that the in-month figure for clearances within 26 weeks stood at 60 per cent. in February and 63 per cent. in March.

Details of clearances for the last three years are as follows:
<BR>
1994-95: 28,272
<BR>
1995-96: 26,955
<BR>
1996-97: 36,339
<BR>
The improved performance in 1996-97 is a direct result of the drive within the Agency to reduce the number of reviews outstanding. At the end of 1995-96, this stood at 11,189, but by 31 March 1997 had been reduced to 6,279. The numbers continue to fall, with 4,903 reviews outstanding at the end of May 1997.
<BR>
The Agency does not collect information on average processing times. We do, however, have details of the age of the cases on hand, with cases over 26 weeks old considered to be in arrears. Our drive to reduce the number of reviews outstanding concentrated particularly on the clearance of these older cases, with the result that only 647 applications were over 26 weeks old at the end of the year, compared to 3,056 at the end of 1995-96. At 31 May, this had increased slightly to 699 cases.
