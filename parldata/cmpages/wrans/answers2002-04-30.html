<P>
<P>
<a name="20430w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Andrew Turner: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General how many applications he has received in the last 12 months via <i>(a)</i> the CPS, <i>(b)</i> members of the public and <i>(c)</i> hon. Members for the review of unduly lenient sentences; and how many in each category have (i) been rejected as out of time, (ii) been reviewed resulting in referral to the CPS, (iii) been reviewed resulting in referral to the courts and (iv) resulted in increased sentences.  [51992]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20430w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General have the power (under sections 35 and 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1998) to refer a sentence for certain categories of offences to the Court of Appeal for review, if it appears to be not merely lenient but unduly so.
<P>

<a name="20430w01.html_para0">The law requires a reference to be lodged with the Court of Appeal within 28 days of the date of sentence. This period cannot be extended.
<P>

<a name="20430w01.html_para1">During the last year (from 1 April 2001 to 31 March 2002) the Crown Prosecution Service sent 191 cases to the Law Officers for a review of the sentence as an unduly lenient sentence.
<P>

<a name="20430w01.html_para2">In addition the Law Officers received similar applications in 17 cases from members of the public, and a further five cases from Members of Parliament. The Law Officers have also received three ULS referral cases from HM Customs and Excise.
<P>

<a name="20430w01.html_para3">In all, during the relevant period, the Law Officers have received applications for a referral in 216 cases.
<P>

<a name="20430w01.html_para4">Two (out of the 17) cases referred by members of the public were received beyond the 28-day time limit for referral and therefore could not be considered for a reference to the Court of Appeal.
<P>

<a name="20430w01.html_para5">Of the 216 cases sent to the Law Officers, 110 were referred by the Law Officers to the Court of Appeal for a review of the sentence.
<P>

<a name="20430w01.html_para6">According to our records, of these, to date, the Court of Appeal has heard 49 cases. Of the 49 cases heard, the results known to date indicate that the Court of Appeal granted leave in 45 cases and found the sentence to be unduly lenient in 44 cases. Despite concluding that a sentence is unduly lenient, the Court of Appeal can, in the circumstances of a particular case, apply its discretion and decide not to increase the sentence. In eight of the cases the Court of Appeal, applying its discretion decided not to increase the sentence. However it increased the sentence in 36 cases.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20430w01.html_spnew3"><B> John Healey </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 April 2002]:</i> Capita notified the Department of some 8,600 complaints relating to non-compliance with the ILA programme rules and ILA accounts being accessed without the ILA account holder's consent. Following a data cleansing exercise some 1,400 complaints have been removed relating to complaints cleared, correction of duplicate complaints

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what responsibility her Department had to put the learndirect database into a form in which it could be used to accredit ILA providers; and when, and what, action has been taken to give effect to that responsibility.  [49881]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20430w01.html_spnew4"><B> John Healey </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 April 2002]:</i> The learndirect database holds details of over 500,000 learning opportunities. The intention is to work towards a comprehensive coverage of all UK learning opportunities. To have their course included on the database providers simply apply via the learndirect website. There is no charge for this service. Inclusion on the database does not imply endorsement, quality assurance or accreditation of providers or their provision and there are no plans to change this approach.
<P>

<a name="20430w01.html_para10">ILA providers were encouraged to list their courses on the learning opportunities website to ensure that Individual Learning Account holders could get information and advice about the learning that was available through learndirect. However, this did not constitute an ILA accreditation process. Full integration of the ILA and learndirect databases was not pursued because of the technical difficulties surrounding data incompatibility.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20430w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Sheerman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how much money was claimed in total for individual learning account payments of more than &#163;200 in the period from September 2000 to 20 October 2000; how many claims for ILAs in that period were for amounts <i>(a)</i> less than &#163;200, <i>(b)</i> in the range &#163;201 to &#163;500, <i>(c)</i> in the range &#163;501 to &#163;1,000 and <i>(d)</i> above &#163;1,000; how many providers submitted individual claims for more than &#163;1,000; and if she will make a statement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20430w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Teachers in maintained schools are subject to national school teachers' pay and conditions. Further education sector colleges are run by independent corporations established under the Further Education and Higher Education Act 1992 and there is no national pay structure in place. Colleges are free to establish pay scales that meet their needs and can be agreed with their staff. This Government have acknowledged the historic funding gap between schools and FE and we have pledged to bring up levels of funding and ensure upward convergence over time. The Teaching Pay Initiative (TPI) budget is &#163;311 million over the period 2001&#150;04. This is to reward excellent teaching and is over and above any general pay rise. The additional investment we are making in the FE sector through normal core funding will also make an important contribution.

<P>
<a name="20430w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 April 2002]:</i> Section 14 of the Education Act 1996 (the 1996 Act) sets out the duty of the local education authority (LEA) to provide sufficient primary and secondary schools for its area. Schools must be sufficient in number, character and equipment to provide education for all pupils, suitable to their age, ability and aptitude and the different periods for which they may remain at school, including appropriate practical instruction and training.

<P>

<a name="20430w02.html_para0">Section 14 does not impose any duty in respect of children under five. It allows an LEA to provide education for people over compulsory school age and under 19, including those from other areas.
<P>

<a name="20430w02.html_para1">In exercising its functions under section 14, an LEA must have regard to the need to provide primary and secondary education in different schools, the need to secure special educational provision for pupils with special educational needs, and the expediency of securing boarding provision where necessary.
<P>

<a name="20430w02.html_para2">The duty is general and does not give rise to a specific duty for an individual child or for a class of children.
<P>

<a name="20430w02.html_para3">None of the LEA's duties under the 1996 Act applies in respect of any person who is in custody because of a court order or an order of recall made by the Secretary of State.

 All the direct funding for schools of which the Chancellor gave examples in his recent Budget speech goes to schools. It is for schools themselves to decide how this money is used within the context of standard guidance.
<P>

<a name="20430w02.html_para6">The Chancellor announced additional capital funding of &#163;85 million for schools and colleges in England in 2002&#150;03, which will be delivered to schools as an additional allocation of the existing New Deal for Schools devolved formula capital programme. This money is allocated by formula with a fixed amount per school plus a fixed amount per pupil. It is channelled through local education authorities, which must allocate it to schools using the standard national formula, and may not retain any part of the grant. Schools can hold this grant in their own suitable bank accounts, on request.
<P>

<a name="20430w02.html_para7">The Chancellor also included school standards grant in his examples of what typical schools will receive in 2002&#150;03.

<a name="20430w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Sixth form teachers in schools have received a pay award of 3.5 per cent. with effect from 1 April, together with a new allowance of &#163;33 in respect of the cost of the fee payable to the General Teaching Councils for England or Wales. Teachers below the maximum of the main pay scale may also receive assimilation increases when the scale is shortened from nine to six points on 1 September. The 2002&#150;03 pay negotiations between the Association of Colleges and representative further education unions started on 16 April and are currently ongoing. I am unable to make an assessment of the value to further education teachers and lecturers at this time.

<P>
<a name="20430w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 We are taking action together with the School Teachers' Review Body and the school teacher employers and unions to address the problem of teacher workload; and pay for a good experienced classroom teacher who has passed the performance threshold has increased by nearly 30 per cent. since 1997. We take very seriously the need to raise the status and morale of the teaching profession. The assessment of further education staff morale is a matter for further education colleges, as independent employers, to address in consultation with the relevant unions, just as the terms and conditions for staff are a matter for colleges to determine in discussion with relevant unions. We acknowledge that colleges need help to ensure that they have the right arrangements to recruit, reward and retain excellent teachers. Over the period 2001&#150;04, significant extra resources amounting to an additional &#163;311 million have been made available to the further education sector to reward high calibre staff through our Teaching Pay Initiative.

 Pay scales for schools teachers have increased by 3.5 per cent. with effect from 1 April, and a new allowance of &#163;33 created in respect of the cost of the fee payable to the General Teaching Councils for England or Wales. The main pay scale now has nine points from &#163;16,599 to &#163;25,713. This will reduce to six points from &#163;17,595 to &#163;25,713 with effect from 1 September. The upper pay scale for post-threshold teachers has five points from &#163;27,861 to &#163;32,217. The pay spine for advanced skills teachers runs from &#163;28,917 to &#163;46,131. The pay spine for the leadership group runs from &#163;30,531 to &#163;85,671. Further education sector colleges are run by independent corporations established under the Further Education and Higher Education Act 1992 and there is no national pay structure in place. Colleges are free to establish pay scales that meet their needs and can be agreed with their staff. We continue to encourage employers and unions to work together to ensure that further education staff receive reasonable pay given the substantial extra funding that has been made available for the further education sector.

We are working closely with the Learning and Skills Council to ensure maximum progress is being made by implementing specific local and innovative approaches to improving level 2 attainment. The Government are introducing a range of new initiatives which will increase participation in learning and attainment by young people post 16 including Education Maintenance Allowances, Connexions and the reforms to the 14&#150;19 curriculum published in the Green Paper (14&#150;19&#151;Extending Opportunities; Raising Standards) though these will not impact by 2002.

 Respect for the rule of law is the only long-term guarantee for human rights in Burma. That is why we have been pressing so consistently for the return of constitutional rule in Burma. In the meantime, we continue to work with EU colleagues and through the United Nations to focus attention on Burma's human rights record. On 25 April the UN Commission on Human Rights adopted an EU sponsored resolution on the human rights situation in Burma.

 Four standing working groups were established at the Afghan National Workshop on Human Rights held in Kabul on 9 March. These working groups will take forward the human rights provisions of the Bonn agreement, including the establishment of the independent Human Rights Commission, the investigation and monitoring of human rights abuses, and the provision of human rights education.

<a name="20430w04.html_para3">The UN Assistance Mission to Afghanistan will continue to support the Interim Authority and the Human Rights Commission in their work. According to the UN Secretary General, a senior Human Rights Co-ordinator in the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General will serve as the principal contact for the independent Human Rights Commission. Staff, including Afghan nationals, will be equipped to perform the human rights aspects of their work, including the integration of rights-based and gender-sensitive approaches in the mission's relief and reconstruction activities.

 On 31 March, the Special Commission for Convening the Emergency Loya Jirga announced the criteria for the selection of delegates for the Loya Jirga, including the arrangements for selection of candidates by regional ballot. These include a quota of seats reserved for women (100 out of the 1,051 seats being decided by regional ballot). A further 60 seats will be reserved for women out of the quotas reserved for members of the Interim Authority, refugees, members of civil society, internally displaced persons and professionals. This will give a total allocation of 160 out of 1,450 seats.
<P>

<a name="20430w04.html_para4">The Loya Jirga process has received wide publicity in Afghanistan via radio and print media. The commission, whose 21 members include three women, are also travelling to the regions to explain the process and to encourage women to take part.

 Reform of the security sector will be crucial in establishing security across Afghanistan. The process is at an early stage. While Afghan women are not members of the recently established First Battalion of the Afghan National Guard (trained by ISAF), we hope that Afghan women will play an important role in the security sector, including in the police, the judiciary and the armed forces.

<P>
<a name="20430w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 It is not possible to provide figures for the cost of criminal damage to FCO buildings in each of the last four years for the following reasons:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) Repairs to buildings following such incidents are funded from many different sources among them local budgets, command budgets, estates budgets and occasionally from Estate Strategy Unit's (SSU) budget. They would be in most cases identified as routine maintenance charges, rather than specifically connected to an incident of criminal damage in the accounts.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) Many posts do not report minor incidents of criminal damage, but simply get on with the job of repair required, funding them from their local budget. Centrally held records within SSU are, therefore, only indicative of reported incidents, and do not accurately reflect the true picture.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) Records of damage caused by criminal activity to HQ buildings in the UK are kept, but logged only as an incident in the normal incident logs. To identify the cost involved, after the fact, would involve trawling through all the incident logs, then checking jobs logged to the Facilities Management Helpdesk during the same period and finally comparing any related jobs with invoices, presented by the relevant service provider, from the same period. This is a highly labour intensive process, far in excess of the cost where it becomes disproportionate to the answer.</FONT></UL>

 We have sought information on Mr. Sheikh's detention, and are awaiting a response from the Pakistani authorities. If Mr. Sheikh is a dual UK/Pakistani national, the Pakistani authorities are not obliged to give us consular access or information. Mr. Sheikh's family have not made contact with our consular officials, although they are welcome to do so in either Pakistan or London.

 The Overseas Territories Constitutional Adviser visited Ascension in October last year. A summary of his recommendations appeared in the island's newspaper on 7 March. A further consultation document was issued by the Governor at a public meeting on 10 April. This outlined two options: a county/district model of government, or an Advisory Island Council with provision for regular consultation with St. Helena representatives on areas of mutual interest. We hope that a decision on the form of democratic representation, based on the preferred choice of the residents of Ascension Island, will be taken shortly.

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 26 April 2002]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary had a discussion with the US Secretary of State Colin Powell on the position of the Director General of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) at the end of March. There have been further discussions at official level on the matter.
<P>

<a name="20430w06.html_para3">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs discussed the chairmanship of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) earlier this month in Washington.

<P>
<a name="20430w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We have received occasional NGO reports suggesting mistreatment of Christians in Bhutan, and have expressed our concern to the Bhutanese Government that the right to choose, declare, and practice one's religion should be respected.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20430w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We have not made any recent representations to the Russian Government about this issue. The main focus of our dialogue has been the human rights situation in Chechnya. However, the UK has supported a Council of Europe project aimed at speeding up the registration process and the issue of identity cards to Chechen internally displaced persons.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what recent representations he has made and to whom for an independent international inquiry into violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in Chechnya.  [53055]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20430w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The UK has not called for an international inquiry into allegations of human rights violations in Chechnya. Instead, we have, with our EU partners, pressed the Russian Government to establish, in accordance with recognised international standards, a national, broad-based and independent commission of inquiry to investigate alleged violations of human rights and breaches of international humanitarian law committed in the republic. We last raised this in mid-April at the 58th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.

<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20430w07.html_wqn3"><B> Lynne Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what steps Her Majesty's Government are taking to encourage the UN Security Council to back OPCW's bid to persuade the Iraqi Government to sign the chemical weapons convention.  [52055]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20430w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 United Nations Security Council Resolution 1284 mandated the UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) to inspect, monitor and, if necessary, destroy Iraq's chemical and biological weapons and its ballistic missile systems. The first priority must be to ensure that UNMOVIC has access to Iraq to carry out its mandate and to uphold the authority of the United Nations.
<P>

<a name="20430w07.html_para0">The UK fully supports OPCW's efforts to achieve universal ratification of the chemical weapons convention. Iraq could, of course, ratify CWC tomorrow, but this should not in any way undermine UNMOVIC's mandate.

 Letters were sent to some 6,700 recipients of occupational pensions from the armed forces in December last year informing them about revised arrangements, to be introduced from April 2002, for those who collected their pensions at Post Offices.

Pensioners may continue to draw cash at Post Offices subject to having an account with the following banks&#151;The Alliance and Leicester, Barclays, Cahoot, Lloyds TSB, Smile or the Co-Operative Bank. These new arrangements apply to armed forces occupational pensions and not to state pensions.

 The Queen's Golden Jubilee Award (for voluntary service by groups in the community) is announced today. This new, annual award is for groups and teams in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, rather than for individuals. The award will be given in recognition of outstanding voluntary activity that enhances and improves the quality of life and opportunity for others in the community. Groups must be nominated for consideration, for example by beneficiaries of their work, members of the public, representatives of public bodies, or other voluntary groups. Initial selection will be by local panels in the devolved Administrations and Government regions, with final selection being done centrally by the Queen's Golden Jubilee Award Committee. The award illustrates the importance the Queen places on community and voluntary service by dedicated and committed teams and groups, and provides 



<P>

 There were 114 convictions for scheduled offences between 11 April 1998 and 31 December 1998, which had been committed before 10 April 1998. Statistics for subsequent years cannot be provided as the data on scheduled offences are unreliable. A new database is currently being developed for courts and criminal records data since 1999.

 <i>[holding answer 23 April 2002]:</i> My Department has allocated support of &#163;29 million to solid biomass crops through the Energy Crops Scheme, part of the England Rural Development Programme. Working with other Departments we are putting in place schemes with funding of &#163;70 million which will develop markets for biomass, including purpose grown energy crops and material from forests, in heat, combined heat and power and electricity generation. We are also working closely with the Countryside Agency which has launched the Community Renewables Initiative to help local communities develop renewable energy projects. The Renewables Obligation permits the co-firing of energy crops with fossil fuels. In the Budget my right hon. Friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, confirmed the new duty rate for biodiesel set at 20 pence per litre below the rate for Ultra Low Sulphur Diesel. The Government are considering carefully the recommendation of the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food that duty on biofuels should be reduced to the rates applied to other clean fuels. The Government have also welcomed the publication of the Energy Review by the Performance and Innovation Unit, which draws attention to the key role of renewable energy sources, including energy crops, in moving to a low carbon economy. The Government plan a public consultation on the key recommendations of the report leading to a White Paper in the autumn.

 <i>[holding answer 27 November 2001]:</i> We have no evidence that the use of recycled incinerator bottom ash (IBA) in building materials is a significant source of human exposure to any substance, but we are undertaking research in order to make further quantitative estimates of exposures by this route.
<P>

<a name="20430w09.html_para1">As regards exposure to dioxins, latest industry figures for IBA going into the construction industry indicate dioxin levels of less than 25ng/kg I-TEQ (1999 AEAT figures for normal urban soils in the UK show a mean of 28ng/kg I-TEQ). There is limited information available on the levels that may be found in other construction materials, and there are no recommended acceptable levels. However we are awaiting the results of independent research into the health and environmental implications of using IBA in construction (including roads and the manufacture of building blocks). Initial indications are that exposure to dioxins from roads constructed with material incorporating IBA is negligible.

This information is updated on an hourly basis. Figures for the year 2001 show that across the country as a whole the average number of days of moderate or poor air quality recorded by individual monitoring stations in urban areas of the UK was 21 days. This total has declined steadily over the last decade as measures to deliver cleaner air have started to take effect.

 There are currently four automatic and 11 non-automatic air quality monitoring stations in the Teesside region. These are part of the UK air quality monitoring networks. In addition, a non-automatic benzene monitor has recently been installed in Middlesbrough as part of the UK non-automatic hydrocarbon monitoring network. There are currently no plans to increase the number of automatic monitoring stations in the region. I am not aware of any plans to further increase the number of non-automatic stations in the region, which are the responsibility of local authorities.

<P>
<a name="20430w10.html_spnew4"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 empowers the Countryside Agency to designate an area in England as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) for the purpose of conserving and enhancing the natural beauty of the area.
<P>

<a name="20430w10.html_para5">Boundaries for AONBs are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The last boundary variation was made to Dedham Vale AONB on 19 September 1991. Establishing AONBs, and varying their boundaries, is the responsibility of the Countryside Agency. They have no plans to create any new AONBs or to vary the boundaries of any of the existing ones, except in so far as a National Park in the South Downs might replace two AONBs.
<P>

<a name="20430w10.html_para6">Boundary reviews are very time consuming and expensive: So the Countryside Agency believes it is better to focus resources on managing existing AONBs, and maximising the opportunities offered by the new Countryside and Rights of Way Act, rather than pursuing minor variations. I support this view.

 Tomorrow I will publish the first Marine Stewardship Report-Safeguarding Our Seas: A Strategy for the Conservation and Sustainable Development of our Marine Environment.
<P>

<a name="20430w11.html_para1">The report sets out our vision for the marine environment&#151;clean, healthy, safe, productive and biologically diverse oceans and seas. It is underpinned by the principles of sustainable development, integrated management, the conservation of biological diversity, robust science, the precautionary principle and stakeholder involvement.
<P>

<a name="20430w11.html_para2">It outlines how we are adopting an ecosystem-based approach to marine management to better integrate marine protection objectives with sustainable social and economic goals.

<a name="20430w11.html_para3">Our initiatives will improve marine conservation. We will undertake our proposed regional seas pilot scheme in the Irish Sea as the next stage of our review of Marine Nature Conservation. The report also commits us to consult later this year on the regulations to extend the Habitats and Birds Directives out to limit of jurisdiction of UK waters. It also contains a commitment to explore with other countries the case for, and feasibility of, marine protected areas on the high seas.
<P>

<a name="20430w11.html_para4">The report announces our intention to review the regulations that affect development in coastal waters with a view to simplifying the regulatory system and protecting the marine environment. It also includes initiatives to explore the role of spatial planning for our seas at the regional level and provide a focal point to build on existing seabed mapping.
<P>

<a name="20430w11.html_para5">In addition, Safeguarding Our Seas commits us to review current arrangements for marine scientific research to ensure that we have the proper science base to deliver our vision. It underlines our commitment to develop our framework for environmental monitoring and that we will produce an integrated assessment of our seas by 2004.
<P>

<a name="20430w11.html_para6">The report emphasises the importance of involving stakeholders in making the decisions that affect them.

Developed countries have committed to support these efforts with action on aid volume, aid effectiveness, building capacity, investment and competition. We are contributing to preparations for the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in August to help ensure better understanding of the links between poverty reduction and globalisation, and more effective management of environmental resources.

 The Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions currently has no significant building projects under construction. Wherever possible, building projects will be planned to avoid or minimise the use of air-conditioning. Where the need for air-conditioning and associated water chilling systems cannot be eliminated, the use of coolants that contribute to climate change will be avoided wherever this is safe, cost effective and technically feasible to do so.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions how many self-certification schemes are in operation relating to the construction industry; and what the cost is of joining each scheme.  [53001]<P>

<P>
<a name="20430w12.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 Five schemes are operating self- certification under the Building Regulations in England and Wales. These are for installers registered with the Council for Registered Gas Installers (CORGI); the Oil Firing Registration Scheme run by the Oil Firing Technical Association for the Petroleum Industry (OFTEC); the Registration Scheme for Companies involved in the Installation and Maintenance of Domestic Solid Fuel Fired Equipment run by HETAS Ltd.; the Approved Contractor Person Scheme (Building Regulations) run by the Institute of Plumbing; and the Fenestration Self-Assessment Scheme run by FENSA Ltd.
<P>

<a name="20430w12.html_para1">We understand the costs for joining each scheme are as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For an installer registered with CORGI the joining fee is &#163;189, with an annual membership fee of &#163;170 included in the first year's costs. Where the registered installer is a company, they can register additional employees at &#163;49 per annum.
<P>
<BR>
For OFTEC the annual fee is &#163;36 for an individual, and &#163;20 for a company, payable five years in advance. An individual must be employed by an OFTEC registered firm.
<P>
<BR>
For HETAS the first year's fee is &#163;150 for a firm followed by and annual membership fee of &#163;100. For an individual the fee is &#163;25 per annum. An individual must be employed by a HETAS registered firm.
<P>
<BR>
For the Institute of Plumbing we understand that there will be no separate charge for membership of the Approved Contractor Person Scheme, but it will be necessary to be a member of the Institute of Plumbing (IoP). There is an IoP joining fee of &#163;30 and an annual membership fee of &#163;50.50.
<P>
<BR>
For the Fenestration Self-Assessment Scheme all firms are required to pay a standard registration fee of &#163;100, in addition to the vetting fee of &#163;200. The vetting fee is not required, however, if the firm has already been vetted by another body which has standards comparable to FENSA. There is also an annual membership charge of &#163;50 included in the first year's costs. Registered firms are required to purchase Approved Documents L1 and N which provide details on how to comply with the Building Regulations.

<P>
<a name="20430w12.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 The criteria used were the same as normally followed when introducing a new initiative under the Building Regulations. There was an initial consultation with the Building Regulations Advisory Committee (BRAC), followed by two extensive written consultations with interested representative bodies. This was followed up by further consultation with BRAC, including the creation of a separate BRAC working party. There was final consultation on the detailed regulations with BRAC along with requests for comments from the schemes involved and individual experts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20430w12.html_spnew13"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 In the consultation document 'Taking Forward Self-Certification Under the Building Regulations' we noted that the first stage of self- certification would develop a body of experience which it might be able to apply more widely when other bodies join. It was also noted that this process would "allow synergies to develop with the quality mark initiative . . .". We have started this process. In relation to the Fenestration Self-Assessment Scheme (FENSA), quality mark members are eligible for a discount on initial membership, and further discussions are currently taking place between the Department of Trade and Industry and FENSA over how the two schemes can work more closely together over the coming months. We will also be working with the other schemes during this first stage to see how they can work more closely with the quality mark initiative.

 The discussion draft of the Government's "Powering Future Vehicles" strategy for supporting the shift to low-carbon vehicles and fuels identified the Government's important role in supporting the development of new fuel infrastructures, as the need and demand for them arose. Hydrogen looks likely to be a key component in the long-term shift to low-carbon transport. The Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Budget announced that the Government intended both to exempt hydrogen from fuel duty for a period to encourage its further development and early take-up, and also to provide enhanced capital allowances for installing hydrogen fuel infrastructure. Additionally, the Government is already providing financial support for the pilot trials of hydrogen fuel cell buses to be carried out next year by Transport for London, including the hydrogen refuelling station to support the initiative.

Thus paragraphs 70 and 71 of Minerals Planning Guidance Note 6 advise that major developments should not take place in national parks, such as the Peak district, save in exceptional circumstances. All minerals applications must be subject to the most rigorous examination, and should be demonstrated to be in the public interest before being allowed to proceed. The factors to be taken into account in considering minerals applications in such areas include:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a) the need for the development in terms of national considerations of mineral supply; and the impact of permitting the development, or refusing it, on the local economy;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>b) whether alternative supplies can be made available at reasonable cost; and the scope for meeting the need in some other way;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>c) any detrimental effect of the proposals on the environment and landscape and the extent to which that should be moderated; and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>d) in the case of extensions to existing quarries, the extent to which the proposal would achieve an enhancement to the local landscape.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="20430w13.html_para0">Minerals policies in the RPG for the east midlands should be read within that context.

 The Court Service has initiated a programme of regular customer satisfaction surveys of court and tribunal users. A press notice was released in April last year, giving details of the first findings. The second part of the survey was completed in November 2001 and the third is in progress: these results will be published in the summer of 2002. All magistrates' courts carry out two court user surveys a year. The results are published and can be found in the House Library.
<P>

 Before the award of the contracts for the Resource Accounting and Management Information System (ARAMIS), the Local County Court Systems (LOCCS) and the Libra project the contract values were compared with public sector comparators and demonstrated value for money.
<P>

<a name="20430w18.html_para4">Since the award of these contract additional work has been commissioned which was not included in the original comparison. It is not possible to produce a lifetime 'comparative' savings figure for these contracts because of work that has taken place since contract award. However, additional work commissioned under these contracts is subject to an evaluation process to ensure that value for money is achieved.

It is there to safeguard the right of the United Kingdom to determine its own immigration and nationality laws. We have carefully reviewed the reservation in the light of

<P>
<P>
<a name="20430w19.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2002]:</i> The total cost of running the Home Office press office in 1996&#150;97 was &#163;1,229,000. This does not include the cost of the then separate Prison Service Media Relations Unit, for which no detailed central records exist. The costs for the year 2001&#150;02 were &#163;2,415,606 including a cost of &#163;358,399 for media relations for the Prison Service, now integrated into the Home Office press office.
<P>

<a name="20430w19.html_para0">Staff numbers increased when a 'breaking news' press team was established in 2000. This was one of the recommendations from the independent external consultants who carried out a review of the structure and operation of the press office in 1999. One of the benefits has been that media calls to the press office, one of the busiest in Whitehall, are now being answered within four rings 90 per cent. of the time. Previously there were occasions when up to 40 per cent. of media calls were being 'lost'.

 <i>[holding answer 24 April 2002]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has not met police representatives to discuss the drug policy in Brixton, but he has been following the progress of the Lambeth cannabis pilot very closely.

<P>

<a name="20430w21.html_para0">The Home Secretary recognises that it is important to address policing cannabis issues such as those raised by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation report, so as not only to bring consistency to policing practice on the streets but also to make the most effective use of police time.
<P>

<a name="20430w21.html_para1">I understand that the Metropolitan police are continuing their evaluation of the policy being operated in Lambeth to assess more accurately its precise impact. I further understand that the Metropolitan police have no plans to extend the operational pilot to other areas in advance of a full evaluation of all the issues being available.

 Currently there is one induction centre in Dover. Generally speaking asylum seekers requiring accommodation will spend approximately one week in the induction centre before being dispersed. Other asylum seekers requesting either subsistence only support or who do not require support will spend between one and two days at the centre. We are proposing to open further induction centres over the coming months close to major ports such as Heathrow and Gatwick and a small number in the regions. There is no ceiling on the number who can be accommodated in an induction centre but typically there are between 200 and 500 in the centre at any one time.
<P>

<a name="20430w21.html_para2">There are no accommodation centres at present but we intend to establish a number of these with a total capacity of 3,000 to accommodate a proportion of new asylum seekers from application through initial decision and any appeal. This will be taken forward on a trial basis. We have identified eight potential sites for accommodation centres. Six of these are in England, one in Scotland and one in Wales.

 The Social Security Fraud Act contains important new powers for the Department and local authorities to get information from organisations such as banks and utility companies to help in the fight against benefit fraud. These new powers come into effect from today and a revised Code of Practice has been laid before Parliament.




<P>
<P><I>30 Apr 2002 : Column 710W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20430w22.html_para0">Further sections of the Fraud Act are also brought into effect from today. These include new powers for the Department and local authorities to offer financial penalties to benefit offenders, on behalf of each other, as an alternative to prosecution, rather than each having to offer a separate penalty as was previously the case; and for the Department and local authorities to offer financial penalties to employers who collude with their staff in the commission of benefit offences, again as an alternative to prosecution.
<P>

<a name="20430w22.html_para1">These new measures should send out a strong message to all benefit cheats and would-be cheats, and those who collude with them, that we are on to them. From today, the odds on getting away with it have lengthened.

 <i>[holding answer 19 April 2002]:</i> The voluntary sector is a key partner in the Departments efforts to help people back into work, particularly those facing the greatest disadvantages. Organisations in the voluntary sector receive funding under contract to the Department for delivering a range of our employment and training programmes, including for example elements of the New Deal. We also have key relationships with, and make grants to, the voluntary sector in: helping people with disabilities to live more independently in the community; providing mobility related assistance; and free help and advice to members of the public regarding their company, stakeholder or personal pension scheme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20430w22.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 We have no plans to introduce proposals requiring employers to contribute to a joint insurance policy to underwrite employees pension schemes. Compulsory mutual insurance to support the pension fund of an insolvent company was among the options considered when we consulted on the future of the minimum funding requirement in September 2000, but it received little support. Such an arrangement could lead to schemes neglecting their obligations knowing that their liabilities would still be met in the event of insolvency. Many employers sponsoring well-funded schemes would object to subsidising firms which neglected their obligations.

<a name="20430w22.html_para3">Pension schemes are set up voluntarily by employers for the benefit of their workforce, and the financial commitment this involves means they have a legitimate interest in the running of the scheme. Where decisions made by trustees have a direct implication for the financial position of the employer, it is understandable and right that the employer wants to be part of that decision making process.

 The public spending system introduced in 1998 provides three-year budgets for departments and allows underspends in one year to be carried over to the following year. Budgets are linked to targets for results set out in Public Service Agreements. This encourages departments to plan their budgets over a longer timeframe and reduces the incentive to spend wastefully at the end of the year.

 The Inland Revenue does not hold information about how many businesses use or have access to computer hardware that may be updated to allow businesses to submit end of year returns to the Inland Revenue electronically. However, businesses do not need to own a computer to submit their PAYE end of year returns electronically. It is a key part of the strategy in Patrick Carter's report to encourage small employers to use the services of intermediaries if they find that more helpful than personally handling the completion and submission of their returns. Employers who wish to complete and submit their own returns can use PAYE online forms which are accessible from the Inland Revenue's website using any Internet connected computer, including those available in libraries and Internet cafes.

These figures are likely to underestimate the true mortality related to hepatitis C for several reasons. Firstly, because the certifying doctor may not always know about the existence of a hepatitis C infection, contracted many years earlier, that had given rise to another fatal liver disease. Secondly, where several other factors (e.g. alcohol, other blood-borne viruses) contributed to fatal chronic liver disease, the certifying doctor may judge that one of the other factors is more important. And finally, because deaths with an underlying cause of primary liver cancer are not included here, even if certified as being the result of hepatitis C infection. This is because international coding rules in use at the time (ICD-9) do not accept cancers being due to infections, except in the case of HIV/AIDS.

 The cost of the reduction in VED for vans meeting euro IV emissions standard from March 2003 is given in table A.1 (page 155) of the FSBR. The cost of the freeze for all vans first registered after 1 March 2001, which are recorded in the light goods vehicle class is negligible.

 As part of Skills for Life, our national strategy for improving adult literacy and numeracy skills, pathfinder areas were established in September 2001 to pilot a range of approaches including financial incentives for learners and fixed rate replacement costs for employers to release low skilled staff for training. In addition, the Employment Service, now Jobcentre Plus, has recently completed piloting alternative approaches to identify and meet the literacy, language and numeracy skills needs of jobseekers. These pilots included the use of financial incentives. Evaluations of all these approaches are currently underway.

 Approximately 400 brewers will benefit from the equivalent of 50 per cent. on the first 5,000 hectolitres they produce. The scheme will therefore apply to 90 per cent. of licensed brewers, responsible for around 2 per cent. of the beer produced in the UK last year.

 Improving the opportunities for victims of anti-competitive practices to gain redress is a key theme of the Enterprise Bill (introduced to the House of Commons on 26 March 2002).
<P>

<a name="20430w28.html_para2">The Bill will enable those harmed by anti-competitive practices to follow a decision establishing a breach of competition law with a claim for damages before a specialist competition body&#151;the Competition Appeal Tribunal. The tribunal offers the advantages of being a quicker and more streamlined route for consumers and businesses to obtain redress from companies that have broken the law. In addition, representative bodies will be able to bring claims for damages in front of the tribunal on behalf of groups of named consumers, thus helping consumers obtain redress where a large number of parties have each suffered a relatively small level of harm.

 My noble Friend the Minister for Science and Innovation has today announced the outcome of the Second Stage of the Quinquennial Review of the Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils (CCLRC).
<P>

<a name="20430w29.html_para2">The first stage of the review recommended that the second stage of the review should focus on the issues associated with the implementation of a strategic

<P><I>30 Apr 2002 : Column 738W</I><P>
ownership model, to encourage collective ownership by the user research councils of CCLRC's large facilities, addressing in particular the implications for the status of CCLRC and its accountability to Ministers and Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20430w29.html_para3">The second stage of the review has been led by the chief executive of the CCLRC, Professor John Wood and conducted under the guidance an external review board chaired by Sir Peter Williams, and the Office of Science and Technology. The review has been conducted in accordance with the latest Cabinet Office guidance and Cabinet Office and Treasury officials have had an opportunity to comment on the draft report and its recommendations.
<P>

<a name="20430w29.html_para4">The principal recommendation is that for its core business the CCLRC should remain a non-departmental public body (NDPB) and a research council. In addition, CCLRC should be given a strategic role, as identified in stage one, to act as a national focus for large facilities for neutron scattering, synchrotron radiation and high power lasers on behalf of the research councils UK. Further, it should also co-ordinate the development for research councils UK of policies and strategies for the provision of access by UK scientists to leading edge large-scale facilities in these scientific areas, both nationally and internationally. The co-ordination and provision of strategic advice would be carried out separately from the day-to-day operation of CCLRC owned facilities.
<P>

<a name="20430w29.html_para5">There should be a common scheme for access to the large facilities for researchers sponsored by all the research councils. For those proposals that successfully undergo competitive peer review, there will be a "free at the point of access" arrangement.
<P>

<a name="20430w29.html_para6">CCLRC's funding arrangements should alter so that CCLRC receives direct funding from the Office of Science and Technology for providing, operating, maintaining, developing and upgrading its large facilities and their instrumentation. This would be on the basis that, a rolling medium term plan for the operational requirements of the large facilities be prepared by CCLRC and endorsed by research councils UK. This arrangement would ensure that the chief executive of CCLRC as accounting officer is clearly and visibly accountable for the value for money of all aspects of the delivery of science from these large facilities. In addition, there will be an external review of CCLRC's cost base and financial processes in advance of the changes to the funding arrangements.
<P>

<a name="20430w29.html_para7">I warmly welcome these recommendations and offer my thanks to Professor Wood and the review board.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20430w29.html_spnew9"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 Implementing the age strand of the Employment Framework Directive (2000&#150;78) is a significant undertaking and we need to allow time to get it right. Unlike sexual orientation and religion, differences of treatment on the grounds of age are capable of objective justification under the Directive in certain circumstances. The Directive itself acknowledges that age is more complex than the other strands by allowing a longer time to implement&#151;2006 instead of 2003.
<P>

<a name="20430w29.html_para11">There are significant practical issues to be worked through in consultation with employers, particularly small businesses and others that may be affected. We want to ensure we implement age legislation sensibly.
<P>

<a name="20430w29.html_para12">We have already undertaken widespread consultation to identify what age-related practices employers have and why they might need to retain them.

 Bidders in the competition for a strategic sealift service were invited to tender on the basis of a crewing option that they considered would offer best value for money and to provide details that would facilitate an assessment of sponsored reserve crewing of all six ships. AWSR initially expected to be using sponsored reserve crews on the six ships when they were in Ministry of Defence use, with British officers and multinational crews when the ships were on commercial work. Negotiations with AWSR in 2001 were able to take account of the implications and benefits of the Government's "British Shipping Charting a New Course" which had been published the previous year. As a result, when working for MOD ships will be manned by British crews who will be eligible to be called out as sponsored reserves and, although not mandated by MOD, British crews will man the ships being used in commercial trade.

 <i>[holding answer 25 April 2002]:</i> The Army and the RAF latest continuous attitude surveys include over 200 questions each, while the Royal Navy survey has over a hundred. The questions are on a wide variety of subjects with the following broad categories: personal circumstances; quality of life; job satisfaction; career development; operational tours and postings; pay and allowances; accommodation; welfare; families; facilities; communication and equal opportunities. The questions are structured around the Armed Forces Overarching Personnel Strategy; however, they are not fixed and are varied to determine attitudes to particular conditions of service.
<P>

<a name="20430w30.html_para4">Each of the three services has conducted its own continuous attitude surveys of serving personnel since the 1980s. The Royal Navy conducts surveys three times per year, the Army twice yearly and the Royal Air Force conducts surveys quarterly.
<P>

<a name="20430w30.html_para5">Each survey is designed to ascertain the attitude of personnel towards a range of service conditions and to gather intentions with regard to their remaining in the service. Senior staff and policy makers use the information gathered to identify which policies are seen to be working and inform subsequent policy development work. The three services also periodically survey spouses of serving personnel to gather evidence on the effects of service life on families.

<P>
<a name="20430w32.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 There are currently 17 different separate licensed anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs which can be used in a variety of combinations. Moreover, different countries use different types of drugs and treatments to help treat people living with HIV/AIDS.
<P>

<a name="20430w32.html_para0">The retail cost of all three classes of drugs in developed countries averages between $10,000 and $14,000 per year. Costa Rica has negotiated a price equivalent to $7,000 per patient per year for ARV. Nigeria has launched the largest ARV treatment programme in Africa, using a generic form of ARV at a cost of $350 per patient per year. In Brazil, where some ARV drugs are produced locally, triple combination therapy costs $1,460 per patient per year, whereas in Thailand the cost of triple combination therapy is over $4,100 per patient per year. In addition to drugs costs there are laboratory monitoring costs (estimated at around US$400 per annum in Uganda) and other associated service delivery costs.
<P>

<a name="20430w32.html_para1">My Department is working with the international community to facilitate a framework for differential pricing, which would provide essential medicines to the developing world at substantially lower cost. However, the cost of ARV represents only part of the cost of treatment for people living with HIV. For example, an essential pre-requisite to any programme to increase access to medicines is widespread availability of voluntary counselling and testing. Adequate access to treatment for opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, is also crucial. Furthermore, building capacity to use ARVs effectively cannot be achieved overnight, and will require substantial and sustained investment in health systems to reduce resistance to the drugs and to maximise the utility of the drugs in the short and long term.

 DFID have no solar panels installed on our buildings. Options for utilising renewable energy resources were studied in 2000&#150;01. Solar panels were not appropriate or viable due to the configurations and locations of our two main UK offices. The studies showed that subject to planning permission, a wind turbine should be investigated for our East Kilbride office. This work, looking at location and wind regimes, is on-going.

<P>
<a name="20430w33.html_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The provision and maintenance of water, transport and energy infrastructure underpins much of what we do to eliminate poverty and encourage pro-poor economic growth. In all programmes we will try to include an element of strengthening and training into the institutions which provide the engineering services. Our Knowledge and Research programmes regularly look at projects which try to improve the technical standards and the quality of decision making for the engineering profession in developing countries.
<P>

<a name="20430w33.html_para0">However more specifically the Strengthening Professional Engineering Associations Project (SPEAP) has been using the Institution of Civil Engineers to study the particular needs of the engineering profession in Bangladesh, India, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Nepal, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Uganda.
<P>

<a name="20430w33.html_para1">Infrastructure services consume a very large proportion of public funds in developing countries. The rationale for the project lies in the recognition that poor quality engineering often leads to the inefficient use of those funds and the rapid deterioration of facilities. Earthquake disasters result in loss of life which could be mostly avoided by implementation of simple engineering good practice. As we move away from donor supervised project level support towards budget and sectoral support the quality of local professional services becomes increasingly critical. A strengthened profession will help to maintain higher standards and improve decision making to the benefit of the whole community.




<P>
<P><I>30 Apr 2002 : Column 752W</I><P>

<a name="20430w33.html_para2">The project will also address the impact of strengthened professional standards on professional integrity and corruption and look at the potential impact of the GATS 2000 decisions in respect of the worldwide trade in engineering services.

There was no significant difference in the rates of bowel problems or regression in those who had had MMR vaccine before onset of problems, after onset or who had never had the vaccine. In addition the proportion of autistic children with regression or bowel problems did not change significantly over the period from 1979&#150;98, which included the introduction of MMR in 1988.

<a name="20430w35.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The changes to the process by which the legal status of a medicine is changed (introduced on 1 April 2002), are designed to speed and streamline the procedures, halving the time taken to deliver a change from application to decision, while maintaining appropriate safeguards.
<P>

<a name="20430w35.html_para0">The changes to the process do not impact on the liability for a product. Where the liability for the use of a product lies will vary according to the circumstances of each individual case but will be the same for products with an existing legal status as for those which have been newly reclassified.
<P>

<a name="20430w35.html_para1">Patient safety remains paramount and any application to consider a change of legal status for a particular medicine will continue to require an applicant to demonstrate its safety in use, including without medical supervision, and that the patient information is suitable for the medicine to be made more widely available.
<P>

<a name="20430w35.html_para2">Making more medicines more widely available when it is safe to do so is a key part of the national health service objective to empower patients. Many patients are expert on their own conditions and early access to treatments for known conditions can have a significant public health benefit where early intervention would not otherwise be possible.

<a name="20430w35.html_spnew3"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2002]:</i> Waiting times for radiotherapy treatments are not collected centrally. The NHS Cancer Plan set out maximum waiting time targets for first definitive cancer treatment which will come into effect over the next few years. Arrangements to monitor these targets are currently being put in place and will cover radiotherapy where this is the first treatment.

<P><I>30 Apr 2002 : Column 761W</I><P>

<a name="20430w35.html_para5">From December 2001, there is a one month maximum wait from diagnosis to first treatment for breast cancer and a one month wait from urgent general practitioner referral to first treatment for children's, testicular and acute leukaemia. By 2005, there will be a maximum one month wait from diagnosis to first treatment for all cancers. Monitoring of these targets is being introduced and figures will be published as the targets apply.

 The Department has made no specific estimate of the prevalence of foetal alcohol syndrome in England and Wales, although the World Health Organisation estimates an incidence of between 0.33 and 9.7 per 1,000 live births in a range of countries. The risks of excessive drinking during pregnancy are well documented, and for this reason the Government recommend that women who are pregnant or who are trying to become pregnant do not drink more than one to two units of alcohol per week.
<P>

<a name="20430w35.html_para7">In 2000&#150;01, foetal alcohol syndrome was reported in 38 birth records on the Hospital Episode Statistics System (HES), representing 0.07 cases per 1,000 births.

<P>

<a name="20430w36.html_para4">Since the circular was published, research into intermediate care has been commissioned, and there is a growing body of evidence from local evaluations. The Commission for Health Improvement, Social Services Inspectorate, and the National Care Standards Commission (and their successor bodies, announced in "Delivering the NHS Plan") all have a role in evaluating the quality of intermediate care services in various settings.

 The NHS Plan announced extra investment of &#163;900 million annually by 2003&#150;04 for intermediate care and related services to promote independence.

 <i>[holding answer 18 April 2002]:</i> The Health Survey for England 2000 reported that 45 per cent. of men were overweight and 21 per cent. obese, and 34 per cent. of women were overweight and 21 per cent. obese.
<P>

<a name="20430w37.html_para0">The Health Survey for England 1995&#150;97 reported that 22 per cent. of six-year-olds and 31 per cent. of 15-year-olds are overweight. The prevalence of obesity ranges from 10 per cent. at age six years to 17 per cent. at age 15 years.
<P>

<a name="20430w37.html_para1">The National Audit Office publication 'Tackling Obesity in England' reported that in 1998 30,000 deaths (of which 9,000 were before the age of 65 years) were attributable to obesity. There is an estimated direct cost to the national health service (NHS) of at least &#163;0.5 billion a year, or about 1.5 per cent. of NHS expenditure. There is also an estimated direct cost of &#163;2 billion a year to the wider economy.
<P>

<a name="20430w37.html_para2">Obesity is a complex condition, but is largely preventable through addressing the risk factors of diet and physical inactivity. The Government are committed to tackling this rising trend in obesity and are taking positive steps to improve prevention, treatment and management of obesity through the NHS Plan, Cancer Plan and national service frameworks.
<P>

<a name="20430w37.html_para3">We have put in place cross-Government work and local action is under way to promote physical activity and healthy eating and tackle overweight and obesity. Specifically, these include a national school fruit scheme, a wider five-a-day programme to increase access to and consumption of fruit and vegetables and work with industry to improve overall balance in diet, including salt, fat and diet. Among children, there has been significant investment in primary physical education (PE) and sports facilities, including &#163;581 million from the new opportunities fund for a PE and sports programme.
<P>

<a name="20430w37.html_para4">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has provided guidance on the anti-obesity drugs orlistat and sibutramine for the NHS. Treatment with these drugs will be supported by advice, support and counselling on diet, physical activity and behavioural strategies. NICE are also reviewing surgical interventions to treat morbid obesity, the findings of which are expected in summer 2002. Referral to NICE of further guidance topics remains under consideration.
<P>

<a name="20430w37.html_para5">We welcomed the Public Accounts Committee report on 'Tackling Obesity in England', published in January 2002, the official response to which was published on 21 March 2002 and has been placed in the Library.
