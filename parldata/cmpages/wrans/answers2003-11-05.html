<a name="31105w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Prisk: </B> 
To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners what study has been made of the impact of increases in stamp duty land tax on the commercial holdings of the Church of England; and if he will make a statement.  [135607]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31105w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bell: </B> 
 No such study has been made in respect of the Church Commissioners' commercial property investment portfolio. I understand that changes to this tax come into effect on 1 December 2003: whether or not these will have an impact upon the amount of rent tenants will offer for new leases remains to be seen. The Commissioners take independent professional advice regarding the rental values of their properties and these are reviewed regularly.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) when she will publish guidance to those wishing to dedicate their land as access land under section 16 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000;  [135813]

(3) what measures she will take to encourage public bodies to dedicate suitable landholdings as access land under section 16 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000;  [135815]

<P>
(5) what measures she has taken to inform other Government Departments about the possibilities of dedicating land as access land under section 16 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000; and what response there has been.  [135817]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31105w01.html_spnew3"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 I expect to publish guidance and model dedication instruments for those wishing to dedicate their land by the beginning of December 2003. I have discussed with the Forestry Commission what funds might be needed to ensure that they are able to meet their commitment on dedication of their freehold estate.
<P>

<a name="31105w01.html_para0">We are developing a strategy for promoting dedication to landowners, which will highlight the benefits of dedication, including the reduced liability that owners will incur and the opportunities to realise the potential that increasing visitor numbers has on the rural economy. This will build on the work undertaken by the Forestry Commission in 2001 when it ran seminars to encourage dedication by woodland owners.
<P>

<a name="31105w01.html_para1">I wrote to Ministers in all Departments in February 2002 about the scope for dedication of land held by Government Departments and sponsored non-departmental public bodies. I have also pursued this point with some commercial organisations that are significant landowners. Now that the dedication regulations have been laid, I will be following this correspondence up, not least to encourage all Government Departments to actively consider the extent to which their landholdings can be dedicated under section 16 and to ensure that the option is widely understood by private sector landowners.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what arrangements she intends to put in place to improve the opportunity for United Kingdom dairy farmers to compete in European and global markets.  [134377]

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31105w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We are helping the UK dairy sector to compete better in European and global markets by promoting supply chain efficiency. My noble Friend Lord Whitty, has been chairing the Dairy Supply Chain Forum to consider, among other issues, ways in which the sector can improve its efficiency through collaborative action, and we have made a grant of nearly &#163;0.5 million to the Food Chain Centre to study how the efficiency of the dairy supply chain might be improved. We have also supported the establishment of English Food and Farming Practices, a new industry-led body that has been set up specifically to support and encourage collective activity across all agricultural sectors. In addition to this, we are actively considering bringing decoupling forward to 2005 to give dairy farmers the freedom to restructure their businesses for the more competitively market orientated environment. Furthermore, the Milk Development Council has been working with Food from Britain to identify potential export markets for UK dairy products.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31105w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Hayes: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what discussions she has had with representatives from the dairy industry on the dispute over the price per litre of milk paid to liquid milk producers.  [134380]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31105w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Price negotiations between producers and processors, or processors and supermarkets, are a private commercial matter in which the Government cannot and should not get involved, as long as competition rules are respected. While the Government share producers' concerns over the low farmgate price of milk, they do not support protests.
<P>

<a name="31105w01.html_para2">The Secretary of State has had no formal meetings with representatives of the dairy industry to discuss milk prices or the current protests. However, Ministers frequently meet with representatives from all parts of the dairy sector and are therefore aware of the issues. In addition, matters affecting the whole dairy supply chain are regularly discussed at the forum chaired by my noble Friend Lord Whitty.

<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what the outcome was of the Environment Council on 27 October 2003; what the Government's stance was on the issues discussed, including their voting record; and if she will make a statement;  [135372]
<P>
<UL>(2) if she will make a statement on the issues discussed in the meeting of the EU Environment Council on 27 October 2003.  [136016]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31105w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I represented the UK at the Environment Council on 27 October 2003. The Council reached a political agreement on one legislative measure, and also considered a number of other important issues.
<P>

<a name="31105w01.html_para3">The Council reached a political agreement on a Directive on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in paints. This measure aims to reduce emissions from paints of these organic solvents, which are precursors of ground-level ozone which can be harmful to human health and the environment. We retained a reservation on the proposal as parliamentary scrutiny is not yet

complete. Greece asked for further time to implement limits for decorative paints and varnishes, but its request was turned down.
<P>

<a name="31105w01.html_para4">The Council agreed conclusions on the Commission's proposed structural indicators for reporting on progress on employment, innovation, economic reform, social cohesion and environmental protection to the spring European Council. There was general support for the proposed set of 14 headline indicators of which three would be environment-related. Some delegations proposed including new indicators on biodiversity and public health. I stressed the importance of using robust and meaningful indicators. I pointed out that any biodiversity indicator should be able to measure progress towards the EU's target of halting loss of biodiversity by 2010, for example, along the lines of an index proposed by Birdlife International. The current proposal, on protected areas, was not adequate. The Council agreed that the three proposed environment-related indicators, on climate change, energy intensity and transport, should be reformulated in order to focus on the most significant environmental impacts and that good quality indicators on biodiversity and health should be included as soon as possible so as to cover all of the priority areas identified in the EU sustainable development strategy.
<P>

<a name="31105w01.html_para5">The Council agreed conclusions on the Commission's proposal for a European strategy on environment and health. This strategy is intended to reduce the disease burden caused by environmental factors in the EU, to identify and prevent new health threats caused by new environmental factors. We also agreed conclusions on the Commission's proposal for an integrated product policy, aimed at reducing the environmental impacts that arise in the supply chain and life-cycle of products.
<P>

<a name="31105w01.html_para6">The Presidency noted a presentation from the Commission on the results of its public consultation on a legislative proposal for an EU chemicals strategy. The Council also noted a presentation from the Commission on proposals for implementing the provisions of the Aarhus Convention in the EC and on access to justice in environmental matters. We heard a report from Sweden on a ministerial conference they had hosted on environment and sustainable development in northern Europe, and the Commission circulated a report on progress on thematic strategies under the 6th Environment Action programme. Portugal gave a presentation about the devastating forest fires they had experienced this summer, stressing the importance of tackling this issue for the future.
<P>

<a name="31105w01.html_para7">Belgium and France gave short presentations calling for member states' co-operation to reduce ozone levels. The Commission indicated its readiness to help and drew attention to existing measures that might facilitate co-operation and exchange of information.
<P>

<a name="31105w01.html_para8">Belgium presented a short paper on decommissioning of ships, expressing concern in particular about the export of vessels to developing countries for disposal. I supported Belgium's concerns, stressing the need to ensure that first class and environmentally sound dismantling facilities are available in the EU.
<P>

<a name="31105w01.html_para9">The Commission then called upon member states to support a protocol on sustainable development to the Treaty being considered by the Inter-Governmental Conference.

<P>

<a name="31105w01.html_para10">We also discussed preparations for the 9th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP9) and the Kyoto project mechanisms. After an exchange of views, we agreed to reconvene on 8 December 2003, immediately preceding COP9, to discuss the outstanding issues.

<P>
<a name="31105w02.html_wqn0"><B> Alan Simpson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what spray density in litres per hectare was used in the GM maize farmscale evaluation programme; and what spray density she expects will be used if commercial cultivation of GM maize goes ahead.  [136609]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31105w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The recommended individual and maximum permitted application rates of the herbicide glufosinate-ammonium used on GM maize in the farm-scale evaluations were defined by the conditions of the simulated product licence that formed part of the experimental pesticide approval. This specified a maximum permitted rate of eight litres per hectare and a recommended individual rate of four litres per hectare, depending on the weeds present and their growth stage. Application was permitted until the nine-leaf stage of maize. For further details, and for details of other non-herbicide sprays used, see Champion et al. 2003; "Crop Management and Agronomic Context of the Farm Scale Evaluations of Genetically Modified Herbicide Tolerant Crops"; Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society (B). 358 (1439): 1801&#150;18. A copy of this journal has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="31105w02.html_para0">Before glufosinate-ammonium could be used on a commercial scale on GM-maize, it would need full pesticide approval. In seeking approval, the necessary data package would have to be supplied by the applicant and be subjected to the considerations of human and environmental safety which have been established for all pesticide uses. Any approval given would specify recommended and maximum application rates in the same way as the experimental permit. These conditions would be determined by the Pesticide Safety Directorate taking due account of advice from their expert advisory committee the Advisory Committee on Pesticides.

 There is no statutory alcohol limit laid down for operating equipment on military bases in Scotland or elsewhere. Where military bases are served by public roads in the UK, the statutory alcohol limits imposed by the Road Traffic Act 1988 apply. If the military bases are not served by public roads, service personnel are subject to standing and local orders which regulate alcohol consumption. Personnel may be prosecuted under the Service Discipline Acts for being unfit for duty as a result of consuming excess alcohol or contravening orders. Commanding officers and the chain of command are very aware of the requirement to provide a safe working environment.

 Heathrow Airport lies within an Air Quality Management Area declared by adjacent local authorities. Various emissions sources may contribute to potential NO2 exceedances in 2010. In the vicinity of Heathrow Airport mitigation strategies could apply to aircraft, airside and road traffic sources, although general 'background' levels of NO2 are also a major contributor (as elsewhere). BAA plc is required to produce and review an Action Plan to minimise emissions from Heathrow Airport as a condition of the planning permission for the Fifth Terminal.

 Emissions from international aviation are not included in national targets under the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2008&#150;12). However, the Kyoto Protocol does require contracting parties to work through the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from international aviation. The Government are therefore working hard in ICAO to engage other countries in the climate change debate and to reduce emissions from aviation. Discussion on action beyond 2008&#150;12 will begin in 2005 when the Government will work closely with all Parties and argue strongly that the framework for global action after 2012 should address international aviation emissions.

 The Department has commissioned various studies into the correlation between vehicle speed and road accidents.

 The Transport Research Laboratory has been commissioned to investigate the reasons for the slowing down of the rate of decrease in road fatalities as part of their on-going work on monitoring the progress towards the 2010 casualty reduction target. It is a complex issue that demands in-depth analysis because there are different trends for different road user groups and for different accident types.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31105w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 One of our key road safety goals is to improve the standard of driving and our road safety strategy sets out a number of measures to achieve this. "Tomorrow's roads: safer for everyone", published in March 2000, is available in the Libraries of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31105w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The appearance of signs and markings, and conditions for their placing, are specified in the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2002 (SI 3113), which came into effect earlier this year. Guidance on good practice in the design and use of signs is given in the Traffic Signs Manual. An updated Chapter 7, on sign design, and Chapter 5, on road markings, will be published later this month. It is the responsibility of individual traffic authorities to ensure that signs and markings are used in conformity with the statutory requirements and Government guidance.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31105w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Department has made no such assessment. It is an offence for any vehicle not to stop at traffic signals when required to do so. Any cyclist or other road user who fails to comply with traffic signals is a danger to themselves and other road users.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31105w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Department has examined the case for a road tax on cyclists in the past. It would require a registration system like the one for motor vehicles and the costs of the system would certainly outweigh any benefits for enforcement of road traffic offences by cyclists. Moreover, increasing the costs of cycling would not support our policy of encouraging more people to consider cycling as a viable mode of transport and we have no plans to introduce such a tax.

<a name="31105w04.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Wray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what proposals he has to make the wearing of bicycle helmets compulsory when riding on roads; and if he will make a statement on their safety uses.  [136159]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31105w04.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 A study commissioned by the Department to look into the effectiveness of cycle helmets, published in November last year, found that overall, the evidence suggests that cycle helmets are effective at reducing the severity of brain and upper facial injuries for all ages, and especially children. This reinforces our view that we should encourage helmets to be worn by children.
<P>

<a name="31105w04.html_para0">A survey undertaken by the Transport Research Laboratory measuring wearing rates in 2002 found that the rate for all cyclists on built-up major roads was 25 per cent. The wearing rate is continuing to increase, with the exception of boys under 16 where the rate has reduced from 16 per cent. in 1994 to 12 per cent. in 2002. At these levels making helmets compulsory would cause enforcement difficulties and without greater public acceptance could have an effect on levels of cycling. We are making special efforts to persuade adolescents, and especially boys, to wear helmets. We will continue to monitor wearing rates by all ages and review the option of compulsory wearing from time to time.

 The UK Government remain fully committed to the rapid and full implementation of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative to ensure that it delivers a robust exit from unsustainable debt for the world's poorest countries. At present, 27 countries have reached Decision Point and have started to receive interim relief. Of these countries, eight have reached Completion Point and are now also receiving irrevocable debt relief.
<P>

<a name="31105w05.html_para4">In the September 2003 publication "Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative: Status of Implementation", the staffs of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) provided an update on progress under the Initiative and new estimates of costs. This document is available on both the World Bank and the IMF websites. Table 9 in the document sets out the status of delivery of assistance by the World Bank. Under the original and enhanced HIPC Initiatives, the World Bank has made total debt service reduction commitments of US$12.4 billion and has delivered $2.5 billion.

<a name="31105w05.html_para5">Table 11 sets out the status of delivery of assistance by the IMF. Under the original and enhanced HIPC Initiatives, the IMF has made total debt service reduction commitments of SDR &#163;1.8 billion (approximately $1.3 billion) and has disbursed SDR &#163;1 billion (approximately $740 million). The Special Drawing Right (SDR) serves as the unit of account of the IMF and is allocated to member countries in proportion to their IMF quotas.
<P>

<a name="31105w05.html_para6">The UK has provided commitments of around &#163;2 billion of debt relief to eligible HIPC countries and has pledged a total of $474 million through the multilateral institutions to further support the initiative. The UK is committed to providing 100 per cent. relief for eligible HIPC countries, and calls for all bilateral, multilateral and commercial creditors to participate in the Initiative.
<P>

<a name="31105w05.html_para7">The HIPC Initiative has an important role to play in maximising the resources available for poverty reduction in developing countries. However, unless there is an increase in the volume of resources available from donors to poor countries, additional debt relief would simply reallocate resources from one form of financing to another, and from non-HIPC poor countries to HIPC countries, without adding to the overall financing available for poverty reduction. Furthermore all HIPC countries would still need additional aid to meet the Millennium Development Goals even if all of their debt from the World Bank and IMF were forgiven. That is why the UK's proposal for an International Finance Facility is so important. It can provide the much-needed substantial increase in

 The Governments of Central Asia established the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS) in the early nineties; an interstate mechanism for developing and centrally funding regional environmental and research activity aimed at improving the environmental situation in the Aral Sea region. Although the established mechanism provides for an operational framework to generate international assistance, in practice the IFAS has failed to become a functioning institution with a strong regional environmental remit. The failure is attributed to a number of factors but chiefly by the general lack of enthusiasm by the governments in the region to cooperate on practical issues.
<P>

<a name="31105w06.html_para2">A $12 million Water and Environmental Management Project financed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), managed by an Executing Agency of IFAS, has a component to develop longer term, sustainable regional and national water management strategies; to replace the current system of annual ad hoc water allocation and distribution arrangements which is slowly breaking down. This strategy will help to develop strategic choices at the river basin level such as water allocation between and within the five states, cost sharing for operations, maintenance, rehabilitation and improvement of the existing infrastructure. The UK contributes to the GEF and last year DFID provided an additional contribution of &#163;15 million to the third replenishment.

 For information on how much electricity and other energy DFID has used in each year since 1997 I refer the hon. Member to the answer given by the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Mr. Bradshaw) on 4 November 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 403W.

<a name="31105w06.html_para3">Forecasts of future consumption are still in the process of being developed. We have occupied our 1 Palace Street building for less than two years and a reliable baseline is only now emerging. Similarly, our East Kilbride office is undergoing extensive refurbishment and extension that will completely alter the energy consumption picture there, and our subsidiary London office is being vacated in 2004 so is excluded from future predictions. However the Department's aim is to reduce its energy consumption in accordance with Government targets, and to this end the London and East Kilbride refurbishments include such features as energy-efficient boilers, low-energy light bulbs and tubes, and, where appropriate, movement sensors instead of light switches to ensure that lights are not left on unnecessarily in unoccupied rooms. The offices have also had their computer monitors replaced throughout with low-energy flat screens. In addition, the London office electricity supply has been 100 per cent. from renewable sources since July 2002, while from this month the new supply contract for East Kilbride is

<P><I>5 Nov 2003 : Column 654W</I><P>
10 per cent. renewable (the maximum available there). Also at East Kilbride, a feasibility study for an on-site wind turbine is currently under way. The staff Green Awareness programme includes an energy section and a computer switch-off campaign backed up by monthly monitoring and feedback.

<a name="31105w06.html_para4">DFID is committed to the Government's Sustainable Development Framework and Targets, which include an Energy component, and is developing an Environmental Management System based on ISO 14001 in order to deliver these. Building management systems incorporate energy reduction elements; consumption is monitored monthly and any undue increases investigated.

For any of these programmes to be implemented successfully they need to involve government, education, health, agriculture, civil society and the private sector and this is the approach the UK promotes.

 DFID did not receive any request for assistance from the Government of Orissa, nor any NGO for the floods in year 2003. However, Care India utilised &#163;25,000 for flood relief from an on-going DFID supported drought relief project of &#163;1.5 million. It was encouraging to note that Government of Orissa was well equipped and organised to manage the flood relief.

 DFID's current policy of channelling a high proportion of its funds for Humanitarian Demining via United Nations Agencies is currently being reviewed. This will be the first formal review of the policy. The UN agencies have a mixed record of success in their various roles; in particular the role of global co-ordination and the management of field operations could be improved.

 The World Food Programme (WFP) have agreed with all their implementing partners a protocol for reporting irregularities, and in particular political interference, in relation to the distribution of donor-funded food aid, which accounts for the large majority of food being distributed in Zimbabwe this year. This information is shared with donors and implementing partners. We believe that, so long as there is no damage to the effectiveness of international humanitarian operations in Zimbabwe, the UN should also make this information available publicly. We and other donors are discussing this with the UN as part of the present review of the UN's Relief and Recovery Unit (RRU).

However, some local non-Governmental Organisations do monitor food supplies, including those from GMB, and publish reports locally.

 New statutory rights to leave and pay for parents adopting a child came into effect on 6 April this year.

<P>

<a name="31105w09.html_para3">SMP is paid for the first six weeks at 90 per cent. of average earnings. This reflects the legal requirement that women take a period of compulsory maternity leave following the birth of a child. This is for their health and safety and that of their child. Offering a higher rate of SMP for the first six weeks recognises this and helps mothers to take that time off.

The survey does not contain a figure for the total number of incidents. Work on the 2004 Survey is under way, and the results will be published in April 2004.

 Negotiations are continuing. The Radiocommunications Agency is in regular discussion with its French counterpart about sharing spectrum for our respective analogue and digital TV coverage requirements. These negotiations are conditioned by internationally agreed arrangements, and spectrum planning methods, for determining equitable spectrum shares. The close proximity of the two countries and the heavy demand for frequencies on both sides of the Channel requires difficult and complicated technical discussions to maximise the use of spectrum in both countries in a way that minimises interference effects. In some cases, compromises are having to be made on both sides to deliver TV networks, such as mutual toleration of the risk of greater interference for longer periods than advised by the international planning rules.
<P>

<a name="31105w11.html_para0">We are still in negotiation with the French authorities on acceptable channels and transmitter powers for digital TV from the Dover and Bluebell Hill stations in conjunction with the French requests for frequencies (and transmitter powers) for their own networks.

<a name="31105w11.html_para8">The performance management system was introduced in 2003 and used for the first time for the 2002&#150;03 annual reviews. Partnerships reviewed their own performance and the results that they are starting to achieve.
<P>

<a name="31105w11.html_para9">The evidence provided in these reviews by the NDC Partnerships show that partnerships in the Merseyside and the north west are beginning to make an impact in reducing crime, creating jobs and raising standards in education. For example:

In Salford, the gap between the proportion of pupils getting five or more GCSEs at grades A to C narrowed from 12 per cent. to 8 per cent. in 2002&#150;03.
<P>
<BR>
In east Manchester, the percentage of the working age population who are in employment has risen from 52 per cent.to 65 per cent., which exceeded the city average in 2002&#150;03.

 Government proposals for regulating occupational pension schemes are set out in the documents "Simplifying the taxation of pensions: increasing choice and flexibility for all" (December 2002) and "Working and Saving for Retirement: Action on Occupational Pensions" (June 2003) Cm 5835. These do not contain specific proposals regarding contribution holidays.

But in any event, no such powers are superseded by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000: generally speaking, existing powers make provision relating to compelling production of information (subject to various safeguards) in different contexts and in a wide variety of statutory regimes. Such existing statutory powers could not be used to compel disclosure of communications data in the sense for which the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 provides.

 The Department has provided &#163;2.6 million to Cancer Research UK to fund their 'Death Repackaged' campaign. This awareness raising campaign was launched in September 2003, to highlight the dangers of terms 'light' and 'mild' on cigarette packs.
<P>

<a name="31105w14.html_para0">The Department does not allocate funds directly to charities for research. We spent an estimated &#163;83.8 million on cancer research in 2000&#150;01. Over 75 per cent. of this expenditure is devolved to the national health service, largely to meet the additional patient care costs associated with research. These costs cover items such as extra scans for diagnosis or monitoring of treatment, extra blood tests, extra in-patient days and extra nursing attention. This support allows work funded by the research councils and charities, including Cancer Research UK, to be conducted within the NHS.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the total cost of PFI-based capital investment in the NHS in London has been since 1997; and what revenue costs were incurred on an annual basis to service the financing facilities.  [133747]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31105w14.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 For private finance initiative (PFI) schemes with a capital value greater than &#163;10 million, the total capital cost of PFI-based investment in the four new London strategic health authorities since 1997 is &#163;975,900,000. The capital value of PFI schemes is defined as: total capital cost to the private sector including the costs of land, construction, equipment and professional fees but excluding value added tax, rolled up interest and financing costs. As PFI procures a service, rather than the underlying asset, capital values are necessarily estimates.
<P>

<a name="31105w14.html_para1">Unitary payments on a PFI scheme&#151;paid for from a trust's general revenue allocations&#151;include elements for 'hard' and 'soft' facilities management services as well as financing costs. A partial breakdown of the unitary costs for schemes with a capital value exceeding &#163;20 million is held centrally. This shows the split between 'availability' and 'services' where 'availability' includes costs attributable to 'hard' facilities management and financing, but does not distinguish further. To collect this information would mean reviewing the financial models for all these schemes which would incur disproportionate costs.
<P>

<a name="31105w14.html_para2">Unitary payments on PFI schemes become payable when the scheme becomes operational. The first to do so was Queen Mary's hospital, Sidcup, which took its first patient at the end of March 2000; the most recent to open was St. George's in September 2003.

<a name="31105w14.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 National minimum standards relating to room sizes in pre-existing care homes (that is, a care home which existed before April 2002) were relaxed in June 2003. The change means that pre-existing care homes which do not already meet certain of the standards introduced in April 2002 will no longer be expected to make physical changes to the home to do so.
<P>

<a name="31105w14.html_para3">The Government has no plans to provide direct financial assistance to care homes to meet any of the standards. Care homes are independent businesses and any changes to meet standards should be viewed as 'upgrading' the service being provided.

<a name="31105w14.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 From 8 April 2003, there has been a duty placed on local councils to make direct payments to those who choose to receive them. The Government have also established the direct payments development fund. This will provide &#163;9 million over three years to national, regional and local voluntary organisations in partnership with local councils. This is a substantial investment in direct payments support services, key to improving access to direct payments. Increasing the take up of direct payments will contribute to the overall assessment of each council's performance that is made each year.

 The European Directive on the conduct of clinical trials was adopted in February 2001. The main aim of the Directive is to simplify and harmonise procedures across the Community while ensuring the protection of trial subjects and providing a

safe environment for the development of new medicines. member states are required to fully implement the Directive by 1 May 2004.
<P>

<a name="31105w14.html_para4">The scope of the Directive is wide and the United Kingdom Regulations will apply to all clinical trials on medicinal products for human use conducted in the UK, including academic and healthy volunteer studies, with the exception of non-interventional trials.
<P>

<a name="31105w14.html_para5">Because the Directive makes no distinction between commercial and non-commercial publicly or charitably funded clinical trials, they cannot be treated differently in the UK implementing regulations. However those drafting the Directive recognised the special position of non-commercial trials conducted by researchers without the participation of the pharmaceutical industry. The Government has taken steps to attempt to influence the Commission in its consideration of a Commission Directive on good clinical practice and also in reviewing guidance that the Commission published earlier this year with a view to avoiding any unnecessary regulatory requirements and costs.
<P>

<a name="31105w14.html_para6">In responding to concerns, and to provide an environment in which patients are protected but high quality research is not inhibited, my noble Friend Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Health, invited the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Academy of Medical Sciences to co-ordinate a report on the impact of the Directive on academic studies. The impact assessment, prepared by the MRC with the active support of others including Cancer Research UK, the National Co-ordinating Centre for Health Technology Assessment and a number of academic experts formed the basis for a response to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) consultation on the draft regulations to implement the Directive into UK law earlier this year.
<P>

<a name="31105w14.html_para7">The MHRA is giving careful consideration to legislation and guidance linked to these issues. For example, they are considering the acceptability of different approaches to monitoring the validity of trial data that are less labour intensive and expensive than those usually used in commercial trials. The aim is the use of appropriate quality systems proportionate to risk (thereby minimising increases in costs). A list of responses to frequently asked questions are published on the MHRA website at www.mhra.gov in the Clinical Trials Directive pages, which will be kept updated.

 Custom-made dental appliances are manufactured to the written prescription of the dentist responsible for the case in question. The choice of manufacturing laboratory is a matter for local decision. All dental laboratories in the European Union are registered with the competent authority, which in the United Kingdom is the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.

<a name="31105w15.html_para0">Manufacturers of custom made appliances from outside the European Union are required to designate an authorised representative within the European Union, who must register with the competent authority where they have their registered place of business. The manufacturer must meet the relevant requirements of the Medical Devices Directive (93/42/EEC) and must meet the same standards as devices manufactured within the European Union.

 Most, if not all, primary care trusts will either directly provide or will commission services for people suffering from dysphasia.

Information is not available in sufficient detail centrally to show whether particular dysphasia services have received external funding.

<P>
<a name="31105w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 At 30 September 2002 (the latest published data), 51,522,391 people were recorded as registered with a general practitioner or provider of personal medical services. The table provides details by strategic health authority (SHA). It is not possible to express these figures accurately as a percentage of total population as the phenomenon of "list inflation" means that registered populations are typically larger than actual populations. This phenomenon arises where a patient moves his or her registration and for a transitional period may be registered on two lists. Similarly, an individual who dies or moves abroad may remain on a list for a time.

The measures include a proposal to exempt from the current restrictions applications from pharmacies which intend to open more than 100 hours a week, provided they provide a full and prescribed range of services, appropriate to local needs, determined by the NHS primary care trust.

 The responsibility for determining the content of GCSE syllabuses lies with the regulatory authority&#151;the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA)&#151;and the awarding bodies.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how much the target transitional grant for Staffordshire local education authority will be in the next two years; and what arrangements have been made for the provision of the grant.  [136166]<P>

 Details of the transitional support package for 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06, including the arrangements for paying the targeted grant, will be published at the time of the provisional Local Government Finance Settlement later this month.
<P>

<a name="31105w19.html_para3">On 29 October the government published indicative figures for the targeted grant in 2004&#150;05, which have been placed in the Library of the House. These assumed that grant would be available to authorities whose increase in Education Formula Spending and relevant DfES grant between 2002&#150;03 and 2004&#150;05 would otherwise be less than 12 per cent. per pupil. The increase in Staffordshire LEA is expected to be above 12 per cent. per pupil over the relevant period, which means it would not be eligible for the targeted grant.
<P>

<a name="31105w19.html_para4">However, if Staffordshire or any other LEA is able to put forward a compelling case that additional, transitional funds are needed in the short term&#151;above and beyond those already available to the LEA&#151;my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will be prepared to consider bringing forward grant payments from my department, so that the LEA will have funds available in 2004&#150;05 for this purpose, with the expectation of a consequential reduction to what they will receive in future years. The maximum amount that might be made available in this way would be a maximum of &#163;300,000 per authority, or 0.2 per cent. of the authority's total education resources in 2004&#150;05, if that is higher. For Staffordshire, 0.2 per cent. of its education resources would be over &#163;800,000.

 The following tables show the percentages of lessons that inspectors recorded as setted by ability by subject in each year for pupils in years 10 and 11. These data are among the background information which are collected by inspectors to assist them in making judgments about standards achieved in schools and are not part of a representative survey of the use of setting by schools.
<P>

<a name="31105w19.html_para5">The table figures provide a useful indicative picture of the use of setting across subjects, with setting being used in the vast majority of schools in mathematics, more than three-quarters of schools in science, and between half and three quarters of schools in English and modern foreign languages. A more detailed study, undertaken over a number of years with a consistent sample of schools, would be needed to enable secure judgments to be made about trends.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31105w19.html_spnew6"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 There are a number of programmes that are responding to forecast labour market demands. In higher education they include: the expansion of Foundation Degrees, New Technology Institutes (NTI), the Teaching Quality Enhancement Fund, Aimhigher and the Enhancing Student Employability Co-ordination Team (ESECT).
<P>

<a name="31105w19.html_para7">In terms of vocational training, programmes such as Modern Apprenticeships and Advanced Modern Apprenticeships are designed to meet existing and future labour market needs. The Higher Education Funding Council and the Learning and Skills Council are working closely with the Skills for Business network and Regional Development Agencies to ensure that vocational qualifications meet the needs of local, regional and national labour markets.

<a name="31105w19.html_spnew7"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 All programmes at Level 3 in the National Qualifications Framework have the potential to allow students to undertake further courses of study to obtain a degree level qualification.
<P>

<a name="31105w19.html_para8">In particular reformed Advanced Modern Apprenticeship frameworks now include technical certificates. These are taken in addition to NVQ at Level 3 to assess underpinning occupational knowledge. Their inclusion in frameworks now allows for easier progression to higher education for those with the aptitude to do so.
<P>

<a name="31105w19.html_para9">We are also expanding the number of Foundation Degrees available, with 10,000 extra places from next year. These are new qualifications and provide opportunities for individuals to progress to full honours degrees.

The research estimated that out of the 2.1 million new jobs expected to be created between 1999 and 2010, 1.7 million (or 80 per cent.) will be in the top three occupational groups.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what measures are being taken to ensure that the phrase teaching assistants includes <i>(a)</i> supervisors working with classes of children without the presence of a teacher and <i>(b)</i> others employed under paragraph 10 of Schedule 2 to Statutory Instrument 1663 employed to undertake specified work and that these are recorded separately from those who already appear in the teachers tables of the school workforce statistics when these figures are next collected from schools and local education authorities.

<i>[holding answer 4 November 2003]:</i> Guidance to LEAs completing the Annual Survey of Teacher Numbers and Vacancies (618G) in January 2004 will make clear that support staff who may be providing cover supervision, or who may be carrying out specified work without a teacher present under the conditions set out in the regulations, should continue to be counted separately from teachers. We would expect most of these to be counted as teaching assistants in the Annual Schools Census, but often support staff in schools undertake more than one role. We are also considering what further categorisation we might introduce for the 2005 school census.
<P>

<a name="31105w20.html_para0">The Workforce Agreement Monitoring Group will continue to monitor developments in the strategies used by schools to deal effectively with teacher absence as part of its wider role in overseeing the implementation of the National Agreement on raising standards and tackling workload.

 Since 1998, full tuition fee remission has been available to most postgraduate trainee teachers in England. In 1999, the Government announced a 



<P>
<P><I>5 Nov 2003 : Column 706W</I><P>
further package of support which consisted of a payment of &#163;2,500 for people taking Postgraduate Certificate in Education courses in mathematics and science and a further &#163;2,500 payable on appointment to a relevant post in the same subjects.
<P>

<a name="31105w20.html_para1">These payments were superseded in September 2000 when the Government introduced &#163;6,000 training bursaries for eligible postgraduate trainee teachers and &#163;4,000 Golden Hellos for those going on to teach one of five priority subjects in a maintained school in England. These incentives have been reinforced by the Repayment of Teachers' Loans pilot scheme, introduced in September 2002 for new teachers of priority subjects.
<P>

<a name="31105w20.html_para2">These measures have contributed to an increase of over 5,000 in the number of recruits to courses of Initial Teacher Training between 1998/99 and 2002/03.

 The Government believe that all controlled drugs, including cannabis, are harmful and that no one should take them.

<P>

<a name="31105w20.html_para12">Reclassification of cannabis is also designed to continue to deter use of the drug, because of its continued illegality, while enabling the police to put in place a consistent regime for policing cannabis, in line with the Association of Chief Police Officers' cannabis enforcement guidance. This will allow the police to redeploy resources to tackling more serious offences, including dealing in Class A drugs, like heroin and crack cocaine, which do the most harm.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the effect of the adoption of the National Crime Recording Standard on the capacity to compare crime statistics with previous years' performance.  [135279]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31105w21.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 It is difficult to make valid comparisons of recorded crime statistics over time owing to changes in police recording, the latest being the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) in April 2002. However, the adoption of the NCRS by all forces will establish a fairer and more consistent basis upon which future crime statistics can be interpreted, both nationally and between police forces.

 Detainees at Dungavel Removal Centre are not fined. They benefit from an incentive scheme that provides them with a weekly cash allowance provided their behaviour and conduct is satisfactory. In the case of unsatisfactory behaviour, a warning letter will be issued and, if the detainee's behaviour does not improve, consideration will be given to withdrawing the weekly allowance. Unsatisfactory behaviour may include breaches of the centre rules on hygiene or health and safety. Detainees taking food from the dining room to their rooms would constitute such a breach. In the case in question, a warning letter was issued in respect of a number of separate matters but the detainee's weekly allowance was not in fact withdrawn.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many prisoners have absconded from HMP Leyhill in the last 12 months for which figures are available; how many of these have not been recaptured; and if he will place in the Library for each absconder in the last year a list of <i>(a)</i> the original offence for which they were imprisoned, <i>(b)</i> their original sentence and <i>(c)</i> the average length of their outstanding sentence.  [134996]<P>

 <i>[holding answer 28 October 2003]:</i> Leyhill is an open category D training establishment containing adult males mostly from the South West Area, although many transfer from other establishments after their recategorisation to category D. Leyhill also holds life sentence prisoners, allocated nationally.
<P>

<a name="31105w21.html_para4">Eighty-two prisoners absconded from Leyhill between 1 November 2002 and 24 October 2003. Of these 19 have not yet been recaptured. Table 1 lists for each absconder the offence for which he was imprisoned, the sentence and the length of sentence outstanding between the date of abscond and the expected release date. For prisoners other than life sentenced prisoners the average period for the time from date of abscond to expected release date was 10 months. Table 2 shows the changes in population, and the number of time served prisoners who were discharged from Leyhill in the last 12 months.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31105w23.html_spnew9"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The Prison Service keeps the impact of population pressures under review. The main threat to offending behaviour programmes stems from prisoners being transferred to another prison before completing a programme, in order to alleviate population pressures. So far this has been largely avoided. Only 1.5 per cent. of prisoners who started a cognitive skills offending behaviour programme in 2002&#150;03 failed to complete the programme as a result of transfer (which may have been due to overcrowding or for other reasons). This is similar to the previous three years and compares with 4.8 per cent. in 1996&#150;97.

England and Wales. It has, however, contracted the Health Protection Agency to provide a communicable disease data collection and monitoring service. As part of this contract, the London prisons will shortly begin to pilot use of a new reporting form, which will provide information on newly diagnosed cases of tuberculosis and also on people already being treated for tuberculosis when received into prison.

The two most recent editions have included detailed guidance about the control of tuberculosis in prisons designed to clarify and reinforce earlier guidance to establishments. This makes it clear that all prisoners should be screened for tuberculosis on first reception by direct questioning about the particular symptoms of the disease.

Any prisoners with symptoms of the disease should be isolated until a diagnosis is made. The recent guidance
