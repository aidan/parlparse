<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51202w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 We are supporting a project, which includes an adviser based in the Caribbean, aimed at improving and strengthening disaster preparedness in all UK Overseas Territories in the region.

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="51202w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 Her Majesty&#039;s Government&#039;s assistance totalled approximately &#163;250,000, provided in response to the immediate humanitarian need. This included the cost of deploying naval vessels in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane and the provision of essential water and medical supplies, plus help with the costs of a contingent from the Bermuda Regiment to help with the clean-up operation. We also offered advice to the Cayman Islands authorities in handling the emergency and we have since funded a review of the hurricane&#039;s impact.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development pursuant to the answer to the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) of 15 November 2005, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 1077&#150;1078W, on damages, why <i>(a)</i> compensation was paid to pensioners for arrears of payment, <i>(b)</i> interest and a penalty payment was made to the Inland Revenue and <i>(c)</i> compensation was paid to a member of staff for personal effects; and if he will make a statement.  [32000]</p>




<p><a name="st_4"><a name="51202w01.html_spnew4"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Compensation was paid to pensioners to recompense them for the reduced pensions they received. Incorrect exchange rates were used in the calculation of their pensions, which resulted in them being paid lower rates of pension than they were due. Besides paying the arrears, DFID paid compensation for their losses.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51202w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">Payment of interest and a penalty were made, as required by the Inland Revenue, for backdated national insurance contributions that had not been paid correctly by DFID.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51202w01.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">Compensation was paid to a member of staff for the loss of personal effects which had been placed in store at DFID expense, under the terms of the employment contract while she was working in one of our offices overseas. An administrative error resulted in invoices never being received by DFID, leading the storage company sub-contracted by DFID&#039;s freight contractor eventually to sell the effects to cover their costs. DFID&#039;s payment was a contribution to the total loss, with the bulk of the compensation paid by our freight contractor.

Notes:<br>

1. Figures for the North East are provided using a three-year rolled average, as single-year estimates do not provide a robust guide to year-on-year changes. Figures are therefore not the same as previously published single-year estimates and there may be differences in changes over time. Due to this, the absolute and relative figures in 1996&#150;97 to 1998&#150;99 will not necessarily match. In circumstances such as a change in trend, rolled averages will show less variation than single year estimates.<br>

2. Regional three-year rolled average figures are rounded to the nearest 10,000.<br>

3. The estimates use the same income measures as the Department for Work and Pensions publication &#039;Households Below Average Income&#039; (HBAI). Income is net of income tax and council tax, and adjusted for household size and composition.<br>

<i>[holding answer 10 November 2005]:</i> Records of hearing tests and their results are held as part of an individual&#039;s personal medical record. The medical records of serving personnel are held at their unit medical centre, whereas the medical records of individuals who have left the services are held by each service at individual central locations. The Ministry of Defence does not, however, hold records of hearing tests which take place after an individual has left the services. The MOD does not hold a central database of hearing test results.

<a name="stpa_56">BFPO mail for Iraq is normally despatched six times per week by RAF aircraft. Typically, a letter posted in the United Kingdom could take one to two days to reach the BFPO sorting office in London, and a further two days to reach the British forces post office deployed in Iraq. Final receipt by the addressee is of course dependent on the operational activities of the addressee&#039;s unit, and the difficulty of effecting delivery from the forces post office, via the addressee&#039;s unit, to the named individual.

 Under the national health service dental reforms being introduced from April 2006, units of dental activity (UDA) refer to courses of treatment that are weighted to reflect their relative complexity. The proposed weightings for different courses of treatments, that is the number of UDA to which they correspond, were set out in the draft general dental services (GDS) and personal dental services (PDS) contract regulations, which were published in August 2005.

The directive and the implementing national measure also contain rules on the labelling, advertising and promotion of infant formula to ensure that this information does not negatively impact on the promotion of breastfeeding.

On average, adults in Britain were getting sufficient nutrients from their diets. There were some positive dietary changes since the previous survey of this group in 1986&#150;87, notably the fall in average intake of fat, which is now close to the recommended amount. However, intakes of saturated fat, non-milk extrinsic sugar and salt are still higher than the recommended levels. Young adults in particular had low consumption of fruit and vegetables and low intakes of some vitamins and minerals.

 Three-year rolling average rates are generally used for monitoring purposes, in preference to single year rates, in order to produce a smoothed trend from the data and to ensure the underlying trend is captured rather than year-on-year fluctuations. The resulting trend is more statistically robust than that produced by using single year rates. This approach has been successfully used in monitoring many of the national targets from current and previous public health strategies, for example, Our Healthier Nation (1999) and Health of the Nation (1992).

This survey found that a quarter of all households experienced some form of unmet demand in that year. Estimating the supply and demand at the national level is difficult because the child care market operates at a very local level, leading to significant local variation.

<i>[holding answer 29 November 2005]:</i> We wish to ensure that safety checks are undertaken in all cases where there is a concern that a child could be at risk. Subject to parliamentary approval, the Children and Adoption Bill will strengthen the safeguards for children, by placing a statutory duty on Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS) officers to undertake risk assessments whenever they are involved in private law family proceedings, where they suspect that a child is at risk of suffering harm. This will include those cases of disputed contact which are the subject of court applications, 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>2 Dec 2005 : Column 860W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
where the child resides with a parent who has a new partner and there is a concern that a child might be at risk.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51202w17.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_111">Since section 120 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 came into effect on 31 January 2005, parties in contact, and other section 8 Children Act 1989 proceedings, have the opportunity of raising concerns about harm, when an application for proceedings is first made or when the respondent files an acknowledgement of proceedings. If either party indicates there may be an issue of harm, including concerns about a new resident partner, they are then expected to provide details in a supplemental information form. These forms will be copied to CAFCASS by the courts, thus enabling its practitioners to prepare in advance of the hearing by making relevant checks and assessments. These include checks of social services and police records, which CAFCASS is entitled to ask for through its duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children under section 12 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Services Act 2000.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51202w17.html_para1">

 The UK supports the efforts of the United Nations and the Government of Cambodia to bring to justice some of those who bear the greatest responsibility for crimes against humanity carried out by the Khmer Rouge. A successful outcome to the Khmer Rouge Tribunal (KRT) will help strengthen accountability, the rule of law and judicial reform in Cambodia and will send a strong international signal that war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide will not be treated with impunity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51202w20.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_140">Progress in achieving a KRT has been slow to date for many reasons and significant hurdles still need to be overcome. The Government of Cambodia has encountered major difficulties in raising the $13.8 million contribution it is expected to deliver. Less than $2 million has been made available to date. Other factors include finding, selecting and training suitably qualified, experienced and politically independent national judicial staff including judges, prosecutors, investigators etc. who can meet international standards. In that context, we welcome the recent appointments of a director and a deputy director by the Government of Cambodia and the UN respectively. Addressing gaps in Cambodia&#039;s national legislation to ensure it is compatible with international criminal law has also proved problematic.

<a name="51202w20.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_141">The UK has been one of the leading financial contributors to the KRT to date. We provided &#163;500,000 in 2004&#150;05 and expect to do so again for 2005&#150;06 and 2006&#150;07.

The EU also welcomes the continued engagement of the Organisation of American States in accompanying the demobilisation process. The Conclusions also spelled out specific areas of intervention where the EU is willing to assist Colombia in support of the search for peace. While we do have some concerns over the pace of paramilitary demobilisation, we acknowledge that effective and transparent implementation of the recently agreed Colombian Justice and Peace Law would make a positive contribution to the search for peace in Colombia.

 There are no negotiations at present between the E3/EU and Iran. On 5 August 2005, the E3/EU presented a comprehensive proposal for long term arrangements intended to give the international community objective guarantees that Iran&#039;s nuclear programme was exclusively for peaceful purposes, while equally providing firm guarantees on nuclear, technological and economic co-operation and firm commitments on security issues. Regrettably, Iran rejected this proposal and resumed uranium conversion activities on 8 August 2005, in violation of the framework for talks it had agreed with the E3/EU. The resolution adopted by the International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors on 24 September and the discussion at the board&#039;s meeting on 24 November have underlined that questions about Iran&#039;s nuclear programme remain unresolved. The Secretary-General of Iran&#039;s Supreme National Security Council, Ali Larijani, wrote to the E3/EU on 6 November expressing Iran&#039;s interest in resuming talks. In their reply on 27 November, E3 Foreign Ministers and EU High Representative, Javier Solana, expressed the hope that Iran would meet the expectations of the international community and help create conditions that would enable talks to resume. They outlined the European sides willingness to meet to see if a basis for the resumption of negotiations can be agreed.

 Iran&#039;s nuclear programme continues to be of deep concern to the whole international community.

Since 2003, the UK, France and Germany, with the support of the EU high representative, Javier Solana, have pursued a diplomatic solution, that would give Iran an opportunity to address international concerns and provide objective guarantees that its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes. These efforts have helped raise international awareness of Iran&#039;s activities and have enjoyed increasing support. But, although we have seen limited progress in some areas, the steps taken so far by Iran fall far short of what is required. The E3/EU will continue to engage closely with key partners including Russia, the USA, EU member states and members of the IAEA board of governors to maintain the pressure on Iran to address the international community&#039;s concerns.

 The Government are committed to achieving an ambitious, pro-development package at the WTO ministerial conference in Hong Kong in December, which will allow a successful conclusion to the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) by the end of 2006.

<a name="stpa_201">The DDA has the potential to deliver a freer and fairer trading system, through substantially increased market access for developing countries and the dismantling of trade-distorting subsidies by industrialised countries, with poor countries given the flexibility to decide, plan and sequence trade reforms. The Department is pressing for as much progress as possible towards a deal at the Hong Kong ministerial.
