 Local authorities are required to work towards meeting the air quality objectives in the Air Quality Regulations 2000 by designating air quality management areas where concentrations of any of the seven pollutants in the regulations exceed, or are likely to exceed, the stated objectives. To help local authorities do this, DEFRA operates an air quality grant scheme, a capital grant for which local authorities bid. The total amount of this grant, which is divided between successful authorities, is approximately &#163;2.3 million per year. While Peterborough city council was aware of the air quality grant, the council has not applied for the past three years.</p>

As individual keepers will be responsible for the costs of vaccination, our aim, in close collaboration with a core group of industry stakeholders, has been to develop a vaccination programme which will reduce the cost of vaccination to a minimum by using existing delivery chains and reducing regulatory burdens in order to encourage maximum participation.</p>

 The England catchment sensitive farming delivery initiative has been in place since April 2006 and is being delivered jointly by Natural England and the Environment Agency on behalf of DEFRA. It is currently based in priority catchments covering a little over a third of the agricultural area of England and its purpose is to encourage farmers to take voluntary action to tackle diffuse water pollution, mainly from nitrates, phosphorus, sediment, pesticides and livestock faeces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="80421w0003.htm_para5"><a name="08042134000103">The main elements of the initiative are: forty priority catchments served by a network of 42 catchment sensitive farming officers working locally; a programme of farmer workshops, farm demonstrations and farm visits; partnership with the pesticides voluntary initiative; local catchment steering groups bringing together farmers, water companies and other stakeholders; a capital grant scheme. In its first two years the initiative also supported 20 projects, with similar aims and objectives, in other catchments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="80421w0003.htm_para6"><a name="08042134000104">In February 2008 DEFRA launched Future Water, the Government's new water strategy for England. This stated that DEFRA will continue to support farmers on catchment sensitive farming for a further three years. DEFRA has since confirmed that the England catchment sensitive farming delivery initiative will receive funding of &#163;12.9 million in 2008-09. Most of the initial programme is being rolled forward for a period of six months, with a new programme planned from October.</p>

 Waste incineration plants, including those in hospitals, are subject to the Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations (the &#147;PPC Regulations&#148;) which were superseded from 6 April 2008 by the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2007. These regulations require each incinerator to have a permit to operate which is issued by the regulator only after detailed consideration of the environmental and health impacts of the operation. Each permit contains operating conditions which incorporate the requirements of the waste incineration directive (the WID), among which is a maximum emission limit to air for dioxins of 0.1 ng/m<sup>(3)</sup> expressed as International Toxic Equivalents (ITEQ). This limit is considered to provide adequate protection to the human health and environment.</p>

 The UK is largely self-sufficient in milk. Over 95 per cent. of the milk consumed in the UK is produced in the UK.

 Under section 45 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, local authorities (LAs) have a general duty to collect household waste.

As DEFRA advised in a letter of August 2005 to LAs, where an authority uses its section 46 powers to prescribe such arrangements and a resident does not comply with those requirements, an LA has no further duty to collect their waste, other than the duty to keep relevant land clear of litter and refuse.</p>

In the event, the then Police and Criminal Justice Bill was amended so the planned merger of all five Inspectorates did not proceed.

 The activities of the Digital National Framework (www.dnf.org) are agreed by an Expert Group formed of officials representing local and central government, non-Department Government bodies and the private sector. Their aim is to promote linkages across national and local datasets, which have a geographic component, to support the sharing of information about a common location. The majority of their resource comes from &#147;in kind&#148; contributions of individual members, supplemented by limited financial sponsorship to cover promotional activities and some technical documentation.

 Targeted Response Vehicles (TRVs) are used as an extra resource by Fire and Rescue Authorities (FRAs) at specified times and locations to provide a more flexible and increased service in specific areas. Effective use of new midi fire appliances or TRVs crewed with three firefighters can, in certain circumstances, provide a better service for local communities. As well as tackling small fires, using TRVs in identified 'hot spots' can act as a deterrent to miscreants and free up staff for major incidents and community safety work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="80421w0013.htm_para1"><a name="0804226000693">FRAs are required by the Fire and Rescue Service National Framework to have in place and maintain an integrated risk management plan (IRMP) which reflects local need and sets out plans to tackle effectively both existing and potential risks to communities. The IRMP enables the authority to tailor cover for fire and other incidents to local circumstances&#151;evaluating where risk is greatest and allocating resource accordingly.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) is planning to continue its humanitarian engagement with a further &#163;5 million in 2008-09. DFID's support will focus in particular on internally displaced persons (IDP) and host populations. DFID will continue to support immediate relief interventions, to improve humanitarian co-ordination and look for ways to encourage early recovery. DFID is working with a range of implementers from the United Nations (UN) agencies, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the Red Cross to ensure that the final distribution of assistance is carried out in a transparent and appropriately targeted way, with particular attention taken to ensure that partners are acting with independence and impartiality.</p>

The European Union Force (EUFOR) is mandated to protect IDPs, host populations and aid workers, and to promote the conditions for IDP return; as EUFOR deploys, we expect that it will become easier to deliver aid. DFID is making provision to allow the expansion of relief and early recovery efforts if and when the security environment is improved.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) is committed to consulting effectively with the public and interested groups.

Public consultations are administered independently by the consulting policy or country team, using this departmental guidance. There is therefore no central record of the number held for the last three years, or of the number of respondents to each, and so it would be of disproportionate cost to provide these details.</p>

 Before scheduling the roadworks at Gateway services, the Highways Agency carefully considered the potential impact on road users.

The number of animals used varies from year to year and depends on the requirements of industry and the regulators concerned. In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate to place a limit on such testing. However, the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 requires that the procedures authorised must cause the minimum possible suffering to the smallest number of animals of the least sentience and we will continue to ensure that these requirements are met in all categories of animal use, including the testing of food additives.</p>
