Over 100 projects are also being supported under a &#163;8.7 million programme in rural areas to support basic services, renovation of villages and supporting local tourism and craft sectors. A Rural Retail Scheme is also in operation designed to help encourage the retention of retail facilities in rural areas.

However, since then, starts have fallen behind profile. The LSC have therefore put in place a range of measures to address this shortfall although it is too early to assess their impact.

 Data on bullying are not collected centrally and there is no reliable basis for an estimate of prevalence.

1. Price Base: Cash terms.<br>

2. Figures reflect relevant sub-blocks of the Education Formula Spending settlement and include the pensions transfer to EFS.<br>

3. Total funding also includes all revenue grants in DfES Departmental Expenditure Limits relevant to pupils aged 3&#150;10 and 11&#150;15, and exclude education maintenance allowances and grants not allocated at LEA level. For those LEAs in receipt of advance of grant under the transitional support arrangements for 2004&#150;05, advance grant funding was included in the year of payment (2004&#150;05). There will be a consequential reduction in DfES grant for these LEAs in future years (either 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 or 2006&#150;07 to 2008&#150;09, depending on the terms on which the advance was given to the LEA).<br>

4. The pupil numbers used to convert &#163;m figures to per pupil are those underlying the EFS settlement calculations.<br>

5. Rounding: Per pupil figures are rounded to the nearest 10.<br>

6. Status: 2005&#150;06 figures are provisional as some grants have not yet been finalised/audited.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what alternative education and training provision has been found for young people who are not yet ready to start an apprenticeship following the changes to the Entry to Employment programme; and what evaluation has been made of <i>(a)</i> the appropriateness of such provision and <i>(b)</i> its likelihood of offering meaningful progression to disadvantaged young people.

 Entry to Employment (E2E) is the main programme for young people not yet ready for an apprenticeship. The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) guarantees all young people for whom E2E is appropriate, a place on the programme. This is in addition to their commitment that every 16&#150;18 year old can have a place in post-16 education and training. Changes introduced in 2004/05 were to improve the referral and learner review processes.

<a name="stpa_29">Some young people are not in a position to be able to benefit from E2E. This may be, for example, because of emotional difficulties and serious substance abuse.

This type of provision is not formally evaluated, however the aim is to enable them to progress onto E2E.

 The challenge of reducing the number of surplus places is one that many local authorities currently face.

The Board also considers applications for Certificates of Consent in respect of existing casinos, where there are significant changes to the ownership or fabric of the casino. This information has not been included in the table.

 In September 2004 the Government responded to the European Commission&#039;s request to provide more information about the valuation of the Tote, its ownership, the future relationship between the Tote and Racing, the proposed exclusive licence, the conditions of the sale and the pool betting market.

We also provided details of why we believe any aid involved in the sale of the Tote is compatible with the principles of the Common Market. In addition we sought to place the sale of the Tote within a bigger picture of the liberalisation of the gambling market in Britain.

 My noble Friend, the Minister for Defence Procurement (Lord Drayson) announced on 6 June 2005, <i>Official Report</i>, column WA62, in another place that we are presently looking at the possibility of carrying out a survey. All surveys need to be carefully framed and then considered as part of the normal sequence of information gathering and analysis. Any such survey would be conducted on a tri-Service basis and not confined to the Army, and would need to be justified by reference to needs, costs and likely benefits.

 The Controller of Her Majesty&#039;s Stationery Office (HMSO) within the Cabinet Office is the Queen&#039;s Printer of Acts of Parliament, and responsible for the publication of Acts of Parliament. HMSO has considered the publication of Acts prior to 1988, which is the earliest date when these were available electronically, but has decided not to do so as many have been heavily amended. To publish them in their original form would be misleading for many users. The Government are, however, taking forward development of a Statute Law Database which will contain the fully revised and updated text of all legislation from 1275. It is expected that this will be made available to the general public during 2006.

 Women&#039;s rights have improved dramatically since the fall of the Taliban and progress continues to be made under the new government. Ensuring that women play a full role in Afghan society remains an important priority for the international community. In many areas ordinary women are now able to work and move about freely in a way that was impossible under the Taliban. The new constitution specifically protects women&#039;s rights and reserves a proportion of seats in parliament for women candidates. For last year&#039;s presidential elections, over 40 per cent. of those registered to vote were women. 40 per cent. of those who actually voted were women. Presidential candidates included one woman. President Karzai&#039;s cabinet includes two women, Dr. Massooda Jalal, Minister of Women&#039;s Affairs and Sediqa Balkhi, Minister of Martyrs and Disabled. Habiba Sarabi became Afghanistan&#039;s first female Governor (of Bamiyan) earlier this year.

In addition there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died.

<p><a name="st_189"><a name="50622w21.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 There are no plans to centralise decision making on national health service capital expenditure. Up to 2005&#150;06 capital expenditure limits have been set by the Department for strategic health authorities, primary care trusts and NHS trusts primarily on a formula basis. From 2006&#150;07, we will introduce a process where organisations put forward investment plans based on what they need and what is affordable.

Notes:<br>

1. The data for 2003&#150;04 have not yet been adjusted for shortfalls in data and unknown/invalid clinical data&#151;are ungrossed.<br>

2. Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier HESID. The identifier is derived based on the patient&#039;s date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and national health service number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data.<br>

3. Diagnoses are made using the tenth revision of the international classification of diseases (ICD). J40-J44 and F00-F03 are the relevant diagnostic codes in the ICD-10 for COPD and dementias, respectively.<br>

4. The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 diagnosis fields in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

 There has been very little work regarding the effects of the radiofrequency signals from mobile phone base stations on the electrical activity of the brain as these exposures are very small; usually many thousands of times below human exposure guideline values. Research in this area has therefore focused on the effects of exposure from the fields associated with mobile phone handsets.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what services hospitals must be able to provide in order to obtain trauma centre status.  [811]</p>








<p><a name="st_220"><a name="50622w25.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 There is no nationally set definition of a &#039;trauma centre&#039; in England. It is for local providers of health care services, in conjunction with their commissioners and clinicians, to determine the most appropriate range and size of those supporting services needed to support seriously injured or wounded patients.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) if she will make a statement on the impact of the Working Time Directive on West Hertfordshire Hospitals Trust;  [3993]

<p><a name="qnpa_15">(2) what assessment she has made of the likely impact of the Article III-278 (7) of the EU Constitution on EU regulations on Working Time in Hospitals, with particular reference to West Hertfordshire Hospitals Trust.  [3992]</p>








<p><a name="st_222"><a name="50622w25.html_spnew4"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 Implementation of the Working Time Directive is a local national health service matter. The vast majority of trusts achieved compliance across all specialties by 1 August 2004, although a small number of trusts experienced teething problems in a limited number of specialties.

<a name="stpa_155">If the proposed constitution were adopted and came into force, regulations made under the current treaty would remain valid and the United Kingdom would need to implement them, unless the regulations were amended in the meantime.
