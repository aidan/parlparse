<P>
<P>
<a name="10307w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. David Atkinson: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General if he has received a recent request from the Wiltshire Coroner to hold a fresh inquest on the death of Ronald Maddison at the defence research establishment at Porton Down; and if he will make a statement.  [152378]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10307w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 Her Majesty's Coroner for Wiltshire and Swindon has requested the Attorney- General's consent for a fresh inquest into the death of Ronald Maddison which occurred in 1953. The Coroner has been asked to provide further information.
<P>

<a name="10307w01.html_para0">The procedure is governed by section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988. Only the High Court may order a fresh inquest to be held. The Attorney-General's consent is required for the application to the High Court for that fresh inquest.
<P>

<a name="10307w01.html_para1">The application for the Attorney-General's consent will be considered when the further information he has requested arrives. If the Attorney-General grants his consent the Coroner will then be able to make the necessary application to the High Court.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10307w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Cox: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the prisons being built in England and Wales; when each is expected to open; and how many inmate places there will be at each.  [152679]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10307w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 One prison is currently under construction, Dovegate prison, and is due to open on 9 July 2001. There will be 800 prisoner places, of which 200 will form a therapeutic community.

<a name="10307w01.html_sbhd2"><H4><center>Asylum</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="10307w01.html_wqn2"><B> Ms Oona King: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many applications for asylum in the UK have been rejected on non-compliance grounds in each of the last three years; and how many of those claims have subsequently been given substantive consideration <i>(a)</i> prior to an appeal hearing and <i>(b)</i> following a successful appeal.  [151625]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10307w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The available information on the number of non-compliance decisions is given in the table.
<P>

<a name="10307w01.html_para2">Statistical information for each of the last three years on the consideration of non-compliance cases following an initial decision but before appeal is not held centrally and would therefore only be available through examination of case records at a disproportionate cost.




<P>
<P><I>7 Mar 2001 : Column: 216W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10307w01.html_para3">We have not generally reconsidered claims following a successful appeal, although it is open to the Department to challenge the outcome of an appeal through the tribunal.
<P>

<a name="10307w01.html_para4">Non-compliance refusals (under paragraph 340 of the immigration rules and paragraph 180F prior to October 1994) are for failure to provide evidence to support the asylum claim, including non-attendance at a substantive interview within a reasonable period. From November 1991, these include refusals for failure to respond to invitations to interview to establish identity under the measures introduced then.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10307w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Cohen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department for what reason and by what amount Wandsworth prison's budget was cut last year; what other prisons received notification of budget cuts and what the amounts were in each case; and if he will make a statement on the budgetary control system for prisons.  [152325]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10307w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Under the 1998 comprehensive settlement review (CSR) settlement, the Prison Service was required to make cash-releasing efficiency savings of &#163;18 million, equivalent to one per cent., in 2000-01. Prison establishments were required to contribute efficiency savings towards this target, and their budget baselines adjusted accordingly. The table shows the amounts by which individual establishments' baselines were reduced.
<P>

<a name="10307w01.html_para6">The 1998 CSR also provided an additional &#163;226 million over three years for the Prison Service to manage population increases and provide purposeful regimes for prisoners designed to prevent their reoffending. This money was allocated to individual establishments for specific purposes related to this aim.
<P>

<a name="10307w01.html_para7">It follows, therefore, that in some cases establishments will have experienced reductions in their baseline at the same time as they received additional CSR funding. The reductions in the baseline reflected required efficiency savings in performing existing functions, while the CSR allocations were to facilitate specific new work.
<P>

<a name="10307w01.html_para8">The allocation of budgets and the efficiency savings required of individual establishments are designed to achieve the most equitable allocation of resources across the service in the context of tight financial constraints and the requirement to make efficiency savings.

 On 19 April 1999 the Chief Constable asked Sir John Stevens to investigate the murder of Mr. Patrick Finucane plus associated allegations contained within the British Irish Rights Watch report on the subject. An investigation into the activities of the FRU is an important part of Sir John's investigation. In the last 12 months neither the Secretary of State nor his predecessor received any correspondence from the RUC specifically on the subject of the activities of the FRU. In that same period the Stevens Inquiry has been discussed at ministerial level in a number of meetings held with a range of individuals.

A technical solution to the problem has now been developed and the fitting of modified parts commenced on 5 March 2001. The operating restrictions are being lifted from individual vehicles as they receive the modified driveshafts. The programme to convert all Warrior vehicles is expected to be completed by July 2001.

<P>
<a name="10307w02.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Ex-service personnel seeking advice on post-traumatic stress disorder from the Ministry of Defence's veterans advice unit are referred to a variety of contacts for assistance, including their own national health service (NHS) GP and ex-service welfare organisations, especially those that specialise in stress-related disorders. However, if any treatment was necessary, it would be carried out by the NHS, as it becomes responsible for the health care of personnel when they leave the armed forces. There are no plans to change this arrangement. The NHS has a range of psychiatric services available, including those that specialise in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. Current NHS guidance provides priority for out-patient and in-patient treatment to be given to war pensioners, where they require treatment for the condition for which they receive their war pension.

 The number of Defence Medical Services personnel on operational duty in Sierra Leone during September 2000 is set out. The majority of these personnel deployed to provide initial medical support to UK troops. A surgical team also deployed briefly to Sierra Leone in support of the UK military operation which successfully freed six members of the Royal Irish Regiment on 10 September, and this is included in the details as shown. Medical support to UK forces was also provided by the UN hospital which was then run by the Indian armed forces.

<a name="10307w03.html_para7">The Government recognise that it is also important that directors are accountable to shareholders in this area, not least because boards of directors face a conflict of interest in relation to directors' remuneration. The Government continue to be concerned that many quoted companies are failing to respond adequately to the best practice recommendations on accountability, but they are also aware that the Company Law Review is looking at a number of issues in adjacent areas. I will therefore take a final decision on how to improve accountability on boardroom pay, including whether or not to introduce a compulsory vote on the board's remuneration report, in the light of the Review's wider recommendations on company law reform.

 In the area of Cannock, as defined by the postcodes WS11, WS12 and WA15, which encompasses the Cannock Chase constituency, IRISC, the Department's claims handlers, have registered 1,961 claims in respect of compensation for respiratory disease. To date, there have been 539 interim payments made, including bereavement awards, and 42 full and final settlements totalling together &#163;1,685,000. Until now, it has not been possible to make full and final settlements in all cases because compensation for some heads of damages, e.g. pensions, had not been agreed. This has now been settled, as I announced last week, and more full and final awards can be made.

As in previous years the sales will be made through Bank of England auctions. There will be six auctions during 2001-02, which will be held every other month starting in May. The auctions will be of approximately 20 tonnes and will continue to be conducted on a single price basis.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For hourly pay, I refer you to estimates which have been developed to measure low hourly pay more accurately. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has published estimates of the number of jobs paid at less than specific hourly low pay thresholds for all workers in the United Kingdom for Spring 2000, and the number of jobs paid at less than National Minimum Wage rates for Spring 2000, desegregated by gender and full and part time. These estimates are based on an improved methodology using data from the NES and Labour Force Survey (LFS). This methodology provides the best estimates for the number of jobs in the UK paid below low hourly rate thresholds. These estimates are posted on the National Statistics website at:</FONT></UL>

<a name="10307w04.html_wqn6"><B> Mrs. Lawrence: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what his latest assessment is of tobacco and alcohol smuggling and its impact on Government revenues; and what action he is taking to tackle it.  [153056]
<P>
<UL><P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10307w04.html_spnew6"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 In March 2000, Customs and Excise forecast that tobacco duty revenues for 2000-01 would be &#163;7.4 billion. In fact, tobacco duty revenues for 2000-01 are now expected to be &#163;7.5 billion, the first time in four years that the forecast yield has been exceeded.
<P>

<a name="10307w04.html_para4">Last March, the Government announced their "Tackling Tobacco Smuggling" strategy, which is designed first to slow the growth in tobacco smuggling, which has been on a strong upward trend, and then to put it into decline within three years. The strategy provided &#163;209 million for investment in 1,000 extra staff and a national network of X-ray scanners. This strategy is at an early stage but it is already beginning to show results. In the first nine months of 2000-01, Customs have seized more than 1.4 billion cigarettes in the UK and helped overseas enforcement agencies seize nearly 700 million cigarettes en route to the UK. Customs investigators have also broken up 38 major organised crime gangs involved in the smuggling and supply of huge volumes of illicit cigarettes. As more front-line staff are put in place, new X-ray scanners come on line, and tobacco pack marks come into force, Customs will be able to take even more effective action against the criminals involved in tobacco smuggling.
<P>

<a name="10307w04.html_para5">As part of the "Tackling Tobacco Smuggling" strategy, Customs are pursuing a target for 2000-01 of holding illicit market penetration to 21 per cent. of the UK cigarette market, equating to &#163;2.8 billion in lost revenues. Customs' assessment for the calendar year 2000 suggests that 22 per cent. of the UK cigarette market is made up of smuggled cigarettes, equating to &#163;2.9 billion in lost revenues. Customs also estimate that 70 per cent. of cigarette consumption in the calendar year 2000 was of UK tax paid product and 8 per cent. was legitimately purchased for personal consumption free of UK taxes.
<P>

<a name="10307w04.html_para6">Detailed estimates of revenue lost (excise and VAT) through cross-border shopping and smuggling of alcohol and tobacco for the calendar year 2000 and revised figures for 1999 are contained in the tables. In reaching these estimates using the best information currently available, Customs' assessment is that overall cigarette consumption in 2000 was approximately 81 billion cigarettes.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Figures have been independently rounded to &#163;5 million. Components may not therefore sum to the totals shown.<P>

2. The figures shown for revenue lost assume that 100 per cent. of all tobacco purchased abroad substitutes for similar purchases in the UK.<P>

3. The increase in the cross-border shopping estimates between 1998 and 1999 reflects the effects of the abolition of intra-EU duty free sale in July 1999. Prior to abolition duty free sales were not included in the estimates of cross-border shopping; from July 1999 onwards duty free sales have largely been replaced by EU duty paid sales, which are included in cross-border shopping. Because the switch from duty free sales to EU duty paid sales does not involve an additional revenue loss, the measured increase in cross-border shopping between 1998 and 1999 overstates the net additional loss of revenue.<P>

4. Prior to 1999 the split between the different tobacco products was not robust enough to publish. <P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Figures have been independently rounded to &#163;5 million. Components may not therefore sum to the totals shown.<P>

2. The figures shown for revenue lost assume that between 70 per cent. and 80 per cent. of all alcohol purchased abroad substitutes for similar purchases in the UK.<P>

3. The figures exclude any amounts for revenue lost on alcohol products smuggled in freight consignments or diversion fraud.<P>





4. The 1999 cross-Channel smuggling figures have been revised to take into account new data on traffic flows from the ONS International Passenger Survey.<P>

5. Prior to abolition duty free sales were not included in the estimates of cross-border shopping from July 1999 onwards duty free sales have largely been replaced by EU duty paid sales, which are included in cross-border shopping. Because the switch from duty free sales to EU duty paid sales does not involve an additional revenue loss, the measured increase in cross-border shopping between 1998 and 1999 overstates the net additional loss of revenue. <P>

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if, with reference to Protocol 5 of the Maastricht Treaty concerning budget deficits and the document known as the Stability Pact, he will list <i>(a)</i> the last published paper issued by Her Majesty's Government containing the text of the Protocol, <i>(b)</i> the Treaty Base of the Stability Pact and the date on which it was (i) first published and (ii) approved by the Ministerial Council, <i>(c)</i> when it was presented to Parliament, considered by a Committee of either House and reported upon, and <i>(d)</i> the debates held or Resolutions made in respect of the document in either House of Parliament.

 The Protocol on the Excessive Deficit Procedure is annexed to the Treaty Establishing the European Community, as a result of the Treaty on European Union agreed at Maastricht on 9-10 December 1991.

I refer my hon. Friend to column 896 of the <i>Official Report</i> on 9 June 1997.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security, pursuant to his answer of 7 February 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 552W, on national insurance numbers, what reasons underlay the increase in the number of national insurance numbers removed from the Departmental Central Index.  [152442]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10307w05.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The primary objective of the Departmental Central Index (DCI) Data Cleaning Project was to undertake an analysis of the DCI database to identify specific data issues which would need to be resolved to clean up the DCI database.
<P>

<a name="10307w05.html_para12">The Project removed 182,000 National Insurance Numbers (NINOs) during this financial year--more than in the whole of the last Parliament. The increase in the number of NINOs removed is due to the Project designing various enhanced IT scans which identified high risk records and continued to target duplicate records. Since the Project commenced only 10 fraudulent NINOs have been discovered, the vast majority were duplicates.

<P>
<a name="10307w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Figures on timber procurement are not readily available. The interdepartmental timber working group is working to develop a common reporting template which will form the basis for future reporting on timber procurement. New FCO guidance has been issued to help buyers to work to ensure that timber procurement is in accordance with international agreements such as CITES and bought from sustainable legal sources.

 As part of their contribution to the Government's competitiveness agenda, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office funds and manages a Science and Technology Network currently based in 10 countries. As a result of the 2000 Spending Review they can now allocate an additional &#163;3 million to Science and Technology work over the next three Financial Years (2001-04). This will mean doubling the number of countries in which our diplomatic posts have specialist Science and Technology staff, and the creation of a dedicated Science and Technology Unit in the FCO.

<a name="10307w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 We remain in close touch with the Commonwealth Secretariat over the situation in Zanzibar. We have encouraged the Commonwealth Secretary General to become personally engaged in the search for a solution to the continuing political impasse on the islands. We have reiterated our support for the implementation of key provisions of the Commonwealth brokered agreement between the parties, which we continue to see as the best way of achieving a durable solution.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what steps the Government have taken to ensure that the Government of Tanzania discontinue the harassment of opposition politicians on the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba.  [151694]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10307w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 We were shocked by the killings, mass arrests and other human rights abuses carried out by the security forces on Zanzibar at the end of January against civilians exercising their democratic right to peaceful assembly.
<P>

<a name="10307w06.html_para0">We believe that progress can be made only through serious dialogue between the Government and the Opposition.
<P>

<a name="10307w06.html_para1">When I saw the Tanzanian Foreign Minister on 15 February I urged him to ensure that the security forces acted with restraint and that the Governments of Tanzania and Zanzibar entered into dialogue without preconditions with the Opposition.

<a name="10307w06.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Menzies Campbell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what his policy is in respect of the elections held in Zanzibar in 2000; and if he will press for a re-run of the elections.  [151695]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10307w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The organisation of the elections on Zanzibar in October and November 2000 was inadequate. International observers noted numerous irregularities, including the excessive use of force by Government forces against opposition supporters.
<P>

<a name="10307w06.html_para2">A re-run of the elections in the same circumstances would be unlikely to advance the cause of democracy in Zanzibar. The only way forward is through the establishment of serious dialogue between the Government and the Opposition, to enable needed reforms to the Zanzibar electoral and judicial systems to be discussed and implemented. I made this point to the leader of the Zanzibar Opposition when I saw him on 1 February and also discussed it with the Tanzanian Foreign Minister at my meeting with him on 15 February.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10307w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Following the shocking incidents in Zanzibar and Pemba over the weekend of 27-28 January 2001, the EU issued a statement condemning the actions of the security forces and calling on the Government of Tanzania to ensure respect for human rights. We also raised our concerns with the Government of Tanzania and pressed for swift humanitarian access to those injured and detained on both islands. The ICRC have since been given access to Zanzibar and Pemba.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10307w06.html_spnew8"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Stem cell techniques are very widely used in human and animal cell research. During 2000 over 4,000 scientific papers were published in peer-reviewed journals. Applications for stem cell research involving the use of embryos require a licence from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. No companies have applied for a licence.
<P>

<a name="10307w06.html_para4">Transgenic techniques are used in many areas of scientific research including work with plants and animals. All transgenic techniques involving animals and plants fall under the definition of "genetic modification" as defined in the Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 2000. This includes germ line therapy in animals. All premises where genetic modification is undertaken have to be notified to the competent authorities (CA) under these Regulations. Where the genetically modified animal or plant poses a greater risk to humans than the non modified animal or plant, the activity must be notified to the CA. For England and Wales the CA comprises the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), the Secretary of State and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. For Scotland the CA comprises the HSE and Scottish Ministers.
<P>

<a name="10307w06.html_para5">When transgenic techniques are used in humans these are for the purpose of gene therapy. A list of all United Kingdom gene therapy trials is published in the annual report of the Gene Therapy Advisory Committee, copies of which are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="10307w06.html_para6">Germ line therapy is not permitted in humans.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what consideration he has taken since the enactment of the Human Rights Act 1998 of its implications for the exercise of his powers of ministerial decision on proposed developments within the NHS to which community health councils have lodged official objection.  [151257]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10307w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 February 2001]:</i> Under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 it is unlawful for a public authority, including the Secretary of State, to act in any way incompatibly with the rights under various articles of the European Convention on Human Rights. When making any decision, the Secretary of State will consider and seek appropriate advice on any relevant human rights issues, in particular whether his actions would be compatible with those Convention rights.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10307w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 March 2001]:</i> East Surrey Health Authority (ESHA) will receive a total cash increase of &#163;22,572,000 for the 2001-02 financial year. This is a 8.46 per cent. total cash increase or 5.82 per cent. in real terms. In monetary terms the additional funding in real terms is &#163;15,516k.
<P>

<a name="10307w07.html_para0">The total cash increase figure includes the increase owing to the extra &#163;140 million resources issued in February plus cost of living and performance fund elements. This gives the total recurrent/non-recurrent cash increase available to ESHA.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what comments Her Majesty's Government have made on the recommendations made in the Mission report (ref. XXIV/1042/99 MR Final 22-26 Feb '99) to the Food and Veterinary Office on 26 April 1999; what visits Her Majesty's Government have received from EU officials to discuss the placing on the market of live bivalve molluscs and of fishery products in member states; what future visits have been notified to Her Majesty's Government under the EU's FVO Missions Programme for 2001; what progress has been made in implementing recommendations made to Her Majesty's Government following previous inspections; and if he will make a statement.  [152094]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10307w07.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 The Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) wrote to the European Commission following receipt of the draft Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) report of its mission to the United Kingdom to evaluate implementation of Directive 91/492/EEC. A number of comments were submitted both to correct inaccuracies in the draft report and to provide clarification on certain points. The CVO commented on two issues which had been identified as requiring immediate corrective measures. These concerned the immediate closure of production areas following the detection of diarrhoeic shellfish poison and the coverage of the phytoplankton and biotoxin monitoring programme in England and Wales. Action has been taken on these two recommendations. The CVO also welcomed the Commission's evaluation of the Directive within the European Community and indicated that the UK would play a full and active part in the proposed commission working group to discuss further some of the issues which were identified during the inspections visits to member states.
<P>

<a name="10307w07.html_para3">Apart from the visit by FVO inspectors in February 1999 Commission inspectors visited the UK in October 1995 and in May 1996 to evaluate implementation of Directive 91/493/EEC. No specific dates for a future visit to the UK have been decided but the FVO programme of 



<P>
<P><I>7 Mar 2001 : Column: 243W</I><P>
visits for the first half of this year indicates that the FVO will visit the UK to carry out inspections of fishery products and bivalve molluscs.
<P>

<a name="10307w07.html_para4">Following all visits, in those cases where deficiencies were noted by the inspectors in individual establishments, the relevant local food authorities were asked to ensure that corrected action is taken. In those cases where the recommendations are addressed to the competent authority, action has generally either been taken or is being considered as part of a wider strategy.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10307w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 March 2001]:</i> Sales of hypodermic syringes and needles to the National Health Service via the NHS Logistics Authority total &#163;15.5 million per annum. This may not be the total figure because some NHS trusts may have their own contracts for these items for which records are not held centrally.
<P>

<a name="10307w07.html_para5">The cost to the NHS to introduce safer products and to replace the standard ones already available could be anything up to five times this amount depending on the type of product selected (from simple needle guard protectors to highly sophisticated products which automatically retract the needle into the syringe barrel).

 <i>[holding answer 6 March 2001]:</i> The information requested has been placed in the Library. Information requested about hospital pharmacists' recruitment and retention is not collected centrally.
<P>

<a name="10307w07.html_para7">Offers have been made to health care pharmacists in line with those for other non pay review body staff of pay increases from 1 April 2000 of 3.25 per cent. or &#163;300 if greater, and from 1 April 2001 of 3.7 per cent. or &#163;380 if greater.

<P>
<a name="10307w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answers 6 March 2001]:</i> Data on needlestick injuries to National Health Service staff and any absence resulting from such injuries, are not collected centrally unless the incident involves the risk of transmission of a blood borne virus. Information on needlestick injuries would be reflected in incident reports held locally by individual NHS employers.
<P>

<a name="10307w07.html_para8">Data collected as part of the National Surveillance of Occupational Exposure to Blood Borne Viruses in Health Care Workers between July 1997 and December 2000 indicated that 1,044 NHS staff were exposed to blood borne viruses during this period.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10307w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 March 2001]:</i> We are fully committed to investing in National Health Service staff. We recognise that a modern NHS must offer staff a better deal in their working lives including the provision of more flexible working practices.
<P>

<a name="10307w07.html_para9">The Improving Working Lives Standard, launched in October 2000, has been developed to set a model of good employment practices against which NHS organisations will be measured. NHS organisations are required to provide a portfolio of evidence showing that they are delivering more flexible working for all staff by April 2003.
<P>

<a name="10307w07.html_para10">Evidence of flexible working is a component of trusts' pledge to achieve Improving Working Lives accreditation. In a number of trusts including Warrington General Hospital, where a ward pilot is currently taking place, a self-rostering system has been introduced to give staff more control and flexibility in their working lives. Team based self-rostering is also evident in Blackburn, North Manchester and Stepping Hill Hospitals.
<P>

<a name="10307w07.html_para11">The NHS has received funding of &#163;1 million to support Improving Working Lives during 1999 and again in 2000. The NHS Plan announced investment building up to over &#163;30 million by 2004 to boost child care arrangements and give parents more affordable, accessible, good quality child care.

 <i>[holding answer 6 March 2001]:</i> Provision has been made in EU and UK legislation concerning the foot and mouth disease export restrictions for such trade to take place under tightly controlled conditions. Information has been made available to the trade about these requirements and can be found on the MAFF website at http:// maffweb/animalh/int-trde/misc/foot/fmd.htm.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what studies he has <i>(a)</i> undertaken and <i>(b)</i> plans to commission to assess the effects of the large scale closure of small slaughterhouses on the geographical and chronological spread of foot and mouth disease.  [151872]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10307w08.html_spnew15"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The reduction in the number of small abattoirs does not appear to be a factor in the spread of foot and mouth disease during the current outbreak. The main cause for the spread of the disease appears to be the movement of sheep for trade purposes. However, detailed epidemiological studies into the outbreak will continue.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what the status is of the maps and co-ordinates issued by his Department showing public safety zones for Biggin Hill airport; what consultation preceded their publication; under what powers public safety zones are established; and upon what information the designation of the public safety zones is determined.  [151995]<P>

<P>
<a name="10307w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 Public safety zones have no basis at present in legislation, although reference to them is included in Department of the Environment Circular 2-92 and they have existed near an increasing number of airports since their introduction over 40 years ago. Following a review of public safety zone policy and its administration, my Department carried out public consultation in 1997-98 on a proposal that public safety zones should be redefined on the basis of risk contour modelling. My hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson), the then Under Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, announced on 31 July 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 638-39W, that public safety zones would correspond essentially to the areas which might be expected to experience an individual risk of death from aircraft accidents of one in 100,000 per year or greater, based on broad assumptions about the numbers and types of aircraft expected to use the relevant airports in 15 years time. She announced on 15 June 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> column 86W, that public safety zones would be defined on this basis at the other airports for which modelling work suggested that this would be justified. On the same day my Department issued for public consultation a draft circular containing guidance to local planning authorities for considering planning applications arising within public safety zones.
<P>

<a name="10307w09.html_para1">My hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin), then the Under Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, announced on 19 April 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 495-496W, that public safety zones would be established for the first time at Biggin Hill and several other airports. On 26 May 2000 my Department asked local planning authorities to apply the guidance in the draft circular on an interim basis when determining planning applications within these zones. Biggin Hill is one of 26 airports for which public safety zones have so far been established and Ordnance Survey grid co-ordinates issued, based on airports' forecasts of the numbers and types of aircraft expected to use the respective airports in 2015. I hope to issue the final version of the guidance and definitive maps of the zones in the next few months.

 The Government endorsed the targets in the 1996 National Cycling Strategy, to double the number of cycle trips by 2002, and to quadruple them by 2012. To achieve increases on the scale envisaged, major improvements need to be made in the infrastructure for cycling. It has become increasingly clear that the interim target for 2002 did not allow enough time for such improvements to be planned and implemented. The Government remain committed to the target for 2012, and in the 10-Year Transport Plan we have set a new interim target of trebling cycling by 2010.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if the Winter Fuel Payments for the winter of 2000-01 have been made to all those eligible in Renfrewshire; and if he will make a statement.  [152420]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10307w14.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 Around 1 million people across Scotland have benefited from Winter Fuel Payments this winter. Automatic payments, where entitlement was established, were made before Christmas 2000.
<P>

<a name="10307w14.html_para0">In some cases, people have to make a claim for the Payment. All payments in respect of successful claims determined by 9 November 2000 were also made before Christmas 2000. Claims that were determined after 9 November and before 15 January are due to be paid during the first two weeks in March. The Department of Social Security will be making further payments in April 2001 and again in June 2001.
<P>

<a name="10307w14.html_para1">The Department of Social Security identified early on that there might be difficulties in relation to areas with tenement buildings. In some cases, there may not be individual flat numbers and the customer may not have supplied a postcode. This could mean that the correct payments might not be made. The Department of Social Security have addressed this issue. Their practice now is to look at all known tenement cases on an individual basis and pay the correct amount due, taking into account whether anyone else can be identified as living in the same household.
<P>

<a name="10307w14.html_para2">People with any queries about their Winter Fuel Payment should contact their local Benefits Agency office.

 In 2000 Hydro Seafoods GSP reported to the Competition Commission, in the context of the inquiry into the proposed acquisition by Nutreco, that exceptional costs of more than &#163;18 million in 1997 and 1998 arose from the outbreak of ISA. We have no comparable information for other companies.
<P>

<a name="10307w14.html_para3">From 1 July 1999 fisheries was devolved and is a matter for the Scottish Executive. I understand that in recognition of the importance of the salmon farming industry to the rural economy in Scotland, &#163;9 million has been made available through Highlands and Islands Enterprise to assist companies directly affected by ISA to regain their previous level of trading. Grants of &#163;2.9 million and &#163;1.4 million have been approved and are under consideration respectively. The scheme will remain open until Spring 2002.

 No. We continue to share US concerns about the threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, and we recognise the role that missile defence can play as one part of a strategy to deal with it.

 President Bush and I discussed a range of issues including the growing threat from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery and the need for common efforts to counter this. As made clear in our joint statement, arms control and disarmament will continue to be important elements of our strategy to combat this threat.
