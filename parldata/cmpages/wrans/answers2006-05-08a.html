 The UK conducted a national consultation on the European Commission&#039;s proposal for a European qualifications framework between September and December 2005, and submitted its response in January 2006. UK experts participated in a conference in Budapest in February 2006 to discuss the issues emerging from the consultation. The Commission is currently consulting an expert group containing technical representatives from all EU member states in order to finalise its proposal. We anticipate that a final proposal will be produced in autumn 2006. The final proposal will cover the full spectrum of education and training, including both academic and vocational qualifications.

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="60508w01.html_spnew2"><b> Bill Rammell: </b> 
 The pension contributions currently paid by teachers and employers to the Teachers&#039; Pension Scheme (TPS) are 6 per cent. and 13.5 per cent. of salary respectively. The 2004 valuation of the TPS is reporting a net pressure on the contribution rate of 0.8 per cent. of salary. This is on the assumption that the change in contribution rate would take effect from 1 January 2007.

The expectation is that a formal consultation on reform proposals will be launched during May.

 The proposed increase in employer contributions from January 2007 will add a maximum of 0.8 per cent. to the paybill of local authorities for all those teachers in membership of the Teachers&#039; Pension Scheme. This cost increase has been more than covered in the levels of the minimum funding guarantee for 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08, and by the increases in dedicated schools grant of 6 per cent. in 2006&#150;07 and 6.4 per cent. in 2007&#150;08.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills whether under the proposals in the further education White Paper (Cm 6798) a local education authority would be permitted to take over responsibility for an under-performing college.  [67565]</p>




<p><a name="st_4"><a name="60508w01.html_spnew4"><b> Bill Rammell: </b> 
 Local authorities and the LSC have crucial roles to play in delivering the reforms set out in the White Paper &#039;Further Education: Raising Skills, Improving Life Chances&#039;, and must work together to drive progress through a shared strategy. The White Paper makes clear that we want local authorities to play a strategic leadership role, consistent with their leadership role in children&#039;s services overall, ensuring the integration of 14&#150;19 reform with the wider agenda for children and young people in the locality. The Learning and Skills Council will be the primary partner for the local authority, and will use its funding and powers to secure high quality provision which meets the needs of learners and employers in every area. This will include providing opportunities for new and existing high quality providers to openly compete for provision.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60508w01.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">The White Paper sets out a robust approach to tackling underperformance which could culminate in the Learning and Skills Council ceasing to fund provision which does not improve; or requiring changes to governance or executive management.

<a name="stpa_3">If a change in governance or leadership is required, this might include a stronger role for the relevant local authority at the invitation of the existing governing body.

<a name="stpa_4">If funding is withdrawn, replacement provision is likely to be sourced by competition. No one model is expected to arise out of a competition to secure a replacement provider. It would be open to a local authority to participate in a competition if it wished to do so.

<a name="stpa_5">We believe that aid is more effective when used to support developing countries&#039; own plans, and to strengthen their own capacity to deliver. So where possible, DFID works in partnership with developing country governments, and integrates our support with their programmes. In such partnerships, our aim is to ensure public understanding of our combined efforts rather than to separately identify donor funded work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60508w01.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">Where however, governments do not share our commitment to reducing poverty reduction, human rights and good financial management, it is important to ensure that our aid is visibly separate from government programmes. For example, in Zimbabwe, no DFID funding is channelled through the Government. All our assistance, which focuses on humanitarian need and the HIV/AIDS crisis, is provided through non-governmental organisations and UN agencies. This substantially reduces the scope for the government to claim credit for assistance provided by DFID

<p><a name="st_6"><a name="60508w01.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 The Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) sets out Africa leaders&#039; priorities to help boost agricultural growth and food security at continental, regional and country levels. As the UK and other G8 countries only responded firmly to CAADP during 2005, no funds were explicitly allocated to it over the last three years. However, the response below identifies where DFID funding was consistent with the CAADP.

<a name="stpa_7">At the country level, the CAADP commits African countries to spend 10 per cent. of their budgets on the agriculture sector. DFID&#039;s support to African country budgets will help them do this. However, detailed information on how budget support is allocated to sectors by Africa governments are not held centrally and to gather it would involve incurring a disproportionate cost.

DFID has recently been considering a contribution for the next three years with the Commission. However, this has been delayed whilst the UN-ECA re-examines its role in conjunction with the African Union and the African Development Bank, under the new leadership of Abdoulie Janneh.

 Through our Embassy in Bogota and in contacts with visiting Colombian officials, we make frequent representations to the Colombian government over human rights issues. We also regularly raise specific cases of concern with them. My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Lord Triesman of Tottenham, most recently did so with Vice President Santos on 28 November 2005, and our Embassy most recently did so in the week beginning 24 April. Human rights form a significant strand of our policy towards Colombia. We consistently urge the Colombian government to implement recommendations arising from successive annual reports of the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights and have offered to help them to do so.

<p><a name="qn_142"><a name="60508w18.html_wqn0"><b> Steve Webb: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what obligations her Department places on <i>(a)</i> acute hospital trusts, <i>(b)</i> GP practices, <i>(c)</i> primary care trusts and <i>(d)</i> strategic health authorities to ensure that patients are able to access transport from their home to NHS appointments; and how much was spent by the NHS on support for such transport in the last year for which figures are available.  [68237]</p>




<p><a name="st_142"><a name="60508w18.html_spnew0"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 4 May 2006]:</i> The publication &quot;Ambulance and other patient transport services: Operation, use and performance standards&quot; provides guidance on the eligibility criteria for patient transport services (PTS) and is available in the Library. This document states that medical need for non-emergency patient transport must be determined by a doctor, dentist or midwife and will depend upon the medical condition of the individual patient, the availability of private or public transport and distance to be travelled. The principle which should apply is that each patient should be able to reach hospital in a reasonable time and in reasonable comfort, without detriment to their medical condition.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60508w18.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_118">Primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible for ensuring that there is provision of ambulance services, which could include patient transport services, to such extent as they consider necessary to meet all reasonable requirements. Therefore, it is for the local national health service to decide who provides patient transport services for eligible patients in their area. PCTs should apply the principles outlined in the aforementioned publication to consider each case on its merits or to develop local criteria for patient transport services use. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 May 2006 : Column 60W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
The White Paper &quot;Our health, our care, our say: a new direction for community services&quot; signals our intent to broaden eligibility to patients referred for treatment in and out of hospital settings and during 2006&#150;07 we will update guidance on eligibility for PTS to reflect the changes outlined in the White Paper.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60508w18.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_119">PCTs are responsible for ensuring that patients who travel to receive their traditional hospital care receive reimbursement of reasonable travel expenses where the patient can prove they require financial assistance. &quot;Our health, our care, our say: a new direction for community services&quot; also signals our intent to extend eligibility for the hospital travel costs scheme (HTCS) to include people who are referred by a health care professional for treatment in a primary care setting, providing that they meet the existing low-income criteria.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60508w18.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_120">For 2004&#150;05, NHS ambulance trust expenditure on non-emergency PTS was approximately &#163;228 million. Itemised data on expenditure by other NHS organisations on non-emergency patient transport is not available centrally. Information on HTCS expenditure is not collected centrally.

<i>[holding answer 2 May 2006]:</i> The Home Secretary regularly discusses illegal immigration with his EU counterparts. Since January 2005, he has attended numerous meetings, specifically eight EU Justice and Home Affairs Councils at which this issue has been raised. In addition, he has also had numerous bilateral meetings with his EU counterparts, in smaller groups, and non EU counterparts in the margins of these meetings and in visits they have made to the UK at which discussion of illegal immigration has played a prominent part. More particularly during the UK Presidency in the second half of 2005, he ensured that specific EU attention was given to illegal immigration including organised immigration crime. An EU action plan on human trafficking was agreed as well as a new approach to migration, both legal and illegal, with partner countries and regions, in particular Africa, which the European Council endorsed. Implementation of both of these programmes of work has begun and the UK is playing its full part in ensuring the EU delivers against the commitments made. The presidency also focused on measures to strengthen the EU&#039;s borders and, as part of work to strengthen the security of EU travel documents, reached intergovernmental agreement on non-binding common minimum security standards and issuing procedures in ID cards.

As explained in the Explanatory Memorandum, there were two main amendments that needed to be made. These were as follows:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38">The existing arrangement was preserved whereby applicants coming to the UK under ancestry provisions are given leave to enter for the entirety of the settlement qualifying period rather than being granted one period of two years and having to apply for a three-year extension before qualifying for settlement (as required in the first statement);</p>

Notes:<br>

1. Of the 920 cases prepared for court with an initial hearing date set, in a small number of hearings, the actual hearing date will occur after 31 March 2006.<br>

2. The fact that the number of suspensions and actual penalties is less than half the number of referrals is explained by the number of debtors who enter into agreements to pay rather than attend court. Similarly, only a very small number of debtors actually go to prison or lose their driving licences because the courts normally suspend a sentence on condition that the defendant commits to pay.<br>

 The Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004 (IMD 2004) was constructed at lower layer super output area (SOA) level and not at ward level. The new geographical unit was introduced to overcome the problems associated with wards&#151;frequent boundary changes and differences in population sizes. With an average population of 1,500 people, SOAs are far better than wards at picking up small pockets of deprivation.

<a name="stpa_169">The following table includes the list of SOAs in Yeovil constituency and Somerset that fall within the 30 per cent. most deprived SOAs in England. The data shows that of the 74 SOAs in Yeovil constituency only seven (9.5 per cent.) fall within the 30 per cent. most disadvantaged SOAs in England and all seven of these are located in the borough of South Somerset. In total there are 327 SOAs in the local authorities that make up Somerset (including Yeovil). Of these 40 (12 per cent.) are among the 30 per cent. most deprived in England.

 The letter referred to in the Summary of VOA and Local Authorities Liaison Group meeting of 2 July 2003 was a draft prepared by the VGA&#039;s head office.
