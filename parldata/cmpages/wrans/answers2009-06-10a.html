 It is not currently possible to provide estimates of the potential costs and savings over the next three years.

<i> [holding answer 8 June 2009]:</i><i> </i>The Department for Transport has not carried out any assessment of the possible safety implications of a failure of the Global Positioning System (GPS). The vulnerabilities of GPS because of intentional or unintentional interference or because of environmental interference have always made it unwise for any GPS user to rely on it as the only means of radio navigation position fixing. It is customary to use multiple navigation systems for marine and aviation navigation for example.</p>

The plan will set out how best to harmonise radio-navigation services and to ensure redundancy and reliability in the use of any mix of navigation systems in support of safety, security, transport, environment and economic policies.</p>

 British Waterways manages its maintenance programme using a risk-based approach in order to ensure that its network remains in a reasonable and safe condition. British Waterways estimates that it would cost around &#163;200 million to remove a backlog of maintenance to both principal and non-principal assets. In 2004, British Waterways eliminated its backlog of safety related arrears.</p>

Up until March 2009, the agency spent &#163;40.5 million on this programme. A further  &#163;9.5 million has been allocated for 2009-10, with &#163;21 million remaining thereafter.

<i> [holding answer 8 June 2009]:</i> The UK is aware of the potential effects of underwater seismic activity on marine life and we are, and will continue to assess the impacts that these activities may have an all marine organisms, including shellfish and other commercial fish stocks. The UK is part of The Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR convention) and currently work is being undertaken by an expert group within OSPAR on the effects of underwater sound on marine life, with findings to be published very soon.</p>

 The interaction between the red and grey squirrel is not straightforward. They can live in the same area for up to 15 years, but in the end, the greys displace the reds. Where greys carry Squirrelpox virus, they can displace the reds within a very short period of time as the virus is normally fatal to reds while the greys remain unaffected.</p>

 The only sustainable solution to the challenges facing Lebanon and the conflict in the Middle East is full engagement in democratic politics and the peace process. The Government continue to believe that Hezbollah should disarm, reject violence and play a constructive, democratic and peaceful role in Lebanese and regional politics, in line with UN Security Council resolutions. This includes the issue of the Middle East Peace Process, where we call on all parties to share the vision of two states&#151;Israel and Palestine&#151;living together in peace and security.</p>

 Strategic Objective 3 of the Land Registry&#146;s 10 Year strategic plan in 2002 was to complete the registration of all remaining unregistered titles by 2012. Land Registry strived to achieve the objective, making significant progress each year, but recognised that the achievement of a complete land register required compulsion, which would be unpopular and require primary legislation. As a result, Land Registry no longer has a target to produce a complete Land Register by 2012. Instead, it aims to create a comprehensive Land Register as soon as possible and has annual targets. The KPI for 2008-09 was to register 325,000 hectares of voluntary registrations, which was exceeded. The total percentage of England and Wales that is now registered is around 70 per cent.</p>

 It is not currently possible to provide estimates of the potential costs and savings over the next three years. It has, however, been shown in the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change that timely and well-targeted climate adaptation measures will yield benefits in excess of their costs. Some of these benefits will accrue to Departments as cost-savings over the next three years, with further more significant gains to be made in future years. The main rationale for investment to address climate risk will be to reduce the UK&#146;s vulnerability to longer-term climate change impacts.</p>

 VAT law provides that interest, calculated at a simple rate, should be paid to taxpayers who have overdeclared VAT as a result of official error. It also provides that taxpayers are charged interest at a simple rate if they have underdeclared VAT. To claim interest on overdeclarations of VAT, taxpayers have to make a valid claim in writing to HMRC within prescribed time limits. The question of whether HMRC is liable to pay compound or simple interest on overdeclared VAT claims is currently the subject of litigation and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.</p>

 History is compulsory in schools up to the age of 14 and the key stage three national curriculum programme of study for history requires pupils to be taught a substantial amount of British history, for example the major events, changes and developments in British history covering at least the medieval, early modern, industrial and twentieth-century periods. History is not compulsory post 14 to allow greater flexibility within the curriculum. However it remains popular at KS4 and beyond. At GCSE at least 25 per cent. of the syllabus must cover a coherent element of British history and/or the history of England, Scotland, Ireland or Wales.</p>

For some, reintegration is likely to be a gradual process over a period of time. Initially some children and young people will benefit from flexible arrangements which may include attending school part-time while retaining some other support. Others may require alternative provision to allow them to cope with peer relationships and a school environment, before a gradual return to school is possible. Support may need to continue to be available on return to school&#148;. Local authorities are responsible for ensuring that an individually tailored reintegration plan is in place for all pupils before they return to school. The plan should have multi-agency approval, and schools have a key role to play.</p>

<i> [holding answer 1 June 2009]:</i> Changes introduced by The Enterprise Act 2002 were aimed at streamlining the administration procedure and introducing greater flexibility to the regime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_512"><a name="90610w0014.htm_para0"><a name="09061070001756">One of the primary aims of the corporate insolvency provisions of the Enterprise Act was to promote the use of administration and restrict the use of administrative receivership where office holders are appointed to act on behalf of charge holders. This was to be achieved in a very direct way by removing the right to appoint an administrative receiver where a floating charge was created on or after 15 September 2003. Instead, administrators would be appointed who would act in the interests of creditors as a whole.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_513"><a name="90610w0014.htm_para1"><a name="09061070001757">Since the introduction of a more streamlined procedure, the number of company administrations in England and Wales has gone up. Evaluation of the Enterprise Act published in 2008 by The Insolvency Service found that the changes implemented by the Enterprise Act 2002 have encouraged a greater uptake of the administration regime as a viable insolvency option. This has been accompanied by a large decrease in the number of administrative receiverships since the introduction of the act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_514"><a name="90610w0014.htm_para2"><a name="09061070001758">Recent Insolvency Service statistics show a sharper increase in the number of corporate insolvencies over the last four quarters, suggesting that it is the current economic climate which is causing the number of company administrations to rise.</p>

 This information is not routinely collected centrally. To ensure the effective provision of dental services, primary care trusts (PCTs) need dental professional advice. Dental public health advice will most appropriately be obtained from a consultant in dental public health. In addition, PCTs may find it helpful to appoint on a sessional basis a dental practice adviser to assist them with issues about the delivery of general dental services. Dental practice advisers (DPA) are members of the dental public health team working particularly in the field of patient safety and quality improvement in dentistry. A survey conducted in autumn 2007 identified 57 dental public consultants working in England and around 90 dentists working as DPAs with some working for more than one PCT. The majority (87 per cent.) of PCTs in England had a dental practice adviser working on a sessional basis.</p>

 The NHS Next Stage Review final report, &#147;High Quality Care For All&#148;, published in June 2008, set out that the Department is currently considering options for the introduction of a new three-digit telephone number to help people find the right local service to meet their urgent, unplanned care needs. NHS Direct will retain its current 0845 number until we are clear about any future role and function it may have in implementing a national three-digit number.</p>

However, the Department has been clear for quite some time that it does not expect patients to be charged more than the equivalent cost of dialling a geographical number to contact the national health service.</p>

 No recent assessment has been made on the effectiveness of the Co-operation and Competition Panel (the Panel) in promoting co-operation between health care providers as the Panel only opened for referrals on 30 January 2009 and has started just started to receive cases. A review of the Panel will be carried out after its first year of operation. This summer, however, the Department will review its principles and rules for co-operation and competition, which set the framework within which the national health service and the Panel operate. Promoting co-operation between providers will be a key focus for the review.</p>
