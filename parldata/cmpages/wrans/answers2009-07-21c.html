<p><a name="stpa_480"><a name="90721w0007.htm_para1"><a name="09072245001469">When the Treasury Solicitor, or counsel instructed by the Treasury Solicitor, acts for a Secretary of State, a Minister or a Government Department or agency, the client is the Crown itself (which is to say, the Crown in right of the Executive). There can be no conflict of interest in the legal professional sense in acting for a single client in more than one manifestation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_481"><a name="90721w0007.htm_para2"><a name="09072245001470">Occasionally, while acting for the Crown, the Treasury Solicitor is requested to act on behalf of bodies or persons who are not the Crown. These may be non-departmental public departments or, very occasionally, individual Crown servants having a personal legal interest in a matter or claim. In such cases, where there is a possibility of conflict of interest, the Treasury Solicitor&#146;s Department operates under procedures that have been designed to be compliant with Lexcel, which is the Law Society&#146;s practice management standard. That standard embraces policy and practice in relation to conflict of interests. In pursuit of accreditation, the Department has prepared guidance for all its staff which explains the requirements of the Code and details procedures for identifying and handling potential conflicts of interest. Both the policy and the procedures are kept under review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_482"><a name="90721w0007.htm_para3"><a name="09072245001471">The procedures have been designed to ensure that conflicts of interest are swiftly identified, the clients are informed and appropriate steps are taken to safeguard the interests of the parties concerned. Such steps may, where the interests of all parties cannot be properly safeguarded, involve the Department&#146;s declining to act for the non-Crown party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_483"><a name="90721w0007.htm_para4"><a name="09072245001472">In any case where the question of conflict of interest has arisen, the case work file will contain a record of the consideration and the outcome.</p>

 On 18 June, the Government published the latest UK Climate Projections. These projections show the potential changes in climate for the UK for a range of probabilities, climate variables and emissions scenarios. The data is provided by region to a scale of 25km grid squares in 30 year overlapping time slices, starting from the 30 year average between 2010-39. This data is freely available to all to make their own assessments of the likely effects of climate change. The Government have set the framework to allow local authorities to undertake their own assessments of the risks and effects from climate change into the future by including a new performance indicator (National Indicator 188 Planning to Adapt to Climate Change) in the local government performance framework. Under the Climate Change Act 2008 the Government are required to undertake a risk assessment of the impacts of climate change on the UK. The results of this risk assessment will include an assessment by region and is expected to be published in 2012.</p>

1. The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.<br>
2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment has been made of the environmental effects of the proposed new surface water drainage charge system. [288125]</p>

<p><a name="st_228"><a name="09072245001993"><a name="90721w0011.htm_spnew3"><a name="09072245005158"><b>Huw Irranca-Davies:</b>
 In 2003, following a review of the various options, Ofwat recommended that charging in relation to site area is the fairest approach to charging for surface water drainage. The larger the site area, the more surface water is likely to drain from it. Charging by site area therefore better reflects the actual costs imposed on the system by customers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_508"><a name="90721w0011.htm_para2"><a name="09072245001994">Charging by site area is also considered to be the most environmentally responsible approach in that it provides a financial incentive for site owners to reduce the amount of water that is directed into the public sewerage system. Options for achieving reductions include such things as: replacing an asphalt or concrete car parking area with a gravel one, and the installation of soakaways. This will reduce the likelihood of flooding from overloaded sewers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_509"><a name="90721w0011.htm_para3"><a name="09072245001995">Surface water drainage needs to be managed more sustainably, by allowing for the increased capture and reuse of water, slow absorption through the ground, and more above-ground storage and routing of surface water separate from the foul sewer, where it is appropriate to do so. Water should increasingly be managed on the surface, rather than relying on the wholesale upgrade of the sewer system which would be a costly and lengthy process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_510"><a name="90721w0011.htm_para4"><a name="09072245001996">The Environment Agency has estimated that around two-thirds of the flooding in summer 2007 was due to surface water. Surface water flooding is extremely difficult to predict as it is often a result of sudden localised rainfall events, and very small variations in the built environment can have significant effects on the way the water flows.</p>

 The Urgent Operational Requirement (UOR) process exists to address unforeseen capability gaps for imminent or current operations. Over 70 UORs for Afghanistan were approved in the period 13 July 2008 to 13 July 2009. We would generally expect these programmes to begin delivering capability to Theatre between six to 18 months after approval. We would not, therefore, expect the majority of requirements associated with these programmes to be fully met within the period stated in the question.</p>

Most of the fatalities listed above for Iraq occurred before 15 December and so were not covered in that statement.

In a relatively small number of cases, their injury or condition may mean that they become permanently unable to deploy. Reasons for this are various, but might include a serious permanent injury (physical or mental) or because during service they develop a medical condition that is incompatible with front line duties.</p>

In clear-cut cases where the individual's fitness falls below the service employment and retention standards, the board will recommend a medical discharge without further delay. In many cases however, the patient will first be downgraded, to allow for treatment, recovery and rehabilitation. For personnel who do not make a total recovery, the board may recommend the patient is retained as permanently downgraded with limited duties, or they may recommend a medical discharge.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what provision has been made for the psychological rehabilitation of members of the armed forces returning from military operations; how much funding has been made available for such provision in 2009-10; and if he will make a statement; [288590]</p>

 Diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders in the armed forces is performed by fully trained and accredited mental health personnel, and measures are in place to increase awareness at all levels and to mitigate the development of operational stresses. In Afghanistan, we deploy uniformed mental health nurses to provide the necessary in-theatre care and treatment for our personnel. If personnel need to leave the operational environment, then their care continues either on an out or in-patient basis in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_536"><a name="90721w0014.htm_para0"><a name="09072245002467">In the UK, our mental health services are configured to provide community-based mental health care, primarily through our 15 military departments of Community Mental Health (DCMH) across the UK (plus satellite centres overseas), which provide out-patient mental health care. The DCMH mental health teams comprise psychiatrists, mental health nurses, clinical psychologists and mental health social workers. A wide range of psychiatric and psychological treatments are available (including psychological therapies, environmental adjustment and medication) where appropriate. The Defence Mental Health Services have particular expertise in treatments for psychological injury.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_537"><a name="90721w0014.htm_para1"><a name="09072245002468">For the relatively small number of patients who need it, in-patient care is currently provided by a group of seven NHS trusts located throughout England and Scotland, led by South Staffordshire and Shropshire NHS Foundation Trust (SSSFT) through a central MOD contract.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_538"><a name="90721w0014.htm_para2"><a name="09072245002469">The organisational structure of the Defence Medical Services means that comprehensive figures for mental health care expenditure cannot be provided without disproportionate cost as the sums involved are disaggregated and embedded in the budgets of individual military units and overall operational budgets. Under the contract with SSSFT, payment for in-patient care is made on a case-by-case basis; as a point of comparison, payments totalling &#163;3.3 million were made for in-patient care in 2008-09; most of this was paid to the previous in-patient provider.</p>

 The Healthcare Commission reported its review of the Defence Medical Services (DMS) in March 2009. As part of that review it looked at the provision of mental health care and visited military Departments of Community Mental Health (DCMHs) in Plymouth, Lisburn and Cranwell.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_540"><a name="90721w0014.htm_para4"><a name="09072245002473">All three Defence Medical Services have processes for inspecting DCMHs, utilising a Common Healthcare Assurance Framework which is based on the Department of Health&#146;s &#147;Standards for Better Health&#148;.

 Service personnel who are identified as suffering from a mental health condition will be followed up or referred on by the medical staff who first had contact with them.

<p><a name="stpa_541"><a name="90721w0014.htm_para5"><a name="09072245002476">Patients are provided with appropriate treatment and care.

 Personnel who are referred to one of the military Departments of Community Mental Health (DCMHs) will undergo a routine biopsychosocial assessment which will comprise an interview with a mental health professional. This usually takes the form of a one-to-one interview, although further reports (for example, from medical providers or from the chain of command) may be requested and psychometric questionnaires might be used where appropriate. The initial DCMH assessment will focus not just on the problem that led to referral but will take a holistic approach to the difficulties that an individual might be experiencing at the time of referral.</p>

There is no requirement to hold data on average flying hours. The figures are agreed in Joint Business Agreements (JBAs) between Front Line Commands (FLCs) and the Defence Equipment and Support organisation, and are forecast up to a year ahead. The month by month Profile is to enable forward resource planning within the overall total for the year, not a definitive prediction of requirements, which will vary during the year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_568"><a name="90721w0019.htm_para1"><a name="09072245003514">&#147;Actual&#148; hours are the total of all hours flown for training and on operations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_569"><a name="90721w0019.htm_para2"><a name="09072245003515">The reasons why actual hours may be less than planned include aircraft unavailability through routine maintenance, running repairs, essential upgrades and modification programmes; air crew unavailability through recuperation, absence on training courses, and leave; changes in training schedules; adverse weather; or cancellation of tasking. Taskings on operations clearly depend on mission requirements at any given time, which are difficult to predict several months ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_570"><a name="90721w0019.htm_para3"><a name="09072245003516">Flying hours required for training are managed within this framework by the FLCs but priority is given to operations.</p>

 The United Kingdom is fully supportive of this Estonian-hosted Cyber Defence initiative and their endeavours in this important area. However, given the need to co-ordinate Cyber Defence with a number of other Government Departments and Allies, the MOD&#146;s preferred means of support is by participation in specific mutually beneficial workstreams rather than attach personnel permanently to Estonia. The United Kingdom is not formally a sponsoring nation of this Centre of Excellence but this position will be kept under review.</p>

your request for a list of the drug seizures made by Royal Naval vessels since 1997; where the seizures took place; and what the value of each seizure was. In the course of this research, US officials have been consulted, who have kindly shared information from their own very detailed records.</p>

The Royal Navy conducts Flag State Verification procedures on Gulf Region Shipping and has also provided significant support to US counter narcotics operations in the Caribbean. Further disruption operations are conducted whenever opportunities arise during the Royal Navy's standing patrol tasks, including within UK territorial waters, in support of operations led by the Serious Organised Crime Agency. These operations have contributed to the seizure of large quantities of illegal narcotics which otherwise might have ended up on UK, US and European streets. A comprehensive list of seizures since 1997 is set out below. This information updates previous estimates and draws on additional information provided by US law enforcement officials.</p>

Our previous answers were drawn from figures often estimated by the UK vessel at the time of the interdiction; subsequent investigations by law enforcement officials would usually have been completed after the UK vessel had left the vicinity and thus not reflected in the initial UK estimate. For interdictions when cargoes were jettisoned by the traffickers we have continued to provide the sizes assessed by the UK crew before the contraband was lost.</p>

In some cases these omissions are due to different approaches by individual UK ships in recording an incident as a &#145;seizure&#146; or as an &#145;interdiction&#146; (which may have resulted in a jettison). In others cases the reliance upon disparate ships' records may have resulted in a small number of accidental omissions as our historic responses were consolidated. The positive outcome is that the Royal Navy has had an even greater impact on narcotics trafficking than previously reported.</p>

seized drugs would have been intended for the UK, however for simplicity the estimated values in the table are based on the assumption that the product would have reached the UK with street values of &#163;40,000 per kilogram of cocaine, of &#163;45,000 per kilogram of heroin and of &#163;2,880 per kilogram of cannabis.</p>

<i> [holding answer 20 July 2009]: </i>The Department for Transport uses valuations to assess changes: either to the costs of congestion over time, or for particular interventions.

 Journey time is only one of the factors that people consider when they are making a choice about how to travel. Other factors include reliability, frequency and price. The Department for Transport has not carried out a detailed assessment of comparative journey times by rail and air, however the evidence does point to passengers making rail their first choice when it can provide a fast and convenient service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_633"><a name="90721w0027.htm_para6"><a name="09072245004835">For example passengers on short-haul trips to European destinations are already increasingly turning to rail where that is an attractive option. Flights to Paris have fallen by over 20 per cent. since 2000, and flights to Brussels by over one third. Increasing the speed of trains within the UK can also have benefits. The journey time between Manchester and London has decreased from nearly three hours in 2007 to around two hours now. The number of rail passengers between Manchester and London increased by 64 per cent. between 2003 and 2008 from 2.1 million to 3.3 million per annum and over the same time period the number of air passengers has decreased from 1.9 million to 1.4 million, a 30 per cent. decrease.</p>

It is impossible to calculate the exact spend on advertising Locate because the campaign combines a number of different travel safety messages, and local promotion initiatives have been funded from Posts&#146; devolved budgets.

1. The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission took responsibility for the Child Support Agency (CSA) from the Department for Work and Pensions on 1 November 2009. As a result, information available on the number of managers and support staff working within the CSA for the 2008-09 year is limited as the existing organisational structure underwent significant change.<br>
2. There will be some managers shown as working for the CSA in the 2008-09 year who may have been working entirely within the new services offered by the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission.<br>
3. Information on the numbers of Executive Support and Administration Staff can not be extracted from CSA data. An estimate of the number of staff deployed in those roles has therefore been provided. This estimate is extrapolated from the number of senior managers in the CSA for 2005 to 2007, and on the organisational design from 2007-08 and 2008-09.<br>
4. The Child Support Agency operates from six main sites with a supporting network of around 100 smaller sites.<br>

The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission has several means which it can use to trace those non-resident parents who are evading their financial responsibilities, including contacting the DVLA, the Prison Location Service and credit reference agencies.

 1. Interpretation of these data needs to take account of changes in recent years to Jobcentre Plus procedures for taking and handling vacancies. These figures are not fully comparable over time and may not indicate developments in the labour market. A more detailed explanation is available on the nomis website at:<br>
https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/Default.asp<br>
2. The stocks of unfilled vacancies reflect more accurately job opportunities available via Jobcentre Plus. In the case of unfilled vacancies, use of the figures on live vacancies is recommended (i.e. excluding suspended vacancies), and this is the default option. Live vacancies may still include some vacancies which have already been filled or are otherwise no longer open to recruits, due to natural lags in procedures for following up vacancies with employers.<br>
 3. Data are unrounded.<br>
 4. Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) are available from the monthly ONS vacancy survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.<br>
 5. Median duration is measured in days and is the median time between notification and closure of vacancies.<br>

<a name="90721w0041.htm_brev3"><a name="09072269002513"><ul><p class="tabletext">Early in the New Year, I wrote to you outlining a pilot we were running to allow vulnerable customers to make applications for Social Fund Crisis Loans (SFCLs) using Customer Access Points (CAPs or &#145;warm phones&#146;) in Jobcentres. This follows the Committee&#146;s recommendation in its 2006-07 report. We worked with the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) Union to agree these arrangements. The small pilot ran from 7 January to 28 March this year and we have now completed the evaluation, which I have attached.</p>
</ul><a name="90721w0041.htm_brev4"><a name="09072269002514"><ul><p class="tabletext">Our current procedures mean that, customers cannot use warm phones to make SFCL applications. This is because a customer could receive an adverse decision in an unscreened area and so, if aggrieved, could pose a risk to themselves, staff or other customers. This control measure is a key part of our agreement with the PCS on working in unscreened offices. The result is that, at present, some vulnerable customers&#151;who use a face-to-face procedure instead of our normal channel of making a telephone claim from home&#151;are referred to a screened office to receive their decision (be that favourable or adverse).</p>
</ul><a name="90721w0041.htm_brev5"><a name="09072269002515"><ul><p class="tabletext">The main replacement control measures for the pilot, agreed with the PCS, meant that Floor Managers and Customer Care Officers were always aware of calls of this type, and&#151;crucially&#151;that the Decision Maker in the Benefit Delivery Centre would contact the Jobcentre on a dedicated telephone line if the application was about to be refused. This allows the Floor Manager and Customer Care Officers to be in place to offer any further assistance to the customer on receipt of an adverse decision. Given the potential risks, and PCS concerns to such an approach, we agreed to a small pilot which ran in five offices in Northumbria.</p>
</ul><a name="90721w0041.htm_brev6"><a name="09072269002516"><ul><p class="tabletext">During the three month pilot seven customers used the service, compared to two using the existing face-to-face service in the preceding 14 months in the whole Northumbria District. Four were awarded a Crisis Loan and there were no incidents of unacceptable customer behaviour linked to any of these customers.</p>
</ul><a name="90721w0041.htm_brev7"><a name="09072269002517"><ul><p class="tabletext">The qualitative evaluation revealed that Jobcentre staff locally were confident that this service was restricted to appropriately vulnerable customers; that they enjoyed the discretion and flexibility this service provided; and, that it was an improvement in access for those customers who are currently turned away or sent to a screened office for a face-to-face decision.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment she has made of the implications for nuclear safety regulation of the civil nuclear industry of the comparative inspection effort expended for the performance of inspection per nuclear power reactor set out in the extract from Committee on Nuclear Regulatory Activities of the Nuclear Energy Agency working group on inspection practices published in annex F of the paper presented to the Health and Safety Executive Board in January 2009, No. HSE/09/13.

 It is correct that the number of HSE nuclear inspectors per nuclear installation is less than most other countries with active nuclear programmes. This is not a recent development and is a consequence of the goal setting nature of the UK regulatory system with its emphasis on ensuring that nuclear operators understand the hazards of their activities and how to control them, and take full responsibility for nuclear safety on their sites.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_796"><a name="90721w0042.htm_para8"><a name="09072269001540">Unlike many foreign regulatory authorities referred to in the Nuclear Energy Agency reference, HSE&#146;s nuclear inspector resources are not used to develop detailed regulations that prescribe how the nuclear operators should carry out their business. The nuclear installations inspectorate (NII) sets safety goals that are embodied in the licence conditions for each nuclear licensed site and require the operators to make and implement arrangements to meet these goals. UK law holds the nuclear operators responsible for safety. The NII&#146;s role is to ensure that they meet this obligation. The law, however, gives the NII the powers to intervene when and where appropriate, and seek further improvements in nuclear safety where reasonably practicable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_797"><a name="90721w0042.htm_para9"><a name="09072269001541">The system requires highly experienced and technically qualified nuclear inspectors to operate efficiently and effectively. Government have agreed with HSE interim measures to ensure that the NII has the resources needed to continue to effectively meet current and future regulatory challenges. Furthermore, the Government are proposing, in their recent consultation document on the Restructuring of the Heath and Safety Executive&#146;s Nuclear Directorate, further measures to sustain this capability into the future.</p>

 The self-employment element of the six month offer was introduced on 6 April 2009 and provides substantial advice and support to enable people to move into self-employment or to start their own business. There is an active programme of intensive support delivered by Business Link in England by Flexible Support for Business in Wales and by Business Gateway and Training for Work in Scotland. Those moving into self-employment will be entitled to a self-employment credit made up of 16 weekly payments of &#163;50 to help with the transition into work and to underpin finances for the first few months of the business.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_814"><a name="90721w0045.htm_para3"><a name="09072269002004">There is no new deal for the self-employed although both the new deal for young people and the new deal 25-plus include options offering self-employment support. Under flexible new deal providers will also be able to provide self employment support. The new deal and six month offer routes into self employment are broadly similar. Both offer intensive support and advice to those who need it. To ease the transition into sustainable self-employment the new deals give customers an opportunity to undertake a period of test-trading for up to 26 weeks. Test trading enables the customer to begin work while remaining on benefits, whereas under the six month offer the self-employment credit is payable.</p>

In addition, two further methods will be used to inform a review of the policy at the end of 2009. First, the last half-yearly Omnibus Survey of local authorities contained questions which specifically asked them about the impact of these changes. Second, a survey has been running on the DWP website since 2 March, inviting stakeholders such as welfare rights agencies, local authority associations and housing organisations to submit their assessment of the effect of the new rules. This survey, which was devised with the assistance of key stakeholders and ends on 31 July, also includes a case study section so that respondents can contribute detailed information about the impact on individual cases.</p>

The factors considered when deciding whether or not to accept a recommendation from the Board are set out in directions given by the Secretary of State to the Board.

 Any death in prison custody is a tragic event. The Government, Ministry of Justice and the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) is committed to learning from such events and reducing the number of self-inflicted deaths in prison custody.

This encompasses a wide spectrum of prison and Department of Health work around such issues as mental health, substance misuse and resettlement. Any prisoner identified as at risk of suicide or self-harm is cared for using the Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) procedures.

5 Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>
<sup>(6)</sup> Staffordshire Police Force were only able to submit sample data for persons proceeded against and convicted at magistrates' courts for the year 2000. Although sufficient to estimate higher orders of data, these data are not robust enough at a detailed level and have been excluded from the table.<br>

 Once we phase in registration with the Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA), there will be duties to check registration, and penalties for non-compliance. If, for example, a person permits staff to look after children under the age of eight in a crèche, it will be an offence if that person does not check that the staff are ISA-registered, or uses staff who are not ISA-registered, or knowingly uses staff who are barred from working with children.

 There is already a process for investigating such deaths or serious injury. Where a death in custody engages the investigative requirement in Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the requirement would normally be met by means of an inquest or a combination of the inquest, criminal proceedings and serious case review. In addition, any death in custody will be the subject of an investigation by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman. In the case of a death or serious injury of a child who is looked after by a local authority, and where abuse or neglect is known or suspected to be a factor, the Local Safeguarding Children Board will consider whether a Serious Case Review (SCR) should be undertaken, as they would following the death of any child in those circumstances.

 Apart from the statutory elements of Sex and Relationships Education (SRE) that are included in National Curriculum Science, schools currently have flexibility to decide the content of SRE provided within Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE). DCSF has provided a non-statutory programme of study indicating what it believes it is appropriate to include within PSHE which&#151;in Key Stage 4 (age 14 to 16)&#151;includes &#145;informing pupils about where they can go to obtain health information&#146;. This would include information, advice and treatment on contraception and sexual health issues. Subject to public consultation, the Government intend to make PSHE (and the programme of study that underpins it) statutory. First and foremost, however, the principal aim of SRE is to encourage young people to delay early sexual activity. Within secondary schools pupils are taught the skills to enable them to avoid being pressurised into unwanted or unprotected sex, and given factual information to enable them to negotiate safer sex when they do become sexually active. However, we make it clear in our &#147;Sex and Relationship Education Guidance&#148; (July 2000) to schools that any programme of study must be tailored to the age and the physical and emotional maturity of the children.</p>

Importantly, we involved young people fully in the review, many of whom told us that they did not have the knowledge they needed to make safe and responsible choices about relationships and sexual health.</p>

This will pay for six individual products to be featured, each of which contains a number of 'real-life' examples of the people who have used STEM and related skills in their manufacture.</p>

 Governing bodies of maintained schools in England are constituted under a stakeholder model which prescribes the percentage representation of each group on the governing body. They can vary in total size from nine to 20 members. It is not our intention to prescribe a smaller size. Each governing body will continue to be free to choose a membership of between nine and 20 which best suits their individual circumstances. We will, however, relax the percentages in the stakeholder model, while retaining safeguards to ensure that each stakeholder group is represented and that there is no reduction in the percentage of parent governors, to give further freedom to governing bodies to choose the optimal membership to meet their needs.</p>

It is not possible to produce such a projected analysis of similarly specific costs because of the scale of change in place in Ofsted; several major changes to Ofsted's organisational structure and operations will be implemented at the same time as the introduction of the new school inspection regime.

Currently, the annual saving as a result of the introduction of the new inspection regime is projected to be &#163;3.9m. This represents a 7.8% savings on the direct cost of the inspection of schools in 2008-09.

 The Geography, Science, Citizenship and History programmes of study within the new secondary curriculum provide opportunities for teachers to educate their pupils in issues related to international poverty, sustainable development, and cultural diversity.

 For more than a decade we have worked with the Teacher Training Agency, now the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA), and training providers to secure the continuous quality improvement of Initial Teacher Training (ITT).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1146"><a name="90721w0075.htm_para0"><a name="0907235003885">The standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) were revised in 1998, 2002 and 2007 setting out progressively more demanding expectations of beginner teachers. Statutory requirements apply to all accredited providers of ITT to ensure training is designed to make sure new teachers have met all of the standards. The TDA uses quality categories derived from Ofsted inspections when allocating ITT places and funding to higher education institutions and school-based providers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1147"><a name="90721w0075.htm_para1"><a name="0907235003886">In the 10 years that this allocation approach has been used in full, the percentage of undergraduate and Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) ITT places allocated to high quality ITT providers has increased from 68 to 96 per cent. This approach has helped secure positive results from the TDA&#146;s annual survey of newly qualified teachers. Currently 85 per cent. of primary newly qualified teachers and 86 per cent. of secondary newly qualified teachers rate their training as good or very good.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1148"><a name="90721w0075.htm_para2"><a name="0907235003887">The outcomes of the first full inspections by Ofsted of the Graduate Teacher Programme will be available in the autumn of 2009 which will assess quality of training through that route. Since 2003 Teach First has brought into teaching many high quality graduates who would otherwise not have considered the profession. Ofsted said that some of their trainees were the best it had ever seen. Currently around half of teachers trained on this route remain in the profession at the end of their induction year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1149"><a name="90721w0075.htm_para3"><a name="0907235003888">The agency&#146;s special educational needs (SEN) and disability programme of work has been developed within the context of the Government&#146;s long-term strategy: &#147;Removing Barriers to Achievement&#148; (2004), the &#147;Children&#146;s Plan&#148; (December 2007) and other evidence. Resources have been put in place to ensure that all trainees are well-prepared to teach children and young people with SEN and disabilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1150"><a name="90721w0075.htm_para4"><a name="0907235003889">Since 2000 the agency has invested nearly &#163;20 million of its funding from the Department to support Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in initial teacher training alongside the Government&#146;s investment in ICT in schools. The aim is to ensure that all NQTs have strong skills in using ICT to support teaching and learning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1151"><a name="90721w0075.htm_para5"><a name="0907235003890">TDA have worked with schools and ITT providers to ensure that ITT is up-to-date, responds rapidly to changes in the schools&#146; curriculum, that ITT partnerships are secure and that every trainee has effective school based training.</p>

Similar modules for secondary training were launched on 25 June 2009. PGCE materials are due to be launched later in 2009.</p>

Since the introduction of the current school inspection framework in September 2005 (commonly known as section 5), the recording of how lessons are organised has been based on discussions with the headteacher or teacher during the inspection, or by reference to the lesson plan at the time of observation. A much smaller number of lessons are observed than would have been seen under the previous inspection framework. Lessons seen may not, therefore, represent the way pupils are grouped in the school as a whole.</p>

Ofsted does not currently differentiate between setting, streaming and banding in the data collected during lesson observations.</p>

 As with all national security activity, it is vital that government powers are used proportionately and in a way that is consistent with individual liberty.

 Broadly, an act of &#145;cyber terrorism&#146; refers to a non-physical attack by terrorists on our information and communications infrastructure. As the UK&#146;s Cyber Security Strategy makes clear, terrorists and violent extremists also make use of cyberspace for purposes such as communication, co-ordination, propaganda, fundraising, radicalisation and recruitment. However, due to the inherent challenges associated with attributing responsibility for actions in cyberspace, our security approach aims to address the range of threats which may manifest in the cyber domain rather than seeking to categorise specific actions as cyber terrorism.</p>

<i> [holding answer 10 June 2009]:</i> We keep our policy on enforced returns to Zimbabwe under constant review. Since the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal RN country guidance judgment last November, all cases are being reviewed on a case-by- case basis. Those asylum seekers deemed to need protection will be granted it. Where the independent courts have confirmed that it is safe for an individual to return home, we do not consider that it is right to ask the UK taxpayer to support them. Instead we expect those not at risk to return home and hundreds of Zimbabweans have done so since we halted the enforced return of failed asylum seekers in September 2006. Any failed asylum seeker who is unable to return home through no fault of their own can apply for support.</p>

<i> [holding answer 6 July 2009]:</i> Those wishing to come to the UK to study for a period of less than six months can choose whether to apply to enter under tier 4 of the points-based system or under the student visitor category. If they choose to apply under tier 4 of the points-based system they must be intending to study at an institution which is registered with the UKBA as a licensed tier 4 sponsor. In addition they must be enrolled on a course which leads at least to an approved qualification at level 3 or above of the National Qualifications Framework.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1230"><a name="90721w0091.htm_para1"><a name="09072311006508">Those wishing to come to study for a period of less than six months on a course which is below level 3 NVQ, can apply under the student visitor category. Short-term students (i.e. those studying on courses of six months duration or less) who do not intend to take part-time employment or undertake a paid or unpaid work placement as part of their course can also benefit from these provisions. The college at which the student intends to study must either be accredited by a UKBA approved accreditation body, or be an overseas higher education institution offering only part of their programmes in the United Kingdom, holding its own national accreditation and offering programmes that are of an equivalent level to a United Kingdom degree. These requirements prove the necessary assurance that the prospective student is coming to study at a bona fide educational establishment.</p>

<i> [holding answer 20 July 2009]:</i> The Government take the issue of metal theft seriously, and recognise that it has a detrimental effect on the national infrastructure, affecting service providers, and both individuals and whole communities. It can also pose a serious health risk to offenders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1242"><a name="90721w0092.htm_para2"><a name="09072311006633">Local agencies are well placed with the necessary tools and powers to tackle metal theft where this is a issue locally. For example, in Avon and Somerset, police and partners initiated Operation Fragment when metal theft was discovered to be a problem. This successful operation tackled metal theft through crime prevention measures, increased publicity, a focus on suspicious vehicles and offenders and working with the scrap metal dealers in the area.</p>

 The Facilitated Returns Scheme was launched in October 2006 as an incentive to persuade foreign prisoners to return voluntarily to their own country. The scheme offers a package of reintegration assistance to the individual; however, no financial incentives are offered. The only cash the individual receives is the standard &#163;46 discharge grant provided to all prisoners, including British nationals. The level of assistance offered is variable and is dependant upon the individual circumstances of each case. Assistance is provided up to a maximum of &#163;5,000 for serving foreign criminals and &#163;3,000 for those who have completed their sentence. Only half of those who are removed under the provisions of the scheme receive reintegration assistance once they return to their country. Once removed from the UK under the scheme's provisions, they are excluded from the UK. As such it is only possible to benefit from the scheme once.</p>

 The decision to close a road is an operational matter for the police. On this occasion, the Metropolitan police closed the road following a serious road traffic collision. The closure was necessary to ensure the safety of the public, to cut open the vehicles so that the drivers and passengers could be removed, to facilitate treatment for the injured and the removal of four casualties by the London ambulance service, and to carry out an investigation into the cause of the collision.</p>

For this reason overall detection rates over time are not fully comparable. From 1 April 2007 the rules governing recording of non-sanction detections were revised to reduce the scope within which they can be claimed to a very limited set of circumstance. There are other changes affecting trends in detection rates that are discussed in section 3.5 of Volume two of Crime in England and Wales 2008-09, a copy of which has been deposited in the Library of the House.</p>

The examinations are usually performed by doctors, but can also be carried out by midwives and specialist nurses. The aim of the clinical examination is to pick up a problem as early as possible, so that any treatment can start as early as possible. The examination record is included in the Red Book under &#147;Colour, pulses, heart sounds and murmurs&#148; for newborns and &#147;Murmur, Cyanosis, Femorals&#148; for the six to eight weeks examination carried out by general practitioners or trained health visitors.

 &#145;Carers at the heart of 21st-century families and communities&#146; sets out a number of commitments that are being delivered over the next three years (2008-09 to 2010-11). A copy of which has already been placed in the Library.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1340"><a name="90721w0107.htm_para0"><a name="09072323000871">The Carers Grant is currently &#163;240 million a year. It enables local authorities to develop innovative and personalised outcomes reflecting the needs of their local carers. It includes &#163;25 million that councils can use to provide emergency cover for carers when they are suddenly unable to care. This means that, by 2011, we will have invested over &#163;1.7 billion in supporting carers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1341"><a name="90721w0107.htm_para1"><a name="09072323000872">We are investing over &#163;255 million to support carers in the short term. This includes &#163;150 million for planned breaks from carers, up to &#163;38 million to enable carers to be better able to combine paid employment with their caring role through enhanced flexible working opportunities and increased skills training opportunities, and over  &#163;6 million to support young carers. This extra funding recognises the value of carers in today's society and their ever-growing importance in the future</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1342"><a name="90721w0107.htm_para2"><a name="09072323000873">In the last couple of months, we have formally launched a national information service, Carers Direct. The Carers Direct helpline and website enables carers to access a wide range of information and advice on sources of support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1343"><a name="90721w0107.htm_para3"><a name="09072323000874">On 15 July 2009, we announced the 25 primary care trusts and local authorities that have been selected to be the Carers Strategy Demonstrator Sites. These will provide evidence of good practice in respect of providing breaks for carers, health and well-being checks and national health service support for carers.</p>

 Additional funding of &#163;150 million for respite care is included in the 2009-10 and 2010-11 primary care trust (PCT) revenue allocations. This is in addition to the Carers Grant paid to councils across England which is worth &#163;240 million in 2009-10 and which they can use to support carers with breaks and other services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1344"><a name="90721w0107.htm_para4"><a name="09072323000878">The NHS Operating Framework 2009-10 states that PCTs should work with their local authority partners and publish joint plans on how their combined funding will support breaks for carers, including short breaks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1345"><a name="90721w0107.htm_para5"><a name="09072323000879">However, the actual level of spend in each year is for PCTs to decide locally in the light of their local circumstances, and priorities as set out in the NHS Operating Framework and Vital Signs. This includes a vital sign on the proportion of carers receiving a carer&#146;s break.</p>

 The Department has just published a revision of &#147;Delivering Better Oral Health: An evidence based toolkit for prevention&#148;. The aim of the toolkit, which has been distributed to all dental practices in England, is to ensure that dentists and members of dental teams give consistent, evidence based advice to patients and their families on the prevention of dental disease. The toolkit contains advice specific to children 0 to six years, children and young adults from age seven as well as for adults. Guidance includes tooth brushing, use of correct toothpaste and dietary advice. While access to national health service dentistry is improving and the toolkit advises parents and carers to take young children to the dentist, we have also taken initiatives to promote oral health in a community setting. For example, under the Brushing for Life scheme families with young children in areas with higher levels of dental decay are issued with a free pack of fluoride toothpaste and a toothbrush&#151;supported by advice on oral hygiene&#151;when they attend child health clinics, Surestart Children&#146;s Centres and other health and pre-school facilities.</p>

 The Department recognises that flexible working allows staff to combine employment and a career with other responsibilities as well as meeting personal needs. The Department encourages staff to work flexibly through providing opportunities such as part time working, job sharing, term time only working and the use of flexitime. It also provides the technology to allow staff to work at home on occasions and has in place specific arrangements to allow parents, adopters, guardians and foster carers of children under 16 (or disabled children under 18) to apply to work flexibly.</p>

1. There is no way to distinguish between illegal and legal drugs and although the patient may be given a drug related diagnosis.<br>
 2. Finished admission episodes<br>
 A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
 3. Data Quality<br>
 Hospital episode statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
 4. Assessing growth through time<br>
 HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected from the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
 Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
5. Number of episodes in which the patient had a (named) primary or secondary diagnosis&#151;drug related<br>
 These figures represent the number of episodes where the diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a HES record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if the diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br>

<i> Finished admission episodes (a)</i><br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<i> Finished Consultant Episode (FCE) (b)</i><br>
A finished consultant episode (FCE) is defined as a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.<br>
<i> Data quality</i><br>
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
<i> Hospital Providers</i><br>
A provider code is a unique code that identifies an organisation acting as a health care provider (e.g. NHS Trust or PCT). Hospital providers can also include Treatment Centres (TC). Treatment Centres (also known as Diagnostic Centres) provide elective (planned) surgery for a range of conditions, mainly for day surgery or short-term hospital stay patients.<br>
Some Treatment Centres are attached to hospital trusts and HES enables data for these to be separately identified from the rest of the healthcare provider's data. It does this by adding TC to the Trust code; if there is more than one per Trust T1, T2, T3 etc are suggested unless already in use by the Trust. Activity performed in the remainder of the Trust is identified by the health care provider code being followed by an &#145;X&#146;.<br>
Hospital providers beginning with an 'N' indicates an independent sector health care provider.<br>

<sup>(<i> 1</i>)</sup><i>  Primary diagnosis</i><br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and 7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital. The data above is where the primary diagnosis is of T51.1 Toxic effect of alcohol - methanol<br>
<i> Finished admission episodes</i><br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<i> Ungrossed data</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
<i> Data quality</i><br>
 HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 national health service trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>

 In preparation for the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), from 2009-10, the Department has estimated the recurring additional revenue impact should all NHS local improvement finance trust (LIFT) and private finance initiative (PFI) schemes come onto the public sector balance sheet. For 2009-10 it is estimated that this would amount to &#163;36 million and &#163;148 million respectively. No similar assessment has been performed for lease arrangements but we expect the introduction of IFRS to have a minimal net financial impact.</p>

1. The structure of NHS trusts in the Wakefield area has changed over the period the data are requested for. In April 2002, the Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust was formed from the partial-merger of the Pinderfields and Pontefract Hospitals NHS Trust and the Dewsbury Health Care NHS Trust.<br>
2. In 2006, Wakefield District Primary Care Trust (PCT) was formed from a complete merger of Eastern Wakefield PCT and Wakefield West PCT. Most General Practitioners are not employed directly by the PCT, but perform NHS work within the PCT areas.<br>
3. Work force statistics are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data. Processing methods and procedures are continually being updated to improve data quality. Where this happens, any impact on figures already published will be assessed but unless this is significant at national level they will not be changed. Where there is impact only at detailed or local level this will be footnoted in relevant analyses.<br>

 Recycled waste biomass is an important source of renewable energy for transport fuel, and heat and electricity generation. The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) requires suppliers of fossil fuel to ensure that a proportion of the fuel they supply is renewable. Under the RTFO, biofuels made from waste materials such as used cooking oil are eligible fuels and certificates can be issued for their supply. The Renewable Fuels Agency, the Administrator of the RTFO, has published data in their fourth quarterly report indicating that 37 million litres, or 3 per cent. of the biofuel used in the first year of the obligation, was made from used cooking oil. The Renewable Energy Directive requires that biofuels made from waste, including used cooking oil, receive double rewards under biofuel support schemes and it is intended that the RTFO will be amended accordingly following consultation. The Government also intend to provide financial support for the creation by industry of a biofuels demonstration plant in England, which would use organic waste material to produce bioethanol and renewable power.</p>

In practice, the ruling by Ofgem is not expected to alter the production of biofuels from used cooking oil to a great extent. We are currently considering whether the implementation of the Renewable Energy Directive into national law has implications for the treatment of biodiesel under the Renewables Obligation.</p>

 The scheme referred to is a private scheme run by British Gas to help it meet its household carbon saving obligation set by Government under the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT). CERT is an obligation on all suppliers with more than 50,000 domestic customers. Suppliers meet their targets by promoting and encouraging consumers to take up energy efficiency measures such as loft insulation and cavity wall insulation and thereby save energy and money. Suppliers are responsible for meeting the costs of CERT, which are expected to be some &#163;3.2 billion over the course of the three-year scheme to March 2011.

<i> [holding answer 20 July 2009]:</i> The Government&#146;s framework for managing and responding to climate change is set by the 2008 Climate Change Act. The Act sets a target for the UK to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to at least 80 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2050, and the Government are required to set and meet five year carbon budgets to define the pathway to this target.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1459"><a name="90721w0119.htm_para3"><a name="09072324000122">The 2050 target was adopted in October 2008, following advice from the Committee on Climate Change. The Committee advised that this was an appropriate UK contribution to a global deal aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to between 20 billion tonnes and 24 billion tonnes by 2050 (between 50 and 60 per cent. below current levels).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1460"><a name="90721w0119.htm_para4"><a name="09072324000123">The Act was also amended earlier this year to require us to set the third carbon budget, covering the period 2018-22, at a level that is equivalent to a reduction in emissions of at least 34 per cent. below 1990 levels, as an important interim target towards 2050. The first three carbon budgets were approved by Parliament in May. On 15 July, we published the &#145;UK Low Carbon Transition Plan&#146;, which sets out how we will meet those carbon budgets through investment in energy efficiency and clean energy technologies such as renewables, nuclear, and carbon capture and storage. It also committed us to producing a longer term roadmap for the transition to a low carbon UK for the period 2020 to 2050 by next spring.</p>

Discussions are still in progress but the UK considers that a mix of grant support and public-private finance instruments will be needed. The level of expenditure required to achieve the EU&#146;s target of halving the rate of deforestation by 2020, while taking account of the concerns of indigenous peoples and local communities and realising biodiversity and other benefits, is still under discussion.

<i>  [holding answer 20 July 2009]:</i> The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan is a route map to a low carbon economy setting out the instruments the UK will use to meet its carbon budgets. This together with the Renewable Energy Strategy published at the same time also sets out how the UK will meet its target that 15 per cent. of energy should come from renewable resources by 2020.</p>

It also includes specific guidance on listed building control, which is relevant for war memorials that have been listed.

<i> [holding answer 20 July 2009]:</i><i> </i>The additional costs falling on local authorities as a result of their responsibilities under section 2 of the Sustainable Communities Act 2007 were taken into account in the spending plans announced as part of the comprehensive spending review 2007. The Act provides a valuable opportunity for local authorities to make proposals which they consider, with their local communities, would contribute to promoting sustainability of local communities. In October 2008, the Secretary of State invited local authorities to submit such proposals, via the Local Government Association by 31 July 2009.</p>

This resulted in the reduction in the overall number of LSC funded adult learners between 2004/05 and 2006/07, but has led to significant increases in Skills for Life literacy and numeracy and full level 2 qualification achievements.</p>

 We are taking a wide range of steps to encourage more people to take up apprenticeships and to encourage more employers to offer high quality places. Government are already committed to increasing spending on apprentices in 2009-10 to over &#163;1 billion. At a time of economic downturn it is vital that we continue to invest in people and their skills. Earlier this year, the Prime Minister announced a &#163;140 million package for 35,000 additional apprenticeship places, of which at least 21,000 will be in the public sector.</p>

This new approach will see large employers expanding existing apprenticeship programmes and allow small businesses to benefit from the expertise of companies which have been training apprentices for some time. We also announced a &#163;7 million fund for up to 10 new apprenticeship training agencies this year, with the potential to deliver up to 15,000 apprenticeship places per year by 2014-15. The funding will also be available to help develop and expand new or existing group training associations, which can help attract new and hard to reach employers and new individuals to become apprentices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1559"><a name="90721w0129.htm_para5"><a name="09072344000215">We have now established the new national apprenticeship service to provide a single point of contact for employers and apprentices.

<p><a name="stpa_1560"><a name="90721w0129.htm_para6"><a name="09072344000216">We are also putting in place procedures to use the public procurement process to encourage companies, including SMEs, with access to Government-funded contracts to offer apprenticeships.

 BIS makes regular assessments on the availability of credit to small businesses by monitoring statistics produced by the British Bankers Association (BBA) and the Bank of England, as well monitoring findings from a large number of regular surveys by business representative bodies. In addition, BIS collects data monthly from the five main banks on their lending activity to SMEs. BIS also carries out regular surveys of businesses examining a wide range of issues including access to finance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1582"><a name="90721w0131.htm_para8"><a name="09072344000759">From these data sources, it is apparent that the stock of bank lending has increased compared to 2007 and 2008. For instance, the BBA has reported that the stock of bank lending to SMEs has increased in the first five months of 2009 and was about 4 per cent. higher in May 2009 than a year ago. However, there has been a decline in new bank lending to SMEs. This is due to a reduction in the demand for finance with declining loans and overdraft applications, as well as a decline in approval rates reflecting tighter credit conditions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1583"><a name="90721w0131.htm_para9"><a name="09072344000760">Approval rates (approvals of new borrowing as a ratio to applications) have fallen compared to the corresponding months in 2007. Likewise, the BIS SME Barometer shows that although the majority of SMEs can obtain the finance they need, there has been a reduction in the proportion of businesses being able to raise finance. In February 2009, 60 per cent. of SME employers obtained some finance from the first source they approached. In comparison, the Annual Small Business Survey 2007-08 shows 84 per cent. of SME employers obtained some finance from the first source approached. Banks attribute the fall in approval rates due to a decline in the quality of applications as well as a tightening in credit availability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1584"><a name="90721w0131.htm_para10"><a name="09072344000761">There has been a reduction in the demand for finance, as measured by the number of loans and overdrafts applications compared to corresponding months in 2007. This is especially pronounced for SMEs with turnover of less than &#163;l million. It is likely that businesses have become more cautious and are delaying capital investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1585"><a name="90721w0131.htm_para11"><a name="09072344000762">Although access to finance is vital for supporting businesses during the current difficult economic conditions, only a minority of businesses seek finance. The Business Barometer shows 21 per cent. of SME employers sought finance in the last six months. Furthermore, the majority of SMEs (39 per cent.) report the economy as the main barrier to the success of the business, compared to only 4 per cent. who report access to finance as the main barrier.</p>

 To date, there is no evidence to suggest that lenders are being inhibited in their use of the Enterprise Finance Guarantee because of the cap of 13 per cent., which is a requirement of EU state aid rules. It is important to remember that the Enterprise Finance Guarantee is aimed at helping banks lend to fundamentally viable businesses. We therefore do not expect an overall portfolio default rate of 13 per cent. to restrict the ability of banks to lend appropriately under the guarantee.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills has spoken to Kirby Adams, chief executive officer of Corus, on a number of occasions about the situation at Teesside Cast Products. In addition, officials have held ongoing discussions with the company to explore ways in which the Government can help resolve the dispute with the partners to the 10-year off-take agreement in a way that avoids job losses.</p>

My right hon.

It is not possible due to disproportionate costs to identify those databases which do not contain personal data.</p>

 In the last 12 years the Government have made great progress on providing support to working parents and encouraging family-friendly working practices through a balanced package which takes account of the needs of parents and the businesses which employ them. This includes significant improvements in maternity leave and pay. All employed women are now entitled to 52 weeks' maternity leave with 39 weeks' maternity pay. Employed fathers benefit from two weeks' paid paternity leave. Adopters are now entitled to the same periods of pay and leave as birth parents.</p>

 It is an important principle set out in legislation (sections 65(1) and 68(2b) of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992) that Ministers cannot intervene in the funding decisions of the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE). As is the case with other universities, London Metropolitan university receives grant from HEFCE under a Financial Memorandum which sets out how it should properly account for its public funding. It is for the Funding Council to keep the financial health of the institutions it funds under review to protect the public interest, including ensuring that public funds are properly spent. This month I have met with the UCU representative and a number of staff from the institution.</p>

No Government though can give a commitment to protect every course or department at any particular institution.</p>

 It is very difficult to provide precise figures for the proportion of UK legislation that stems from the European Union.

Regulations should be risk based, proportionate and well designed, so as to achieve their objectives whilst also keeping costs to a minimum. The Government continue to work with European partners to ensure that EU regulations meet these standards.</p>

 The guarantee was not due to come into effect until academic year 2010-11; former EMA recipients entering higher education in 2009-10 would always have been treated in the same way as other applicants for student support, being assessed at the point of application. In these difficult economic times, it is both fair and reasonable to expect that those students who see an improvement in their financial circumstances are assessed  <br>

 The Government looked carefully at the issue of extending the GLA-style licensing regime to other sectors, including the construction sector, as part of the Vulnerable Worker Enforcement Forum that I chaired last year. The Forum consisted of union and business representatives, Citizens Advice, and the key workplace enforcement bodies. There was a full debate, but no consensus was reached on the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1668"><a name="90721w0139.htm_para0"><a name="09072344001712">Following the work of the Vulnerable Worker Enforcement Forum, the Government&#146;s focus has been to prioritise effective enforcement of the existing law. We have taken steps to strengthen the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate which regulates employment agencies in the non-GLA sectors, and to raise its profile among both agency workers and agencies themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1669"><a name="90721w0139.htm_para1"><a name="09072344001713">There have been calls more recently for the Government to look at this issue as my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan) put forward a 10-minute rule Bill on 10 June 2009, and my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) tabled an Early Day Motion on 28 April 2009. More recently, Rita Donaghy&#146;s report into the underlying causes of fatalities in the construction sector, commissioned by the Department for Work and Pensions, was published on 9 July 2009 and recommended the extension of the GLA&#146;s remit to the construction sector. The Government will fully consider all the recommendations before responding later in the year.</p>

<i> [holding answer 20 July 2009]:</i> In 2008-09 the total cost of the maintenance grant and RAB cost of loans was around &#163;3,000 per student where the RAB charge represents the future cost to Government of subsidising and writing off the loans issued. &#163;3,000 is likely to be an under-estimate of providing an extra place in 2009-10 because it is partly based on students falling under less generous student support regulations than are in operation in 2009-10. The maximum total grant and RAB cost per entrant in 2009-10 is around &#163;5,200, therefore the academic year student support cost for the first year of study for 5,000 additional entrants in 2009 could be anything up to &#163;26 million; depending on students&#146; individual characteristics.</p>

The group included a number of university Vice-Chancellors and Presidents from the UK and USA, led by Professor John Sexton, President of New York University and Professor Rick Trainor, Prinicpal of King's College London. The report contains a very helpful analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of US/UK collaboration and recommends significant investment in a new programme of joint activities involving the US, UK and third country partners. Its recommendations are being considered in the context of the work on a framework for higher education over the next 10-15 years which is expected to be launched in the autumn.

 The HEFCE funding model for teaching is constructed in broad terms and generally allows institutions to vary the number and mix of students within a tolerance band of plus/minus 5 per cent, of a standard reference point. Other specific controls (minimum Full Time Equivalents (FTE)) required to satisfy the funding agreement) apply if institutions are awarded funded growth. Institutions are expected to deliver growth for which they have received additional funding, but are given two academic years to deliver a minimum target FTE student number. institutions can vire between full-time, part-time, undergraduate and postgraduate provision.</p>

Compliance with the codes is enforceable by Ofcom under the Communications Act and they can require telecoms providers to remedy the consequences of any breach and can ultimately levy a financial penalty (up to 10 per cent. of relevant turnover) if they do not do so.</p>

<i> </i><i> [holding answer</i><i>  3 July 2009]:</i> Train to Gain is a service for employers which puts buying power and information in their hands, giving them better access to a wider range of opportunities for improving the skills of their employees and the productivity of their business. Evaluations show that a wide spread of industry sectors are accessing the service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1744"><a name="90721w0148.htm_para7"><a name="09072344003328">The expenditure for Train to Gain is an operational matter for the national Learning and Skills Council (LSC). They do not generally break down information on Train to Gain spend by Sector Skill Council (SSC). However, they are able to provide a breakdown of learner starts by sector and actual costs where possible. I have asked Geoff Russell, the LSC's chief executive, to write to the hon. Member with the relevant information. A copy of his reply will be placed in the Library.</p>

The estimates for 2008 are from the Annual Population Survey (APS) which covers the period January to December, and the estimates for 2001 are from the Annual Local Area Labour Force Survey (ALALFS), the predecessor to the APS, which covers the period March 2001 to February 2002. Due to the small populations of local authorities, the LFS does not have large enough sample sizes to produce reliable estimates for geographies such as LEAs. Therefore we have used the latest APS (2008) which has a larger sample size, and have provided estimates for LEAs as estimates are too unreliable for smaller geographies. Please note that even for regions, sample sizes can be small and these estimates are subject to sampling variability. Numbers have been rounded to the nearest thousand, and typical confidence intervals for these percentages are between 2 and 3 percentage points for regional estimates, and between 3 and 9 percentage points for local authority estimates.</p>

 The regulations implementing the Working Time Directive in the UK apply to "workers". A "worker" is someone who works under a contract of employment or a contract to perform personally any work or services for another party whose status is not that of a client or customer. Holders of political and elected office are not regarded as "workers" and are therefore not covered by the regulations.</p>

 The OFT carried out a detailed investigation into Yes Loans and its business practices and on 13 July 2009 it imposed multiple requirements on the company to change its behaviour and to cease certain business practices. Any single failure to comply with these requirements, now or in the future, can result in a fine of up to &#163;50,000 per occasion.</p>
