 To ask the Prime Minister what papers he has submitted to date to Lord Butler&#039;s inquiry into intelligence on Iraq; and whether officials from his office have given oral evidence to the inquiry.  [177071]</p>








<p><a name="40608w01.html_spmin0"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 I refer my hon. Friend to the answer my hon. Friend the Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Mr. Rammell) gave to him on 8 June 2004, <i>Official Report, </i>column 303W.
</p>






<a name="40608w01.html_dpthd1"><h3 align=center>DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER</h3>

<a name="40608w01.html_sbhd1"><h3 align=center>Aston Down Airfield</h3>





<p><a name="40608w01.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what criteria are used in the planning system to decide when an environmental impact assessment is considered necessary; and what assessment he has made of whether such an assessment is required in respect of the proposed development at Aston Down Airfield, near Stroud in Gloucestershire.  [177598]</p>








<p><a name="40608w01.html_spnew0"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 In response to the first part of this question, I refer the hon. Member to the answer given on 27 April 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 885W. On 24 March 2003, a screening direction under the Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 1999 (SI 1999 No. 293) was issued to the effect that, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, the proposed development at Aston Down Airfield, near Stroud, would not be likely to have a significant effect on the environment by virtue of factors such as its nature, size or location.
</p>






<a name="40608w01.html_sbhd2"><h3 align=center>Ellipse Project</h3>





<p><a name="40608w01.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Steen: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how many letters he has received about the decision made by Westminster council to approve The Ellipse project for the Royal College of Art; how many requests he has received to meet those opposed to the decision of the council&#039;s planning committee; what plans he has to call in the council&#039;s planning decision; and if he will make a statement.  [176698]</p>








<p><a name="40608w01.html_spnew1"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has received over 10,000 representations, the majority of which objected to the proposal by the Royal College of Art for an extension building, known as the &quot;Ellipse&quot;. A number of requests were also received to meet those opposed to the proposal but it is not standard practice to do so when a planning application is formally before my right hon. Friend the Deputy 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Jun 2004 : Column 276W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Prime Minister for consideration on whether it should be called in. The hon. Member will be interested to know that my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister called in these proposals on 19 May 2004. A copy of the decision will be made available in the Library of the House.

<a name="40608w01.html_sbhd3"><h3 align=center>Firefighters&#039; Dispute</h3>





<p><a name="40608w01.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Weir: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister (1) what action he has taken to bring the sides together to discuss the difficulties encountered with the agreement to end the firefighters&#039; dispute;  [177029]




</p>



<p>(2) what discussions he has had with the employers&#039; organisations regarding fulfilling the obligations undertaken to end the firefighters&#039; dispute.  [177030]</p>









<p><a name="40608w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has had no such discussions and taken no such action. The June 2003 agreement, which ended the firefighters&#039; dispute, set out a clear path for pay improvement linked to modernisation of the Fire and Rescue Service subject to some further negotiations. I understand that discussions between the employee representatives and their employers are continuing. Negotiation is clearly the way forward.


</p>







<p><a name="40608w01.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Weir: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what representations he has received regarding difficulties with the agreement which ended the firefighters&#039; dispute.  [177031]</p>








<p><a name="40608w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has received a handful of representations on these issues both directly and through ministerial colleagues and constituency MPs. Letters originated from members of the public, serving members of the Fire and Rescue Service and the Fire Brigades Union. In addition, Andy Gilchrist, General Secretary of the Fire Brigades Union wrote to all Members of Parliament on 17 May 2004 setting out the Union&#039;s views on the detailed negotiations with employers following the June 2003 pay and conditions agreement.

<p><a name="40608w01.html_wqn5"><b> Mrs. Brooke: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what steps he has taken to inform members of the public about how they can participate in the consultation on high hedges.  [176912]</p>








<p><a name="40608w01.html_spnew4"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister issued a press release launching the public consultation on the high hedges legislation on 29 March. The announcement was covered in three national and a number of local newspapers, by national radio stations and some regional TV. The consultation package has been sent to a number of organisations with a special interest, for example, Hedgeline, the Consumer&#039;s Association, the National Consumer Council, the National Federation of Consumer Groups, the Royal Horticultural Society and the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. It is also available on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s website and on UK Online.

There were three hearings in the North West, at Blackburn, Liverpool and Kendal. Ministers have also visited the North West as part of cross-regional tours in inform voters of our policy and on other occasions.

Where analysis of this monitoring reveals any disparities, we will take appropriate action to address concerns. The results of monitoring, and impact of action taken to address issues identified will be reported to the Departmental Management Board.

The Department reviewed its recruitment processes between November 2003 to January 2004. The findings are yet to be analysed, however, once analysis has taken place we will carry out implementation as appropriate.

<p>
<a name="40608w03.html_para4">
We have delivered training events on race awareness for staff involved interviewing and chairing for recruitment and promotions. In addition to this, we have held race equality impact assessment training for key staff, and race equality is featured in our Valuing Diversity programme of events being run throughout 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40608w03.html_para5">
In 2003, we delivered diversity awareness workshops for untrained staff. The workshops were designed to challenge some of the stereotypes and misconceptions some managers might have about the ability of minority ethnic staff. We set up a Steering Group, with representation from the trade unions and our minority ethnic staff support network, to develop a career development programme for minority ethnic staff. It is hoped that the programme, to be launched early in 2005, might have some impact in helping to address their under-representation in more senior grades.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40608w03.html_para6">
The Department conducted a staff survey in November 2003. Among the outcomes were that 64 per cent. of black staff felt that they were treated with dignity and respect, compared to 76 per cent. of white employees although these differences are not statistically significant. Compared to benchmarking data on race, the Department for Transport performs well against other public sector organisations in those who claimed to have been unfairly treated on account of their race. The departmental figure is 3 per cent. below the benchmark.

 The international community, including the UK, is responding to the need for security throughout Afghanistan with increased commitments of troops and resources, including extension of the network of Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs). Deploying additional PRTs is the key to expansion of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The UK is at the forefront of this, having agreed to lead a second PRT and provide a Forward Support Base for all PRTs in the North. But ISAF expansion can only proceed once NATO&#039;s statement of requirements is fully met and we are pressing other nations to contribute the resources needed to meet existing shortfalls.

Women&#039;s rights in Afghanistan are protected by the new Constitution, ratified in January 2004. The Constitution contains specific articles on women&#039;s equality and rights to political participation.

Rape and forced marriage are both prohibited by Afghanistan&#039;s obligations under the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the UN Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, both of which Afghanistan has ratified.

 We have not sought to change the mandate of the Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs). They are not resourced to focus purely on security, nor is that their purpose. PRTs aim to extend the authority of the central Government by facilitating reconstruction and security sector reform. Although small in size, we believe that PRTs are succeeding in achieving this through the beneficial effect they have on the security environment in the areas in which they operate. This has certainly been borne out by our experience with the UK-led PRT in Mazar-e Sharif.

Many of our overseas missions employ private security contractors but the detailed information requested on the numbers involved is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate costs. The majority of these contracts provide personnel to work as static guards at our missions and at staff accommodation in countries where the security situation warrants that level of protection. In some of our high-risk posts we use contract guards to provide a quick reaction force and to act as individual bodyguards. The costs of these contract guards fall under administration and programme budgets, which are devolved to regional and functional directorates within the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The directorates then disburse funds to posts. Not including Iraq, approximately &#163;6 million was allocated to fund contract guarding in the financial year 2003&#150;04.

<p><a name="40608w10.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Browne  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 27 May 2004 ]:</i> China is prepared to accept back failed asylum seekers from the UK in principle. However, the Chinese have very strict conditions for re-documenting their nationals to enable repatriation. This issue is at the forefront of our bilateral relations with the Chinese and the my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister underlined the importance of finding a solution to the problem of undocumented returns during his discussions with the Chinese Premier earlier this month. We have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Chinese on co-operation on illegal immigration, which will provide a framework to take forward our discussions with the Chinese to improve the system of returning failed asylum seekers as a matter of urgency.

<p><a name="40608w11.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what his Department&#039;s plans are to tackle child sex tourism.  [172797]</p>








<p><a name="40608w11.html_spnew1"><b> Paul Goggins </b> 
<i>[holding answer 17 May 2004]:</i> The Government are committed to eradicating the sexual exploitation of children, including where British citizens go abroad to abuse children. We have put in place comprehensive legislation to deal with this problem:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Section 72 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 enables courts in England and Wales and Northern Ireland to deal with British citizens or residents who commit sexual offences against children abroad. Similar provisions apply in Scotland.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998 makes it an offence for a person to conspire to commit an offence outside the UK, including sexual offences against children.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40608w11.html_para3">
In addition, the Sexual Offences Act 2003 has introduced a new civil preventive order aimed at protecting children abroad from UK sex offenders. The foreign travel order is targeted specifically against paedophile sex tourists&#151;those who travel overseas to abuse young children because the opportunities to do so are more available in some countries than in the UK. It enables the courts to prevent those with a conviction for a sexual offence against a child aged under 16 from travelling abroad where there is evidence that they may cause serious sexual harm to children aged under 16 overseas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40608w11.html_para4">
The Sexual Offences Act 2003 also includes a new order which enables the courts to make offenders who have received convictions or cautions for sexual offences overseas (whether they are British citizens or foreign nationals) subject to the notification requirements (&quot;the sex offenders register&quot;) of Part 2 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 if they come to the UK.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40608w11.html_para5">
The Government have also made regulations which reduce the period that &quot;registered&quot; sex offenders can intend to spend abroad before they have to notify the police form eight days to three days. The police can, and do, pass this information to other jurisdictions where they believe it will prevent the offender from committing an offence overseas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40608w11.html_para6">
Finally, a working group has been established to further examine the issue of combating child sex tourism. This group includes representatives for Government Departments, the travel industry, NGOs and the police. The Home Office is also funding a research project, managed by ECPAT UK, aimed at identifying the best channels through which we can raise awareness of child sex tourism.

[174968]</p>








<p><a name="40608w11.html_spnew4"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 Further and higher education colleges offer a variety of courses in community safety for Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs).

<p><a name="40608w12.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Evans: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimate he has made of the number of people from EU accession countries living and working in the UK; and how many of those he estimates are working illegally.  [161816]</p>








<p><a name="40608w12.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 During the period September to November 2003, an estimated 113,000 nationals of the 10 EU accession countries were resident in the United Kingdom. Of these, 51,000 were in employment, 48,000 were economically inactive, 10,000 were aged under 16 and less than 10,000 were ILO unemployed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40608w12.html_para0">
Official estimates of the size of the illegally working migrant population in the United Kingdom do not exist. The Government have commissioned research into the methods used in other countries to estimate the size of their illegal populations (illegal workers forming part of this population) in order to define methods appropriate for the UK. Further research is also planned to investigate illegal working in order to help the Government tackle the problem more effectively.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40608w12.html_para1">
The work required is challenging because, by definition, illegal migrants fall outside of official statistics and are therefore difficult to measure. People illegally present in the UK are also motivated to ensure they remain hidden, which is a challenge to conducting research.

<i>[holding answer 13 May 2004]:</i> On 1 May 2004, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Cyprus and Malta became members of the European Union and asylum seekers from these countries ceased to be eligible for support from the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) or a local authority under the Asylum Support (Interim Provisions) Regulations 1999. Immigration Nationality Directorate officials wrote to all those affected to ensure that they were aware of their options after 1 May. Letters were sent on 5 and 6 April to those supported directly by NASS and on 16 April to those supported by local authorities. The letters explained the options available, namely to obtain work and register under the Worker Registration Scheme (except for those from Cyprus and Malta who are not required to register), to remain in the UK but become self supporting, or to return to their country of origin.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40608w12.html_para2">
The letters advised those affected that they could look for work immediately but that they could not take up that work until 1 May unless they already had been given permission to work by the Home Office. The letters also advised those affected that they could approach their embassy or consulate for advice on returning.
</p>


<p>

Accession state nationals who wish to make an application for a workers registration card whose passports are being held by the Home Office should indicate this on the workers registration form. Their documentation will then be considered alongside the application.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether an identity card card reader will be available for purchase by the general public under proposals in the draft Identity Cards Bill and consultation document (Cm 6178).  [173128]</p>








<p><a name="40608w12.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 There are a number of potential options for card readers, ranging from biometric readers which might be used to verify identity securely, to card readers on personal computers which might be able to verify the authenticity of the card. At present no firm decisions have been made on card reader specification. The Identity Cards Programme is investigating these options and evaluating them, looking particularly at how they might be used by potential user organisations and the privacy and security issues which arise from these options.

<p><a name="40608w12.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 Where an individual attempts to enrol twice into the identity cards scheme using separate identities, it is essential that the second enrolment is detected by making a successful match against the biometric already enrolled by that individual. This form of negative matching is a common feature of existing biometric systems, including the police National Automated Fingerprint Identification Service (NAFIS) system and the on-going United Kingdom Passport Service (UKPS) biometric trial.
</p>


<p>

The identity cards programme is at an early stage in investigating the details of the requirement for matching within a large database, the design of feasibility work to test it and the technical solutions to deliver it.

 The current status of Iraqi asylum seekers, who were refused refugee status and other forms of protection in the UK in 2003, will depend on whether they have appealed against this decision, and if so what the outcome of the appeal was.

 &quot;Suicide watch&#039; is not a term used by the Prison Service.

The inherent vulnerability of many women in custody, combined with the high levels of self-harm across women&#039;s prisons, results in a very large number of women prisoners presenting themselves as requiring special care, and being made subject to the &quot;Self-Harm At Risk Form&#039; F2052SH procedures.

The number of self-inflicted deaths and level of self-harm among women prisoners is recognised as a very serious concern by the Prison Service and Ministers. The main principles of the outline suicide prevention strategy that I announced on 31 March 2004 apply across all types of prisons and to all prisoners, whether male or female. Women prisoners are to benefit from a specifically targeted and separate suicide prevention and self-harm management strategy being developed for them. This builds upon a number of interventions including: individual crisis counselling for women prisoners who self-harm; the continued development and evaluation of Dialectical Behaviour Therapy, which is currently being trialled at Durham, Bullwood Hall and Holloway prisons; investment and planning to ensure progress on the detoxification strategy in women&#039;s prisons; and the introduction of a new training pack for all staff working with women in custody, which includes a module on the health and well being of women prisoners. &#163;1 million from the Department of Health has been allocated to women&#039;s prisons to be spent on the recruitment of psychiatric nurses.

 Prior to 1997 the Race Relations Act (RRA) 1976 already prohibited discrimination on racial grounds. The RRA did not specifically refer to harassment, but it was clear from case law that racial harassment was a type of detriment capable of amounting to the kind of less favourable treatment prohibited by the Act.

As part of its fulfilment of its obligations under the EC Race Directive the UK amended the Race Relations Act 1976 (by virtue of the Race Relations Act 1976 (Amendment) Regulations 2003) so as to make it unlawful to harass a person, on grounds of race or ethnic or national origins, in the areas of activity covered by the 1976 Act.

The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 created new and separate offences where the offences of causing fear and violence or of causing harassment, alarm or distress under the Public Order Act 1986, or the offences of harassment or putting in fear of violence under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 were racially aggravated. Figures for the number of prosecutions in Preston for this type of offence are not centrally available. Lancashire police figures for harassment offences (published by the Home Office under the requirements of S95 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991) show a total of 717 recorded offences of this type in the Lancashire police area over the period 1999&#150;2000 to 2001&#150;02.

<p><a name="40608w16.html_spnew2"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Under the National Offender Management Service prison governors will continue to be accountable for the running of prisons. Over time regional offender managers will become responsible for ensuring the effective management of all offenders regardless of whether they have received a custodial or community sentence or a combination of the two. They will also commission services from prisons in the public and private sectors and specify standards to which each should perform. The regional offender managers will be line managed by the national offender manager who will report directly to the chief executive and will be responsible for reducing re-offending.

 The first private prison opened in 1992. Figures for the number and percentage of prisoners re-convicted within two years of discharge from prison are given in Prison Statistics, England and Wales, 2002. Table 9.1 shows reconviction rates for samples of discharged prisoners in each of the years 1987 to 1999. The related text explains that to compare reconviction rates over time it is necessary to control for changes in the characteristics of discharged prisoners, such as age and previous criminal history, which are strongly associated with reconviction rates.

<a name="40608w17.html_para2">
The Sexual Offences Act 2003 introduced a new civil order&#151;the notification order. This order enables offenders who have been convicted or cautioned for a sexual offence overseas to be made subject to the notification requirements of Part 2 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. The notification order is an important new tool which will help the police and probation services manage offenders who have committed sexual offences overseas.

The police can also apply to the courts for a sexual offences prevention order (SOPO) to be made against an offender convicted of a sexual offence overseas who is living in the UK and who poses a risk of serious sexual harm. A SOPO can set prohibitions on an offender and will also make him subject to the notification requirements for the duration of the order.

If it becomes necessary to close a care home, councils, acting both as commissioners and providers, should seek to achieve this in a planned way.

Councils are obliged to comply with statutory obligations and relevant case law. When a home does have to close, the essential thing is that proper arrangements are made for the safe and satisfactory transfer of all residents to other suitable homes. There should be adequate time for this to be done, in a way that allows both residents and their relatives a choice in where they are to move to and which creates the minimum possible discomfort to all concerned.

The Secretary of State does not intervene in decisions of this nature at local level. The relevant legislation and the Secretary of State&#039;s Approvals and Directions set out the extent of council&#039;s obligations to provide services to persons in their area. The council has statutory obligations to meet the needs of any residents it has placed in these homes, and if the homes are closed, it must ensure that those obligations are fulfilled in some other way. It must also comply with its obligations to consult all residents and to take into account their views. It is a matter for all councils to ensure that they comply with their legal obligations. If they do not, this may be challenged through local complaints procedures, the commissioner for local administration, and through the courts.

Notes:<br>

1. Data tor 1979&#150;90 are based on the international Passenger Survey (IPS) only. Data for 1991&#150;2002 are based mainly on data from the IPS but also include adjustments for (1) those whose intended length of stay changes so that their migrant status changes; (2) asylum seekers and their dependants not covered by the IPS; and (3) flows between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. This means that figures for years from 1991 onwards include all categories of migrants and therefore represent total international migration, while figures for years Drier to 1991 exclude certain categories.<br>

2. The estimates for years from 1991 onwards are compiled using the following main sources of migration data in addition to the IPS: Home Office data on asylum seekers and their dependants, and people who entered the UK as short-term visitors but were subsequently granted an extension of stay for a year or longer for other reasons, for example, as students or on the basis of marriage; and estimates of migration between the UK and the Irish Republic.<br>

<p class="tabletext">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your parliamentary question on modifications to the ONS Environmental Accounts report. (177267)</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The information on greenhouse gas emissions from transport were not removed from the ONS Environmental Accounts report published on 20 May 2004. The report was never altered from the version originally prepared by professional statisticians within ONS, and is publicly available on the National Statistics website.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The focus of the accompanying News Release changed during drafting, as there were some unresolved statistical concerns over the reconciliation of road freight emissions figures using alternative definitions. Given these concerns, it was decided that it would not be appropriate for the News Release to focus upon transport emissions as had been intended. This decision was taken independently by senior Government statisticians, as a matter of professional judgement.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The circumstances surrounding this decision are explained in a letter that I sent to David Rowlands (Permanent Secretary of the Department for Transport) on 28 May. This letter is available on the website of the Statistics Commission at: http://www.statscom.org.uk/media pdfs/correspondence/letter0189.pdf</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The ONS operates in accordance with the &quot;Framework for National Statistics&quot; and follows the principles and procedures set out in the &quot;National Statistics Code of Practice&quot; and its supporting &quot;Protocols&quot;. One of the key principles within the &quot;Code of Practice&quot; states that National Statistics will be &quot;fit for purpose and of high quality&quot;. Our concerns about the reconciliation of the emissions data led us to make the professional judgement that these measures, while of publishable quality, were not fit for the purpose of being the focus of a high-profile news release.</p>
</ul>
