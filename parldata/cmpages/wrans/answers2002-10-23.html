To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) what the Government's target for growth in rail freight is over the next 10 years;  [75012]
<P>

<P>
<a name="21023w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Strategic Rail Authority has published both a Freight Strategy and a Strategic Plan (copies are in the House Libraries), which detail its plans for achieving the rail freight growth envisaged by the Government's 10 Year Plan for Transport. A revised Strategic Plan is due to be published in January 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment has been made by or for his Department on changes in the accident rate on roads with speed cameras; and if he will place copies in the Library.  [75603]<P>

<P>
<a name="21023w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Speed enforcement cameras have proved to be highly effective at reducing speeding and, when sited at dangerous sites or along problem routes, have in the first year of the pilot scheme on average reduced the number of those killed and seriously injured by 47 per cent. In some areas the reduction has been even greater. A report of the cost recovery system for the eight pilot areas in the traffic safety camera scheme will be published shortly and will be made available in the Libraries of the House.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment is made by or for his Department of the performance of <i>(a)</i> the Northern Lighthouse Board and <i>(b)</i> the Health and Safety Commission including performance targets; what reports have been published on its performance; and if he will place in the Library copies of such reports that are not readily available.  [75600]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21023w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Northern Lighthouse Board (NLB) measures the availability of the aids to navigation against the service standards set by the International Association of Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities (IALA). These performance indicators are set out in the Report and Accounts of the General Lighthouse Fund 2000&#150;2001, a copy of which has been placed in the Library of the House. They indicate that most aids to navigation provided by the Board exceed the IALA standards for availability for use.

 Warning of the dangers of speeding is an integral part of the Department's publicity strategy. An integrated communications campaign incorporating TV, radio, press and poster advertising has run since 1991 supported by local road safety officers. An ongoing monthly tracking study has shown that this publicity has helped create and sustain a high level support for road safety measures which encourage people to slow down. In this time the number of people killed and seriously injured on the roads has reduced significantly.

(Wave 2 result 93 per cent., Wave 1 result 88 per cent.) of the answers given were completely accurate and reflects an improvement across the regions but particularly for some of the long distance call types.

<P>

<a name="21023w02.html_para8">The EU Food Supplements Directive requires that the safety of concentrated sources of vitamins and minerals used as ingredients in food supplements be approved by the European Union scientific committee on food before use. Consequently, the Directive is likely to have the effect of encouraging research into the safety of these ingredients.
<P>

<a name="21023w02.html_para9">The possible impact of the proposed Directive on traditional herbal medicinal products on research and development is difficult to predict. Under the current regime in the United Kingdom for unlicensed herbal remedies it will not normally be clear to the purchaser of a remedy whether that remedy is brought to the market on the basis of evidence of efficacy of the product, of traditional usage, or some other factor. The proposed Directive should, over time, bring greater clarity to the market on this issue, which may be beneficial to the prospects for research and development.

<a name="21023w02.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply
<P>

<a name="21023w02.html_para10">In the short-term the EU Food Supplements Directive is unlikely to have any effect upon the retail sector. In the longer-term, the impact of the Directive will depend upon progress in adding vitamin and minerals and their sources to the lists of permitted nutrients in the Directive and upon developments in the setting of maximum limits for vitamins and minerals in food supplements. The Food Standards Agency is arguing the case for these maximum limits to be based on thorough scientific risk assessments so that there is no unnecessary restriction on the range of products that can be marketed.
<P>

<a name="21023w02.html_para11">The proposed Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products could have positive consequences for employment in the retail sector. The proposals would require traditional herbal remedies to meet standards as to quality, safety and product information,

areas in which the current regime for unlicensed herbal remedies has significant weaknesses. More effective regulation, which would follow if there is a successful outcome to the negotiations, potentially could enhance the status and recognition of traditional herbal remedies. This in turn could help to maintain and increase public confidence and ultimately lead to an expansion in the sector. Our aim in the continuing negotiations, and in the implementation of the Directive if it is agreed, will be to ensure that the regulation is proportionate.

 <i>[holding answer 22 October 2002]:</i> The Director of the SFO is already entitled, under Section 1 (3) of the Criminal Justice Act 1987, to investigate any offence that appears to her on reasonable grounds to involve serious or complex fraud. Offences of corruption and money laundering are therefore already included in the range of offences open to the SFO to investigate provided they meet key criteria. Amongst others, these include where the sum at risk is estimated to be at least #1 million or the case is likely to give rise to national publicity and widespread public concern or the case has a significant international dimension. All or some of these factors can be present in an allegation of corruption or money laundering and if so then the SFO may investigate.
<P>

<a name="21023w03.html_para0">The SFO has, in fact, successfully investigated and prosecuted 10 cases involving offences of corruption and/or money laundering since its inception in 1988. These cases have led to prison sentences or suspended sentences for the defendants, often coupled with disqualification from acting as a company director. The SFO is also currently investigating several similar allegations.

<a name="21023w03.html_para4">Following a tender exercise an agreement was entered into between Defra and two companies: Scottish Power and TXU Energi.

 The Department has received a number of representations concerning the application by Greece to register ''feta'' as a protected food name. Throughout all the discussions on this issue (at official and Ministerial level), the UK has opposed the Greek application on the grounds that we believed that the name ''feta'' had become a generic and so not eligible for protection.

<a name="21023w05.html_spnew0"><B> Andrew Smith: </B> 
 In order to ensure a robust evaluation of the standard local housing allowance scheme, we have drawn up a list of key factors against which pathfinders should be chosen. This includes a broad range of housing and labour market conditions in England, Wales and Scotland.
<P>

<a name="21023w05.html_para0">The pathfinder areas will represent variety in market and economic activity and will represent a range of high, medium and low house prices and rental values. They include a mixture of rural, urban, suburban and city areas. They will also provide a sufficient sample size, as those taking part must have a caseload of at least 2,500 claimants in the de-regulated Private Rented Sector, of whom at least 1,600 must have claimed under the rent rules introduced in 1996 and 1997.
<P>

<a name="21023w05.html_para1">Further conditions affecting the choice of pathfinder areas include the current state of Housing Benefit administration, the capacity of IT systems, and the need to avoid those local authorities already piloting other Government initiatives.
<P>

<a name="21023w05.html_para2">Based on these criteria, we have invited the following local authorities to take part: Brighton and Hove, Conwy, Coventry, Edinburgh, Leeds, London Borough of Lewisham, Middlesborough, North East Lincolnshire, Teignbridge and Tendring.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on progress made to date on the target to halve unemployment among 18 to 24-year-olds by 2010 throughout the European Union set at the European Council's meeting at Lisbon.  [75249]<P>

<P>
<a name="21023w05.html_spnew1"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Lisbon European Council in 2000 set targets to increase employment rates rather than reduce youth unemployment rates. It agreed that, by 2010, the EU should aim to increase its total employment rate to 70 per cent. and to increase the employment rate for women to 60 per cent. The Commission and the Council will issue a Joint Employment Report in November 2002, which will

<P><I>23 Oct 2002 : Column 316W</I><P>
provide the latest available data against these and other targets set at Lisbon, as well as summarise action being taken by Member States to achieve them.
<P>

<a name="21023w05.html_para3">Current Eurostat figures show that between August 2000 and August 2001, EU youth unemployment (15&#150;24) fell from 15.3 per cent. to a low of 14.6 per cent., before rising again to 15.3 per cent. in June 2002. Latest figures for each Member State are given below. The European Employment Strategy, the main instrument for action to increase employment, will operate in a revised form from next year, and will focus more clearly on reaching the employment rate goals agreed at Lisbon.

<a name="21023w05.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Nigel Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will assess the impact on employment in the <i>(a)</i> research and development, <i>(b)</i> manufacturing, <i>(c)</i> wholesale and <i>(d)</i> retail sectors of the European Food Supplement Directive and the proposed European Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products; and if he will make a statement. [75812]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21023w05.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="21023w05.html_para7">The Food Supplements Directive is likely to have a positive impact upon employment in the research and development sector. The Directive demands that the safety of concentrated sources of vitamins and minerals used as ingredients in food supplements be approved by the European Union Scientific Committee on Food before use, and is therefore likely to encourage related research.
<P>

<a name="21023w05.html_para8">In the short-term the EU Food Supplements Directive is unlikely to have any effect upon employment in the manufacturing, wholesale or retail sectors. In the longer-term, the impact of the Directive will largely depend upon progress in adding vitamin and minerals and their sources to the lists of permitted nutrients in the Directive and upon developments in the setting of maximum limits for vitamins and minerals in food supplements. The Food Standards Agency is arguing the case for these maximum limits to be based on thorough scientific risk assessments so that there is no unnecessary restriction on the range of products that can be marketed.
<P>

<a name="21023w05.html_para9">The possible impact of the proposed Directive on traditional herbal medicinal products on employment in the research and development sector is difficult to predict. Under the current regime in the United Kingdom for unlicensed herbal remedies it will not normally be clear to the purchaser of a remedy whether that remedy is brought to the market on the basis of evidence of efficacy of the product, of traditional usage, or some other factor. The proposed Directive should, over time, bring greater clarity to the market on this issue, which may be beneficial to the prospects for research and development.
<P>

<a name="21023w05.html_para10">The proposed Directive potentially could have positive consequences for employment in the manufacturing, wholesale and retail sectors. The proposals would require traditional herbal remedies to meet standards as to quality, safety and product information, areas in which the current regime for unlicensed herbal remedies has significant weaknesses. More effective regulation, which would follow if there is a successful outcome to the negotiations, potentially could enhance the status and recognition of traditional herbal remedies. This in turn could help to maintain and increase public confidence and ultimately lead to an expansion in the sector. The Medicines Control Agency's aim in the continuing negotiations, and in the implementation of the Directive if it is agreed, will be to ensure that the regulation is proportionate.

 Import liberalisation, properly managed, can contribute to sustainable and poverty-reducing economic growth. Cross-country evidence shows that trade liberalisation increases economic growth and that economic growth, in turn, tends to reduce poverty on average. Trade openness contributes to poverty reduction by stimulating productivity and reducing domestic consumer prices. However, the relationship differs substantially from country to country. Complementarity and sequencing of supporting policies within an overall long-term development strategy are essential to the success of trade liberalisation. A country will typically have to implement some or all of the following complementary policies:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>trade-related capacity building, to formulate a sound trade strategy, participate successfully in international trade negotiations and implement WTO requirements;</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="21023w05.html_para13">Domestic reform, however, will often not be sufficient. Developing countries face high tariff and non-tariff barriers in sectors of importance, notably agriculture and textiles and clothing. As tariffs are lowered, new forms of protection become more prominent, such as anti-dumping and excessive product

standards and technical regulations. Such issues need to be addressed in future trade negotiations to ensure that international trade rules are more developmental.
<P>

<a name="21023w05.html_para14">The Integrated Framework (IF) is a policy initiative by six international agencies, with participation by donors and developing countries. DFID is playing a prominent role in its implementation. It represents an attempt to respond to the need for trade reforms to be implemented carefully and with the appropriate mix of complementary policies. Under the Integrated Framework, existing trade-related policies in a country are assessed and further needs identified. The Integrated Framework tries to facilitate the formulation of a coherent trade policy that fosters sustainable and poverty-reducing economic growth.
<P>

<a name="21023w05.html_para15">DFID has been at the forefront of developing and promoting trade policies that address the risks associated with import liberalisation. All our trade-related work is geared towards making trade work for the poorest. DFID is trying to raise awareness of the need for sound trade policies at all levels: within DFID itself, in our country offices, within Whitehall and at the WTO.
<P>

<a name="21023w05.html_para16">DFID believes that the trade policy it has developed to address the challenges of trade liberalisation contains the kind of advice and experience that contribute to sustainable and poverty-reducing development ant that it can usefully recommend such policies to policy makers in developing countries. In general, developing countries have responded positively to DFID's trade policy, as is clear for example from the recent review of the Ghana Trade Policy Project.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21023w06.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 2001 was an atypical year for poppy cultivation because of a ban imposed by the Taliban regime. After the fall of the Taliban there was a resurgence in poppy planting, and estimates of area cultivated are only slightly less than that in 2000. This is in spite of a Decree by the Afghan Interim Administration in January 2002 banning the production and processing of opium, and an eradication and compensation scheme which destroyed an estimated 25&#150;30 per cent. of the crop. We are hopeful that poppy cultivation will decline as the international community promotes efforts to create alternative livelihood opportunities for farmers, and to improve the interdiction capacity by the Afghan authorities charged with enforcing the ban. This is only likely to come about as security is maintained and the reconstruction process gathers momentum.
<P>

<a name="21023w06.html_para0">My Department is committed to supporting measures that will help to develop alternative livelihood opportunities for poor people, including in poppy growing areas, in order that there is a consistent shift away from both poverty and poppy cultivation.

The World Bank funded National Solidarity Programme will also be a further significant contribution to community based development. My Department is also planning to provide assistance to the Ministry of Rural Reconstruction and Development within Afghanistan to develop a sustainable approach towards generating alternative livelihoods, including in poppy growing areas.

 DFID will contribute approximately #12million over the period 1999 to 2004 to the rural water sector in Nepal through 3 NGOs&#151;Nepal Water for Health (NEWAH), Gurkha Welfare Scheme (GWS) and Helvetas.
<P>

<a name="21023w06.html_para5">The GWS Rural Water and Sanitation Programme receives #7.9 million from DFID to help selected hill village communities access safe water and sanitation, manage their water systems efficiently and, through hygiene education, use water effectively. NEWAH receives #2.7 million from DFID to implement a similar approach in the Mid and Far West for communities that would not be reached by GWS. Since January 2001, DFID has also provided approximately #1.5 million in short and medium term support to water related programmes of Helvetas that are designed to improve living conditions of socially and economically disadvantaged communities in Nepal. The location of physical investments through these programmes has been affected by the conflict, and there has been some movement, by NEWAH in particular, to safer districts. However expenditures overall are on target.

 I met with the High Commissioner for Refugees on 4 July when we discussed UK support to Afghanistan and other issues. Our officials remain in close contact.
<P>

<a name="21023w06.html_para8">My department has provided significant support to UNHCR to assist with the repatriation of refugees to Afghanistan. Since September 2001, the UK has contributed over #5 million to UNHCR for their programmes of assistance to Afghan refugees. In addition we have provided over #3.5 million to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) for assistance to internally displaced persons (IDPs) and returnees to Afghanistan. We are also supporting a number of other humanitarian programmes which will help to create an environment for the sustainable return of both refugees and IDPs.
<P>

<a name="21023w06.html_para9">In addition, earlier this month the governments of Afghanistan and the United Kingdom and UNHCR signed a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) setting out a detailed framework for the voluntary repatriation of Afghans residing in the UK and their reintegration back in Afghanistan. Under the agreement, UNHCR will provide information and counselling to Afghans in the UK&#151;to ensure that any decision to repatriate is taken in the ''full knowledge of the facts''. UNHCR will also monitor the voluntariness of the returns prior to departure, as well as other aspects of the agreement&#151;a role that both states have pledged to respect. Similarly, once returnees are back in Afghanistan, the agency has guaranteed access to them from the moment they land at the airport. UNHCR believes that the MoU contains all the necessary safeguards to ensure that Afghans who still need international refugee protection continue to receive it and that returns under the agreement would be sustainable. A similar tripartite agreement had earlier been signed with the French government. It is hoped that the MoU will become a model for other countries who are interested in offering assisted voluntary repatriation for Afghans.

 I attach a table of estimated disbursals produced by the Afghan Assistance Coordination Authority (AACA). This was produced for the recent Implementation Group meeting in Afghanistan and outlines donor's pledges, commitments and disbursals for 2002, as known to the AACA. It is currently estimated that overall 67 per cent. of 2002's pledge has been disbursed.

 Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia have all qualified for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Both Malawi and Zambia have reached their Decision Point and are already receiving interim debt relief. Malawi's estimated debt service payments for the first six months of 2002 is US$35.5 million, and Zambia's foreign debt service was US$24 million in the first four months of 2002. Mozambique has completed the HIPC process and is receiving full debt relief. In 2002, Mozambique is scheduled to pay US$56 million in debt service. Following debt relief, resources are being freed up for social expenditure to reduce poverty in these countries.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what impact she estimates the dispute over non-acceptance by African Governments of genetically-modified grain supplied by the World Food Programme will have on famine relief efforts in the region.  [76100]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21023w07.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Zambia is the only country which has refused so far to accept grain containing genetically modified material. The effect is to make it more difficult for the World Food Programme to meet emergency needs in the country. Over the months of October and November around 27,000 tonnes which are in the pipeline (about 40 per cent. of the food aid requirements for the two months) will not be distributed in Zambia if the current ban is maintained. In that case, it seems likely that the Government of Zambia would have to resort to more expensive and slower options in order to meet the needs.

 Some 14 million people in southern Africa are at risk and face severe food shortages. Within this number vulnerability varies. Many people are exceptionally vulnerable because they have HIV or AIDS.

 All of the #44.75 million I committed in June 2002 has been allocated to programmes which are now under way. Further allocations were made before that and since bringing total UK support to #72.08 million. Figures for expenditure against commitments are not available for other donors; but the US is well on its way to delivering its commitment of 500,000 tonnes of grain for calendar 2002, and the European Commission has met its commitment to provide

<P>
<a name="21023w07.html_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Staff from our offices in Malawi and Zambia have been involved in discussions with the World Food Programme and Governments on the acceptance of grain containing genetically modified material as food aid. In Malawi the Government has proposed that GM maize is milled before distribution. We and other donors are discussing how to do this with minimum delay in distribution to beneficiaries. In Zimbabwe DFID officials have supported the World Food Programme in negotiations with the Government over the acceptance of such grain, but have had no direct contact with the Government. I have spoken and written to President Mwanawasa of Zambia on this issue, and my Department hosted a fact finding visit by Zambian scientist to London on 23 and 24 September.

 We have spent #72.08 million on humanitarian assistance in Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Lesotho and Swaziland since September 2001. This is going towards feeding programmes, other essential supplies, agricultural inputs for the next season, logistics and personal support for the World Food Programme. Through our Southern Africa Humanitarian Crisis Unit in Johannesburg we are helping to strengthen and co-ordinate the international response.

 There is mixed evidence on the effectiveness of infant industry protection. We believe that a multilateral trade system built on the principles of non-discrimination and market opening, combined with providing assistance to enterprise development across the board, is the best way of increasing the efficiency and competitiveness in developing countries.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what additional resources are <i>(a)</i> available and <i>(b)</i> planned for local authorities with the duty to provide integration strategies for asylum seekers granted exceptional leave to remain.  [73690]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21023w08.html_spnew0"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Secretary of State is empowered under Section 110 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 to pay grants to organisations in respect of expenditure incurred in connection with persons who are or have been asylum seekers and their dependants. The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) may grant fund Regional Consortia for their enabling role in providing services and support for asylum seekers dispersed to their region. A grant agreement exists between NASS and the Regional Consortia to facilitate payment, a key element of which is to develop, implement and deliver a strategy for resettlement and integration for those who are granted leave to remain in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="21023w08.html_para0">The enabling grant is payable for each financial year and is increased proportionately to cover the costs of the enabling authority.
<P>

<a name="21023w08.html_para1">Additionally, the Home Office has distributed #1.5 million through the Refugee Integration Challenge Fund of which around #340,000 has been given to local authorities in order that they may implement pilot projects in the field of refugee integration. Around #1.7 million of the European Refugee Fund 2002, provided by the European Commission, has also been awarded to local authorities for similar projects. It is the intention that these projects will be robustly evaluated in order to identify good practice and so inform future policy making.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21023w08.html_spnew1"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The support package announced on 20 August 2002 is fully operational. The costs of the programme include the resettlement grant payment, flight costs and funding for implementing agencies who will counsel returnees and arrange their return. The cost 



<P>
<P><I>23 Oct 2002 : Column 330W</I><P>
of this programme depends on the number of participants, and sufficient funds are available for up to 1000 returns.
<P>

<a name="21023w08.html_para2">The Government are fully committed to assisting in the reconstruction of Afghanistan and packages such as this will be an important element in fulfilling that commitment, enabling the return of Afghans to their country and their subsequent re-integration to be managed in an orderly and beneficial way.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21023w08.html_spnew2"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has had wide-ranging discussions with his French counterpart on the problem of illegal immigration, including the practicalities of implementing their welcome commitment to closing the Sangatte centre. But the general principle is that asylum claims made in France are dealt with by the French authorities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21023w08.html_spnew3"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 As my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced on 7 October, we are working to develop our resettlement gateway, which will start in April 2003. The United Kingdom is a regular attendee at the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) resettlement working group, and we continue to discuss positively with UNHCR the establishment of our programme.
<P>

<a name="21023w08.html_para3">Official level discussions have taken place with other Government departments in order that the impact of the scheme on them is fully taken into account during its development and implementation. These will continue, as will our contact with the Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) sector.

 The information requested by the hon. Member is not held centrally and could not be obtained without disproportionate cost; however the Immigration and Nationality Directorate issue letters to members of the public where the document cannot be immediately traced. In the year 2000, 97 such letters were issued; and 103 letters in 2001. As at 11 October 2002 a total of 265 letters have been issued in the year to date. Action is being taken to address this issue.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21023w08.html_spnew5"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Home Office does not collate statistics in relation to where illegal immigrants claimed to have clandestinely entered the United Kingdom. Although attempts are made to capture this data the responses given are unreliable. Most claim not to know where they specifically entered the United Kingdom or where they embarked from in Europe, or are unwilling to divulge this information.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21023w08.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what discussions he has had with cross-channel ferry companies concerning the improved detection of clandestine immigrants entering the UK; and if he will make a statement.  [75451]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21023w08.html_spnew6"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The UK Immigration Service (UKIS) has close working relationships with cross channel ferry companies and has regular contact with the management and staff of P&O Ferries, SeaFrance, Norfolk Line, Hoverspeed, TransEuropa and Brittany Ferries. UKIS officers offer support and advice in respect of inadmissible passengers and clandestine entry.
<P>

<a name="21023w08.html_para4">The government is taking forward a project to procure new detection technology equipment for deployment at Continental Channel ports serving the United Kingdom. It is proposed that this be made available on a loan basis to port and/or ferry operators to supplement the search regimes that they already conduct by visual checks and using CO <sup>2</sup>  detectors.
<P>

<a name="21023w08.html_para5">In taking this project forward, UK Immigration Service officials propose to visit all ports which pose an actual or potential risk of clandestine traffic to the UK and have already visited Calais, Dunkirk, Ostend, Zeebrugge and Cherbourg. In each case there has been dialogue with port and ferry operators to determine their equipment needs, how it will be operated and by whom.
<P>

<a name="21023w08.html_para6">Good progress has been made at those ports visited and both port and ferry operators have shown enthusiasm for the initiative, which will provide both a deterrent to clandestine entry and a considerable service to the road haulage industry. Remaining ports will be visited in the near future.

 The Home Office does not collate statistics in relation to where asylum seekers claimed to have entered the United Kingdom clandestinely.

 The government are determined to reduce the flow of clandestine entry to the United Kingdom from Continental Channel ports in freight vehicles and, as a first step in a project, are procuring new detection technology equipment for the use of port/ferry operators in Calais to supplement the vehicle checks already conducted there. This is the first of a number of initiatives, which will provide a significant deterrent to clandestine entry to the United Kingdom and to strengthen our controls at the Channel ports.
<P>

<a name="21023w08.html_para7">It is recognised, however, that these positive measures in Calais may initially result in displacement of clandestine traffic to other Continental ports. As a precaution extra freight searching operations have been conducted in Poole and Portsmouth by UK Immigration Service (UKIS) in respect of vessels arriving from France. Results of these extra searches revealed no indication of significant displacement of clandestine traffic into these ports. Consideration is also being given to the deployment of mobile detection units in order to respond more quickly to changing threats in respect of cross-channel illegal migration.
<P>

<a name="21023w08.html_para8">Funding has also been made available for the procurement of additional equipment for deployment in those ports and considerable progress has already been made.

 At present, there are 1,609 detention places in removal centres. This excludes the 900 places at Yarl's Wood removal centre, the operation of which has been suspended since March this year. In addition, there are 400 detention places at Oakington Reception Centre which are used to support the fast-track asylum process.
<P>

<a name="21023w09.html_para0">We remain committed to reaching the target of 4,000 detention places announced in the White Paper ''Secure Borders, Safe Haven''. The serious events at Yarl's Wood removal centre in February, and the subsequent need to suspend operations at the centre, were a severe blow to our programme to reach the target of 4,000 places. Plans to build a new removal centre (Logford) adjacent to the existing Harmondsworth Removal Centre, are in place and this will provide a further 300 detention places. We anticipate that the new centre will become operational in April 2004.

 Action to maintain and improve the quality of initial decisions on asylum applications is a continuous process. Recent initiatives include extra training on human rights and seminars by the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture to better equip caseworkers to interview asylum applicants. Guidance to caseworkers and training needs are informed by, and updated in the light of, random sampling of initial decisions, emerging case law, policy changes, and feedback from internal and external stakeholders.

<a name="21023w09.html_para8">The Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) achieved the 2001&#150;02 target of deciding 60 per cent. of new substantive asylum applications within two months. Provisional, internal data indicate that IND is on track to meet this year's target of 65 per cent. and well placed to achieve next year's target of 75 per cent. within two months. The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill contains a number of provisions to support faster asylum processes, particularly for clearly unfounded claims.

<a name="21023w09.html_spnew7"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Government, working with successive Presidencies and the Commission, has been instrumental in driving forward the European Union (EU) agenda on Immigration and Asylum. We have taken a key role in speeding agreement to a common package jointly to handle Asylum issues. We have taken action, with our partners, to enhance border protection and tackle transit routes. We have drawn attention to the scope for enhanced co-operation on returns and readmissions. We have been instrumental in focussing on the need for enhanced co-operation with source and transit countries. Effective, targetted and intelligence-led joint operations to tackle the traffickers is also a keynote of the Government's approach that has been taken up across the EU.
<P>

<a name="21023w09.html_para10">The joint Anglo-Spanish initiative at Seville resulted in a substantial impetus being given to the progress on migration and asylum at EU level, including action to strengthen the EU borders, tackle illegal immigration and target dates for reaching agreement on the remaining elements of the asylum package.

Recorded crime figures for the force from before and after these dates will therefore not be directly comparable.

 The Prison Service is committed to reducing all forms of violence in prison whether affecting prisoners or staff.
<P>

<a name="21023w11.html_para0">Existing steps include; a policy for addressing bullying with anti-bullying co-ordinator roles in establishments; an offender assessment system developed jointly by the National Probation and Prison Services; the recently introduced cell sharing risk assessment tool which we hope will minimise the risk of violence when allocating prisoners to cell accommodation; and a number of accredited offending behaviour programmes, including cognitive skills programmes, which have been shown to affect institutional behaviour.
<P>

<a name="21023w11.html_para1">Future steps will include a violence reduction policy in the very early stages of development, which will bring together existing approaches and seek to develop a safer environment for prisoners and staff.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the planned NATO rapid reaction force; what missions it is envisaged this force will undertake; and whether any of its missions are the same as those to be undertaken by EU military forces deployed under the auspices of the European Security and Defence Policy.

<P>
<a name="21023w12.html_spnew8"><B> Geoffrey Hoon: </B> 
 At the NATO Informal Ministerial Meeting in Warsaw in September 2002, the United States Defense Secretary proposed a NATO Response Force (NRF) to provide a rapidly deployable capability within the existing developments in the NATO Command and Force Structures. The United Kingdom strongly supports the NRF concept as a means of optimising the utility of the NATO Force Structure across the range of missions. It will also help to focus efforts to improve capabilities, and will therefore be coherent with and complementary to the European Security and Defence Policy. The NRF concept is currently being discussed within the Alliance, with the guiding principles expected to be put before Heads of State and Government at the November 2002 NATO Summit in Prague for their agreement.

 The independent Animal Welfare Advisory Committee (AWAC), chaired by Dr. Robert C Hubrecht, has recently published its sixth Report. The Animal Welfare Advisory Committee was set up in 1996 in response to parliamentary and public concern about the use of animals in defence research. Its purpose is to consult, inspect and make all necessary enquiries into all aspects of animal care and their use in establishments of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl). It has also been agreed between the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and QinetiQ that the work at Alverstoke should remain within the Committee's remit.

<a name="21023w14.html_para0">All work with animals undergoes an ethical review process and has to demonstrate that as much as possible has been done to replace the procedures with alternatives not using live animals; to reduce the numbers of animals used in particular studies; and to refine the procedures to minimise pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm prior to the issues of licences to undertake work.

Notes:<P>

After account is taken of the UK abatement and the bringing to account of surpluses and deficits in respect of Member States contributions in earlier years.<P>

Difference in the UK's gross contribution between 2001 and 2002 is primarily the result of the very large abatement (Euro7,342.5 million) received in 2001 compared with the estimate for 2002 (Euro5,092.2 million). This reflects a large core abatement for 2001 and also signficant adjustments, in the UK's favour, to the abatement in respect of earlier years.<P>

 The Treasury keeps the arrangements for the supply of circulation coins under review. The current arrangements with the Royal Mint have several years to run.

 Productivity has grown since 1997, even with rapidly falling unemployment. Productivity growth between 1997Q2 and 2002Q1 has averaged 1.3 per cent. p.a. (comparing each quarter with a year earlier). This is in the context of rising employment (increased employment of over 1&#189; million since Spring 1997), while unemployment as measured either using the International Labour Organisation methodology or via the ''claimant count'' has been at its lowest since the 1970s over the past year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21023w15.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Macshane: </B> 
 The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) entered into force in 1997. Industrial inspections did not begin in the United States until 2000, because the necessary national implementing legislation had not 



<P>
<P><I>23 Oct 2002 : Column 357W</I><P>
been put in place. The United Kingdom had consistently pressed the United States to put this legislation in place at the earliest opportunity. Since the implementing legislation has been in place, the United States has accepted all inspections of its chemical sites required by the Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which is responsible for ensuring the implementation of the Convention.
<P>

<a name="21023w15.html_para2">From entry into force of the CWC and 31 December 2001, the OPCW conducted 1117 inspections. Of these 374 (33 per cent.) were in the United States.

Carrying out effective risk assessment on end-users before making the export licensing decision is the surest way to prevent UK arms falling into the wrong hands. We assess all export licence applications on a case by case basis against the Consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria in accordance with Criterion 7. In accordance with that criterion we will not issue an export licence where there is an unacceptable risk of diversion to an undesirable end-user.

 As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister told the House on 15 October (<i>Official Report</i>, column 177&#150;9), we identified the South East Asian region as an area with a real threat from groups linked to Al Qaida even before 11 September 2001.

Thaer has also been investigated in Italy for his links with a terrorist cell and for participation in a criminal conspiracy to traffic in arms, explosives, chemical weapons, identity papers, receiving stolen goods and aiding illegal immigration. According to the Italian authorities he is a member of the Salafist Group for Call and Combat (GSPC), an Algerian-based group operating in North Africa and Italy.

<a name="21023w16.html_para4">During her recent visit to Nigeria my noble Friend the Minister for Africa, the Baroness Amos, raised with President Obasanjo HMG's concerns about the harsh sentences imposed under the Sharia penal codes. She emphasised the strength of feeling against them in the UK and reiterated HMG's opposition to the death penalty in all circumstances.

<a name="21023w16.html_para6">The Federal Government has made clear its opposition to the extreme Sharia penalties. It has declared them discriminatory and unconstitutional. Exercise of the Sharia penal code is, however, entirely under the control of the relevant States. The Federal justice system only comes into play if the defendant appeals to the Federal Appeal Courts.

According to the Italians he is a member of the Salafist Group for Call and Combat (GSPC), an Algerian-based group operating in North Africa and Italy. The UN added GSPC to the list of terrorist groups linked to al Qaeda on 8 October.

 Northern Ireland has among the fastest economic growth rates in the United Kingdom.

Since the Belfast Agreement there has been high inward investment, particularly in the IT and hospitality industries.

 The Government are determined to press forward with all aspects of the Agreement. The key priority now is to restore the devolved institutions. Essential to that is the restoration of trust that all parties remain committed to fulfilling their obligations, and crucially the commitment to exclusively democratic and peaceful means.

 The introduction of the Human Rights Act plays a major role in safeguarding human rights throughout the UK as a whole, including Northern Ireland. The Human Rights Act puts human rights at the heart of policy making and operations for all public authorities and means that all public authorities, including courts and the police, must act compatibly with the Convention rights. It gives further effect throughout the UK to the rights and freedoms set out in the ECHR and provides the basis for a new culture of rights and responsibilities.
<P>

<a name="21023w18.html_para0">The Northern Ireland Act 1998 restricts the Northern Ireland Assembly's powers to ensure it can only pass legislation that is compatible with Convention Rights and requires all NI Ministers and Departments to act compatibly. The Act also created the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission whose remit includes making sure laws and practices conform to the European Convention, promoting awareness of human rights and offering advice and guidance to individuals. The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission is currently considering the scope for a Bill of Rights to reflect the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland.

 Ceasefires, however defined, are not by themselves enough to sustain confidence in the process. The transition from violence to democracy must be completed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what are the <i>(a)</i> current and <i>(b)</i> potential future funding opportunities for local authorities to offer home to school transport for those currently not entitled to free transport under the Education Act 1996.  [75599]<P>

<P>
<a name="21023w20.html_spnew0"><B> Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 Compulsory school age pupils are entitled to free transport if their nearest suitable school is beyond statutory walking distance from their home. In other circumstances, LEAs have the discretion to provide help with travel in accordance with their own locally determined policies and priorities. Although we keep the arrangements under regular review we will not consider changing the current system for compulsory school age children unless we have clear evidence that an alternative system is fairer.
<P>

<a name="21023w20.html_para0">For post-16 students, there is a duty on LEAs to determine what is necessary to meet their particular local circumstances. In addition, as a result of a recommendation from the study commissioned by DfES into transport support and services for post 16 students in further education, #9 million has been made available in 2002&#150;03 to 60 LEAs under the Transport Pathfinder Initiative. The initiative will run from April 2002 to July 2003. Their purpose is to test and develop different approaches to transport support and services and will be evaluated in order to inform future transport policy.

 Applications from all Local Education Authorities (LEAs) for three-year funding commencing in 2003&#150;04 for New Pupil Places (Basic Need) were invited in September. These applications are currently being assessed. This support is for additional school places in areas of population growth where there is no more capacity in all schools in the surrounding area. The funding is not necessarily for new schools, and can be used to increase the number of places at existing schools. We will be announcing Basic Need allocations for 2003&#150;04 in December.
<P>

<a name="21023w20.html_para1">The building of new schools and additional accommodation at existing schools can also be funded from other capital programmes provided by the Department, including the Private Finance Initiative and Targeted Capital Fund (for which applications should be received by 3 January 2003), and from formulaic funding allocated to all LEAs and schools.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what links her Department has identified between additional educational needs and social and economic factors and indicators, other than parental take-up of income support and working families tax credit.  [75978]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21023w20.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 To investigate the links between additional educational needs (AEN) and deprivation indicators, the department commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers to research the incidence of pupils with AEN and the costs of meeting their needs. They found that the number of pupils eligible for Free School Meals (FSM) was the strongest factor explaining variation in reported social need. They also found that the number of pupils with English as an additional language was strongly linked to non-social measures of AEN. They also looked at several ward based measures such as Long term unemployment, the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) and the Access domain from the IMD, but found that these indicators were not as good at explaining variations in reported need as the standard FSM data.
<P>

<a name="21023w20.html_para2">The department also considered a number of other measures of deprivation: from the 1991 census, such as rented accommodation or low social class; and from the Labour Force Survey, such as the proportion of working age adults with no qualifications. Many of these measures showed some statistical relationship with low attainment suggesting they could be used as a proxy for AEN. However, they are also all highly related to parental take up of income support, which is

<a name="21023w20.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Miliband </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 October 2002]:</i> The Teachers' Pension Scheme (TPS) is an unfunded scheme. Periodic valuations of the scheme are carried out by the Government Actuary to establish the liabilities and notional assets of the scheme. The valuation determines the contribution rate paid by the employers of TPS members.
<P>

<a name="21023w20.html_para3">With the agreement of Treasury, I am currently consulting teacher and employer representatives and other interested parties on changes to the valuation methodology. Under the existing provisions of the Teachers' Pensions Regulations, the notional fund is deemed to have delivered the average rate of return achieved by the largest invested pension funds. However, likely interest returns to the stock market performance of notional assets is unlikely to produce a stable assessment of the cost of providing public service pensions, particularly over the short to medium term, or to reflect the risks and costs to government of financing the pensions in payment. The Government wishes to reflect these costs more appropriately, remove the financial uncertainty about the performance of notional assets, and provide greater stability in employer contribution rates. I am, therefore, consulting on the proposal that, instead of tracking the returns of invested pension funds, the method of crediting investing returns to the notional fund should be based on a rate of returns which the Government Actuary advises as being appropriate for the valuation of a public service pension scheme. The consultation period ends on 8 November.

<a name="21023w22.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Willis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, pursuant to her answer of 19 September, <i>Official Report</i>, column 121W, on mental health, if schools <i>(a)</i> are obliged to promote the mental health of their pupils, <i>(b)</i> have a mechanism for detecting mental health problems and <i>(c)</i> have regular contact with the local Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services.  [76579]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21023w22.html_spnew3"><B> Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 My hon. Friend David Miliband, in his written answer of 19 September, outlined the ways the Secretary of State aims to ensure that children's mental health needs are being met. In June 2001 the Department issued guidance, <i>Promoting Children's Mental Health within Early Years and School Settings</i>. This is strongly recommended and we would expect schools to have regard to it.
<P>

<a name="21023w22.html_para2">The guidance is designed to help teachers and others working alongside mental health professionals to identify children and young people's mental health needs, and sets out useful approaches for how these needs might be met. The advice in the guidance is backed up by illustrative case studies.
<P>

<a name="21023w22.html_para3">The guidance also includes a section on the work of the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). The Department commissioned a research project into effective collaboration between schools and CAMHS which will be available later this year.

<a name="21023w22.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Willis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, pursuant to her answer of 19 September, <i>Official Report</i>, column 121W, on mental health if <i>(a)</i> BEST teams members will receive training in children's mental health and <i>(b)</i> BEST teams will contain mental health specialists.

<P>
<a name="21023w22.html_spnew4"><B> Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 The aims of Behaviour and Educational Support Teams (BESTs) are to promote emotional well-being, positive behaviour and school attendance among children and young people. They help in the identification and support of those with, or at risk of developing, emotional and behavioural problems, through the provision of multi-agency support in schools and to individual families.
<P>

<a name="21023w22.html_para4">BESTs will take part in training which covers many areas of multi-agency working and related subject areas. This will include children's mental health issues.
<P>

<a name="21023w22.html_para5">There are a number of professional disciplines which may be appropriately represented within the BEST. The precise skills balance will be decided locally, in line with the priorities agreed for the BEST, provision already available in schools and the resource available across the LEA and partner agencies. DfES guidelines suggest teams should contain a complementary mix of education, social work and health skills in order to meet the multi-faceted needs of children, young people and their parents.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21023w22.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Willis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, pursuant to her answer of 19 September, <i>Official Report</i>, column 121W, on mental health, if Ofsted's draft framework for inspection requires an inspection of schools' ability to promote pupils' mental health and detect and handle pupils' mental health problems.  [76581]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21023w22.html_spnew5"><B> Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 This is a matter for the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted). HM Chief Inspector for Schools, David Bell will write to the hon. Gentleman and a copy will be placed in the Library.

 The cost of overseeing the assessment of students through the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority represented 0.2 per cent. of the total education budget of almost #40 billion for England in 2001&#150;02. No data is held centrally on the overall costs of exam fees and associated assessment costs payable by schools. OfSTED, working with the Adult Learning Inspectorate in some circumstances, is responsible for <i>(b)</i> and <i>(c)</i>. The sum of the Inspectorates' budgets was #183 million in 2001&#150;02 or 0.5 per cent. of the total education budget, although some of this was spent on inspecting pre-school and non-schools post-16 providers as well as schools and teachers.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has responsibility for a number of primary web sites in addition to the main Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's web site (www.odpm.gov.uk). It is not possible to state the start up costs as the site has been created out of the former DTLR (and before that, DETR) web site. The annual cost of running the web site is currently #85,000 (excluding staff costs). The web hosting company is EduServ, who are based in Bath. There has been no assessment of the ODPM web site, as it has only existed since the creation of the Office earlier this year. Because not all sites are managed centrally, information about every web site could only be provided at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how the Government make choices in prioritising the allocation of its cancer research funding to tumour specific areas; and how needs-based access to these funds is ensured.  [75746]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21023w24.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The total Government expenditure on research into individual diseases, including cancer and different types of cancer, is not normally specifically allocated in advance. Expenditure is related to many variables, such as the quality of research proposals received and the relevance to National Health Service priorities.
<P>

<a name="21023w24.html_para3">The Government supports health related research through three routes. The Medical Research Council (MRC), which is funded by the Department of Trade and Industry, is the main agency through which the Government supports research into the causes and treatment of disease including cancer. Some of the other research councils, especially the biotechnology and biological sciences research council, also fund relevant research.
<P>

<a name="21023w24.html_para4">The Department and its equivalents in the devolved administrations meet the NHS support costs of the research councils' and charities' projects. The Department also funds research into policy development and the delivery of effective practice in health and social care. The higher education funding council for England and its equivalents in the devolved administrations fund the university academic base.
<P>

<a name="21023w24.html_para5">Access to all these different forms of funding is by various means, with the mechanism depending on the nature and purpose of the research funding stream involved. The Government set up the national cancer research institute (NCRI) in April 2001, in partnership with the charities and the pharmaceutical industry. The NCRI is providing strategic oversight of cancer research across the United Kingdom. This will help to ensure that the nation's total investment in cancer research is directed to best effect.

Professor Richards has been asked to report to Ministers later this autumn.

<a name="21023w25.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Lammy </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 October 2002]:</i> The Department has not commissioned any recent surveys to identify and itemise the costs of these independent contractors, which will vary from practice to practice. In negotiating the National Health Service sight test fee, the Department and the representative bodies for optometrists and ophthalmic medical practitioners put forward the factors they consider should be weighed in determining an appropriate fee level. For the Department, these are the state of recruitment, retention and motivation within the general ophthalmic service, together with affordability.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health for what reason there is an explicit upper age limit for routine breast screening.  [76130]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21023w26.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 October 2002]:</i> The Forrest report, on which the National Health Service breast screening programme was based when it began in 1988, recommend that women aged 50 to 64 should be invited for breast screening. The Forrest report found that, in view of poor response rates, there was insufficient benefit to be gained by actively offering screening to women aged 65 or over. Women aged 65 and over are able to self-refer for breast screening every three years. Women who have participated in the programme are informed of this right at the age of 64.
<P>

<a name="21023w26.html_para4">Government funded pilot studies have now shown that extending routine invitations for breast screening to women aged 65 to 70 is both feasible and cost-effective. The NHS Cancer Plan gave the commitment that the programme will be extended to women aged 70 by 2004.
<P>

<a name="21023w26.html_para5">There is little research evidence to show whether population screening in the over 70s is effective in reducing mortality. What little evidence there is suggests that screening in this way may not be effective and could even do more harm than good to some women. However, for some individual women there will always be a clear benefit in screening. Women aged over 70 will be offered free three yearly screening on request, as are women aged 65 and over now.

 In recent years the Department has supported a number of initiatives taken by professional bodies and other agencies to raise awareness of attention deficit disorder (ADD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and to facilitate accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. These include an evidence-base briefing for clinicians on the use of stimulant medication (1999) and factsheets for parents, teachers and young people on attention deficit problems and hyperactivity, both produced by the Royal College of Psychiatrists. We have also collaborated with the Department for Education and Skills in issuing guidance for teachers on promoting children's mental health, including attention deficit/hyperactivity, within early years and school settings, in 2001. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), at the suggestion of the Department, undertook an appraisal of the use of the drug methylphenidate for ADHD in children and issued clinical guidelines for its use, including information for patients, in 2000. This guidance was circulated widely among professional groups involved with attention deficit disorders. The Department has also grant-aided the ADHD national alliance, an organisation which helps to co-ordinate voluntary sector activity and development work in this field.
<P>

<a name="21023w27.html_para3">In general the content of professional training is a matter for the relevant professional bodies. However the Department's requirements for social work training from September 2003 will include elements covering child development and mental health and communication skills with children.

 No estimates of prevalence that differentiate between attention deficit disorder (ADD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been commissioned centrally. The prevalence of ADHD of all types is estimated at around five per cent. of school-aged children, approximately 345,000 six to 16 year olds in England. A survey by the Office for National Statistics of the mental health of children and adolescents in Great Britain, published in 2000, found the prevalence of hyperkinetic disorders, including the severer forms of ADHD, to be 1.4 per cent. of five to 15 year olds.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to provide Government support for tinnitus research.  [74785]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21023w27.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The main Government agency for research into the causes and treatments of disease is the Medical Research Council (MRC), which receives its funding from the Department of Trade and Industry. The MRC spent about #5 million in 2000&#150;01 on hearing research generally, much of which is basic in nature but some of which may well have a bearing on the causes and treatment of tinnitus. Included in this figure is a major investment in the MRC Institute of Hearing Research.




<P>
<P><I>23 Oct 2002 : Column 402W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21023w27.html_para4">The MRC is independent in its day-to-day research funding decisions, which take account of both health needs and scientific vision and opportunity. The MRC always welcomes high quality applications for financial support into any aspect of biomedical research and these are judged in open competition with other demands on funding. The MRC does not, as a rule, earmark funds for particular topics; research proposals in all areas will compete for the funding available.
<P>

<a name="21023w27.html_para5">The Department funds research to support policy and the delivery of effective practice in health and social care. The Department's research programmes are not funding any projects related to tinnitus, and there are no current plans to commission such work. The Department does, however, provide National Health Service support funding for research commissioned by the research councils and charities that takes place in the NHS.

<a name="21023w28.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Department works closely with the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) and with the National Health Service to ensure that biological threats are rapidly identified and dealt with. We are confident that the United Kingdom is as well prepared as any country could be to protect the health of its citizens in the event of bioterrorism.
<P>

<a name="21023w28.html_para2">The transfer of most PHLS general microbiology services to the NHS will strengthen the public health outputs of the NHS. It will also improve surveillance and linkages between human, veterinary, food, water, and environmental surveillance systems, which are essential to identify new events and monitor the effectiveness of interventions.
<P>

<a name="21023w28.html_para3">In considering the transfer of the PHLS laboratories to the NHS, the Department is ensuring that there will be dedicated public health microbiology support at local and regional levels to make sure that incident response and public health surveillance continues.

 The Department has received no representations concerning the efficiency of systems to report results from radiotherapy, X-rays and other diagnostic tests using ionising radiation. The use of ionising radiation in healthcare is governed by legislation.
<P>

<a name="21023w28.html_para5">The Ionising Radiation (Medical Exposure) Regulations 2000, which came into force on 1 January 2001, require that all exposures to ionising radiation are justified and that a clinical evaluation of each exposure is recorded. A major intention of the legislation is to minimise the inappropriate use of ionising radiation in patients' exposures.
<P>

<a name="21023w28.html_para6">The regulations also require that where an employer, such as a trust, believes that a person may have been exposed to a dose of radiation greater than intended, from a repeat diagnostic test or other error, it must report such an incident to the appropriate authority. In England this authority is the Secretary of State's Inspectorate for the Ionising Radiation (Medical Exposure) Regulations 2000.

 The age of each linear accelerator in service in the National Health Service in January 2001 was published at www.canceruk.net. This lists each linear accelerator installed in the NHS along with the dates when each machine was commissioned. This database is expected to be updated in the next few months and will provide comprehensive details of equipment installed since the introduction of the NHS Cancer Plan, including those provided under the new opportunities fund cancer initiative.
<P>

<a name="21023w28.html_para8">The criteria for replacement of radiotherapy equipment will take into account age and whether spare parts can still be supplied by the original equipment manufacturer. There is no formal recommended replacement age for linear accelerators within the NHS in England. Older equipment is capable of delivering safe and appropriate treatment to many cancer patients. Careful maintenance can ensure that radiotherapy equipment can remain in service for periods in excess of 11 years and this is reflected in the age of some machines identified in the survey. It is recognised however that equipment older than 11 years may not be capable of providing the latest treatment techniques.
<P>

<a name="21023w28.html_para9">Standards regarding maintenance and safety of equipment are high in the United Kingdom and these are met by a combination of local scientific and technical staff and manufacturers providing servicing and quality assurance systems.
