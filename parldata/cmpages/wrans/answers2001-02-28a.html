<P>
<a name="10228w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Pickles: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1) if he intends to introduce a scheme to help farmers with the cost of removing illegally dumped motor vehicle tyres from agricultural land;  [150810]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will make a statement on the cost to farmers of removing illegally dumped motor vehicle tyres from agricultural land in the latest year for which figures are available.  [150809]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10228w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="10228w01.html_para0">Section 59 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 provides the Environment Agency and local authorities with powers to require the removal of waste dumped in contravention of waste controls; or to remove it and recover their costs from those responsible. However, farmers of land which is the subject of fly-tipping cannot be required to remove the waste or to pay for its removal, unless they knowingly caused or permitted its dumping. We have no plans to introduce a scheme to pay the costs incurred by landowners in removing fly-tipped waste.
<P>

<a name="10228w01.html_para1">However, the Fly Tipping Forum is addressing the problem of fly-tipping on farms; and has commissioned research to assess the problem's scale and associated costs. (The Environment Agency chairs the Forum and its members include the NFU and the Country Landowners Association.) It is anticipated that this research project will be completed later in the spring and the Forum will then consider its findings. The Department of Trade and Industry also chairs a joint Government/industry working group which is considering options for recycling tyres in the light of the Landfill Directive, which will ban their disposal in landfill sites.
<P>

<a name="10228w01.html_para2">No data are currently held centrally on the cost to either local authorities or farmers of removing illegally dumped motor vehicle tyres.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10228w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Gordon Marsden: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will set out, including statistical information relating as directly as possible to the constituency, the effect on the Blackpool, South constituency of his Department's policies and actions since 2 May 1997.  [142229]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10228w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 As most of my Department's policies flow from measures agreed within the framework of the EU Common Agricultural Policy, statistical data are normally available on a UK or England basis, but not disaggregated further. However, farmers in the UK have benefited from this Government's policies to the tune of &#163;1.2 billion since 



<P>
<P><I>28 Feb 2001 : Column: 646W</I><P>
2 May 1997 in addition to the figure of approximately &#163;3 billion per year in direct CAP payments. Farmers in the Blackpool, South constituency will also have available to them all of the schemes available under the England Rural Development Programme, which is backed by funding of &#163;1.6 billion over the period 2000-06. Three of the schemes within this programme--Rural Enterprise, Processing and Marketing, and Vocational Training--have a budget of around &#163;190 million and are being operated on a regional basis; each region has its own allocation.

<a name="10228w01.html_sbhd2"><H4><center>Policy and Strategy Units</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="10228w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Tyrie: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food when his policy and corporate strategy unit was established; which of its reports are placed in the public domain; how many departmental or non- departmental special advisers participate in its work; how many regular <i>(a)</i> non-departmental and <i>(b)</i> departmental staff participate in its work; and how many of these work for the unit on a full-time basis.  [150366]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10228w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The MAFF Policy and Corporate Strategy Unit was established in November last year. No departmental or non-departmental special advisers participate directly in the unit's work, but one of the departmental special advisers sits, alongside senior officials and a non-executive director of the MAFF management board, on the unit's steering board. This board is chaired by the permanent secretary and is intended to determine priorities for the unit's work.
<P>

<a name="10228w01.html_para3">It is intended that the Policy and Corporate Strategy Unity will provide internal advice to Ministers and the permanent secretary. Typically, resulting reports would be placed in the public domain by the Department. No such reports have yet been produced by the unit.
<P>

<a name="10228w01.html_para4">The unit currently has 10 full time members of staff, including three staff on loan from other Government Departments and Agencies. During the coming months its staff complement is expected to rise to approximately 15 full time staff.

<a name="10228w01.html_sbhd3"><H4><center>Producers' Organisations</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="10228w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Salmond: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what review has been carried out by his Department's officials in order that producers' organisations recognised prior to 1995 satisfy EC Regulation 1762/96; and if he will list the proportion of total production by weight, attributable to each producers' organisation for its economic area.  [151536]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10228w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 UK Fisheries Departments regularly review the status of producers' organisations in accordance with the provisions of EC Regulation 2939/94, as amended by EC Regulation 1762/96, to ensure that they still meet the recognition criteria. Under EC Regulation 2939/94 a producers' organisation must be responsible for at least 15 per cent. of the production in its area, or at least 30 per cent. of production in a major port in its area. Data from 1999, the latest date for which information is available, for the producers' organisations are set out as follows. It should be noted that the European Commission is currently reviewing the recognition criteria in respect of minimum levels of economic activity.

 There is need to improve sports facilities in many of our primary schools. Part of our plan to do this is the Space for Sport and the Arts initiative which will provide &#163;130 million for capital projects in 65 LEAs benefiting about 300 schools. In addition, &#163;580 million of New Opportunities Fund money will be invested in strengthening the foundation of sport across England by building and refurbishing PE and sports facilities in over 1,500 schools.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what measures he is taking to ensure national lottery funds are distributed in a way that targets areas with the greatest social needs.  [149393]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10228w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 Following the 1988 reforms to the national lottery, distributors are required to take into account the need to ensure that all areas have access to funding and the scope for reducing economic and social deprivation. Since then, distributors have increasingly targeted funding on areas of need, on people and activities rather than just capital projects, and on small grants to community groups. All of this means that, more than ever, the communities with the greatest needs are experiencing the positive effects of national lottery funding.

 <i>[holding answer 6 February 2001]:</i> I understand from the New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC), that the Hinduja Foundation first approached NMEC in February 1997 about the possibility of incorporating the "Concordia Project" into the Dome. This was to be an interactive visitor education centre focusing on the world's different cultures. The agreement between NMEC and the Hinduja Foundation governing its &#163;1 million financial support for the Faith zone was signed on 16 February 1999. The first payment of &#163;100,000 was paid on 25 February 1999; the second payment of &#163;450,000 was paid on 18 May 1999 and the final amount of &#163;450,000 was paid on 23 August 1999.

 <i>[holding answer 15 February 2001]:</i> The information requested is contained in the tables.
<P>

<a name="10228w02.html_para0">Higher education student numbers have steadily increased over recent years. Further education student numbers, on the other hand, have fallen slightly. The main reason for this is the large fall in franchised provision. Previous participation figures were artificially inflated by franchising, some of which offered courses of dubious value. I remain determined to raise student numbers in FE at the same time as I raise the quality of the provision on offer.

<P>

<a name="10228w03.html_para3">The Employment Service's modernisation programme has made remarkable achievements in less than 12 months. The ES now has a modern IT infrastructure in its 1,000 Jobcentres. A national jobs database has been created with around 400,000 vacancies. That database is available to anyone with internet access through the Employment Service website.
<P>

<a name="10228w03.html_para4">Job points have been installed in 12 Jobcentres. Job points are state-of-the-art touch-screen kiosks through which Jobcentre customers can search the national database. Early indications from these pilots are that job points are popular and successful and it is intended that they will be rolled out nationally to all Jobcentres from March this year.
<P>

<a name="10228w03.html_para5">The Employment Service is also establishing a network of 11 customer services centres to take vacancies from employers through a single telephone number, by fax or by e-mail. They will provide employers with 24-hour electronic access to Jobcentre recruitment services. This new service is expected to come on line in the next few months.
<P>

<a name="10228w03.html_para6">The Employment Service is also managing the transfer of Work Based Learning for Adults in April 2001 from the TECs and this will result in the implementation of a new contracting and funding system in April 2001 which will encourage closer working with ES's programme providers.
<P>

<a name="10228w03.html_para7">These achievements have been part of a fully integrated programme of change valued at some &#163;816 million, which has already seen a vast improvement in the way ES conducts its business.

 DfEE staff up to and including Grade 6 have their performance assessed under the Department's Performance Management System and at the end of each year are awarded an overall performance marking. This performance marking determines the size of their pay increase. Better performance is rewarded with a higher pay increase than weaker performance. The details of these increases are negotiated annually with the unions.

Review set centrally by the Cabinet Office. At the end of each reporting year, members of the SCS are awarded a performance mark, which is the key factor in determining their pay increase. Again, better performance at each level of management within the SCS is rewarded with a higher pay increase than weaker performance. The framework for the SCS pay award is set centrally each year by the Cabinet Office following the Government's response to the Senior Salaries Review Body's Report for that year.

 The table lists credit approvals issued to Sefton local education authority for the financial years 1997-98 to 2001-02, and shows those schools for which the credit approvals were allocated, together with details of the projects supported, where this information is known. Credit approvals for local authorities for the years beyond 2001-02 have not yet been issued. Sefton local education authority will have had discretion as to the application of credit approvals to specific projects and will be able to provide more information about the individual projects which have been supported through credit approvals.

<P>
<a name="10228w05.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 February 2001]:</i> My Department had sufficient supplies of Mefloquine and other anti-malarial drugs to support deployments to Sierra Leone in 2000. There were no known problems in obtaining supplies, either at the start of Operation Palliser or on subsequent deployments. Some 200 Army personnel nevertheless deployed initially without anti-malarial tablets. An Army board of inquiry subsequently concluded that this was due to an oversight in their preparation for an unexpectedly rapid deployment. Within 24 hours of these personnel arriving in theatre, the French drug, Savarine, was procured locally and distributed. Steps were immediately taken to provide Mefloquine, the preferred anti-malarial treatment, from the UK and all personnel taking Savarine transferred to Mefloquine within four days. One other individual is known to have deployed without anti-malarials as a result of being temporarily absent from his unit on duty just prior to deploying and therefore missing the issue of Mefloquine. 



<P>
<P><I>28 Feb 2001 : Column: 665W</I><P>
He was issued with Mefloquine as soon as the problem came to light between two to five days after his arrival in theatre.

<a name="10228w05.html_para9">No anti-malarial drug is 100 per cent. effective and the degree of protection can be subject to a wide range of factors', for example, the geographical location, the season and the activities undertaken by the individuals concerned.

The Deputy Chief Constable of the MDP has appointed a MDP Chief Superintendent to investigate the circumstances surrounding the recovery of Ms McBride's telephone.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10228w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The recovery and disposal of waste are subject to control under the Framework Directive on waste; and the main method of control is a waste management licence under Part II of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. However, Article 11 of the Directive provides discretion for the provision of licensing exemptions, on the basis of "general rules" and subject to certain conditions. The main purpose of exemptions is to encourage waste recovery in ways which protect the environment and human health.
<P>

<a name="10228w07.html_para0">We are currently reviewing several of the exemptions provided in regulation 17 of Schedule 3 to the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994. The review includes two exemptions subject to allegations of abuse (Schedule 3 paragraphs 9 and 19). We propose to tighten the terms of these exemptions to preclude their use for "sham recovery", to set minimum inspection frequencies by the Environment Agency, and to introduce charges for their registration and inspection.

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10228w07.html_para3">We intend to publish a consultation paper on these proposals this spring.

 Section 59 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 provides the Environment Agency and local authorities with powers to require the removal of waste dumped in contravention of waste controls; or to remove it and recover their costs from those responsible. However, farmers of land which is the subject of fly-tipping cannot be required to remove the waste or to pay for its removal, unless they knowingly

 The Civil Aviation Act 1982 and the Air Navigation (No. 2) Order 1995 provide strong powers for dealing with passengers who threaten the safety or personal security of cabin crew or passengers. New powers were introduced in 1999 to ensure that anyone using threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour towards cabin crew or intentionally interfering with the crew during their duties can be punished. The effectiveness of existing measures to deal with disruptive incidents is monitored by the Disruptive Passengers Working Group, which is made up of representatives from Government, the Civil Aviation Authority, the airline industry, the police and other interested parties.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10228w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Government fully recognise that school crossing patrols provide a valuable service to local communities, making it safe and easier for children, parents and other pedestrians to cross busy roads. However, questions as to where they should be provided and to the terms and conditions of employment of the patrol officers, are a matter for individual local authorities. My Department has made no centralised assessment of such matters.
<P>

<a name="10228w08.html_para0">Recent amendments to previous legislation, through the Transport Act 2000, have given school crossing patrols wider powers. When in operation, they now have authority to help anyone who seeks their assistance in crossing the road, and not just children on their way to or from school.

 Prime activity to raise public awareness of waste reuse and recycling is taken forward under my Department's "are you doing your bit?" publicity campaign, which aims to persuade people to take action to protect the environment. This campaign, which is receiving funding of &#163;9 million in this financial year covers transport, climate change, waste and water conservation. Approximately 15 per cent. of campaign expenditure is devoted to waste issues. Examples of "are you doing your bit?" waste campaign activity are at www.useitagain.org.uk and www.doingyourbit.org.uk, which I commend to the House.

<a name="10228w08.html_para2">In addition, my Department is providing core funding of &#163;3.7 million to the environmental charity ENCAMS (incorporating Tidy Britain Group and Going for Green), who primarily focus their waste promotional activity around a waste theme month in October.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10228w09.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Telecommunications operators have a duty under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and the Management of the Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 to ensure that so far as is reasonably practicable, their work activities--which would include the installation and operation of their equipment--do not expose people to risks to their health and safety.
<P>

<a name="10228w09.html_para18">Following publication of the Stewart report on mobile phones and health in May 2000, the Government accepted that, as a precautionary measure, the emissions from mobile phone base stations should meet the more restrictive International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines for public exposure (as expressed in the EU Council Recommendation of 12 July 1999 on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields (0 Hz to 300GHz)). Most base stations already meet the ICNIRP guidelines and all new base stations will do so.
<P>

<a name="10228w09.html_para19">The Stewart report recommended the establishment of clearly defined physical exclusion zones around base station antennas, which delineate areas within which exposure guidelines may be exceeded, to prevent the public from exposure to radiofrequency radiation above the ICNIRP guidelines. These exclusion zones relate to an area directly in front of and at the height of the antenna. The report did not recommend the introduction of a minimum distance between masts and existing development and we have no plans to introduce such a requirement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10228w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Government have introduced a range of measures to promote the wider use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The Powershift programme, funded by my Department and administered by the Energy Saving Trust, provides grants towards the additional cost of vehicles fuelled by LPG. There is a low rate of duty on LPG and other road gas fuels--around 7.5p per litre, compared to 48.82p per litre for premium unleaded petrol and 48.82p per litre for ultra low sulphur diesel. From 1 March 2001, new LPG cars will benefit from a lower rate, under the new Vehicle Excise Duty system.
<P>

<a name="10228w10.html_para5">The number of LPG refuelling points is growing rapidly. There were around 100 in 1997. There are now around 660 sites in the UK and this number is expected to rise to over 1,000 by the end of this year, thanks to investment from the major fuel suppliers. Many of these new facilities will be on petrol station forecourts. The Government's revised transport planning guidance note (PPG13) will further encourage local authorities to view planning applications for refuelling facilities for cleaner fuels more favourably. This is expected to be published later this year.
<P>

<a name="10228w10.html_para6">My Department's Ministers and officials have met a range of vehicle manufacturers to discuss the development of the gas vehicle market.

I am encouraged to know that several vehicle manufacturers are considering doing so.
<P>

<a name="10228w10.html_para7">Grants under the Powershift programme focus on new cars (but also those of up to one year old), encouraging manufacturers to develop high quality production line gas vehicles, so as to reduce the cost and lead to the wider use of gas fuelled vehicles. Also, the older a vehicle is, the harder is it to guarantee that a gas conversion will lead to emission reductions.

There is a rigorous final accounting process during which these clauses are reviewed against the performance of individual contractors to determine whether or not damages apply. LUL manages this process, supported where necessary by high quality legal and technical advisers. If a contractor is deemed to be liable for any part of the total time and cost overrun this is taken into account in final settlement of the relevant contract. For reasons of commercial confidentiality it would not be appropriate to comment on any individual case.

 <i>[holding answer 27 February 2001]:</i> An important part of the Government's regeneration and neighbourhood renewal strategy is to tackle anti-social behaviour and promote community safety at grass roots level.

<a name="10228w11.html_para0">My Department and the Home Office have jointly allocated &#163;18.5 million until 2003-04 for the Neighbourhood Warden programme.

<a name="10228w11.html_para1">More widely, the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 requires local authorities and the police to establish district based crime and disorder reduction partnerships, to develop and implement local strategies for reducing crime and disorder. Each strategy is informed by evidence drawn from an audit of crime and disorder in the locality in consultation with the local community. The recently appointed crime reduction directors in each of the English regions and Wales will be managing the Partnership Development Fund announced as part of the Spending Review 2000 which provides for &#163;3 million in this financial year with a further &#163;20 million in each of the next three financial years.

 In January a number of measures were put in place to encourage builders to join the Quality Mark (QM) pilot scheme in Birmingham and Somerset. Among these were a time limited discount on the joining fee, joint working with several leading trade associations and commercial organisations, to develop ways of helping their members and sub-contractors achieve the QM standard and easier ways of obtaining the mandatory warranty cover. I am pleased to say these efforts are now beginning to pay off and the number of companies in the two pilot areas now wishing to join the QM has increased from around 40 to over 275. I expect more companies to apply to join the QM in the weeks and months ahead.

As a result of this, I am able to announce today that subject to satisfactory progress with the assessment process, we shall move to the second stage of the pilot programme by opening the QM to consumers on 22 May. The launch will involve the unveiling of the QM logo and involve a major public information campaign in the pilot areas, co-ordinated with our partners, to alert the public to the QM and the benefits of using QM builders.

warranty on their work. The opening of the QM scheme to the public in this way is a major step forward in the fight against disreputable builders and fulfils a major commitment by this Government to introduce measures to empower consumers and promote reputable companies.
<P>

<a name="10228w11.html_para6">After six months there will be a review of how well the scheme has worked to see what lessons can be learned.

Following further consultation with QM builders, our partners, the industry and consumers a decision will then be made about whether any modifications need to be made to the scheme and how to extend it to the rest of the country.
<P>

<a name="10228w11.html_para7">Consumers in this country have for too long been at the mercy of disreputable builders and tradesmen. But there are many reputable builders willing and able to do a good job for a fair price. The QM pilot scheme is a first step towards a national scheme to link consumers and reputable builders. I hope that more builders will recognise the benefits of the QM and apply to join now.

 There has been no recruitment to the Royal Ulster Constabulary since 1 April 2000. It is therefore not possible to make any assessment on the impact this has had on morale within the force. On a wider front, however, the RUC is subject to major change resulting from the Patten Report and, like any other organisation, there is understandable concern among officers until changes are properly implemented and bedded in.

1. All figures are rounded to the nearest 10,000 and totals may not sum due to rounding.<P>

Households may be in receipt of more than one of the benefits shown. Consequently, the sum of the totals will not represent an overall estimate for adults and children on income-related benefits.<P>

2. The Income Support column of the original table also included Jobseeker's Allowance recipients, and has been updated accordingly.<P>

3. Figures are derived from the Department policy simulation model, and are based on the 1997-98 Family Resources Survey uprated to 2000-01 prices, benefit levels and caseloads. Actual data are not available for Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit beyond May 1999.<P>

4. Total numbers in receipt of the above benefits are consistent with the Department's 2000 post budget forecasts.<P>

5. The total number of adults represents those aged 16 and over, except for those 16 to 18 year olds in full time education. The total number of children represents those aged under 16, and 16 to 18 year olds in full time education. <P>

<P>
<a name="10228w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 Poverty and social exclusion are complex multi-dimensional issues, affecting many aspects of children's lives--their families' income, health, housing, the quality of their environment and opportunities to learn. There is no single measure that can capture the complex problems that need to be overcome.
<P>

<a name="10228w14.html_para3">However, a number of these aspects have seen significant improvement in Jarrow since 1997. For example, the proportion of 11-year-olds achieving level four or above at Key Stage 2 has risen in both english and mathematics from around 60 per cent. to over 70 per cent. in 2000. Over the same period the number of children in families in receipt of out of work benefits has fallen from 4,900 to 4,500.

<a name="10228w14.html_para4">Cold Weather Payments are paid to people who are in receipt of Income Support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance and get either a disability or pensioner premium or have a child under five. A payment of &#163;8.50 is made automatically when the average temperature at the specified weather station linked to their postcode has been recorded as, or is forecast to be, 0oC or below over seven consecutive days.

 We are keen to ensure that people are in an informed position to make choices on whether to claim benefit and we are the first Government to encourage the active pursuit of take-up initiatives as a means of tackling pensioner poverty. The Benefits Agency was instrumental in running the national take-up campaign for the minimum income guarantee. Additionally, it is involved in a wide range of national and local initiatives to ensure accurate and accessible information is available, including leaflets, information officers, liaison with local groups, and talks.

 I am pleased to announce that the General Levy rates for 2001-02 will be frozen at the 2000-01 level as set out in the table. We have been able to do this as a result of good housekeeping by Opra and buoyant levy receipts. Opra's costs will increase due to new responsibilities for Stakeholder and Personal pensions but will be met from existing levy rates.

<a name="10228w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Byers:  </B> 
I am today able to announce the outcome of the First Stage of the Quinquennial Review of the Council for the Central Laboratory of the Resarch Councils.
<P>

<a name="10228w15.html_para8">Reviews of Non-Departmental Public Bodies (NDPBs) are a key part of our programme to modernise Government. The Government are committed to achieving better public services that are of higher quality and are more responsive to the needs of the people who use them. Regular NDPB reviews are an important element in ensuring that we have in place the right structures to deliver the Government's agenda effectively and to provide a strong focus on improving future performance.
<P>

<a name="10228w15.html_para9">The Terms of Reference for the Review required the First Stage to examine the role, composition and funding mechanisms for CCLRC, by reference to its Charter and mission, its past performance, recent CCLRC instigated studies on future vision and funding, current best practice for NDPBs and its contribution to the work of other Research Councils. The Review was further required to consider all relevant options for the future of the Council, including abolition, continued NDPB status, rationalisation, privatisation or strategic contracting out.
<P>

<a name="10228w15.html_para10">The Review has been conducted in accordance with the lastest Cabinet Office guidance (published on 31 January 2000) and has included consultation with members of Council, the Executive and CCLRC's customers and key stakeholders. The Review Boad, chaired by Sir Peter Williams, met on six occasions, including visits to the Rutherford Appleton and Daresbury laboratories.
<P>

<a name="10228w15.html_para11">The principal recommendation is that the relationship of the Research Councils and CCLRC as customer and supplier has proved to be sub-optimal and should be changed to a Strategic Ownership model, in which CCLRC is brought under the joint ownership of the grant awarding Research Councils. To facilite this change, CCLRC should be reconstituted, as soon as practicable, as a Limited Company, to provide a similar governance structure to existing Research Council Institutes.
<P>

<a name="10228w15.html_para12">This model ensures a clear commitment by the Research Councils to meet the planned funding needs of CCLRC based on scrutiny of strategic and operating plans, and should provide efficiency savings. Within this framework, CCLRC should seek to fulfil a more strategic role in the provision of access to leading edge, large-scale facilities for UK researchers. Investment in new facilities should be based on long-term requirements agreed by all the different research communities.
<P>

<a name="10228w15.html_para13">Stage Two of the Review will now examine the issues associated with the implementation of the Strategic Ownership model, addressing in particular the implications 



<P>
<P><I>28 Feb 2001 : Column: 703W</I><P>
for the status of CCLRC and its accountability to Ministers and Parliament. Stage Two will also examine how the strategic role can be implemented, such that it is not compromised by CCLRC's role as a facilities operator.
<P>

<a name="10228w15.html_para14">I warmly welcome these recommendations and offer my thanks to Sir Peter Williams and the rest of the Review Board.

The right hon.

The reasons for my decision to seek and subsequently to accept from BAE Systems undertakings in lieu of reference to the Competition Commission are set out in my announcements of 9 September 1999 and 28 March 2000.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has today laid a draft order defining turnover for the purposes of section 30 of the Postal Services Act 2000. A consultation document on this draft order was published on the DTI website www.dti.gov.uk on 19 December. The consultation came to an end on 31 January. The Department is grateful to those who responded. The policy behind the draft order has not altered but a number of minor changes have been made. The reference to "enforcement action" has been removed as it was deemed to be unnecessary. Some minor changes to annualisation in the first year have been made to minimise unfairness. Finally, the multi-year calculation has been simplified so that whole years are used rather than fractions of years. Subject to the approval of both Houses, the draft order will enable the Postal Services Commission to impose appropriate financial penalties in support of its enforcement of the new postal licensing regime.

 In line with Cabinet Office guidance, the review is being carried out in two stages. I am now in a position to make an announcement about the outcome of Stage 1 and the basis on which work will be taken forward.
<P>

<a name="10228w16.html_para9">The review team recognises the progress which UKAEA has made since 1996 and commends its performance and commitment to improvement across the full range of its activities. However, it identifies a number of options for organisational change and raises fundamental issues relating to UKAEA's primary role in managing nuclear liabilities on behalf of the taxpayer and restoring the environment at the sites for which it is responsible over the next 60 years--for example about funding arrangements, the regulatory framework and the way in which it operates, waste management and the long-term availability of relevant knowledge and skills.
<P>

<a name="10228w16.html_para10">The Government consider it essential that nuclear liabilities should be dealt with safely, cost effectively and in a way which inspires public confidence. Significant challenges are involved and there is an absolute requirement that the public should have confidence in the arrangements in place for dealing with them. The ideas and issues raised by the review team will therefore be explored further with a view to establishing whether there is a case for changing present management arrangements. The review team will also consider what action might be taken to attract more companies into the nuclear decommissioning market and to promote competition for decommissioning contracts let by UKAEA.
<P>

<a name="10228w16.html_para11">As regards other UKAEA activities, Stage 2 of the review will focus on testing options for:

Not all businesses are VAT registered, however, in particular, if they do not have a turnover above &#163;52,000 per annum.

 Immigration detainees rarely test positive for drugs. As a result from 1 April 2001 detainees held at Her Majesty's Prison Haslar and within discrete units at Her Majesty's Prisons Lindholme and Rochester will no longer be subject to the random mandatory drug-testing programme. Other security measures to prevent the smuggling and misuse of drugs will remain unchanged. These new arrangements will not apply to detainees dispersed more widely across the prison estate and who therefore have regular contact with prisoners.

 <i>[holding answer 26 February 2001]:</i> In line with the maternity grant paid from the social fund to those on low incomes, the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) on 13 November 2000 introduced a maternity payment for eligible asylum seekers. The mother or father completes an application form within the time scale to qualify. The voluntary sector one-stop shops will assist asylum seekers to complete the maternity payment application form if required.
<P>

<a name="10228w18.html_para1">There are no plans to change the conditions of eligibility. We consider that the NASS application time scale is reasonable. This allows asylum seekers to apply for the maternity payment between one month before the estimated date of delivery and two weeks after the birth. Additionally, a payment may be made if a child was born outside the United Kingdom to a person who, on application, qualifies for NASS support and the child is three months of age or less.
<P>

<a name="10228w18.html_para2">Written advice on applications for the maternity payment is available from the NASS in English. The voluntary sector one-stop shops are funded by the Home Office to provide relevant advice in other languages to asylum seekers if required.
<P>

<a name="10228w18.html_para3">There are no plans at present to change the NASS maternity provision. However, the Government are currently reviewing the operation of the NASS voucher scheme. If serious problems are found they will be properly addressed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10228w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Roche </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2001]:</i> We intend to introduce juxtaposed entry controls on Eurostar trains arriving from Paris, Lille and Calais-Frethun as soon as legislation will allow. The timing of the deployment of United Kingdom immigration officers will depend upon ratification by the French Parliament of the Additional Protocol to the Sangatte Protocol governing the control of international traffic through the Channel Tunnel. We understand this will now take place in early summer 2001.
<P>

<a name="10228w18.html_para4">The United Kingdom Immigration Service proposes to staff juxtaposed controls from within its agreed staffing allocations for 2001-2002. It will have 1,000 more operational staff, (Assistant Immigration Officers, Immigration Officers and Chief Immigration Officers) in post in May this year than it did in April 2000. Waterloo will provide the immigration officers to operate the juxtaposed controls at Paris and Lille. Controls at Calais-Frethun will be conducted by staff deployed at the Channel Tunnel site at Coquelles. We do not intend to use staff from other areas of the Home Office.

 The Government have put in place a series of measures aimed at families with children, including: record increases in Child Benefit, with a 26 per cent. real increase in the rate for the first child since 1997; the new Children's Tax Credit, worth up to &#163;442 a year for around 5 million families from April 2001; the introduction of the Working Families Tax Credit in October 1999, to make work pay for low and middle income working families with children.
<P>

<a name="10228w18.html_para6">These measures, together with the new 10p income tax band, the cut in the basic rate of income tax to 22p and reforms to National Insurance Contributions, mean that by April this year the tax burden on the typical family will be at its lowest level since 1972.

 I have regular discussions with my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister on a wide range of issues. The determining factor underpinning any Government decision is whether the economic case for the UK joining the single currency is clear and unambiguous. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor has clearly set out the Five Economic Tests, which must be met before any decision to join can be taken. The Government will make another assessment of the Five Economic Tests early in the next Parliament. The Five Tests will assess the economic case for entry of the whole of the UK, including Scotland.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if she will make a statement on the impact of the vehicle fuel duties on the rural economy in Scotland.  [145640]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10228w19.html_spnew10"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Vehicle fuel duty is only one of many factors that have an impact on Scotland's rural economy and needs to be seen in the context of overall UK fiscal policy. The measures announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his pre-Budget report to reduce fuel duties for cleaner fuels and vehicle excise duty will benefit all Scottish motorists and bring significant financial benefits to Scotland's economy. In particular, the abolition of Vehicle Excise Duty for Tractors and agricultural vehicles will benefit up to 20,000 agricultural producers in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="10228w19.html_para4">Independent research commissioned by my Department has shown that the level of taxation paid by private motorists in Scotland is lower than in other European countries such as Netherlands, Finland, Ireland and Portugal. The average Scottish driver pays &#163;1,000 a year less than in Denmark.
