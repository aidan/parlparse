The housing waiting list includes those who consider social housing as their preferred or one of a number of housing options, and those who decide to get onto the waiting list ladder before they need or want to move house&#151;particularly where the priority system is heavily based on waiting time. The size of the housing waiting list is not an indicator of absolute need, it is only useful as a broad indicator of housing demand in an area.</p>

 As part of the community infrastructure business case requirements and owing to the value of the Roscommon Way Extension scheme (in excess of &#163;10 million) the Departments for Transport and Communities and Local Government requested that Essex county council complete a full &#145;Major Schemes Business Case&#146;. This was subsequently submitted in May 2008. It contained an initial environmental assessment which included noise, air quality, landscape, townscape, heritage, biodiversity and water environment analyses. Building on this assessment, the county council has submitted a planning application which includes a detailed environmental impact assessment, which proposes a raft of mitigation measures including invertebrate relocation, avoidance of water courses and careful landscaping to minimise the noise impact.</p>

 Under current plans the sanctions that will apply will be similar to those in place for refusing to take the steps necessary to tackle other barriers to work. Currently, for failing to comply with a Jobseeker Direction, the claimant will incur two weeks&#146; benefit loss in the first instance, followed by four and 26 weeks&#146; loss for repeated failure to comply. Those on employment and support allowance can lose up to half of the work related activity component of their benefit for four weeks if they fail to meet with conditionality requirements. If they still fail to cooperate they can lose their work related activity component in full.</p>

The September qualifying week is used to ensure that payments can be made before Christmas. If the qualifying period were to be extended or a later week used, the payment exercise could not be completed in time for the payments to be available when they are most needed.

1. Data are unrounded.<br>
2. These figures are not fully comparable over time and may not indicate developments in the labour market. Changes to Jobcentre Plus vacancy handling procedures have led to a major discontinuity in the vacancy statistic pre and post May 2006. See http://www.nomisweb.co.Uk/articles/177.aspx#may06 before comparing data over this period. Interpretation of these data need to take account of changes in recent years to Jobcentre Plus procedures for taking and handling vacancies.<br>
3. Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) are available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.<br>

To address this we are investing a further &#163;0.5 billion to ensure the support available to people who lose their jobs increases the longer a person is unemployed. The package of support for people who are still unemployed after six months includes: employer &#147;Golden Hellos&#148; of up to &#163;2,500 to recruit and train people; support to set up a new business along with funding for the first months of trading; additional training places to help people develop work-related skills; and more opportunities to volunteer where this will help a person move towards work.</p>

 The Government believe that every lesson counts and it is right that schools should stay open wherever reasonably practicable during severe weather conditions, subject to health and safety considerations. If some of a school's pupils whose home is not within walking distance of the school get to school by transport that is provided by the school or a local education authority, and that transport is not available because of adverse weather conditions, then if the school stays open, those pupils should be marked using code Y (forced and partial closure). Code Y does not count as absence in the statistics. All other children should be expected to attend and should be recorded as present/absent as normal. Our data do not enable us to alter the formula in any way that would isolate the absences due to inclement weather, or even the days concerned&#151;we only have total numbers of absences for each term and cannot isolate particular days (or even weeks). This does mean that the absence percentage for a school that stays open may be higher than if it had closed if significant numbers of pupils are unable to attend. However, our main focus is on persistent absence (which we define as missing 20 per cent. or more of possible sessions). It is unlikely that persistent absence would be significantly affected by short periods of adverse weather. Moreover when looking at attendance, Ofsted inspectors look at trends over time. When looking at registers, if there appear to be specific days or periods of time when there is high absence inspectors will discuss with the school the reasons for it. Similarly the national strategies will take account of such circumstances in their support and challenge work on persistent absence with LAs and schools.</p>

At the same time we launched an independent review of how this might be achieved in the most effective and practicable way. Sir Alasdair Macdonald, the headteacher of Morpeth school in Tower Hamlets, is conducting the review and will report in April 2009.

<i>  [holding answer 23 February 2009]:</i> The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) is currently agreeing with school sixth forms the funding allocations for 2009/10. Those allocations will take account of the number of pupils schools recruited and retained in 2008/09 and whether this was above or below planned expectations. We anticipate that where numbers exceeded plans in 2008/09, this above planned growth will be consolidated into 2009/10 allocations. However, this will be subject to affordability.</p>

Where this is the case the LSC will consider, on a case by case basis, the need for extra funding in exceptional circumstances. However, as announced in the LSC's Annual Statement of Priorities, published in November 2008, the DCSF and LSC are currently considering whether a more flexible system of funding is needed to best ensure that funding matches learner choice.</p>

PR campaigns by their nature are time-limited and so it would not be cost-efficient to retain staff internally to run them. Contracting outside agencies also enables the Department to gain external specialist expertise as well as supporting the creative industries.

The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV - for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220.<br>

These are under an initiative known as the &#145;Optimum Business Model&#146; (OBM). The OBM comprises nine recommendations, the key element being the introduction of proactive case progression teams that ensure cases are ready in advance of the court hearing. OBM has focused on eliminating waste and duplication, streamlining processes and improving timeliness. It has been implemented across 40 of the 42 Crown Prosecution Service areas to date and considerable benefits have been gained not least in the improved timeliness of the prosecution review of cases, in better rates of readiness for trial and responses to correspondence. A system has been introduced to record numbers of adjournments and the reasons why they occurred which is currently under review. Early indications show a reduction of adjournments overall in line with the introduction of criminal justice simple speedy summary (CJSSS) processes and the contribution of OBM.</p>

 The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) appointed regional offender managers (ROMs) as commissioners of services. As a result of structural changes in NOMS, Directors of Offender Managers have now been appointed (due to be announced imminently). The ROMs will remain in post until 31 March 2009. The role will then end as the new structure comes into place. The expectation is that there will be no redundancies as a result of this change as our objective is to redeploy the ROMs into other roles.</p>

 It is a mandatory requirement that prisons check the correctness of the calculation of a prisoner&#146;s release date 14 days and two days before release. At this point, a check is also made to ensure that there is no other reason a prisoner should be detained in custody, such as, if they are remanded to custody on further charges or held on immigration matters. Additionally, re-calculations and checks are also carried out during the course of the sentence should a prisoner be transferred from one establishment to another.

 The National Offender Management Service has a broad, integrated and evidence-based prisoner suicide prevention strategy that seeks to reduce the distress of all those in prison.

Any prisoner identified as at risk of suicide or self-harm is cared for using the Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) procedures. ACCT is the prisoner-centred flexible care-planning system introduced across the prisons estate in partnership with the Department of Health during 2005 to 2007 to replace the old F2052SH system.</p>

1. The offence of &#145;Failing to give up a dog for destruction having custody of a dog whilst disqualified&#146; is an offence under the Badger Act (1992) and the Dangerous Dogs Act (1991). It has been included in these figures, although it is not possible to tell which Act was intended when sentencing.<br>
2. The statistics are presented on the principal offence basis, where an offender has been sentenced for more than one offence the principal offence is the one for which the heaviest sentence was imposed, where the same sentence has been imposed for two or more offences the principal offence is the one for which the statutory maximum is most severe.<br>
3. These figures have been drawn from administrative data systems. Although care is taken when processing and analysing the returns, the detail collected is subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large scale recording system<br>

Only those county courts which do not have direct on site access to PCOL were affected. Consequently, upward adjustments have been applied which estimate the effects of the missing data.

 The scoping exercise involved a series of meetings with stakeholders to discuss implementation. The enforcement provisions in the Tribunals, Court and Enforcement Act 2007 are far reaching reforms. The provisions have recently undergone a comprehensive reassessment by Ministers to ensure that they remain appropriate even under this difficult financial climate. This assessment has now concluded and a statement will be made shortly.</p>

It was considered reasonable to offer limited drinks (alcoholic or non-alcoholic) as part of that meal. The normal subsistence allowance was not paid to attendees.</p>

<i> [holding answer 23 February 2009]:</i> On 3 December 2008 the Court of Appeal upheld an Asylum and Immigration Tribunal finding that there is no evidence that failed asylum seekers who are returned from the UK to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) face a general risk on return. The UK Border Agency continuously monitors the situation in asylum intake countries and is not aware of any subsequent allegations of ill-treatment of returnees to the DRC.</p>

We are therefore setting up a short-term central improvement team for mixed sex accommodation with an expected life of around six months. The intention is that thereafter responsibility will be devolved to the NHS. The fine details of who will be employed in the teams, and how they will be deployed will depend on local needs, and are currently being developed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_547"><a name="90225w0025.htm_para1"><a name="09022629004004">Funding from the privacy and dignity fund will not be specifically attached to improvement teams, rather it will be distributed against detailed plans drawn up by each SHA. Distribution of resources within SHAs will be based on those schemes that demonstrate the greatest return for the planned investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_548"><a name="90225w0025.htm_para2"><a name="09022629004005">Our existing definitions in respect of the environment are still relevant, and are set out below. However, we have expanded this to move towards a definition based on individual patient experience, rather than on buildings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_549"><a name="90225w0025.htm_para3"><a name="09022629004006">It is not acceptable for people to share sleeping accommodation unless it can be clinically justified for each patient. Some of the circumstances in which this might apply are as follows:</p>
<a name="90225w0025.htm_brev1"><a name="09022629004603"><ul><p class="tabletext">patient needs very high-tech care, with one-to-one nursing (e.g. ICU, HDU);</p>
</ul><a name="90225w0025.htm_brev2"><a name="09022629004604"><ul><p class="tabletext">patient needs very specialised care, where one nurse might be caring for a small number of patients and cannot safely leave the room other than for very short periods (e.g. immediately following major surgery); and</p>
</ul><a name="90225w0025.htm_brev3"><a name="09022629004605"><ul><p class="tabletext">patient needs very urgent care (e.g. rapid admission following a heart attack)</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_550"><a name="90225w0025.htm_para4"><a name="09022629004007">Inevitably, applicability of the above circumstances calls for a fine judgement that needs to be made on an individual basis. For instance, in a four-bed bay, it means that mixing must be justifiable for all patients, not just one. It is also a judgement that needs to be revisited regularly&#151;for example, in the very early stages following a stroke, when the patient has reduced consciousness and needs regular observation, then mixing might be justifiable. However, in the later stages of recovery, when the patient is receiving rehabilitation (or palliative care), then we would expect greater segregation.</p>

 The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) in partnership with professional bodies and other stakeholders, including patient groups and representatives of the national health service (NHS), has developed a national strategy to significantly reduce the incidence of multiple births resulting from in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and related treatments. This strategy is known as the One at a Time campaign and includes promoting greater use of single embryo transfers (SET) where this is clinically appropriate for individual patients, leaving scope for the exercise of clinical discretion. The Department has observer status on the group that has determined the strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_555"><a name="90225w0025.htm_para9"><a name="09022629004016">The HFEA policy aims to lower the average national multiple birth rate from the current rate of just under 23 per cent. of all live birth events following IVF and related treatments to 10 per cent. For 2009, HFEA licensed treatment centres are expected not to exceed the 24 per cent. figure, a figure determined by the HFEA, on the basis of national average at the time the Year 1 target was agreed. This target will be progressively lowered towards a 10 per cent. national target. The HFEA will carefully monitor the impact of its policy, including any impact on fresh embryo treatment cycle pregnancy rates, to ensure that all the target rates set are appropriate. The HFEA will set a Year 2 maximum multiple birth rate in the light of progress during 2009. The HFEA wrote to all directors of public health in primary care trusts about this on 4 February 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_556"><a name="90225w0025.htm_para10"><a name="09022629004017">The HFEA has required all licensed treatment centres to have in place a documented multiple births minimisation strategy, setting out how they intend to reduce their annual multiple birth rates and to ensure that they do not exceed the maximum rate set. These strategies must include criteria for SET. Centres are required to send copies of their strategies to the HFEA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_557"><a name="90225w0025.htm_para11"><a name="09022629004018">The Department has established an expert group on commissioning NHS infertility provision to identify the barriers to the implementation of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) fertility guideline in England and to help NHS commissioners to progress towards full implementation of the guideline. The expert group produced an interim report in August 2008, which recognised that patients are more likely to accept SET if they are assured that provision of services is established in line with the NICE guideline.</p>

 Good progress is being made in implementing the White Paper &#147;Pharmacy in England: Building on strengths&#151;delivering the future&#148; to achieve the Government's future vision for pharmaceutical services in this country. The two national clinical directors for pharmacy have been appointed to champion the development of pharmaceutical services and help deliver the White Paper's objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_566"><a name="90225w0026.htm_para0"><a name="09022629004069">As chapter 3 of the White Paper sets out, we are keen to improve the way medicines are accessed and used. Research has been commissioned from the universities of York and London to examine the scale and cost of medicines wasted, as well as the complex and varied reasons why people do not take their medicines as intended. The findings are expected later this year and will inform policy development for influencing both health professionals and members of the public to reduce the amount of unwanted medicines and provide value for money for the national health service. The figure of &#163;100 million for the costs of unwanted and unused medicines in the White Paper is no more than a cautious estimate. The 2000 Spending Review stated that &#147;various small scale studies have suggested that the value of medicines returned to pharmacies amounts to  <br>

Copies of the documents have already been placed in the Library. Home delivery services are commissioned by PCTs according to patients' needs locally. Many pharmacies voluntarily provide such a service.</p>

They have a particularly important role in detecting and reporting suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in association with over the counter medicines including herbal products and newly reclassified medicines. By the end of January 2009, the Medicines Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) had received in excess of 20,000 reports from the profession, contributing 13 per cent. of all yellow cards annually.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_570"><a name="90225w0026.htm_para4"><a name="09022629004073">The MHRA recognises that pharmacists have a crucial role to play in pharmacovigilance, not just in the submission of suspected ADR reports, but also in raising public awareness of patient reporting. Following a successful national campaign to raise awareness of the yellow card scheme in community pharmacies during 2008, there was a 50 per cent. increase in patient reporting and a doubling in online reporting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_571"><a name="90225w0026.htm_para5"><a name="09022629004074">The MHRA is now exploring further use of the pharmacy network in conjunction with the chief pharmaceutical officer for England. To recognise the important role pharmacists play in pharmacovigilance, specific information pages for pharmacists are being launched on the MHRA website at the end of February 2009. These will provide up to date information and guidance on ADR reporting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_572"><a name="90225w0026.htm_para6"><a name="09022629004075">A wider range of services is being commissioned from pharmacies according to local need. Some PCTs are commissioning community pharmacies to provide seasonal influenza vaccination following training and accreditation, to help GPs attain their targets. Information on the proportion of all pharmacies providing this service is not collected centrally. In many parts of the country, pharmacies are one of the main sources of access to emergency hormonal contraception, either through over the counter sales or through the use of patient group directions. In addition, a total of &#163;26.8 million of additional funding has been allocated in 2008-09 to special health authorities (SHAs) and PCTs  <br>

to improve women's knowledge of, and access to, the full range of contraception, to help reduce the number of teenage pregnancies and abortions. It is for SHAs and PCTs to determine how to use this funding most effectively to meet the needs of their local populations. SHAs have been working with PCTs to agree local action plans to develop innovative schemes, including pharmacy-based schemes, to improve awareness of and access to all types of contraception. The extent to which pharmacies have been included in local schemes to help reduce unintended pregnancies has not been assessed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_573"><a name="90225w0026.htm_para7"><a name="09022629004076">Many pharmacies are already providing services to people with diabetes&#151;ranging from blood glucose testing and carrying out blood pressure measurements to providing healthy lifestyle advice. The Department is working with the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain and the National Pharmacy Association to develop resources to support the further integration of pharmacy into the care of people with diabetes, which will be endorsed by the national clinical director for diabetes and the chief pharmaceutical officer for England. These resources, expected to be completed by autumn 2009, will identify how pharmacy can play its part in the integrated care of people with diabetes to help ensure that patients get seamless care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_574"><a name="90225w0026.htm_para8"><a name="09022629004077">Pharmacists also have an important role in raising awareness of symptoms of cancer. The Department has funded leaflets containing key messages on lung cancer awareness, which will be distributed to all community pharmacies shortly. The Department will be discussing with key stakeholders and interested parties, how best to incorporate referral systems for people with symptoms indicative of cancer, within the community pharmacy contractual framework. The Department is also considering how to engage pharmacists further in raising awareness of other cancers and referring on to other healthcare professionals, where appropriate.</p>

Both services will take account of local enhanced services already being commissioned by PCTs, research into public awareness and knowledge, and will be subject to further negotiation.

<p><a name="stpa_579"><a name="90225w0026.htm_para13"><a name="09022629004082">These developments need to be underpinned by effective professional relationships, communications and information technology. The Department asked NHS employers in 2008 to convene and lead a working group of pharmacy, medical and public representatives to formulate a series of actions to promote more effective professional relationships. Further details of the working group are held by NHS employers. One aspect of the group's remit was to identify and agree mechanisms that can support further incremental implementation of repeat dispensing. In January 2009, the working group published &#147;Guidance for the implementation of repeat dispensing&#148; for general practices, to support this. A copy has been placed in the Library. In addition, the working group have published guidance for general practices on the medicines use review service, and have issued a joint letter to community pharmacists, general practitioners and their local representatives to help facilitate discussions between general practitioners GPs and pharmacists on key work areas including repeat dispensing. The three documents can be found at:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_580"><a name="90225w0026.htm_para14"><a name="09022629004083">To support communication planning the Department commissioned an extensive qualitative research programme in September 2008 that was completed, as scheduled, in December. The research identified key segments within the population and gave insight into their differing uses of, and attitudes towards, pharmacy. The Department is considering the implications of these findings for the communications programme and expects to publish the research together with an outline communications plan later this spring. Further qualitative research is being commissioned by the Department on the opinions of the pharmacy profession towards delivering the services outlined in the White Paper. This research will be completed by this summer. &#163;65,000 has been spent in 2008-09 to date on the research to support the communications programme. Estimates for future years' expenditure are not yet available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_581"><a name="90225w0026.htm_para15"><a name="09022629004084">A pharmacy information technology programme is being established by the Department and NHS Connecting for Health.

<p><a name="stpa_582"><a name="90225w0026.htm_para16"><a name="09022629004085">Structural and legislative reform is also needed and the Department consulted on a number of proposals in autumn 2008, including PCTs assessing pharmaceutical needs. A preliminary report of the outcome of that consultation on those elements which require changes  <br>

to the primary legislation was published on 16 January 2009 alongside the Health Bill 2009. The Bill proposes placing a requirement on PCTs to undertake and to publish their assessments of pharmaceutical needs. Subject to parliamentary approval, regulations would then set out the structure and content of these assessments, how PCTs should carry them out and the requirements for publication. The Department expects to work closely with interested parties, including NHS and contractors' representatives, on drafting the regulations. At this stage, the Department does not propose to pilot these requirements, but to roll them out across PCTs with appropriate support and training programmes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_583"><a name="90225w0026.htm_para17"><a name="09022629004086">The Department asked NHS Employers to set up a short-term working group in 2008 to review the structure of, and data requirements for, PCTs&#146; pharmaceutical needs assessments and to develop a support programme so that these assessments will be an effective and robust commissioning tool, which support local decisions. NHS employers published the first element of this support programme&#151;&#147;Guidance for PCTs on pharmaceutical needs assessments (PNAs) as part of world class commissioning&#148;, which has been prepared to dovetail with the world-class commissioning programme&#151;on 7 January 2009. A copy has been placed in the Library. It is available at:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_584"><a name="90225w0026.htm_para18"><a name="09022629004087">Further resources will be published later this spring. These will include guidance on how to commission pharmaceutical services and more detailed advice on the information these needs assessments should contain. These resources are designed to provide a comprehensive support programme for PCTs to achieve the necessary capability to be world-class commissioners of high quality pharmaceutical services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_585"><a name="90225w0026.htm_para19"><a name="09022629004088">The Department is committed to continuing to work with the NHS and the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee to devise proposals to ensure that effective arrangements are in place to address unwarranted variations in standards and quality of pharmaceutical service delivery. Following consultation last autumn, provisions in the Health Bill 2009 will, subject to parliamentary approval, introduce new powers to enable PCTs, through regulations, to issue remedial notices to contractors or to withhold payments due to them. These new powers will form part of the Department's programme to ensure appropriate discretionary levers are available to PCTs to secure quality pharmaceutical services and to manage contractors' performance. Subject to discussions with key stakeholders and negotiation, this will be supported by strengthening the clinical governance requirements of the contractual framework which already require amongst other things, contractors to carry out an annual patient survey and one pharmacy-based and one multi-disciplinary audit. These audits are undertaken locally and no data is held on them centrally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_586"><a name="90225w0026.htm_para20"><a name="09022629004089">Research to inform future developments and an appropriate pharmacy workforce are also important. Research into pharmaceutical services is a relatively new area. Its focus has largely been on the acceptability and uptake of services by the public and on perceptions of the profession and their job satisfaction. Measures to date have largely been expressed in terms of inputs and outputs, rather than in terms of service quality, outcomes and relative cost effectiveness.</p>

<i> Notes</i>:<br>
1. Finished admission episodes: A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
2. Data quality: Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
3. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years {particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
4. Number of admissions in which the patient had a 'poisoning (improper use) by steroids'<sup>(1)</sup> primary or secondary diagnosis: These figures represent the number of admissions where the diagnosis was recorded in any of the 14 primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each admission episode is only counted once in each count, even if the diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br>

These include spontaneous adverse drug data from the UK and worldwide, clinical trials and epidemiological studies, worldwide published medical literature, data from the manufacturer and information from worldwide regulatory authorities.</p>

Although no formal research was undertaken directly by the Department, all available safety information was continuously evaluated by the MHRA as it emerged. Throughout these reviews, additional data and analyses were requested from the company where necessary to facilitate thorough assessment. Product information for prescribers and patients was updated during the course of these reviews, in line with expert advice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_600"><a name="90225w0028.htm_para2"><a name="09022629004359">In response to public concern, in May 2003, an Expert Working Group was established to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the available data relating to the safety of SSRI antidepressants, in particular, the risk of suicidal behaviour and withdrawal reactions. The Expert Group considered the findings of laboratory, clinical and observational studies along with information relating to reports of patient experiences. In relation to the risk of suicidal behaviour, the MHRA conducted a study using the UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD). Full information on the data considered as part of this review has been published in the group&#146;s report which is available on the MHRA&#146;s website at:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_611"><a name="90225w0028.htm_para13"><a name="09022629004391">The regulatory minimum ratio derives from the Basel 2 Accord, implemented in the European Union via the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) which came into force on 1 January 2008 (Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC). The framework consists of three pillars.  <br>

Pillar 1 sets the minimum capital requirements required to meet credit, market and operational risks. Pillar 2 requires firms and supervisors (in this case the Financial Services Authority&#151;FSA) to take a view on whether a firm should hold additional capital against risks not covered in Pillar 1. Pillar 3 requires firms to publish certain details of their capital and risk management.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_612"><a name="90225w0028.htm_para14"><a name="09022629004392">Full details of these capital requirements can be found in FSA &#147;GENPRU&#148; and &#147;BIPRU&#148; rulebooks, available via the FSA&#146;s website.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_613"><a name="90225w0028.htm_para15"><a name="09022629004393">The regulatory minimum capital adequacy ratio under Pillar 1 is 8 per cent. of total capital, of which a minimum of 4 per cent. must be tier 1 capital, which includes ordinary shares and reserves. In practice firms&#146; regulatory capital may be higher than this, and firms may also decide to hold more capital than the regulatory minimum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_614"><a name="90225w0028.htm_para16"><a name="09022629004394">As the FSA made clear in its statement of 19 January, the purpose of the recent bank recapitalisation exercise was to ensure that participating institutions held sufficient capital to ensure a buffer against challenging economic conditions. This did not constitute creating new statutory capital requirements for the UK banking sector.</p>

The definition of expenditure used in the data covers a wide range of activities, some of which will already be subject to the current 5 per cent. reduced rate of VAT (while complete demolitions and rebuilds of houses are currently zero rated). The estimates also do not factor in behavioural responses, the current 15 per cent. standard rate of VAT, those businesses not registered for VAT or developments in the relevant markets since 2007.</p>

 Yes. The summer opening programme has to break even over a three-year period, during which time prices are held; the current period is 2007-09. Full price adult tickets sold for the 2008 summer opening cost &#163;12. With the reduction in VAT rate, in 2009 these will cost &#163;11.70. Other ticket types will be similarly reduced.</p>
