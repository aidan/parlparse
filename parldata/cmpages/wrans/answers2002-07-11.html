<P>
<a name="20711w01.html_spnew0"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Department does not maintain a register of all approved wind farm projects, and approval is usually a matter for local determination. From the information available to us, which may not be complete, we are aware of 67 locally-granted approvals for wind farms since 1997. In addition, approvals for two wind farms over 50MW declared net capacity have been given centrally in accordance with section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989.

 The Department does not maintain a register of all approved wind farm projects, and approval is usually a matter for local determination. From the information available to us, which may not be complete, we are aware of four approvals for wind farms in or near Workington, and 129 for wind farms in the United Kingdom. The UK figure includes two approvals given by central Government, in accordance with section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989, for wind farms over 50MW declared net capacity.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what measures she is taking to assist the aerospace industry.  [66378]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20711w01.html_spnew2"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 This Government have a track record of providing significant support to this important sector. For example, we have committed nearly &#163;1 billion in launch investment support over the past five years for major new airframe and aero-engine programmes.
<P>

<a name="20711w01.html_para0">In addition, support for civil aircraft research and technology currently runs at about &#163;20 million a year. And, as large investors in R&D, aerospace companies will benefit from the recently announced tax credit scheme for larger firms.
<P>

<a name="20711w01.html_para1">We are working closely with other Government Departments on how best to address a wide range of problems faced by the UK aerospace industry. For the longer-term, this embraces a wide range of complex, cross-cutting policy issues&#151;for example, support for research and technology, launch investment, export financing arrangements and defence procurement matters. For the nearer term, we are looking at how to make the

<a name="20711w01.html_para2">To help with this process, my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, announced on 16 May the formation of the Aerospace Innovation and Growth Team, lead by Sir Richard Evans. This will enable key stakeholders to work together to produce a shared vision and strategy for the future success of the industry. I expect Sir Richard and his team to report by the end of March 2003. This will enable an informed debate to take place followed by an agreed action plan to take the industry forward.

12. <a name="20711w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Savidge: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on employment protection for shopworkers.  [66379]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20711w01.html_spnew3"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 In general, protection applies to shopworkers as it does to workers in other sectors of the labour market. For example, if any employer tries to change an employee's terms and conditions of contract without their consent, or dismisses the employee for no good reason, the employee may be able to make a claim. For historical reasons, there is specific additional protection for shopworkers in England and Wales who do not wish to work on Sundays.

 Up to the end of June there have been 23 applications under the small-scale individual stream. 17 of these have been approved, including that of the hon Member for Blaby. The first system was installed on a house in Dover in June.
<P>

<a name="20711w01.html_para3">For medium and large-scale installations, the first of our quarterly calls for proposals closed at the end of June.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20711w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Rural postal services are safeguarded by the universal postal service obligation which the government laid down in primary legislation in the Postal 



<P>
<P><I>11 Jul 2002 : Column 1083W</I><P>
Services Act 2000. The legislation says that the obligation consists of a service provided at an affordable price determined by a public tariff uniform throughout the UK and includes the delivery each working day to the home or premises of every individual in the UK and a collection each working day from access points. Under the Act it is the Postal Services Commission's (known as Postcomm) primary duty to ensure the provision of a universal postal service and it currently requires Consignia, in the licence, to provide the universal postal service.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20711w01.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The programme to restructure the urban post office network has not yet started and I am advised by Post Office Limited that, until it does, there are no specific plans for post office closures in the Portsmouth South constituency. When the programme starts it will be taken forward in consultation with individual subpostmasters, the community, local stakeholders and Postwatch. Under the Code of Practice, Post Office Limited is required to consult Postwatch on individual changes and is briefing it on the process envisaged for reaching decisions.
<P>

<a name="20711w01.html_para4">The objective of the urban network restructuring programme is to provide modernised and improved facilities which meet customers' needs and expectations and are in the right location for the local community.

<a name="20711w03.html_para0">In addition, we will use WSSD to reaffirm the EU's commitment to the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) so as to add momentum to the negotiations in the WTO. These include negotiations to provide substantial improvements in market access for developing countries; to reduce, with a view to phasing out, all forms of agricultural export subsidies; and to make substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic agricultural support.

 No. We do intend to publish a consultative document this autumn that seeks views on the requests that have been made of the EC and member states, to the extent that these affect the United Kingdom.

 My Department is working with the Cabinet Office to increase the availability of flexible working at senior levels, including tackling the design of senior posts.
<P>

<a name="20711w06.html_para0">The civil service continues to make progress on increasing the numbers of women at senior levels. In the top 600 posts, the proportion of women has increased from 12.7 per cent. in 1998 to 21.2 per cent. in October 2001. In the senior civil service as a whole, the proportion has increased from 17.6 per cent. to 25.3 per cent. over the same period.

<P>
<a name="20711w06.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Surveys carried out when drawing up the Green Paper on work and parents (published December 2000) showed that most employers identified benefits from flexible working. We have since continued to compile extensive case study evidence which demonstrate that employers can see real business benefits by implementing flexible working patterns. Our campaign is based on what shrewd employers are already doing, because of their own business needs.

 The pay gap between men and women currently stands at 18 per cent, down from 20 per cent. in 1997. In the financial services sector, the gap has reduced from 30 per cent. to 29 per cent. over the same time period. The Government are taking a number of steps to reduce the pay gap further. As well as the introduction of the National Minimum Wage and the provisions in the Employment Bill, the Fair Pay Champions and Castle Awards, are helping to spread good practice on equal pay. All Government Departments are committed to carrying out a pay review by March 2003.

 I am today placing a copy of the Cabinet Office's report on the issue of timber procurement for the 22 Whitehall project in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="20711w06.html_para4">The report shows that timber for the 22 Whitehall project was not procured in line with the Government's policy of seeking to procure timber from legal and sustainable sources. This has led to the procurement of sapele timber, for which there is no independent certification of sustainability available, from forests in Central Africa.
<P>

<a name="20711w06.html_para5">The report also sets out a number of actions that the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Office of Government Commerce will be taking to improve the Government's adherence to the policy on timber procurement. The Cabinet Office is also taking a number of steps to improve its own domestic position on timber procurement.
<P>

<a name="20711w06.html_para6">I am grateful to the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms Walley) for her interest in the issue of timber procurement. The specific case of the 22 Whitehall project has highlighted a significant level of confusion associated with the terminology used in connection with the specification of timber in contracts. This clearly has implications across Government Departments as employers of contractors, and among contractors themselves. The actions set out in the report published today reflect the importance the Government attaches to improving its position on the issue of timber procurement. The Government

 Revenue is dependent on the price of oil, the exchange rate and the levels of production and expenditure. Decisions on levels of production and expenditure will be taken by companies on the basis of actual and expected prices. A significant and sustained change in oil prices would lead to different levels of production and expenditure. The yield will also be affected by differential movements in gas prices relative to oil. By way of an estimate, at current levels of planned production and expenditure, at an exchange rate of &#163;1/$1.40, a movement in the oil price of $5 could be expected to affect revenue by about &#163;2.2 billion in a full year. At an exchange rate of &#163;1/$1.50, a similar movement would affect revenue by about &#163;2.0 billion in a full year. These estimates assume that gas prices would move broadly in line with the price of oil.

 The Valuation Office Agency (VOA) is the executive agency of the Inland Revenue that is responsible for preparing and maintaining rating lists. It has received representations from a number of bodies including Wales Opponents of Pheasant Shooting and Animal Aid requesting confirmation that specified game farms are assessed for non-domestic rates (NNDR).




<P>
<P><I>11 Jul 2002 : Column 1104W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20711w07.html_para1">The VOA has also been requested by the Game Farmers Association to ensure that their membership and others in the industry are all treated fairly in relation to non domestic rates.
<P>

<a name="20711w07.html_para2">Game farms have been assessed for NNDR in the 1990, 1995 and 2000 rating lists.
<P>

<a name="20711w07.html_para3">The Valuation Office Agency has undertaken various initiatives over recent years to identify this class of property and to enter them in the non-domestic rating lists. Where the valuation officer is aware of a property operating as a game farm and it is not assessed for non- domestic rates, then the circumstances are investigated.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20711w07.html_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Historical estimates of the number of households facing marginal deduction rates in excess of 70 per cent. for 1997&#150;98 through to 1999&#150;2000 are contained in the Social Security Departmental Report&#151;The Government's Expenditure Plans 2000&#150;01 to 2001&#150;02. Forward-looking estimates, which include the impact of the tax and benefit changes made in Budgets since 1997, are contained in the Budget 2002 report. Tax and benefit changes made since 1997 have reduced the number of households facing marginal deduction rates in excess of 70 per cent. by around half a million.

 As part of the implementation of resource accounting and budgeting, Government Departments prepared resource and pension scheme accounts in parallel with the related appropriation accounts for 1999&#150;2000. These accounts were laid before the House by the Treasury and published by Departments. All were subject to audit and examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Thirty nine of those accounts were laid before the House under the terms of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1921 by the statutory deadline of 31 January 2001 and the remaining 10, with the agreement of the Treasury and the National Audit Office, were laid by 4 April 2001. Therefore these represent a comprehensive set of accounts for that period.

<P>
<a name="20711w09.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In our road safety strategy "Tomorrow's Roads&#151;Safer for Everyone" we gave the Driving Standards Agency (DSA) an expanded remit to contribute to improvements in road safety for young and novice drivers by establishing, developing and disseminating high standards and best practice in driving and riding on the road. We committed DSA to boosting road safety education in schools by expanding its programme of presentations to schools and colleges. Copies of the "Strategy" are available in House Libraries, and I am arranging for copies of the "Arrive Alive" material to be placed there too.
<P>

<a name="20711w09.html_para2">The schools programme was recently renamed "Arrive Alive" to reflect the wider target audience that has developed since the scheme was launched in 1996. Driving examiners now visit and make presentations to a wide range of organisations including schools and colleges, the armed forces, agricultural colleges, youth football teams, probation services and young offender units. There is no rigid procedure for DSA selecting schools, colleges or other institutions in which to carry out the presentations. In some cases a local Road Safety Officer will ask DSA to take part in a road safety presentation. In other cases, interest might be generated by a visit to the "Arrive Alive" website.
<P>

<a name="20711w09.html_para3">Independent research carried out in 1997 by the British Institute of Traffic Education and Research (BITER) concluded that the schools programme had proved effective in promoting key safety messages and in moulding attitudes among potential drivers.




<P>
<P><I>11 Jul 2002 : Column 1113W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20711w09.html_para4">The Department has funded the programme since 2000. Prior to that, DSA obtained funding from private business and from surpluses generated by DSA's non-statutory commercial activity&#151;mostly the sale of books. DSA spent &#163;65,000 in 1997&#150;98, &#163;94,000 in 1998&#150;99 and &#163;25,000 in 1999&#150;2000. In 2000&#150;01 funding by the Department amounted to &#163;250,000 and in 2001&#150;02 to &#163;500,000. We plan to increase funding so that as many young learners and novice drivers as possible can benefit from the important road safety messages that the programme conveys&#151;&#163;750,000 for 2002&#150;03 and &#163;1 million for 2003&#150;04.

 No new railway lines have been constructed in London in the last two years. Work has already commenced on the extension of the East London line to connect it into the National Rail Network. The Strategic Rail Authority's Strategic Plan gives a target completion date of 2006. The SRA is seeking to enhance levels of orbital rail services over existing infrastructure. The Mayor of London's Transport Strategy details a

<P>
<P>
<a name="20711w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Overcrowding is primarily a problem in London in the morning peak. Overall overcrowding levels fell from 1992 to 1996, rose in 1997, fell in 1998, rose in 1999 and 2000 and are unchanged in 2001.
<P>

<a name="20711w10.html_para0">In 2001, nearly half a million people travelled by train into London each morning. This is the highest figure since the late 1980s. Despite this growth in use at peak times, overcrowding has decreased on eight out of the 10 London franchises since spring 2001, and the number of operators that have overcrowding levels exceeding the SRA's threshold has fallen from five to four. These four operators all have plans in place to reduce overcrowding.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what action he is taking to reduce numbers of untaxed cars on the road.  [69174]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20711w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Detection of unlicensed vehicles on the public road is carried out by police and traffic wardens, who pass offence reports to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) for enforcement action. Last year 800,000 offenders were brought to book, bringing in &#163;110 million in fines, penalties and relicensing revenue.
<P>

<a name="20711w10.html_para1">This day to day enforcement activity is being supplemented by a number of other measures. Since 1997 a nationwide scheme has been operating to wheel clamp and impound unlicensed vehicles seen on the public road. Over 90,000 vehicles have been clamped since the scheme started. The scheme has been a success and we are investigating the possibility of expansion.
<P>

<a name="20711w10.html_para2">In addition, we significantly increased the number of joint DVLA/police campaigns against VED evaders last year and these are running at a record level. We also introduced mobile digital camera technology to detect unlicensed moving vehicles. This complements other activities which concentrate more on stationary vehicles.
<P>

<a name="20711w10.html_para3">DVLA is also working closely with other enforcement agencies in a pilot scheme to target both unlicensed and abandoned vehicles. Operation Cubit is a joint operation between DVLA, the police, fire service and local authorities which removes offending vehicles from the 



<P>
<P><I>11 Jul 2002 : Column 1115W</I><P>
road immediately. It is proving to be very popular with members of the public with each vehicle being dealt with by the legislation which is appropriate to its condition.
<P>

<a name="20711w10.html_para4">Another pilot scheme recently proved the feasibility of local authorities using DVLA's powers to wheel clamp and impound unlicensed vehicles. This is now being rolled out to any local authorities that wish to join the scheme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20711w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 DVLA currently accepts on-line notification of untaxed vehicles. Plans are also in hand to enhance the agency's website to make it even easier for customers to report untaxed vehicles on-line.
<P>

<a name="20711w10.html_para5">DVLA has also set up a trial telephone hotline notification scheme of untaxed vehicles in Hertfordshire. This started on 26 February 2002. The trial is being carefully monitored and if it proves a success, will be rolled out on a nationwide basis and will be given wide publicity.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20711w10.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 We have today published draft regulations for consultation. Copies of the consultation letter and draft regulations will be placed in the Library. The draft regulations place the liability for payment of the penalty charge where a vehicle is driven illegally in a bus lane on the registered keeper, except that where a vehicle is subject to a hire agreement, liability falls upon the person who has hired the vehicle, and where a vehicle is being kept by a motor trader who is not the vehicle's registered keeper, liability falls upon the motor trader.
<P>

<a name="20711w10.html_para6">During the passage of the Transport Act 2000 we indicated that it was intended, at least initially, that regulations for bus lane enforcement outside London would be made on the basis of driver liability. In preparing the draft regulations, advice was taken from a working party of local authority representatives, and from the independent adjudication services dealing with parking appeals and, in London, bus lane appeals, flowing from local authority enforcement. They made representations that pursuing the driver is not a practical option for civil enforcement of bus lane contraventions. Merit is also seen in having a civil enforcement regime for bus lane contraventions that parallels the well established owner liability regime of decriminalised parking enforcement. Therefore, we decided that the draft regulations would place liability for payment of a penalty charge on the registered keeper, subject to the aforementioned exceptions.

 One hundred and ten staff of the House have been given special responsibility for energy conservation and efficiency. They receive monthly data on the energy consumption in their respective parts of the estate and manage housekeeping economy measures&#151;for example, by reporting damaged windows and faulty lamps, and ensuring lights and water heaters are switched off when not in use.
<P>

<a name="20711w11.html_para0">Some &#163;30,000 has been invested each year in energy saving schemes. Recent examples include lighting occupancy sensors and thermal insulation. A contract has recently been let to replace the main Palace boilers and chillers with modern high efficiency plant over this summer recess and the summer recess of 2003. A combined heat and power plant provides electricity and domestic hot water to the Norman Shaw buildings.
<P>

<a name="20711w11.html_para1">Portcullis House was specifically designed to be energy efficient. Cooling for the air conditioning is obtained by drawing cold water from a deep aquifer. Heat exchangers recover energy from discharging warm to cool air. The thermal mass of walls, floors and ceilings balances out daily temperature changes.

 The World summit on Sustainable Development takes place in Johannesburg from 26 August to 4 September.

However, through the Environmental Action Fund we are helping voluntary organisations in England to promote sustainable development. For 2002&#150;03 we have allocated &#163;1.4 million to 25 projects promoting 'biodiversity' and &#163;3.1 million to 58 projects promoting the 'understanding and awareness of sustainable development'. In 2001&#150;02 the Environmental Action Fund supported 115 projects promoting 'sustainable living' to the tune of &#163;4.2 million. In addition, DEFRA supports Environmental Campaigns Ltd and the Energy Saving Trust's Energy Efficiency Campaign, and last financial year provided over &#163;8.2 million (it is not possible to disaggregate a small element of Scottish Executive support for the Energy Saving Trust from this figure) for both.

 <i>[holding answer 8 July 2002]:</i> Modulation is a mechanism which enables member states of the European Union to redirect a proportion of their CAP direct payments to rural development measures, should they choose to do so. It is not a mechanism through which EU funding is directed for FMD purposes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20711w14.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 July 2002]:</i> The majority of farmers do not deal directly with supermarkets. However, those that do may benefit from the supermarkets Code of Practice which the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced on 18 December 2001. Although the Code is currently binding only on the four largest supermarkets, we have been encouraging smaller supermarkets and larger processors to sign up to its principles and practices.
<P>

<a name="20711w14.html_para0">The Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food stressed the potential of collaborative ventures for all farmers, large and small, and pointed out that collaboration can put farmers in a better negotiating position when dealing with large customers. We support this view and are looking at ways in which we might encourage greater collaboration between producers. We have already proposed that one of the priorities of the new Agricultural Development Scheme will be projects promoting co-operation and collaboration benefiting primary producers. We have also been considering with others the Policy Commission's Recommendation for the establishment of an English Collaborative Board that would encourage and support collaboration and co-operation among farmers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20711w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 July 2002]:</i> This Government are committed to increasing reuse and recycling of all materials. Waste Strategy 2000 set a national target of recycling or composting at least 25 per cent. of household waste by 2005, 30 per cent. by 2010 and 33 per cent. by 2015. To underpin these targets, last year we set statutory performance standards for recycling for all local authorities in England. Authorities are required, on average, to double recycling by 2003&#150;04 and triple it by 2005&#150;06.
<P>

<a name="20711w14.html_para1">These recycling standards are not material specific. It is up to the individual authority to decide which materials to collect for recycling, depending on local circumstances. Many authorities have introduced kerbside collection of recyclables and these often include paper, glass and aluminium.
<P>

<a name="20711w14.html_para2">We are taking various steps to help local authorities increase recycling. For example, the Waste Minimisation and Recycling Programme provides &#163;140 million for local authority activities, and grants for the first year of funding have just been allocated. Around 58 of the schemes to be funded this year involve kerbside collection and a great number of these target the paper, glass and aluminium waste streams. In addition, schemes to increase bring site recycling and schemes that should raise awareness and consequently recycling rates, have also been approved.
<P>

<a name="20711w14.html_para3">We have also set up the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) to tackle the market barriers to recycling. WRAP have made good progress so far, and have awarded a grant which will result in additional paper reprocessing capacity for 320,000 tonnes of waste paper per year.
<P>

<a name="20711w14.html_para4">The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive, which the Government support, makes producers of electrical and electronic goods responsible for their recovery, treatment and environmentally sound disposal and covers inkjet cartridges if they are discarded with the printer.
<P>

<a name="20711w14.html_para5">Two of the amendments to the Directive proposed by the European Parliament are relevant to inkjet cartridges&#151;amendment 7, which would give re-use of WEEE, its components, sub-assemblies and consumables priority over recycling, and amendment 22, which would prevent the production of equipment which has been manufactured in such a way as to prevent reuse. The

<P>
<P>
<a name="20711w14.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 July 2002]:</i> Overall 56 per cent. of respondents to the recent consultation "How should England implement the 1991 Nitrates Directive?" preferred application of Action Programme measures to the whole of England. Thirty six per cent. preferred the alternative designation of discrete areas as Nitrate Vulnerable Zones. The remainder failed to state a preference. We published an independent analysis of all the responses on 27 June 2002, which is available on the DEFRA web site at "www.defra.gov.uk/environment/ water/quality/nitrate".
<P>

<a name="20711w14.html_para6">However, these responses were on the basis that 80 per cent. England would be designated under the discrete area option. Subsequent refinement of the mapping work has established that only 55 per cent. of England has to be designated. We took this into account in deciding how to proceed in the light of consultation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how the figure of &#163;165,000 compensation paid to UK Coal in respect of the Widdrington carcases disposal site was arrived at.  [66888]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20711w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 July 2002]:</i> MAFF/DEFRA negotiated a six year lease for the Widdrington mass burial site, commencing 31 March 2001. In addition to a basic rent for the occupation of the site, since the area is zoned for future coal extraction, a further premium of &#163;300,000 was paid for sterilised coal deposits.
<P>

<a name="20711w14.html_para7">This sum was determined by the local Mineral Valuer of the Valuation Office Agency in negotiation with UK Coal and was based on the area of land-take used exclusively by MAFF/DEFRA for carcase disposal and a calculation of the likely tonnage of coal that could have expected to be mined from the area.
<P>

<a name="20711w14.html_para8">The &#163;165,000 referred to in the NAO Report relates to the purchase of Tow Law mass burial site. When MAFF/DEFRA acquired the site, it paid the negotiated purchase price. However, there was in the deeds a restrictive covenant which limited use of the site to open cast mining or agriculture. If any other use was made of the land, the former owners, in this case the Coal Authority, would have to be paid a clawback of 50 per cent. of the increase in the value of the site. The increase was calculated by taking the difference between the indexed sale price achieved by the Authority and deducting this from the price paid by DEFRA, and dividing the result by 2, giving &#163;165k.

 Since 1 August 2001, it has been illegal to feed any processed animal proteins&#151;including avian proteins&#151;to animals which are kept, fattened or bred for the production of food. These legislative requirements, designed to avoid any possibility of the BSE agent getting into feedingstuffs for farmed livestock, are backed up by robust surveillance arrangements to monitor compliance. The specially developed tests which are used to help enforce the feed controls include one specifically aimed at detection of avian proteins. Given the robust controls in place, no added value would be achieved from a separate risk assessment on the animal health implications of bovine DNA contained in imported frozen chicken breasts. Consequently, no risk assessment has been produced or sent to either the inquiry into the lessons to be learned from the foot and mouth disease outbreak of 2001, or the National Audit Office Value for Money Examination into the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease, or the Royal Society Study into Infectious Diseases in Livestock.

 Units of the United Kingdom armed forces, in operational theatres, are issued with the general service combat body armour (CBA), which is a vest designed to provide protection to the chest and much of the abdomen. There is also an explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) suit that provides head-to-toe protection for EOD units. Both are manufactured from textile ballistic fabric. Two ceramic plates can be added to the CBA vest, for extra front and back protection, if required. The current EOD suit does not have ceramic plates but a new lightweight EOD suit, which like the CBA would have ceramic plates to the front and back, has recently been trialled.

 As a result of the significant increase in intelligence work following the events of 11 September, the need to augment the Defence Intelligence Staffs and other headquarters organisations by some 55 reservists continues. It is therefore necessary to call out compulsorily a second tranche of intelligence specialists to relieve the majority of those called out last February who now wish to resume their civilian employment. The individuals involved in the second tranche will primarily come from the Territorial Army, but a small number will also come from the Royal Naval Reserve and the Royal Auxiliary Air Force. They will commence their appointments in mid-August. We recognise the essential contribution made by these reservists to the operations against global terrorism and are grateful to them, their families and their employers for their support.

 An environmental survey was started on 4 July 2002 at Mill Hill to check for radioactive contamination on land that previously belonged to the Ministry of Defence. The first stage was a walk-over survey with meters to check for any radiological activity. Only two small areas meriting further investigation were found. These were on the Barnet council depot/MOD boundary and in open space in the vicinity of Notting Hill Housing Group flats. The risk to the general public is considered very low and no immediate action or special precautions are necessary.

<a name="20711w16.html_para1">The survey is a precautionary measure following a previous Land Quality Assessment of the military site at Mill Hill that identified low levels of radioactivity in a small area in the centre of the site. This activity arises from the residues of luminous paint buried in the ground. Radium based luminous paint was commonly applied to items such as vehicle dials during the second world war as well as on a wider commercial basis for watches and clock faces up to the late 1960s. The MOD intends to remove the contaminated material from Mill Hill, as it has successfully done from other sites, such as the former Admiralty Compass Observatory at Ditton Park, Slough, now sold and re-developed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20711w17.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Joint Force Logistic Component Headquarters is a capability that is formed as required. It is based on the core capability of a Logistic Brigade Headquarters enhanced by a Logistics Brigade Signal Squadron, other signals assets and augmentation from the other two Services. The first Joint Force Logistic Component HQ was able to be formed from April 2000, and we will have the capability to form a second such HQ from April 2003.
<P>

<a name="20711w17.html_para0">The capability which would have been provided by a regular Ambulance Regiment has been created within the Strategic Defence Review endorsed Medical Regiment Concept. This has been achieved by the creation of evacuation squadrons in each of the four medical regiments formed. These evacuation squadrons were fully formed by March 2001. Embedding the evacuation capability within each regiment, rather than creating a discrete capability, has enhanced our ability to deliver the ambulance and evacuation function.

 In 1996 most service families' accommodation in England and Wales was sold to Annington Homes Ltd. (AHL) under a sale and leaseback agreement.

<a name="20711w18.html_spnew0"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 The second report by the president of appeal tribunals is published today and has been placed in the Library. Of those cases where the appeal tribunal overturned or amended the decision the main reasons given were because new evidence was produced at the hearing, the presence of the appellant at the hearing shed new light on the existing evidence or they took a different view of the same evidence.




<P>
<P><I>11 Jul 2002 : Column 1144W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20711w18.html_para0">The president has highlighted some areas where improvements have been made following his first annual report. Some examples of these are; more obvious use of the reconsideration process before cases reach the tribunal, improved standards of decision-making and the use of the medical evidence in disability living allowance cases and a reduction in the number of medical reports under-estimating the severity of disability.
<P>

<a name="20711w18.html_para1">The president has suggested that the agencies should concentrate on engaging appellants fully during the dispute period and encourage them to provide additional evidence earlier. This could lead to problems being resolved without the need to go to an appeal tribunal. I welcome the president's report, which provides an independent view of the standard of Secretary of State decision-making in cases coming to the appeal tribunal.

 <i>[holding answer 13 May 2002]:</i> With certain prescribed exceptions, the Employers' Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969 (ELCI) requires all employers carrying on business in the United Kingdom to insure their liability to their employees for bodily injury or disease sustained in the course of their employment in Great Britain. There is currently a penalty of up to &#163;2,500 for failure to insure on any day.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on the financial support available to jobseekers for the cost of travelling to interviews.  [64269]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20711w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 We recognise that it can sometimes be difficult for unemployed people to meet the cost of travelling to job interviews. The travel to interview scheme, which is available from the first day of unemployment, encourages people to widen their job search by helping with travelling costs to attend interviews outside their usual travel to work area. From June this year we have widened the scope of the scheme to give personal advisers the discretion to make payments for travel to local interviews where the costs exceed &#163;4.
<P>

<a name="20711w18.html_para7">Additional help can also be provided through the Adviser Discretion Fund which gives New Deal personal advisers the opportunity to make available up to &#163;300 for anything that will help a jobseeker obtain a job, or if offered a job, to accept that job. This can include help with the costs of travel to interviews.
<P>

<a name="20711w18.html_para8">Employment Zones are also helping long-term unemployed people in the most deprived areas get and keep work. Employment Zones are about meeting the needs of individuals.

Help can be provided through Employment Zones with the cost of travelling to interviews.
<P>

<a name="20711w18.html_para9">Our Action Teams for Jobs, which focus on small areas with particular problems of labour market disadvantage, offer tailored help to enable people overcome barriers to employment. This can include financial assistance to help them secure and retain employment, such as help with the cost of attending job interviews. In addition, we introduced the Transport Projects Fund in April which provides an additional &#163;5 million for Action Teams to address the particular transport difficulties faced by some unemployed people seeking to enter the labour market.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will estimate the value of the assets, including pension funds, which <i>(a)</i> a man aged 65 and <i>(b)</i> a woman aged 60 years would need in order to receive a higher income than if they had no such assets.  [67226]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20711w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The value of assets needed for the individuals described will depend upon the level of entitlement to state pension benefits that have been built up over the individuals working lives.
<P>

<a name="20711w19.html_para0">For illustrative purposes, the following estimates can be made for a man aged 65 who has built up rights to a full single basic state pension but has no other sources of income. At current market rates assets of about &#163;14,000 or more are currently needed to purchase an annuity that generates a higher income level than if he had no such assets. The equivalent figure for a woman aged 60 is approximately &#163;17,000. In practice, it is common for someone with full basic state pension entitlement to also have additional income from SERPS but this has been excluded in the above illustration.
<P>

<a name="20711w19.html_para1">From October 2003, the introduction of the pension credit will mean that these levels will fall to zero. Any individual with a full basic state pension who has saved for their retirement will have a higher income from doing so, regardless of the amount of this saving.
<P>

<a name="20711w19.html_para2">These estimates use current 2002&#150;03 single rates for the basic state pension and minimum income guarantee, and the most favourable annuity rates quoted by The Annuity Bureau as at 4 July 2002 for an index-linked annuity with spouses benefits. It is assumed that the full pension pot is annuitised and no tax-free lump sum is taken.

Every relevant planning issue, whether of local or national importance, which is a material consideration in assessing the proposal, would be taken into account.

 The Housing Corporation's National Investment Strategy sets out the national objectives for the Approved Development Programme and the national targets. The Corporation also produces a London Investment Strategy which contains priorities for investment in that region. In addition, the Government office for London and the Housing Corporation's London office produce a London Housing Statement working closely with local and regional stakeholders including local authorities and housing associations.

 The Government see the provision of new affordable housing to meet the needs of homeless households and key workers in London as a key priority for the capital. For this reason we have increased the Housing Corporation's Approved Development Programme for 2002&#150;03 to enable more affordable homes for rent and low-cost home ownership to be built. We are also keen to ensure that new affordable housing is developed cost-effectively so as to maximise the contribution that funding can make. At the same time we

 Local housing authorities have a responsibility to produce a housing strategy which sets out plans to address the range of housing needs in their area. This includes all groups with special needs where the strategy must link into the provision of associated support services. Decisions on how these should be addressed are taken locally on the basis of the assessment of the nature and scale of the different housing needs.
<P>

<a name="20711w20.html_para1">The Housing Corporation through the Approved Development Programme (ADP) and Supported Housing Management Grant (SHMG) provide specially adapted housing and support for the disabled. The Housing Corporation through its National Investment Strategy sets out the priorities against which registered social landlords should bid for resources for both ADP and SHMG. Included in these priorities are supported housing for people with physical disabilities. The ADP is set to rise to &#163;1.2 billion in 2003&#150;04, almost double the planned expenditure for 2000&#150;01.

<a name="20711w22.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Laws: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will list the local education authorities in which <i>(a)</i> primary and <i>(b)</i> secondary school class sizes have risen since 1 May 1997, ranking these from largest to smallest increase in class sizes; and if she will make a statement.  [66275]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20711w22.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 July 2002]:</i> The available information is shown in the table. The change in average class size is not readily available for those local education authorities that underwent local Government reorganisation in 1997 and 1998. The table is therefore shown in two parts: the list for local education authorities which are unaffected by local Government reorganisation; and the second for those that are.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will make a statement on the availability of transition plans to young people over 14 with a statement of special educational needs with particular reference to the obligations and compliance of local education authorities.  [67110]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20711w23.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 July 2002]:</i> The Education (Special Educational Needs) (England) (Consolidation) Regulations 2001 make provision for all young people over 14 with statements of special educational needs to have a transition plan. Head teachers are responsible for drawing up a transition plan following the year 9 annual review of a young person's statement where he or she is in school and submitting this to the local education authority. Where the young person attends either a non-maintained special school or an independent school or does not attend school the local education authority is responsible for preparing the transition plan.
<P>

<a name="20711w23.html_para2">Figures on the numbers of young people with statements in year 9 onwards who have transition plans are not held centrally. The Department is aware of the importance of securing successful transitions for this group of young people and has commissioned a longitudinal study of 'Post-16 Transitions of Pupils with Special Educational Needs'. Its findings will inform policy development.

<P>
<a name="20711w23.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 Children with special educational needs must be educated in a mainstream school unless that is incompatible with the wishes of the child's parents, or the provision of efficient education of other children. Where a child has a statement, and the parents do not wish the child to be educated in a mainstream school, then the local education authority may educate the child in a special school. The local education authority must name the parents' preferred choice of school on the statement unless the school is unsuitable, or the child's inclusion would be incompatible with the efficient education of other children or the efficient use of resources.

<P>
<a name="20711w23.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 The Secretary of State does not issue specific guidance to local education authorities on the optimum size of special schools. Children with special educational needs must be educated in a mainstream school unless that is incompatible with the wishes of the child's parents, or the provision of efficient education of other children. Where a child has a statement, and the parents do not wish the child to be educated in a mainstream school, then the local education authority may educate the child in a special school. The local education authority must name the parents' preferred choice of school on the statement unless the school is unsuitable, or the child's inclusion would be incompatible with the efficient education of other children or the efficient use of resources.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what her Department's policy is on the sale of school playing fields.  [67227]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20711w24.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The Department has a presumption against the need to change the current pattern of playing field provision at schools. We are committed to funding schools and local education authorities so they are no longer forced to sell school playing fields to pay for school repairs. We have provided over &#163;7 billion over the last five years for capital investment in schools and are making &#163;6.5 billion available over the next two years for investment in school buildings.
<P>

<a name="20711w24.html_para0">Before October 1998, there was nothing to prevent a local authority selling a school playing field if it wanted to. To protect school playing fields from such indiscriminate disposal, we introduced legislation on 1 October 1998 that requires local authorities to obtain the Secretary of State's consent before they can dispose, or change the use, of any school playing field or any part of a school playing field that has been used by schools in the last ten years.
<P>

<a name="20711w24.html_para1">Applications to dispose, or change the use, of school playing fields are assessed against the following criteria:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a. Schools' needs: that playing field provision and curriculum requirements at the school making the disposal, and at other schools in the local area, will be met;</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>b. Community needs: that community use of a school's playing fields is taken into account, with alternative facilities made available if necessary;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>c. Finance: that any sale proceeds are re-invested to provide new or improved sports facilities at schools, or are used to help to raise standards by providing better educational facilities.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="20711w24.html_para2">Only those applications that meet the criteria are approved. All applications made since July 2001 have been scrutinised by the independent School Playing Fields Advisory Panel to make sure that they conform to the published criteria. The panel comprises representatives from the National Playing Fields Association, the Central Council of Physical Recreation, the education organisation Learning through Landscapes, the National Association of Head Teachers and the Local Government Association.

<a name="20711w24.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The rules governing specialist school sponsorship were last reviewed in May this year. As a result, we made one significant change to the criteria by reducing the amount of sponsorship required by small mainstream schools (defined as those with under 500 pupils on roll) to &#163;100 per pupil, subject to a minimum of &#163;20,000, rising to &#163;50,000 for a school with 500 pupils.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20711w24.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The guiding principles governing the eligibility of specialist school sponsorship are that it must be raised for the purpose of the application and be from a private sector source. Sponsorship from privately sourced school foundations and from parent teacher associations is acceptable. Where the school raises money by use of a public asset, such as the school's own premises, the funds are not eligible.

<a name="20711w24.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The Department for Education and Skills does not have the statistics required to make an assessment of reprocessed scrap tyre usage in schools. It is for the individual local authorities and school governors to apply the guidance on good practice in the way they consider most appropriate. The DfES has no plans to recommend an increase in the use of reprocessed scrap tyres in the future.

<a name="20711w24.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The great bulk of capital funding for schools is now allocated by formula to schools and local education authorities for them to address the investment priorities of their school buildings. These priorities are decided locally in the context of each authority's Asset Management Plan. The Department appraises each plan to ensure that prioritisation is done in an open, rigorous and consultative process, based on a full survey of the building needs of all the schools in the authority, and reflecting Government priorities. This process increases the amount and quality of local decision making and reduces the bureaucratic burden of bid based and hypothecated funding.

<P>

<a name="20711w24.html_para3">While we wish to see the backlog of repairs eliminated, and provided &#163;1.3 billion of New Deal for Schools capital grant funded from the windfall tax from 1998 until 2001 directly to address the most urgent needs, we also wish to move away from the patch and mend approach of the past to a strategic modernisation of our schools. Subsequent capital funding, such as the &#163;6.5 billion being made available over the two years to 2003&#150;04, is intended both to address repair needs and to take forward the modernisation of schools for the teaching and learning needs of the 21st century. Progress on each of these objectives will depend on the balance of local priorities in each local authority between repairs and modernisation needs.
<P>

<a name="20711w24.html_para4">To reduce the bureaucratic burden, the Department does not require detailed information on how formulaic capital funding is invested. We do, however, have more detailed information on how capital funding is used from bid based programmes, including the New Deal for Schools from the windfall tax, the Private Finance Initiative and the Targeted Capital Fund, as well as investment in schools in the voluntary aided sector. Asset Management Plan returns provide periodic information on needs and, from this year, also on major capital projects in each authority. We have recently conducted a sample survey of the use of major formulaic programmes, and are considering how this information could be extended with minimum bureaucracy to provide evidence from which a national picture can be extrapolated.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20711w25.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Adult education tutors are employed by the local authority, college or provider for whom they work. Their age of retirement is therefore a matter agreed between themselves and the employer. This means that the local authority, college or provider is able to retain tutors beyond the customary retirement age if there is a particular need or a shortage of expertise in a given area.

 In setting the remit for the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), the Government stressed that qualifications are very important and accreditation will continue to be appropriate for many courses. But we also want to see the LSC provide a wide range of opportunities including learning not leading to awards. The Government are increasing funding for adult education secured through local education authorities and now funded through the LSC. Nationally the budget is &#163;167 million in 2002&#150;03, an increase of 9 per cent. on the previous year.

<a name="20711w25.html_para1">The Government have simplified the operation of the Standards Fund, by far the largest specific grant for education. Since April 2001, schools have had more freedom to move funds between the different Standards Fund activities; separate auditing of the Standards Fund is no longer required; and the spending period for the Standards Fund was extended from 12 months to 17 months to give schools even more flexibility in planning expenditure.

At Key Stage 3, the Government strongly encourage secondary schools to offer pupils the opportunity to study food technology, and 90 per cent. do so. Food, nutrition and healthy eating are also taught within science and personal, social and health education.

The figures for 2000&#150;01 and 1999&#150;2000 include the balances held by former grant-maintained schools, which amounted in total to approximately &#163;108 million and &#163;92 million respectively.

 My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills set out our plans to transform the school work force in her speech of last November to the Social Market Foundation. These plans directly address the key issues that we know teachers are most concerned about&#151;work load, bureaucracy, professional development and status. 30 Pathfinder schools are testing different approaches for making improvements, and we will use the lessons learned to help the whole school work force nationwide. The number of teachers in our schools has already increased by more than 20,000 since 1997, and the number of support staff by more than 70,000.

<P><I>11 Jul 2002 : Column 1177W</I><P>
16,528 technicians and some 43,809 other staff. Plans for increasing this number will depend upon the spending review and decisions taken locally by schools.

 Freeing teachers to concentrate on the core of their job and improving the status of the teaching profession more generally are central to our school work force reform agenda. The package of recommendations on work load made in a recent report by the School Teachers' Review Body reflects many of the issues raised by teachers themselves. A consultation on the principles contained in the report concluded on 3 July. The Government will issue a formal response to the report later this year.

 In making its recommendations to encourage greater take up of Modern Apprenticeships, Sir John Cassels' Modern Apprenticeship Advisory Committee proposed the establishment of pre- employment provision for those young people not immediately able to enter a Modern Apprenticeship or other employment. The Learning and Skills Council and the Department have been working together over recent months with other relevant interests to develop a more effective set of arrangements in work-based learning that will enable more young people to progress to higher learning opportunities. To this end a pathfinder Entry to Employment programme will be introduced in the following areas from this August:

 The Government's general policy on insurance, set out in Government Accounting, Chapter 30, notes that Government only needs to purchase insurance to protect the viability of its business, where the value of claims met would exceed the cost of insurance premiums. Commercial insurance of a building is acceptable in cases where <i>(a)</i> insurance is a condition of a lease; <i>(b)</i> the lessor will not accept a Government indemnity; <i>(c)</i> incurring the total cost of the accommodation in question, including the cost of the insurance, is more cost-effective than other accommodation options.

 On 30 June the US vetoed the UNSC resolution renewing the UNMIBH/SFOR mandate for Bosnia. An extension was agreed until 3 July to allow more time to seek a solution. It did not prove possible by this deadline to find a solution acceptable to Security Council Members. The Council therefore decided to extend the mandate until 15 July, to allow for further efforts to resolve the issue.

 <i>[holding answer 12 June 2002]:</i> Between May 2000 and May 2002 the Inspectorate inspected 37 of the 42 CPS areas. Gloucestershire was also the subject of a short follow-up inspection.

This process provides areas with information showing particular trends and a means by which improvements can be made.
<P>

<a name="20711w29.html_para4">The Crown Prosecution Service produces quarterly summaries of unsuccessful case outcomes from information drawn from its various case tracking systems. This year the CPS and the police have begun to develop a joint case outcome analysis which builds on these two processes and will focus on avoidable case failure. Under this system, the reasons for judge ordered and judge directed acquittals in individual cases will be jointly assessed for individual training needs and other joint strategies for performance improvement.

Over the same period judge ordered acquittals rose from 9,616 to 11,825, an increase of 23 per cent. Much of this increase can be attributed to recent changes in procedures. Since January 2001, the prosecution, unlike before, have been able to discontinue cases in the Crown Court. Although this is a prosecution decision, the current system records these as judge ordered acquittals.

 No. The draft Communications Bill extends obligations for the provision of subtitling, sign language and audio-description services from terrestrial broadcasters to all licensed broadcasters. It is not proposed to extend them to other media unless such media were brought into the licensing regime by order, having met the criteria set out in the Bill for licensable television services. Under the Bill as drafted, true video on demand would not be licensable and, therefore, would not have legal obligations for subtitling any more than on-demand services provided over the internet. It would be for those who provide such services to decide whether to offer ancillary services for viewers with disabilities.

 I am aware of the extent to which the British Darts Organisation is reliant on tobacco sponsorship and of the difficulties it faces in finding replacement sponsorship. I can assure my hon.

<P>

<a name="20711w29.html_para10">My Department has maintained a constant dialogue with the British Darts Organisation, partly through the Tobacco Sponsorship Task Force, and I fully understand its concern about the impact of a ban on British darts. As it remains the Government's intention, subject to consultation, to end tobacco sponsorship for non-global sports by the end of July 2003, it is vital that the British Darts Organisation continue its efforts to find replacement sponsorship.

 The Sponsorship Tobacco Task Force last met in October 1999. Following that meeting it was agreed that the task force had completed its initial work of identifying the needs of sports affected by the ban on tobacco sponsorship. At that time these sports believed that it was too soon to be looking to replace existing contracts, and that the situation should be reviewed before the expiry of current contracts.
<P>

<a name="20711w29.html_para12">Following the introduction of the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Bill, and the proposed consultation on draft regulations, I wrote to the seven sports represented on the Tobacco Task Force on 14 April to ask for their thoughts on whether this might be an appropriate time for it to resume its work. So far, I have only received a response from the British Darts Organisation. Should the other six members respond favourably, the Government would be happy to reconvene the Tobacco Sponsorship Task Force.

 Our long standing approach to Afghan asylum applications has been that we would not, other than in exceptional circumstances, normally seek to return to Afghanistan asylum seekers whose applications have been found not to meet the criteria set down in the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention. In those circumstances we would normally grant the unsuccessful asylum applicant four years exceptional leave to remain (ELR) in the United Kingdom. We modified that policy in April this year so as to grant only 12 months ELR to reflect the improving situation in Afghanistan.

If the circumstances of an individual case justify it, exceptional leave to remain will be granted but, for the reasons stated above, I have decided that a blanket policy of granting exceptional leave to remain in all such cases is no longer justified. In cases where asylum has been refused, and exceptional leave has not been granted, we will take the appropriate enforcement action.

The payments would help returnees to re-establish themselves in Afghanistan. The payments would be closely administered and time limited: it is essential that they not act as a pull-factor to the United Kingdom, nor their provision abused. We will also be looking into what other support may be needed in order to ensure the sustainability of returns.

<a name="20711w32.html_para0">These figures show the arising amount and cost of litigation over the last five years. Around 2,500 cases were opened in the financial year 1997&#150;8; over 3,500 have been opened to date in this financial year. The cost has arisen from roughly &#163;7.5 million to &#163;9.7 million. Prison Service litigation represents about a third of the total number of cases; while immigration judicial review covers about 90 per cent. of the judicial review cases which themselves form about two thirds of all the litigation.
<P>

<a name="20711w32.html_para1">While the rise in the number and cost of judicial review and personal injury cases has been about 50 per cent. over the past five years, in the employment field the cases have doubled and the costs have all but trebled.

<P>
<a name="20711w32.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 I welcome this report, which is today being placed in the Library together with our response to the five findings and 20 recommendations made in the report. The Prison Service has previously accepted partial liability for the death of Paul Wright because failure to provide proper medical treatment was a contributory factor to his death, and in October 2000 apologised to the family, followed by an out-of-court settlement in December 2000. This independent investigation provides a very thorough review of the circumstances surrounding the death of Paul Wright and associated issues. Two of the findings reflect conflicts of evidence that are unlikely ever to be resolved.
<P>

<a name="20711w32.html_para2">This was a unique investigation in circumstances unlikely to be repeated, largely because of changes made since 1996, including: provision of health care services in prison has been changed through a partnership between the Prison Service and the NHS at local, regional and national level; procedures for recruitment and supervision of prison medical officers have been improved, with training and qualification requirements tightened; and all self-inflicted deaths in prisons are now routinely investigated and investigation reports disclosed to families. In addition, a clinical review of the treatment provided to a prisoner dying in custody from natural causes routinely now takes place. Procedures for investigating all deaths in prison custody are currently under review. In parallel, a wider Home Office and Government review of investigations and inquiries is taking place against a background of emerging jurisprudence from both the domestic and European Courts. This investigation has provided some valuable insights which will help inform this debate, specifically in relation to the introduction of independence in future investigations.
<P>

<a name="20711w32.html_para3">I hope that the changes which have been made show that we are trying to learn from what's happened as a result of our failure to look after Paul Wright in the way that we should have done.

 We fully recognise the importance to recruitment and retention of good quality, affordable accommodation being available for nurses and other health workers, and this is why we set out a target of providing 2,000 additional units by July 2003 in the NHS Plan.
<P>

<a name="20711w33.html_para4">We have established the national health service housing initiative and, since the launch of the NHS Plan, 1,273 additional units of accommodation have been sourced through negotiation with registered social landlords and other providers.

However, as I indicated to the hon. Member in my reply on 30 October 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 648W, the Working Minds programme works in partnership with employers to create positive shifts in workplace attitudes and behaviour surrounding mental health. Its objectives are far greater than helping people with mental health problems to find employment; the programme seeks to bring about a fundamental, long-term change in employers' policy and practice so that people with mental health problems are able to participate fully in the workplace.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the reasons are for variations in the use made of guardianship under section 7 of the Mental Health Act 1983.  [68143]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20711w35.html_spnew14"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The purpose of guardianship, under the Mental Health Act 1983, is to enable patients to receive community care where it cannot be provided without the use of compulsory powers. Local social services authorities have the responsibility for applying guardianship orders and we know that there is variation in their use. We believe that the reasons for this may include a lack of awareness and understanding of the provisions, and a lack of powers to compel compliance with a guardianship order.
<P>

<a name="20711w35.html_para13">The draft Mental Health Bill which was published on 25 June 2002 addresses these problems by introducing a legal framework that will enable patients on orders, under the Mental Health Act, to be based in the community. These will supersede guardianship orders and will provide a clearer statutory basis for protecting patients in the community.

 Local implementation teams (LIT) have a planning function and also report back on progress with implementation of the mental health national framework service and NHS Plan.

<a name="20711w35.html_para15">This is a complicated area, and the Department needs to develop a way of assessing the use of out of area treatments that does not overburden the service with additional data collection, instead trying to use the systems already in place like the hospital episode statistics. This will take time, and in the meantime we are focusing attention on the development of crisis resolution services that will help avoid unnecessary out of area treatments.

 Increasing participation in physical recreation has an important role to play in raising the rates of physical activity and improving public health. The national service framework for coronary heart disease requires the National Health Service to develop local programmes of effective policies on increasing physical activity. We welcome the findings of the Central Council of Physical Recreation report which documents the progress being made by primary care trusts towards this milestone. We are currently developing a primary care handbook which will provide guidance on delivering the national service frameworks, including advice on developing local prevention strategies and effective approaches to increasing physical activity.

 The Government is confident that the National Health Service bursary scheme continues to provide satisfactory support for the great majority of students. At the same time we recognise that there are undoubtedly individual cases of hardship, and work is continuing to ensure we address any specific weaknesses in the support arrangements.
<P>

<a name="20711w36.html_para1">The Government is increasing the financial support provided for all health professional students through the NHS bursary scheme (including trainee nurses and midwives), both in terms of the basic bursary and other elements of the package. This will help ensure that as few a students as possible experience financial difficulties during their training.

 The Department has made no recent assessment of the use of cognitive behaviour therapy. However, cognitive behaviour therapy is recognised as an effective treatment for a range of mental health problems and information relating to this treatment can be found in the national service framework for mental health (www.doh.gov.uk/mentalhealth). The Department has also published a guideline 'Treatment Choice in Psychological Therapies and Counselling' and a booklet for service users that contain information about cognitive behaviour therapy and the common mental disorders for which its use is indicated.

 As a non-ministerial Government Department the system for measuring the performance of the Food Standards Agency (FSA) is the same as for other Government Departments. The FSA independently prepares its own submissions as part of Her Majesty's Treasury's (HMT) Spending Review although these are submitted to the HMT through my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health. HMT approve the funding of the FSA on the basis of their submission and also agree a service delivery agreement setting out the main aims and targets to be achieved over the Spending Review period.

<P>
<a name="20711w37.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Lammy </B> 
 <i>[holding answers 4 July 2002]:</i> The European Commission published proposals for wide-ranging amendments to the regulatory regime for human and veterinary medicines in December 2001. Among the proposed changes were the mandatory use of the centralised system for the authorisation of human medicines containing a New Active Substance (NAS) and a new definition of a medicinal product.
<P>

<a name="20711w37.html_para1">The UK, together with a number of other member states, has strongly opposed the mandatory use of the Centralised Procedure in negotiations. We do not see any scientific justification for this proposal, as it is the regulatory bodies in the member states who possess the expertise to carry out the scientific work. Nor do we believe that the proposal will improve the competitiveness of the pharmaceutical industry, as it reduces business flexibility.
<P>

<a name="20711w37.html_para2">The UK has promoted this view in the Council of Ministers and in the European Parliament and we have the support of a number of other member states. Final decisions have not been taken in either institution and the UK will continue to argue its case strongly in the meantime.




<P>
<P><I>11 Jul 2002 : Column 1220W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20711w37.html_para3">The Government agrees that there is a need to ensure that definition of a medicine is drafted in such a way that will allow new therapies to be appropriately regulated. However, the UK view is that the extension of the scope of the medicines legislation, particularly when linked to the new definition, is unwarranted and unacceptable, as it would capture many products already covered by other sectoral legislation. The Government sees no justification for this proposal and will continue to resist it. This position is shared by most other member states.

 <i>[holding answer 5 July 2002]:</i> I am advised by Ashford & St. Peter's Hospitals National Health Service Trust that the current funded establishment of midwives is 103 whole-time equivalents (WTE). There are currently 75 WTE staff in permanent positions. Therefore an additional 28 WTE staff are required to achieve full establishment.

<a name="20711w37.html_para5">However, in addition to the current permanent WTE staff of 75, the Trust has informed me that it also has a dedicated team of midwives temporarily employed to cover the shortfall, under the new NHS Professionals initiative. This results in an overall vacancy rate of 14 per cent. at the current time.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what the required reduction in expenditure arising from the merger of the Ashford Hospital NHS Trust and the St. Peter's Hospital NHS Trust was <i>(a)</i> in the year the merger took place and <i>(b)</i> in each subsequent year;  [67464]

 <i>[holding answer 5 July 2002]:</i> In 1998&#150;99, the year the hospitals merged, West Surrey Health Authority required strategic change savings of &#163;300,000. As a result of the merger, the Ashford & St. Peter's Hospitals NHS Trust actually saved &#163;1.4 million in management costs (&#163;1.2 million in 1998&#150;99 and &#163;0.2 million in 1999&#150;2000) and &#163;0.6 million in support service costs. The benefits of the savings have been ongoing in subsequent years. The savings made met the strategic change target and helped fund cost pressures at the Trust.

 <i>[holding answer 8 July 2002]:</i> There are no plans to restrict the use of the traditional or typical anti-psychotic drugs to a named patient basis. The recently published guidance from the national institute for clinical excellence stated that oral atypical anti-psychotic drugs should be considered in the choice of first-line treatments for individuals with newly diagnosed schizophrenia and where there are unacceptable side effects with the typical anti-psychotics in people with a more long-established schizophrenic illness.

 <i>[holding answer 8 July 2002]:</i> There is a continuing dialogue, facilitated by the Department, between the health professions council (HPC), those bodies representing the currently unregulated chiropody sector and those representing the regulated sector. The arrangements for grandparenting (the assimilation of unregulated practitioners to regulated status) will not be finalised until after the HPC have completed and analysed the results of their public consultation. This is likely to be April 2003.
