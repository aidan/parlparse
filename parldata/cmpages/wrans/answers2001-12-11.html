<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w01.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The National Service Framework for Older People, launched in March this year, drew on available evidence, and existing research on the causes and treatment of dementia was comprehensively assessed. A research strategy for older people is being drawn up as a result of the National Service Framework and mental health services for older people will be a high priority in shaping it.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the state of the private care home sector.  [19667]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w01.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 On 9 October, we announced an extra &#163;300 million investment over this year and next year for local councils to spend on community care services. This major cash investment will be used to reduce bed blocking and will help to stabilise the care home sector, giving them greater confidence in the future.
<P>

<a name="11211w01.html_para0">We also launched a new agreement, 'Building Capacity and Partnership in Care', on 9 October. The agreement focuses on councils and the independent sector working together as partners throughout the commissioning process. This should promote a more strategic, inclusive and consistent approach to capacity planning at local level.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Between July to September this year 91.3 per cent. of all urgent general practitioner referrals for suspected cancer were seen within two weeks. Over the period January to September 2001 over 233,500 people urgently referred with suspected cancer were seen by a specialist within two weeks.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w01.html_spnew5"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Children's hospices have access to national health service funding, the level of which may increase by agreement with health authorities and primary care trusts following assessment of local options available to support children with life threatening illnesses, and their families. The New Opportunities Fund will also be available from next year and has a budget of &#163;48 million to support projects for children with life threatening illness.

 I announced on 15 October that the Diabetes National Service Framework standards would be published this year and the delivery strategy in summer 2002. This will enable the national health service to prepare to plan for the 10-year implementation programme which will start in April 2003.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what recommendations his Department makes to general practitioners regarding the amount of time that should be made available for consultation per patient; and if he will make a statement.  [19673]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Patients' needs vary from one to another and it is best left to the clinical judgment of each general practitioner to decide how long to spend on a consultation. Accordingly, the Department has issued no guidance on this.

<a name="11211w01.html_sbhd6"><H4><center>NHS Expenditure</center></H4>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health to what extent NHS spending has been <i>(a)</i> over and <i>(b)</i> under planned levels in the (i) financial year 2000&#150;01 and (ii) first half of this financial year.  [19675]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The resource underspend for the Department of Health (which includes national health service spending) in 2000&#150;01 was &#163;712 million. The Department plans to spend all resources in the current

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of progress with respect to the <i>(a)</i> prevention of falls and <i>(b)</i> treatment of older people who suffer injury through falls.  [19676]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w01.html_spnew9"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The National Service Framework for Older People recognises the importance of preventing falls and providing effective treatment and rehabilitation to those who have fallen. It sets a standard and milestones for the introduction of integrated falls services. No formal assessment has yet been undertaken of progress towards the NSF falls milestones which are set annually from April 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 For national health service trusts who were awarded no stars, action plans are being drawn up and implemented. These will improve the areas of significant under-performance and bring them up to the standard the public and patients have the right to expect.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department is represented on an ad hoc Committee set up by the World Health Organisation to review scientific and technical aspects relating to smallpox. A report of this work is due to be considered by the World Health Assembly in May 2002.
<P>

<a name="11211w01.html_para1">These matters are kept under continuous review.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the projected deficit of Barnsley area health authority for 2001&#150;02.  [19679]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w01.html_spnew12"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 For 2001&#150;02, Barnsley health authority submitted a balanced financial plan, but with only limited contingency funding set aside to address in year pressures. As at the end of October 2001, against their allocation of &#163;198 million, Barnsley HA is forecasting a deficit of &#163;2 million (or 1 per cent.). This is attributable to higher than expected community prescribing costs. In response to the current position, the health community is collectively working on a recovery plan to ensure delivery of a balanced financial position in 2001&#150;02 without adversely affecting the delivery of agreed service targets.

 From 1 April 2002, local HIV prevention will be commissioned by Primary Care Trusts. In addition, the Department of Health will continue to fund national HIV prevention work. Both national and local work will be undertaken in accordance with the priorities set out in the National Strategy for Sexual Health and HIV. Implementation of the Strategy will be underpinned by robust performance management, for example using information collected under the AIDS (Control) Act 1987.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w02.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 We are investing an additional &#163;300 million over this year and the next as part of a radical 'cash for change' programme. This is aimed at reducing delayed discharges and targeted on the worst performing areas. This investment and reform will help to free up beds in hospitals, reduce waiting times for treatment and ensure patients, particularly older people, are cared for in the most appropriate place.
<P>

<a name="11211w02.html_para0">Redbridge council has received &#163;369,000 from the &#163;100 million announced on 9 October to fund reductions in delayed discharges in 2001&#150;02.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w02.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Government are aware that delayed discharges remains a particular problem in East Sussex. A Performance Improvement Plan was developed by East Sussex, Brighton and Hove health authority and the East Sussex and Hove social services departments to address the issue. The number of delayed discharges has been falling steadily since September 2001.
<P>

<a name="11211w02.html_para1">Delayed discharges is a problem common to many parts of the country. To address this the Secretary of State, on 9 October, announced an additional &#163;300 million over this year and next to tackle delayed discharges. East Sussex county council was recognised as a local authority in need of extra help and was allocated &#163;1,255,000 this year from that money.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w02.html_spnew8"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Earlier this year we held a public consultation about the arrangements governing eligibility for impotence treatments on the national health service. Expenditure on impotence treatments, at &#163;25 million a year, is above what we expected and continues to increase. We concluded that the extra cost of allowing unrestricted prescribing might involve diversion of funds from other NHS priorities. Therefore we decided to maintain the restrictions introduced on 1 July 1999. To maintain a consistent approach the new drug treatment, Uprima, has been subject to the same restrictions since 1 November 2001.

<P>
<a name="11211w05.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We have not made any specific assessments of the impact the bushmeat trade per se has had on the environment in West and Central Africa. However, we are conscious that the unsustainable escalation in the commercial bushmeat trade is a growing problem that is in large part a result of poverty and is facilitated by the expansion of the forestry and mining industries into natural forest areas.
<P>

<a name="11211w05.html_para1">We are aware of the dangers posed to eco-systems by the unregulated expansion of these industries in west and central africa and are concerned to ensure that the long-term interests of poor people in sustainable natural resource management are addressed. DFID is currently working closely with DEFRA and other international, National and Civil Society bodies to address this issue. To this end we are involved in various initiatives that contribute to the conservation of wild animals and their habitats (see Annex 1).

 The United Nations Population Fund's (UNFPA) programme in China is one of the most scrutinised of their global portfolio. UNFPA Executive Board members including the United Kingdom, United States, European Union and developing countries, have reviewed the programme with the UNFPA representatives in Beijing and visited programme counties on five occasions since December 1997. My Department, including the DFID Health Adviser in Beijing, closely monitors the development of the programme.
<P>

<a name="11211w05.html_para2">My Department also receives periodic reports from the International Planned Parenthood Federation on its work to promote awareness and implementation of international standards in reproductive health and greater respect for reproductive rights through its affiliate the China Family Planning Association (CFPA). The work of the CFPA was the subject of an independent review in 1996 led by Professor John Hobcraft of the London School of Economics who concluded that the IPPF was playing an effective and valuable role in influencing the work of the CFPA.

 Tackling the poverty and ignorance which feed extremism and violence is vital to ending global terrorism. It has never been more evident that ending world poverty is in all of our self-interests. The 1997 and 2000 White Papers on international development set our policies for eliminating poverty and making globalisation work for the world's poor. The need to tackle terrorism provides additional impetus to my Department's efforts to implement these policies.

 In Sierra Leone, my Department is engaged primarily in promoting security and good governance. We are providing long-term support to the police, strengthening the Ministry of Defence to ensure the armed forces are more democratically accountable, and helping reintegrate ex-combatants wishing to return to civilian life. We are supporting the Anti-Corruption Commission, helping to reform the judiciary, training the media, assisting the Government to prepare for elections next year, and providing budgetary support to help meet the running costs of government. We also provide substantial support to meet the ongoing humanitarian needs of those displaced by the conflict.

<a name="11211w07.html_para0">In his October 1997 statement to the House, the Chancellor of the Exchequer set out five economic tests which will define whether a clear and unambiguous case for UK membership of the single currency can be made. An assessment of the five economic tests will be produced within two years of the start of this Parliament. The assessment will be comprehensive and rigorous; all relevant economic issues will be dealt with as part of the assessment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w07.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 A full file of evidence was submitted on 12 October 2001 and additional information is still being submitted.
<P>

<a name="11211w07.html_para1">Since 31 May 2000, the police have been submitting information and requests for advice to the Crown Prosecution Service. The CPS has been advising the police on an ongoing basis. This advice has covered matters of admissibility and the sufficiency of evidence upon a number of discrete criminal allegations.
<P>

<a name="11211w07.html_para2">The Crown Prosecution Service has not delayed and has dealt with this case expeditiously. This police investigation has encompassed a number of separate criminal allegations and has resulted in the submission of a large volume of evidence. In the light of the complexity and sensitivity of the issues raised advice has been obtained from Senior Treasury Counsel. The review of the large volume of evidence and proper consideration of all the issues involved has necessarily required adequate time to complete.
<P>

<a name="11211w07.html_para3">The Crown Prosecution Service works very closely with the police but makes decisions about cases through careful, independent and impartial consideration of all the evidence and application of the Code for Crown Prosecutors, which states that a prosecution will only be brought if there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction and a prosecution is required in the public interest. The decision to start a prosecution is taken independently of the police and in this particular case will have the benefit of advice of independent Counsel.

them stopped; and if he will list their names, giving in each case the details of the charges that are being dropped and the known paramilitary affiliations.  [12932]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w07.html_spnew2"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Decisions on ending prosecutions are a matter for the independent prosecuting authorities based on a strict application of evidential and public interest tests. Separately, in relation to terrorist prisoners on the run, the Government announced in September 2000 that they were dropping extraditions against those who would have had little or no time left to serve if they returned to Northern Ireland. This has no bearing on cases where there remains an outstanding need to prosecute but relates specifically to cases where the individual concerned has escaped from custody before the completion of their sentence. The Government have dealt with these individuals in a way that is consistent with the Sentences Act 1998, which provides for the accelerated release of prisoners. For the most part this has meant allowing the individuals back into the jurisdiction in order to allow them to make an application for early release to the Sentence Review Commissioners. In a handful of cases, individuals had served the same or longer periods in custody than those already released under the Sentences Act but fell outside the strict application of that legislation, either because time in custody had been served outside Northern Ireland or because their offences had not been scheduled at the time they were committed. In these cases the Secretary of State uses his powers under the Northern Ireland Prison Act 1953 to release life sentence prisoners on licence or to recommend use of the Royal Prerogative of Mercy to remit outstanding portions of determinate sentences.
<P>

<a name="11211w07.html_para4">To date these arrangements have been made in 19 cases. This arrangements does not represent an amnesty. The actions taken by the Government involve decisions on whether these individuals should be allowed to return to Northern Ireland without serving further time in custody because they have met the principles of the early release scheme.

<a name="11211w07.html_para5">Following the proposal made at the Weston Park talks, the Government have agreed to such steps as are necessary as soon as possible, and in any event by March 2002, to resolve the issue about supporters of organisations now on cease-fire against whom there are outstanding prosecutions, and in some cases extradition proceedings, for offences committed before 10 April 1998, who would, if convicted, stand to benefit from the early release scheme. We are currently considering the options for delivering this.

<a name="11211w07.html_para6">In the Regulatory Impact Assessment published with the Outworking Bill we assessed there could be up to one million victims of all the 300 schemes that are estimated to exist at any one time. The initial outlay by the victim is typically between &#163;10 and &#163;60, with some schemes eliciting supplementary payments. These schemes tend to attract vulnerable and low paid people.
<P>

<a name="11211w07.html_para7">Due to the difficulty of monitoring the scam operatives' activities it is difficult accurately to gauge the size of the problem in financial terms.
<P>

<a name="11211w07.html_para8">When the Outworking Bill was introduced we supported it as a way of further clamping down on homeworking scams although we recognised there was some scope to tackle these under existing legislation such as the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 and the Control of Misleading Advertisements Regulations 1988 (CMARS). Since then we have strengthened the powers of Trading Standards officers by introducing Stop Now Orders. These enable trading standards authorities and the Office of Fair Trading to seek an injunction against anyone who is in breach of consumer protection legislation in a number of relevant areas, in particular misleading advertising. We plan to strengthen consumer protection by extending the injunctive regime through the Enterprise Bill. The Stop Now regime will cover all consumer protection legislation, and include Trading Standards as well as the OFT as enforcement bodies. This will further strengthen the ability of Trading Standards to shut down scams including homeworking scams.

 I met with my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, Central (Mr. Doran) on 19 November and with my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith on 21 November. From these meetings, and those which the Scottish Executive Minister held at the same time, we were clear about the difficulties facing Atlantic's business customers in particular.
<P>

<a name="11211w09.html_para0">I then had discussions with the Director General of Telecommunications on 20 November expressing my resolve that everything possible should be done to smooth the transfer of customers from Atlantic to other operators. I then met the Chief Executive of BT, Sir Peter Bonfield, and the Group Commercial Director, Colin Green, on 22 November where I sought BT's assistance to ensure that they would expedite the connection of ex-Atlantic customers. BT assured me it would do all it could to help facilitate a quick transfer of customers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Following the consultation process last year, I am persuaded that a number of miners dismissed in connection with the 1984&#150;85 strike, and not subsequently re-employed by British Coal, were harshly treated.

<P><I>11 Dec 2001 : Column: 760W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11211w09.html_para2">I have concluded that the most appropriate way forward would be to enhance the pensions of these miners in recognition of the years of further service they lost as a result of British Coal's decision not to re-employ them. The costs of this will be met from the residual assets of British Coal. I would emphasise that those whose offences involved serious acts of violence or intimidation or actions which jeopardised the safety of others will not qualify for this enhancement of pension.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent question on what advice the Treasury has received from the Office for National Statistics on the treatment of government loans to Railtrack while in administration in the national accounts (22065).</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Treasury did not seek advice on the national accounts treatment of these loans and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) did not provide any. Once ONS had decided on the national accounts classification of Railtrack while in administration, the classification of government loans to it is straightforward. These are classified as central government loans to the private non-financial corporations sector. This treatment has been reflected in the National Statistics public sector finances release, which is based on national accounts definitions and jointly published by ONS and the Treasury.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment has been made of the effect on risk premium which will have to be budgeted for in future partnerships with the private sector, following the events surrounding Railtrack going into administration.  [8445]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 We do not anticipate that there will be any long-term impact on the risk premium for PPPs as a result of Railtrack administration. In its report of 23 October, credit rating agency Standard and Poors said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Railtrack situation has no direct credit implications for rated PFI projects".
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="11211w09.html_para6">PPPs are fundamentally different from the regime under which Railtrack operated. Whereas PPPs involve output focused bilateral contracts which provide a clear allocation of risks, Railtrack was privatised under a broadly standard utility-style regulatory structure; although, unlike any other privatised utility, some two thirds of its revenue came from Government.

<a name="11211w09.html_para8">The costs of the Savings Gateway pilot schemes and further consultation on the Savings Gateway and Child Trust Fund will also be contained within existing spending plans. Detailed proposals of the pilot schemes remain to be decided, but based on the proposed size and scope of the pilot projects it is anticipated that the costs of operating them might be up to about &#163;1.5 million. Proposals for both the Savings Gateway and the Child Trust Fund will continue to be developed through the process of consultation, as well as being considered as part of Spending Review 2002. It will be important to get the design of these new proposals right and no fixed deadline has been set for the introduction of either initiative.

<P>
<P>

 Public Private Partnerships (PPP) cover a wide range of projects. They have been set up in most central Government Departments and local authorities, and in some public corporations. No information is held centrally on their total value.
<P>

<a name="11211w10.html_para4">In many cases the private sector owns the capital assets used in PPPs. In most of these cases the capital expenditure would not count as public sector net investment because it is private sector expenditure. The exceptions are when a PPP involves a lease of an asset by the public sector, and the accountants classify it as a finance lease. In those circumstances the capital expenditure, and the depreciation of the asset, would be part of the calculation of public sector net investment.
<P>

<a name="11211w10.html_para5">Although private sector investment does not usually count within public sector net investment, it is included as part of the total investment in our public services.

 Recent work by CBI-TUC and the Performance and Innovation Unit has underlined the importance of workforce development and skill acquisition in the UK. Their reports identify significant market failures that restrict training opportunities for lower skilled employees. To tackle these market failures and deliver a long-term improvement in workplace training the Government are considering a range of options for a new policy framework to reform the UK training system and encourage more training among people with low skills. In the PBR, the Government said they would examine an approach based on four complementary, linked elements which would require commitments by stakeholders&#151;the Government, employers and individuals. These are: financial support for employers whose staff take time off; free learning provision for employees; and entitlement to take-up training and extended guidance and support.

<P>
<a name="11211w12.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Under the Ionising Radiation Regulations 1999 a risk assessment is required before any X-ray source is used. The Defence Science Technology Laboratories Radiation Protection Service is Customs' Radiation Protection Advisor for the freight X-ray scanner project and they prepare each risk assessment. Each risk assessment is site and machine specific and includes local rules for setting up the scanner, operating practices and safety procedures. The risk assessment is kept with the scanner for production, as required, to any Health and Safety Executive Inspector or any other person.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many people entering the UK were questioned by HM Customs and Excise in each of the last five years on suspicion of alcohol smuggling; how many were carrying more alcohol than the suggested guidelines for imports for personal use; and how many of these were allowed to enter the country on the grounds that the alcohol was for personal use.

 This information is not available in the format requested.
<P>

<a name="11211w13.html_para0">Customs carefully target their anti-smuggling activity on those thought likely to be smuggling, and have no interest in legitimate cross-border shoppers. Accordingly only a very small proportion of the 90 million travellers who enter the UK each year are stopped by customs officers. Indeed, in 2000&#150;01 less than 0.2 per cent. of the estimated 14 million travellers through the channel ports had goods seized by customs. The majority of people entering the UK with goods in excess of the minimum indicative levels were able to satisfy customs that the goods were for their own personal use.

<a name="11211w13.html_wqn4"><B> Andrew George: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, pursuant to his answer of 23 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 539W, on winter fuel allowance, (1) by what factors and measures the <i>(a)</i> care and <i>(b)</i> mobility components of disability living allowance (i) were first and (ii) are calculated;  [19918]

[19919]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Disability living allowance provides a contribution towards the generality of extra costs faced by severely disabled people as a result of their disabilities. The amounts payable are not based on calculations of the costs of specific items, and recipients are free to spend the benefit according to their own priorities and requirements.




<P>
<P><I>11 Dec 2001 : Column: 775W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11211w13.html_para2">When the allowance was introduced in 1992, the highest and middle care components were set at the same weekly amounts as the higher and lower rates of attendance allowance, and the higher mobility component was set at the same weekly amount as the mobility allowance which it replaced. This was because the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys' major surveys of disabled people in Great Britain in the 1980s had found that those allowances were well directed towards the most common costly disabilities, and were more than sufficient to cover disability-related expenditure in most cases. For less severely disabled people, the lowest care component and the lower mobility component were set above the average weekly amount of disability-related expenditure found by the disability surveys. Since 1992, all components have been uprated annually in line with the movement in prices.

 The new Jobcentre Plus service pathfinder offices opened in October and will be rolled out nationally from April 2002.

 The help team initiative is a voluntary partnership between central and local government. The team only visits local authorities which request its assistance, and works with these authorities to identify ways of improving their housing benefit administration.
<P>

<a name="11211w14.html_para1">The help team's visits started on 12 March 2001 and to date the team has visited Hull during March and April; Bristol during May and June; Lambeth during July and August; Northampton during August; Derwentside during September and October; and East Ayrshire during October and November. The team spent around four to five weeks at each local authority, apart from Northampton, where the visit lasted around two weeks.
<P>

<a name="11211w14.html_para2">At the conclusion of an initial visit, arrangements can be made for the help team to remain in contact by telephone and give informal advice, or for members of the team to undertake short return visits. Such return visits have taken place at Hull, Bristol and Lambeth, and one is planned for Northampton in mid-December.

 Pensioners who already receive the minimum income guarantee (MIG) will not have to make an application. They will automatically receive pension credit. For other pensioners who become eligible for pension credit as a result of the more generous rules, we are building on lessons learned from other recent initiatives. We will ensure our communications to pensioners are closely targeted and designed to help them to understand their entitlements.

 The Government are continuing to monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the new Planning Policy Guidance Note (PPG) 25 through the high-level targets published by the then Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in November 1999. The reports for 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01 provide a baseline for the situation before PPG 25 was published. We are also looking with the Environment Agency at monitoring PPG 25 through data on planning applications and land-use change statistics. We are committed to a general review of the guidance three years after publication in the light of emerging experience of its use and of developing information on climate change.
<P>

<a name="11211w15.html_para1">Should there be substantive evidence that the guidance is not being followed, we would consider the introduction of a flooding Direction requiring local planning authorities to refer to the Secretary of State applications they are minded to permit in the face of sustained objections from the Environment Agency.

<a name="11211w16.html_para0">London Underground acknowledges that its track needs major investment. The age and quality of the track requires intensive maintenance and/or the imposition of speed restrictions to enable services to run safely. With limited resources for investment, London Underground has had to prioritise the level of track renewals to ensure that the overall conditions do not deteriorate further. However, once London Underground's tube modernisation plans are in place, the investment backlog will be tackled and the standard and condition of the track will be improved significantly.

<a name="11211w16.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The information is currently not available. In particular, the rate of increase of actual registered social landlord and local authority rents over the next 10 years will depend, among other things, on the outcome of future Spending Reviews (for local authority rents) and periodic reviews by the Housing Corporation (for registered social landlord rents). Moreover, individual landlords retain responsibility for rent-setting.

Two recent research studies were commissioned by the Department to assess Eurostar's passenger number and revenue forecasts and Freightliner's application for Track Access Grant. The Department has had regard to advice from the Strategic Rail Authority which receives monthly financial reports from train operating companies and monitors the financial position of their parent companies on a regular basis.

 My Department's major effort in the area of raising the awareness of road safety is the "Think!" publicity campaign. My Department launched this campaign in June 2000, with the aim of encouraging 



<P>
<P><I>11 Dec 2001 : Column: 790W</I><P>
all road users to think about their own and others' safety. The generic "Think!" message enables us to link the promotion of a range of specific road safety messages that can help to make our roads safer for all. The campaign also links the promotion of road safety messages by a range of supporters in the public, private and voluntary sectors. The long-term campaign is a key commitment in the 10 year strategy, launched by the Prime Minister in March 2000, for reducing road deaths and serious injuries by 40 per cent. (and 50 per cent. for children) by the year 2010.
<P>

<a name="11211w17.html_para0">In the campaign to date we have given priority to addressing those behaviours that are most likely to put road users at risk, eg driving too fast, driving after drinking, driving while tired, passenger seat belt wearing, unsafe child pedestrian behaviour. Over the coming year we shall continue to address safety in these areas, particularly the safety of children. But in addition we shall be preparing a major effort to address the growing number of powered two wheeler casualties (almost one in six of the deaths on our roads last year were riders of these vehicles). The outline programme of forward activity is available on the "Think!" website at www.think.dtlr.gov.uk.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (1) what was the average cost associated with <i>(a)</i> job losses, <i>(b)</i> removal costs, <i>(c)</i> informing the resident population of the change, <i>(d)</i> changes to records, <i>(e)</i> administration costs and <i>(f)</i> election costs incurred by the establishment of the new unitary authorities in 1996;  [21634]
<P>
<UL>(2) what responsibility <i>(a)</i> local and <i>(b)</i> central Government have for the costs associated with changes in (i) finance structure and (ii) administration structure when setting up a new unitary authority.  [21635]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w17.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 These costs were met by the local authorities concerned and this information is not held centrally. The Government expected local authorities being reorganised to take the opportunity to cut costs and improve efficiency. So supplementary credit approvals (SCAs) were given for authorities to borrow money to meet the one-off indirect costs of reorganisation until the savings and receipts arising from the process were realised. The SCAs provide a rough proxy for the transitional cost of reorganisation, though they do not necessarily capture all local authorities' expenditure. The total for the 1995&#150;96 authorities was &#163;143.8 million.

 The Government do not collect any local authority trading information centrally.
<P>

<a name="11211w17.html_para4">However, we recently commissioned research for the Byatt Review of Local Government procurement which showed that 42 per cent. of authorities overall have joint contract arrangements with other authorities, that is 98 authorities. 17 of the 30 unitary authorities responding to this question have joint arrangements with other local authorities. Many of these joint arrangements are facilitated through buying consortia.
<P>

<a name="11211w17.html_para5">We believe that a truly mixed economy of service provision is the best way to ensure genuine innovation and true competition. We want to see partnerships that are public-public, public-voluntary and public-private. This could involve the best in-house providers using their expertise in wider markets within the public service.

 A table has been placed in the Libraries of the House comparing the standard spending assessments (SSAs) and revenue support grant (RSG) allocations for 2002&#150;03, as announced for consultation on 4 December, with what they would be if based on the area cost adjustment (ACA) for 2001&#150;02. This shows the effect of updating the data underpinning the area cost adjustment from the New Earnings Survey for 1999 (on which the 2001&#150;02 ACA is based) to the New Earnings Survey for 2000 (on which the 2002&#150;03 ACA is based). The figures also include the effect of updating the rates cost element of the ACA, but this element only makes up a very small proportion of the overall adjustment. The RSG figures are before the application of floors and ceilings.

 The Government are broadly aware of concerns expressed in relation to the possible contamination of aircraft cabin air by organophosphates, but have not reviewed the contents of any websites. The Civil Aviation Authority, which has responsibility for investigating incidents involving fumes in aircraft cabins, is currently working with aircraft and engine manufacturers to identify and analyse potential aircraft cabin pollutants and to minimise the potential for engine oil leaks. A considerable amount of cabin air quality research at a European level is either under way or about to start. The Government are monitoring these developments closely and are prepared to commission specific work on organophosphates if this proves necessary.

 The responsibility for setting criteria for the distribution of nursery education places at a local level rests with the Local Education Authority in conjunction with the Early Years Development and Childcare Partnership, within the strategic framework set by the Department requiring the most socially disadvantaged to be targeted first.

However, officials are setting up, as a matter of priority, arrangements to validate outstanding payments and claims for payment from learning providers so that the majority of providers, who have acted honestly throughout, can be paid as quickly as possible.

 <i>[holding answer 4 December 2001]:</i> Officials are setting up, as a matter of priority, arrangements to validate outstanding payments and claims for payment from learning providers so that the majority of providers, who have acted honestly throughout, can be paid as quickly as possible. We will pay for eligible learning that has already taken place and for learning that is already booked on the ILA Centre's system, providing we are satisfied that eligible learning is undertaken, in accordance with the rules of the programme. Learning which was not booked onto the ILA system before the programme was shut down on 23 November will not benefit from an ILA discount.

<a name="11211w22.html_spnew8"><B> John Healey </B>

The powers allow the Secretary of State to begin such a scheme, to change it or to close it down.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what is her estimate of the number of holders of individual learning accounts who had not used them by 23 November; and what arrangements are being made to enable these accounts to be used.  [20679]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w22.html_spnew9"><B> John Healey </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 December 2001]:</i> As at 17 November, there were 1,235,190 individual learning account holders who had not used their accounts.




<P>
<P><I>11 Dec 2001 : Column: 814W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11211w22.html_para5">The closure of the programme on 23 November was as a result of evidence of serious potential fraud and theft involving individual learning accounts, which are being investigated by the police. All eligible learning booked onto the system before 6.30 pm on 23 November will be honoured, subject to new validation arrangements. It will only be after we have been able to complete our validation of claims and bookings from learning providers that I shall be in a position to provide an updated figure of ILA holders who have not used their accounts.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what financial advice is being provided by her Department to firms which have suffered loss as a result of the closure of the individual learning account programme.  [20680]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w22.html_spnew10"><B> John Healey </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 December 2001]:</i> It is not expected nor appropriate for the Department to offer financial advice to any firm which has suffered a loss as a result of the closure of the individual learning account programme. Similarly, the Department did not offer financial advice to any provider at the point when they became registered with the ILA Centre.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w22.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many people were employed in the individual learning account centre on 23 November; how many are employed; and whether the closure of the programme will result in redundancies in her Department.  [20681]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w22.html_spnew11"><B> John Healey </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 December 2001]:</i> The number of staff in place at the individual learning account centre fluctuates in response to demand and to the extent to which people make use of the range of services. The ILA centre has a flexible workforce to meet these demands, with many working part-time or in a pattern of shifts. The precise number of staff is a matter for Capita Business Services Ltd. who perform this service under contract to the Department. The contract with Capita is output based and fees paid are reliant on certain key operational indicators being met.
<P>

<a name="11211w22.html_para6">I do not anticipate any redundancies within the Department relating to the closure of the ILA programme. These staff are fully occupied with residual issues resulting from the wind down of the present ILA programme, and development of a successor programme or programmes.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w22.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what compensation is being offered to holders of individual learning accounts who had intended to use them on or before 7 December 2001 but had not used them by 23 November.  [20683]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w22.html_spnew12"><B> John Healey </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 December 2001]:</i> There are no plans to offer compensation to individual learning account holders who had intended to use them on or before 7 December 2001 but had not used them by 23 November.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w22.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many letters were sent out to holders of individual learning accounts to advise them that the accounts must be used on or before 7 December; and what warning was given to the recipients of the letters that the date, 7 December, had been changed to 23 November.

 <i>[holding answer 4 December 2001]:</i> Between 29 October and 5 November every one of more than 2.5 million individual learning account holders was sent a letter about the withdrawal of the programme on 7 December. Because of the need to take immediate action it was not possible to notify account holders prior to the decision to shut down the programme on 23 November. The shutdown meant that the ILA account holders database was not available to us. However, we issued a press statement on 23 November and provided notification of the shut down on both the Department and Capita websites which we updated as new information became available. We were also able to resume the operation, on a limited basis of the ILA helpline for account holders on 27 November.

 On 26 October the Individual Learning Account Centre stopped accepting applications to open new accounts. Between 29 October and 5 November every one of more than 2.5 million Individual Learning Account holders was sent a letter about the withdrawal of the programme on 7 December. Notices were placed in nine national newspapers on 26 and 27 October and the ILA helpline advised account holders on their individual circumstances.

 Because of the need to take immediate action it was not possible to notify account holders or ILA registered learning providers prior to the decision to shut down the programme on 23 November.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will make a statement on the Government's strategy to develop out of school and holiday schemes for 11 to 14-year-old children.  [20493]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w23.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The Government have recognised that out-of-school-hours learning activities play a key role in developing young people and raising their attainment. "Extending Opportunity: a national framework for study support", published in 1998, set out our vision for providing more opportunities for older primary and secondary pupils to enrich their learning through out-of-school-hours learning activities. Since then &#163;160 million has been made available through the New Opportunities Fund, including &#163;25 million specifically for summer schools. In addition, the Department's Standards Fund has provided nearly &#163;75 million for study support programmes this year.
<P>

<a name="11211w23.html_para0">The National Childcare Strategy was established to promote childcare for children aged 0&#150;14 and for children up to age 16 with special needs. Between 1999 and 2004, &#163;225.5 million is being made available from the New Opportunities Fund to help create new out-of-school- hours child care in England, including breakfast, after school and holiday schemes. This can benefit all children in education, including 11 to 14-year-olds. Since 1997, through the New Opportunities Fund support and other Government support, nearly 275,000 new child care places have been set up for the 3 to 14 age range.

<a name="11211w23.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The latest actuarial valuation of the Astra Group Pension Scheme was by William M Mercer in April 2001. My understanding is that it showed that at the due date of valuation of 30 April 2000, had the winding-up of the scheme been completed, it would have been in deficit by &#163;10.72 million. However, the completion of the winding-up is still some time away and only when this process is complete will the extent of any deficit be known. This matter is entirely in the hands of Astra's administrators. The actuary (William M Mercer) has recommended that the next actuarial valuation be carried out with an effective date no later than 30 April 2003.

<P>
<a name="11211w23.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 December 2001]:</i> The primary source of information on the activities and attainment of young people in the years immediately after completing compulsory education is the Youth Cohort Study (YCS). A question designed to identify those with a current long-term disability or health problem as defined under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 was introduced in the 1998 YCS surveys. Questions on Special Educational Needs (SENs) were included in the most recent survey of 16-year-olds in 2000.
<P>

<a name="11211w23.html_para1">Key results from the YCS are published in Statistical First Releases (SFRs). The tables include information on attainment and participation in higher education for those with and without a long-term disability or health problem. DfES SFRs are available in the House of Commons Library and on the DfES website at http://www.dfes.gov.uk/ statistics/DB/SFR/.
<P>

<a name="11211w23.html_para2">In response to the call for more information in the 1997 Green Paper "Excellence for all children: meeting special educational needs" the Department has commissioned a longitudinal piece of research about the experiences of young people with SEN once they have left school.
<P>

<a name="11211w23.html_para3">The study looks at the experiences, achievements, and attitudes of young people with SEN during their transition from secondary education to early adult life. It aims to identify barriers to further education, training, employment and independent living.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what measures she is taking to upgrade the standards and status of vocational education.  [21813]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w24.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The White Paper "Schools: achieving success" sets out our plans to make available high quality vocational options to all students from the age of 14, which are widely recognised and offer the opportunity of entry to higher education. We have introduced vocational A levels, are reforming and extending modern apprenticeships and are introducing foundation degrees. The new GCSEs in vocational subjects to be available from September 2002 will provide a qualification of the same standard as academic GCSEs. A forthcoming consultation paper on the 14&#150;19 education phase will address how best to break down the traditional prejudice against vocational education, and to enable more students to pursue vocational options.

 The Educational Maintenance Allowance (EMA) pilots are subject to a rigorous three- year evaluation study.
<P>

<a name="11211w24.html_para0">Early findings from the evaluation show that EMA appears to have raised participation in education. The statistical analysis estimates an average gain in participation in pilot areas compared to control areas, among EMA eligible young people, of around 5 percentage points. These findings were published in March this year.
<P>

<a name="11211w24.html_para1">Although we do not yet have figures on attainment, the qualitative aspect of the evaluation has found some evidence of a positive effect on young people's commitment to study, and their performance.
<P>

<a name="11211w24.html_para2">However, although these first findings are encouraging, it is important that we do not make any decisions on the future of EMAs until we have received further evaluation evidence.

<a name="11211w24.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 We are working closely with the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) to ensure that revised systems are put in place to monitor and improve teaching quality which are not unnecessarily bureaucratic and costly. Proposals are currently out for consultation and we will look closely at the outcome of that process. In addition, we have requested that HEFCE produces, by July 2002, a strategic plan for enhancing teaching quality.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what progress has been made in the promotion of homework clubs in schools in Portsmouth; and if she will make a statement.  [22439]<P>

<P>
<a name="11211w24.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 We are committed to providing opportunities for young people to enrich their learning through out-of-school-hours activities. "Extending Opportunity: a national framework for study support", published in 1998, set out the contribution homework clubs can make to a school's wider programme of out-of-school-hours learning activities.
<P>

<a name="11211w24.html_para3">We also published Homework Guidelines, which require school homework policies to refer to any opportunities that exist for pupils to do homework, under supervision, at places other than home. In addition to school homework clubs, these may also include libraries and community centres. The homework area on the Department's Standards website supplements the guidelines with examples of good practice and case studies which teachers, governors, parents and pupils can access.
<P>

<a name="11211w24.html_para4">Within that framework, the promotion of homework clubs in specific parts of the country is a matter for individual local authorities and schools.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will list for each of the years 1997&#150;98 to 2001&#150;02 <i>(a)</i> the name of each local education authority where education SSA increases have not been passported, <i>(b)</i> the total amount of education budget and <i>(c)</i> the total amount of education SSA and the surplus order deficit over education SSA.  [22371]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w24.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Tables 1 to 3 list those local education authorities which did not passport in the years 1999&#150;2000 to 2001&#150;02, together with their total education budget, their education SSA, and the spend above or below SSA. Passporting is defined by whether an authority passed on to the education budget the year on year increase in education SSA, rather than by the relationship between budget and SSA. However, it is not possible to assess whether passporting took place simply from an analysis of budget and SSA figures, since in assessing passporting adjustments were made for items such as Capital Expenditure from the Revenue Account (CERA), one-off payments, and the ceiling on grant increases in 2001&#150;02. There were no passporting exercises in 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99.

<P>
<a name="11211w27.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 It is not possible for the Home Office to give an estimation of the impact of the Biocidal Products Directive (98/8/EC), which came into force in the United Kingdom in April 2001, on the scale and nature of animal use.
<P>

<a name="11211w27.html_para5">As a consequence of it coming into force, there will be a requirement for all biocidal products and their active substances to be authorised for use and therefore the new testing requirement may increase animal use in this area.
<P>

<a name="11211w27.html_para6">To minimise duplicate testing, Article 13 of the Directive requires authorisation holders to take all reasonable steps to share data. Furthermore, the Article also allows for member states to oblige applicants to share data, specifically to avoid unnecessary and duplicate testing on animals.
<P>

<a name="11211w27.html_para7">It continues to be our aim to reduce, refine and replace the use of animals in scientific procedures and to ensure that the benefits to humans, other animals or the environment outweigh the costs to the animals involved.

 The production of genetically modified animals (as well as their use in experiments or other scientific procedures) is controlled under the terms of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. In deciding whether to grant a licence to produce, breed or use 



<P>
<P><I>11 Dec 2001 : Column: 834W</I><P>
genetically modified animals, the 1986 Act requires, as with ordinary animals, that the likely benefits of the programme are weighed against the likely adverse effects on the animals concerned (the cost/benefit assessment) and that there are no alternatives which either replace animal use entirely, reduce the number of animals needed or refine the procedures to minimise pain and suffering (3Rs). We must also be satisfied that the procedures are likely to achieve the stated objectives.
<P>

<a name="11211w27.html_para8">Since the genetic modification of animals was first achieved, the number of genetically modified animals produced and used under the terms of the Act has increased considerably, and is likely to continue to increase. The production and use of such animals allows new areas of medical and other scientific research to be explored; provides the potential for investigating a wide variety of conditions including cancer, cystic fibrosis and multiple sclerosis; and allows the quality of the science in many areas of research and testing to be improved.
<P>

<a name="11211w27.html_para9">It is not always possible to predict the likely welfare effects of novel genetic modifications. However, project licence authorities are framed to permit only apparently healthy genetically modified animals to be produced or maintained unless, and exceptionally, a specific scientific justification is made and accepted for the production of genetically modified animals whose welfare may be compromised.
<P>

<a name="11211w27.html_para10">The vast majority (over 95 per cent) of GM animals produced and used are mice.

Unlike the Home Office, the funding of alternatives by other Government Departments is neither ring-fenced nor clearly demarcated from the funding of other areas of science.

 Project licences for particular programmes of scientific research have only been granted since 1987, when the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 came into force. Prior to this date live animal research was authorised via a personal licence system which did not set out the scientific issues in detail.

It would not be possible to obtain the requested information by other means without disproportionate effort or with any guarantee of completeness. We can only say that a growing number of GM animals are used as models within some licensed programmes, often in conjunction with other live animal models.
<P>

<a name="11211w27.html_para16">However, since 1988 annual statistics published by the Home Office have contained information on the overall use of GM animals in scientific procedures. The detail provided has increased over the years, and the latest publication entitled 'Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals Great Britain 2000' (Cm 5344) contains a great deal of related data. Table 3 of the publication provides comprehensive data on scientific procedures by species of animal, primary purpose (including breeding) and genetic status. Copies are available in the Library.

 Planning is under way involving all criminal justice partners for pilot studies to find the most cost-effective means of extending court hours. The aim is to test whether extended hours would have an impact on delays, deter local criminals, improve access to justice and help reassure local communities. The pilots are expected to start in the spring of next year and run for approximately six months. In Manchester three remand courts will start at 9 am on Monday to Friday to deal with remand cases more quickly and release more court space in the afternoon. Additional evening trial courts will be available on Tuesday and Thursday sitting from 4 pm to 8 pm at the request of victims and witnesses who would find these times more convenient. The objective for the Manchester pilot is to extend court sitting to support the key criminal justice objectives of access to justice, reducing delay and improving services to victims and witnesses.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the basis upon which the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Wallasey (Angela Eagle), made her statement of 21 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 422, on the powers of co-decision of the European Parliament on some Third Pillar measures.

 <i>[holding answer 10 December 2001]:</i> For the role of the European Parliament in relation to Third Pillar measures, I refer the hon. Member to the answer the Minister for Europe gave to the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) on 29 November 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1080W. I have, through my officials, written to the editor of <i>Hansard</i> making it clear that the applicable procedure is consultation with the European Parliament rather than co-decision. The point I made in my statement of 21 November 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 422&#151;that the European Parliament have a role in the development of Third Pillar measures&#151;is absolutely correct. The European Parliament must be consulted on all Conventions, decisions and framework decisions. It has delivered opinions on the European Arrest Warrant and on the Framework Decision on Terrorism. It will be reconsulted on the terrorism framework decision and, if the Council achieves consensus, on the European Arrest Warrant. This demonstrates that the European Parliament does in fact have oversight of Third Pillar matters.

 <i>[holding answer 10 December 2001]:</i> The prison service currently operates one prison ship, Weare, which is berthed in Portland Harbour and has been operating successfully as a medium security training establishment since 1997 accommodating 400 men over the age of 25 serving the last nine months of their sentence. There are currently no plans to increase the number of prison ships. However, the prison service is always prepared to consider a wide range of options for safely accommodating the prisoner population when it is rising including the use of floating facilities, but would prefer to give primary consideration to other alternatives which provide better long term accommodation.

 As part of the Triennial Review of Judges Lodgings, a notional comparison was made of the value for money provided by lodgings with alternative forms of accommodation providing appropriate standards of security, privacy and comfort. The review concluded that, taking account of the security requirements and extra environmental benefits offered by lodgings, they continue to provide the best balance between meeting the needs of the judges on the one hand and obtaining fair value for money on the other.
<P>

<a name="11211w29.html_para0">While the review therefore recommended that there be no change to the overall principle that lodgings continue to be the main method by which accommodation is provided, the Lord Chancellor has now decided that it will be taken forward in the context of relevant recommendations of Lord Justice Auld's report which was published on 8 October.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if she will make a statement on the savings in 2000&#150;01 resulting from the introduction of conditional fee arrangements.  [15037]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w29.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Conditional fee arrangements were introduced in 1995 and are now widely used in personal injury cases. Because of the availability of conditional fees, personal injury and some other areas of law were taken out of the scope of civil legal aid in April 2000 when the funding code for the community legal service fund was introduced.
<P>

<a name="11211w29.html_para3">We estimate that net the direct savings to legal aid in 2000&#150;01 from taking most personal injury cases out of scope were &#163;32 million. This is based on a comparison with the previous year. It is not possible to quantify separately savings in 2000&#150;01 resulting from the use of conditional fee arrangements in other types of cases which were taken out of the scope.
<P>

<a name="11211w29.html_para4">The figure of &#163;32 million understates savings to legal aid from the introduction of conditional fees. Expenditure on personal injury cases fell substantially in the years before 2000&#150;01 following the introduction of conditional fees, but our records do not enable us to cost this accurately.

 Following a statement made on 2 November 1992 by Sir George Young, the Crown authorities gave an undertaking that the Crown would, as landlord and subject to specified conditions, agree to the enfranchisement or extension of residential long leases under the same qualifications and terms which applied by virtue of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 and the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 to lessees who hold from other landlords.

As was announced by my noble and learned Friend Lord Falconer of Thoroton during the Third Reading of the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Bill, which is before this Parliament, on 19 November 2001, <i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> column 927, the Crown authorities have now confirmed that this also applies to those Acts as amended by the current Bill.

<P>
<a name="11211w30.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The valuation of animals to be compulsorily slaughtered for animal disease control purposes (eg TB and brucellosis) is an established practice, carried out on DEFRA's behalf by independent valuers. The valuation process should take into account any relevant factors which would have a bearing on the real market value of an animal which is due to be slaughtered. Eligibility for slaughter premium can be taken into account if, in the opinion of the valuer, this eligibility would have an impact on market value.




<P>
<P><I>11 Dec 2001 : Column: 845W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11211w30.html_para0">The system for valuing animals for foot and mouth disease was no different from established practice until the option of standard values was introduced on 22 March 2001. Standard values include an element in respect of slaughter premium where relevant. However, in the light of a number of queries on valuations from farmers and industry organisations, it was decided to issue central guidance to valuers which confirmed the Department's position. This was issued on 11 September, as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Department has long considered "the value" to mean the price an animal might reasonably have been expected to achieve on that day from a purchaser at an open livestock market. Any factors relating to the animal that would be taken into account had the animal been sold on the open market should thus be taken into account when assessing its value for the purposes of compensation. Such factors would include (but not be limited to) the species, its breed, age, weight, pedigree and (if appropriate) its state of pregnancy or lactation. If, for certain animals, the price obtainable at market would normally include some element for Beef Slaughter Premium, that should also be considered. If it is considered that such an element should be included, the age of the animal and the amount relating to the premium must be listed next to the animal on the valuation sheet."

<a name="11211w30.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Leeds Disease Control Centre (DCC) has, from the onset of foot and mouth disease, involved and consulted with local veterinarians and other stakeholder organisations in an effort to promote an integrated approach to eradicating the disease. The Leeds DCC appointed a highly experienced local veterinarian&#151;from the Thirsk area&#151;as Liaison Officer for the Local Veterinary Inspectors, three local farmers as National Farmers Union Liaison Officers, an industrial Liaison Officer and local authority personnel to provide additional links with local communities. Regular meetings and consultation with local stakeholders have provided opportunities for the exchange of information and expertise.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w30.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Leeds Disease Control Centre has endeavoured to maintain good relations with the Thirsk farming community, both directly and through the National Farmers Union and other organisations, since the initial outbreak in the Thirsk area on 5 July. The importance of the strict biosecurity enforcement measures in the Thirsk 'Restricted Infected Area' (RIA), introduced on 30 July, which were designed to halt the spread of the disease made the need for good communications particularly important. The improvement in the biosecurity arrangements of farmers and others while the RIA was in place, as measured by the reduction in infringements of the biosecurity requirements, suggests that key messages were communicated effectively.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what imports of Argentinean meat have entered the UK food chain in the last 12 months; if the meat is from vaccinated sources; and if it is organically produced.  [20002]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11211w31.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The table at Annexe A shows the amount of meat of foot and mouth disease susceptible species imported into the UK during the last 12 months for which statistics are available. There is no guarantee that all this meat entered the UK food chain as some meat may be re-exported.
<P>

<a name="11211w31.html_para0">The importation into the UK of fresh meat derived from foot and mouth disease susceptible animals originating in Argentina is currently prohibited. Prior to the prohibition, meat from vaccinated animals could be imported from Argentina, but had to be deboned and fully matured so as to remove any risk of the live foot and mouth disease virus being present.
<P>

<a name="11211w31.html_para1">According to an estimate in the Soil Association Organic Food and Farming report 2001 some 45 per cent. of organic meat sold in the UK is imported. It is therefore possible that some meat from organic production has been imported from Argentina. Customs import figures are not available for organic meat from Argentina because organic products are not distinguishable from conventional products in the data collected by Customs.

<P>
<a name="11211w31.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 December 2001]:</i> Some livestock markets have re-opened in Scotland reflecting the lower number of FMD cases there. A decision to re-open livestock markets in England and Wales will be made in the light of scientific and veterinary advice on progress with the eradication of foot and mouth disease. It is not possible to give a precise date but it is expected to be in the early part of 2002, provided there are no further outbreaks.
<P>

<a name="11211w31.html_para2">The Department has held a number of meetings with representatives of the Livestock Auctioneers Association to discuss the conditions required for the re-opening of markets, particularly as regards biodiversity. A number of ideas were discussed and these are now being reviewed by my Department. We will continue to consult fully with the LAA on this very important matter and hope to announce the outcome before Christmas.

 Support for the sugar beet industry is regulated under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). A revised Sugar Regime under the CAP was agreed at the May 2001 Agriculture Council and runs for five years until 1 July 2006, with a review in the early part of 2003. We continue to believe that further substantive reform is needed to take account of trade liberalisation resulting from the "Everything But Arms" agreement and to put the industry on a more sustainable basis for the future.

 Checks on meat imported at airports and sea ports is the responsibility of the local authority in which the port or sea port is situated. DEFRA officials are co-ordinating a number of initiatives, involving interested Government Departments and local authority enforcement bodies, aimed at ensuring that rules for importing animal products are enforced effectively and efficiently. We have taken action to improve publicity to travellers about import rules, to improve the collection and analysis of information about illegal imports and to use that information to better target enforcement activity. We are keeping these measures under constant review and we are looking at a wide range of other options for improvements, including, for example, the use of sniffer dogs, X-ray machines, on-the-spot-fines and changes to administrative structures.

<P>

<a name="11211w32.html_para0">Similarly, the scrapie provisions of the Bill would not directly impose additional regulatory burden or costs on the industry. However, if the relevant enabling powers were applied, there would be a minimal increase in the level of regulatory burden and cost associated with compliance.
