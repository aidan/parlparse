<p><a name="40312w01.html_wqn0"><b> Annabelle Ewing: </b>  To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) how many Customs and Excise staff were employed in Scotland in each year since 2002;  [157866]

<p><a name="40312w01.html_spnew0"><b> John Healey  </b> <i>[holding answers 2&nbsp;March 2004]</i>: The regional distribution of permanent staff (including fixed term) staff in all Government Departments is published annually by the Cabinet Office in Table D of &#039;Civil Service Statistics&#039;, a copy of which is available in the Library of the House.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w01.html_para0">In April 2002 there were 1170 full time equivalent Customs and Excise staff based in Scotland, along with a further 21.5 casual staff.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w01.html_para3">The national deployment of Customs and Excise staff is reviewed annually, and at other times as necessary.

<p><a name="40312w01.html_spnew1"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b>  No new tax liabilities have been introduced on film production. A number of tax reliefs exist specifically for film production and remain available for film-makers. These include Section 42 of the Finance (No.2) Act 1992 and Section 48 of the Finance (No.2) Act 1997. Measures to be included in Finance Bill 2004 prevent tax avoidance through the manipulation of partnership losses. A number of such avoidance schemes were targeted at the film industry.

</p>



<p>(2) what estimate he has made of the cost to museums of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;computer equipment, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;staff, <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;administration and <i>(d)</i>&nbsp;other costs in relation to claiming gift aid; and if he will make a statement;  [155989]

</p>



<p>(3) pursuant to the answer of 15&nbsp;January 2004 to the hon. Member for Leominster (Mr. Wiggin), <i>Official Report</i>, columns 865&#150;6W, on gift aid, what research his Department has conducted into the impact of lost gift aid revenue on <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;national museums, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;independent museums, <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;country houses and <i>(d)</i>&nbsp;royal buildings; and if he will make a statement.  [155990]</p>








<p><a name="40312w01.html_spnew2"><b> John Healey: </b>  Ministers and officials from the Treasury and Chancellor&#039;s Departments regularly receive a wide range of representations from museums and the heritage sector, including many on the benefits they receive from Gift Aid.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w01.html_para4">In April 2000 the Government made improvements to the Gift Aid scheme, as part of a wider package to make the tax system simpler for charities and their donors and to encourage greater charitable giving. In 2002&#150;03 charities received donations under Gift Aid of &#163;2.3&nbsp;billion, including tax relief from the Government of &#163;506&nbsp;million.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w01.html_para5">Under a special exemption introduced in 1989 and imported into Gift Aid as part of a wider reform in 2000, certain heritage and conservation charities are able to claim Gift Aid on membership subscriptions in the same way as they were previously able to claim tax refunds under Deeds of Covenant. Deeds of Covenant lasted for at least three years, meaning that a donor was required to have an ongoing commitment to a charity, but Gift Aid can apply to one-off donations as well.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w01.html_para6">A number of charities eligible for the special exemption are claiming Gift Aid tax refunds under so-called &#039;day membership&#039; schemes. These schemes do not generate additional giving, but simply reclassify admission fees as donations on which Gift Aid is being claimed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w01.html_para7">The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the pre-Budget report (Cm 6042) that the Government will amend the Gift Aid legislation to ensure that the special exemption applies as it was originally intended and not to these &#039;day memberships&#039;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w01.html_para8">This will mean that heritage and conservation charities will continue to benefit from the special exemption where a donor has an ongoing commitment to the charity, such as an annual membership, and these&nbsp;charities&#151;like other fundraising charities&#151;will continue to benefit from Gift Aid on other donations of money.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w01.html_para9">The Government is consulting closely with charities that might be affected, directly and through their associations and representative bodies, on the detail of how the change may best be achieved.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>12 Mar 2004 : Column 1751W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w01.html_para10">As I made clear in my earlier answer, no estimate is available of the amount of money being claimed by charities which are taking advantage of this. Charities are not required to differentiate on their Gift Aid claims the amounts they are claiming for &#039;day membership&#039; income from other amounts they are claiming. No estimate has been made of the cost to museums of claiming the Gift Aid benefits they enjoy.

<p><a name="40312w01.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Drew: </b>  To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the situation of local authorities who have transferred their housing stock and who have to pay VAT on the service arrangements involved in that transfer.  [161043]</p>








<p><a name="40312w01.html_spnew3"><b> John Healey: </b>  A local authority is entitled to recover any VAT incurred on professional services supplied to it in connection with arranging the transfer of housing stock to the private sector. VAT can also be recovered on certain improvement works the purchaser may require the local authority to carry out as a contractual condition of purchase.
</p>






<a name="40312w01.html_sbhd4"><h3 align=center>Large Business Office</h3>





<p><a name="40312w01.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Gray: </b>  To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer pursuant to his answer of 12&nbsp;February, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1556W, on the Large Business Office, when the Director of Inland Revenue&#039;s Large Business Office first asked Inland Revenue&#039;s internal auditors to review the accuracy of the Large Business Office&#039;s compliance data for 2002&#150;03; when the internal auditors reported their findings; when the relevant commissioner first made known to fellow board members the existence of potentially unreliable reports of the Large Business Office&#039;s compliance performance; when the Board received the report on the issues of the 2003 review; when Inland Revenue first alerted the National Audit Office to the existence of previously overstated compliance performance for the Large Business Office in Inland Revenue&#039;s annual reports; how many of the Large Business Office&#039;s geographic offices were revealed by the 2003 follow-up review to have had at least one Large Business Office caseworker who was not reporting yield in line with departmental guidance; and what proportion of Large Business Office caseworkers were revealed not to be reporting yield in line with departmental guidance.  [160095]</p>








<p><a name="40312w01.html_spnew4"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b>  The Director of the LBO asked the&nbsp;Internal Audit Office to carry out a review of the 2002&#150;03 figures in April 2003 (after the year end). The IAO made their report in August 2003.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w01.html_para11">A design fault in the LBO computer system incorrectly invited Inspectors to enter a tax outcome for taxpayer favour adjustments. All taxpayer favour adjustments were recorded in this way. The Board was advised in October 2003 of the overall adjustments required to LBO yield figures. The issue was discussed with NAO at a working level in February 2004 as part of their general audit coverage of the Inland Revenue.

[160189]</p>








<p><a name="40312w01.html_spnew5"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b>  As a Government Department, the Inland Revenue must comply with EU Council Directive 50/92, which came into force in the UK in January 1994 as a Statutory Instrument (Public Services Contract Regulations 1993 (1993: No 3228)). This Statutory Instrument allows a contracting authority to reject a service provider if the latter has not fulfilled obligations relating to payment of taxes under the law of any part of the United Kingdom.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w01.html_para12">Work on drafting the ASPIRE ITT commenced in January 2002 and notification that a review of the tax affairs of bidders would form part of the evaluation was included in a draft version of the ITT issued to the three shortlisted bidders on 31&nbsp;July 2002.

[160013]</p>








<p><a name="40312w02.html_spnew0"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b>  Where the Inland Revenue is working on a procurement exercise or is engaged in a contract jointly with another Government Department, the Revenue may withdraw from that joint exercise or contract in the light of tax non-compliance by a supplier. In those exceptional circumstances an explanation to joint procurement partners for the withdrawal would be appropriate but would be limited to a brief general statement and will not include details of non-compliance of the potential supplier. Where necessary, this would be done by the most appropriate Revenue office in the specific instance.

<p><a name="40312w03.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Sheerman: </b>  To ask the Secretary of State for Transport in what ways environmentally sustainable procurement strategies within the Department have driven innovation in the design and supply of products.  [159147]</p>









<p><a name="40312w03.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b>  Environmentally sustainable procurement strategies have driven innovation in this Department in the following areas:

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">It is Government policy to use recycled paper and this Department has developed a Recycled Printing Papers Framework to meet the requirements of the Waste Strategy Initiative. Since the Framework started in August 2000, the success can be measured in terms of awareness, quality, availability and price advantage, demonstrated in savings to Government of &#163;1.8&nbsp;million, growth in the market place and improvements in supply and quality. There are now more than 25 Government Departments and agencies using the Framework.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">It is now a contractual provision within the Department to use legal and sustainable timber for all central furniture and property management contracts. Certification to this effect is required for all furniture supplied. A decision has also been taken to discontinue use of natural wood veneers on ranges of furniture where alternative finishes are available.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">The Department&#039;s catalogue of core stationery items clearly identifies &quot;green&quot; products. All toner cartridges are recycled.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">The Department&#039;s IT disposal contract offers surplus equipment to schools under a Home Office scheme. Any equipment where this is not appropriate is disposed of in an environmentally friendly way.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">All the Department&#039;s personal and laptop computers have power saving software which puts the hardware into power saving mode after approximately 20 minutes of inactivity. In addition, a rolling program is in place to refresh hardware: this has recently included the replacement of monitors with flat screen technology which has a much lower power consumption and heat output. All PC, laptop and network printer hardware also complies with EU energy saving and electrical regulation.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">The Department has encouraged its main suppliers of furniture, stationery and office machinery to aim for ISO 14001 certification. Most have now received accreditation with the remainder expected to achieve it in 2004.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">The Department carries out an annual environmental audit of suppliers of goods, irrespective of whether they have an ISO 14001 accreditation. The audits are carried out internally by trained staff. Examples of good practice are shared with other suppliers where possible.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">The Department (in collaboration with ODPM) has awarded a contract for an electronic environmental management system (EMS) which is now being rolled out to other Government Departments.</p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w03.html_para2">The Unit has already identified a number of areas where local authorities need additional support. In response the Unit is producing a range of tools, case studies and best practice.

<p><a name="40312w04.html_spnew4"><b> Alun Michael: </b>  If milk prices fully reflected the reductions in intervention prices for butter and skimmed milk powder in the period 2004&#150;07, there would be a decrease of 4.5 pence per litre, assuming current exchange rates. The Commission in its economic assessment of the reform proposals concluded that prices would not fall to the full extent of any support price cuts. Colman and Harvey in their recent study for the Dairy Supply Chain Forum concluded that the average farm gate price in the UK could fall to just above 15 pence per litre. However, the effects of these lower prices on farm incomes will be, at least in part, offset by the introduction of direct payments. Furthermore, decoupling should lead to some improvement in prices and incomes as farmers produce for the market, rather than subsidy.

<a name="40312w04.html_para11">Emissions from diesel trains have fallen substantially in the last decade. In 2001, emissions from diesel trains accounted for approximately 0.2&nbsp;per cent. of UK CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions, compared to 0.3&nbsp;per cent. in 1990. For NOx the proportion of UK emissions originating from diesel trains fell from 0.8&nbsp;per cent. in 1990 to 0.6&nbsp;per cent. in 2001. PM <sub>1</sub>  <sub>0</sub>  emissions from diesel trains accounted for 0.6&nbsp;per cent. of total UK emissions in 1990, reducing to 0.5&nbsp;per cent. in 2001. Finally, SO <sub>2</sub>  contributions have remained about the same over the same time period at about 0.08&nbsp;per cent. of total UK emissions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w04.html_para12">Defra has not assessed specifically the environmental implications of emissions from diesel locomotives because they are a low proportion of total national pollutant emissions. It is however possible that these emissions might have an impact on local air quality. Local authorities have a duty to review and assess air quality outside of buildings to identify areas where it is considered likely that Air Quality Objectives will be exceeded. Some local authorities are now beginning to perform monitoring in the vicinity of rail stations.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w05.html_para0">The Council agreed by consensus a set of Conclusions as the contribution by Environment ministers to the Spring European Council. We were pleased with the priorities reflected in the Conclusions. They included rapid implementation of the Environmental Technologies Action Plan, a proposal that the Commission should report annually to Spring council on the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, and called on the Community and member states to consider mid and long-term emissions reduction strategies, including targets, in preparation for the 11th Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Climate Change in November 2005. We called on the Commission, in preparing its review of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy by the end of 2004, to incorporate the external dimension of sustainable development so as to contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and other international commitments.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w05.html_para1">We held a short policy debate on the proposal for a Regulation on shipments of waste. Replying to a series of questions from the Irish Presidency to all the delegations, I indicated that any measures aimed to prevent &#039;eco-dumping&#039; should work through establishing community-wide standards and preserve the internal market; that in handling mixed &#039;green waste&#039;, the UK would support a proportionate, risk-based approach, aligned to the OECD Decision on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Wastes Destined for Recovery Operations; and that the &#039;take-back&#039;requirements of the Regulation should not be applied to &#039;green waste&#039;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w05.html_para2">The Commission gave a progress report on the proposal for a Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). We were informed that further work is being done on assessing the impact of the proposals. There are to be policy debates in both the Competitiveness and Environment Councils, in May and June respectively. We were also updated on the progress of negotiations on the proposal for a Directive to amend the EU emissions trading scheme in respect of the Kyoto Protocol&#039;s project mechanisms. Although work remains to be done, the Presidency remained hopeful that an agreement could be reached which would also receive the early support of the European Parliament.

[157983]</p>








<p><a name="40312w05.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b>  Producer responsibility Directives include the Packaging, End of Life Vehicles (ELV), and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directives. The WEEE and ELV Directives contain provisions on product design that are expected to increase the recyclability of vehicles and electrical and electronic equipment when they are transposed later this year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w05.html_para6">The Packaging Directive is implemented in England and Wales by (i) the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended) (&quot;the packaging Regulations&quot;) and the parallel instruments in the devolved administrations; and (ii) the Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 2003. The Producer Responsibility Obligations provide incentives to minimise packaging as the amount of packaging waste producers have to recover and recycle is determined, in part, by the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>12 Mar 2004 : Column 1765W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
amount of packaging they handle. Therefore businesses can save money if they reduce the amount of packaging they handle.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w05.html_para7">The Government recently commissioned a study on the impact of the Essential Requirements Regulations, which can be viewed at: www.dti.gov.uk/sustainability/packagingfinalreport.pdf. The report highlights a number of instances where packaging has been minimised as a result of the Essential Requirements Regulations. For example one large retailer has reduced the weight of plastic packaging on a range of cosmetic products saving around 30 tonnes of plastic per year.

<p><a name="40312w05.html_spnew3"><b> Alun Michael: </b>  The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) is bound by commercial confidentiality in its dealings with its customers, whether sole traders or farmers or corporations, breach of which by disclosing information relating to the affairs of individual traders or farmers or corporations would expose the RPA to the liability of legal proceedings in court.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w05.html_para8">In relation to individual farmers or traders, information which is of a personal nature, such as individual payments to such persons, is personal data which is protected from voluntary disclosure under the Data Protection Act 1998. While the RPA can release global figures relating to payments, which do not identify individual persons, including corporations, it is unable to release individual figures without incurring the liabilities under the two principles referred to.

<p><a name="40312w06.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Morley </b> <i>[holding answer 27&nbsp;February 2004]:</i> The Review is being led by my right hon.

<p><a name="40312w06.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Todd: </b>  To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will publish the legal advice her Department uses to determine eligibility for payment under the over-30-months scheme when cattle are presented for slaughter without an official tag but with other supporting documents; and how many claims previously regarded as ineligible for want of tags have been accepted since this advice.  [159486]</p>









<p><a name="40312w06.html_spnew1"><b> Alun Michael: </b>  When cattle are presented for slaughter at a designated abattoir the Rural Payments Agency must be satisfied of the origin of the animal. There is a risk that without an ear tag an animal might have been substituted. However, provided that there is some clear and unequivocal identification on the animal itself which directly links with the animal&#039;s official documentation it may be concluded that an animal can be satisfactorily identified.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w06.html_para0">Sixty six animals initially regarded as ineligible because of a missing official tag have since been accepted onto the scheme.

<p><a name="40312w06.html_wqn2"><b> Norman Baker: </b>  To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for what reasons the Environment Agency has not implemented a minimum standard for the amount of ozone-depleting substances recovered from each refrigerator.  [154777]</p>








<p><a name="40312w06.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b>  Two of the principal aims of the Ozone Depleting Substance (ODS) Regulation (EC 2037/2000) are to prevent the release of existing ODS and ensure their recovery.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w06.html_para1">When setting performance standards the Environment Agency must have regard to the ODS Regulations and the criteria set out in Waste Management Paper No4 (WMP4). Licence conditions must be necessary, enforceable, unambiguous and comprehensive. The standard set by the Agency is based on the emission loss to the atmosphere from the process based on throughput, and the percentage loss through attachment to residual metal, plastic, foam and oil. The ODS Regulations do not require minimum 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>12 Mar 2004 : Column 1767W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
recovery; only that releases are prevented and ODS recovered. The Environment Agency considers that the performance standards set meet these requirements.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w06.html_para2">Setting a minimum standard of ODS recovered would be problematic when assessed against the aforementioned criteria and the fact that fridges accepted at the facilities do not contain an average or an assumed amount of ODS, as carried out by certain other standards.


</p>







<p><a name="40312w06.html_wqn3"><b> Norman Baker: </b>  To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what percentage of chlorofluorocarbons is extracted from recovered refrigerators in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;the United Kingdom and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;other EU member states.  [154778]</p>








<p><a name="40312w06.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley: </b>  To calculate the percentage of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) from recovered refrigerators the average recovered CFCs per fridge for R11 and R12 needs to be used, which for 2003 in England and Wales are 186.13g and 50.5g respectively, and the average amount of CFCs contained in a refrigerator.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w06.html_para3">However, there is currently no agreed figure for an average amount of CFCs in a refrigerator across member states, primarily because of the variation in size and volume of units. Therefore it is not possible to assess and compare the percentage of CFCs with any confidence. It is for this reason that the performance standards set in the UK work on the basis of emissions lost in the process and those lost through attachment to residual metal, plastic, foam and oil.

<p><a name="40312w06.html_wqn4"><b> Llew Smith: </b>  To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent information she has received from the Environment Agency on the management of Technetium-99 radioactive wastes at Sellafield.  [156639]</p>








<p><a name="40312w06.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Morley: </b>  In September 2001 the Environment Agency published its proposed decision on the future regulation of technetium-99 (Tc-99) discharges from Sellafield into the Irish sea. In December 2002, the Secretaries of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and for Health published their decision not to exercise their powers under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 to direct the Agency in respect to its proposed decision. The Agency&#039;s decision was, therefore, implemented in full. It contained a number of elements including a requirement to work towards the abatement of Tc-99 discharges through &quot;MAC Diversion&quot;. This technique came into operation in middle of last year. The Agency also required research to be carried out into the use of tetraphenylphosphonium bromide (TPP) to abate Tc-99 discharges still further. A plant-scale trial using TPP was carried out towards the end of last year. The results of the trial are currently being evaluated by the Agency and the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate. We look forward to hearing their conclusions, which are expected in April.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>12 Mar 2004 : Column 1768W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
factors in the next (i) 25, (ii) 50 and (iii) 75 year terms; and what research her Department has (A) carried out and (B) commissioned into the subject.  [154230]</p>









<p><a name="40312w06.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Morley: </b>  The Thames Barrier was originally constructed to accommodate an 8mm per year increase in sea level, which at the time of design was extrapolated from tidal records through the Estuary. This, in principle, provides protection against a one in a 1000 year tidal surge up to 2030. Current guidance from DEFRA suggests an increase in relative sea level of up to 6mm per year is built into plans for future flood defences.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w06.html_para4">The 6mm per year figure is intended to accommodate the impact of climate change on sea level; that is thermal expansion of the oceans and ice melt of coastal ice-sheets, as well as long-term regional land subsidence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w06.html_para5">Currently the Environment Agency is undertaking work to consider flood risk management options for the estuary up until 2100 under the project, Thames Estuary 2100. This will also involve making a full assessment of the risks associated with climate induced sea level, including potential changes in North Sea surges.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w06.html_para6">Predictions for the next 100 years will be developed using UK Climate Impact Programme research combined with trends inferred from the project&#039;s investigation into absolute ground level changes.

In addition, other landfill sites, classified as non-hazardous, may opt to accept stable non-reactive waste in separately constructed cells. Both these issues are being kept under regular review. Not all hazardous wastes are toxic and the Landfill Directive specifically bans hazardous wastes that are explosive, corrosive, oxidising or flammable from being disposed of to landfill.

<p><a name="40312w07.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Morley: </b>  The definition of waste in force in the United Kingdom is the definition in Article 1(a)&nbsp;of the Waste Framework Directive (as amended). It provides that waste means, &quot;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. any substance or object .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard.&quot;
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w07.html_para3">It rests in the first place with the producer of a substance to decide whether it is being discarded as waste. The Environment Agency is designated as a competent authority for the purposes of the Directive and is responsible for the application of its controls to substances discarded as waste.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w07.html_para4">Whether or not substances, such as hazardous materials, are discarded as waste is a matter which must be determined on the facts of the case and the interpretation of the law is a matter for the Courts. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has issued several judgments on the interpretation of the definition of waste and the meaning of &quot;discard&quot;. ECJ judgments are binding on member states and their &quot;competent authorities&quot;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w07.html_para5">There are no specific limits on <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;volume and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;duration of storage of hazardous materials to determine whether they have been discarded as waste. However, the long term storage of materials with little intention or certainty of future use, or that no use for the material other than disposal can be envisaged, may be an indication that the material has been discarded as waste.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w07.html_para6">Where hazardous materials have been discarded as waste, the Government have provided an exemption for the temporary storage of hazardous waste at the place of production in paragraph 41 of Schedule 3 of the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994. This allows for the temporary storage at the place of production, pending collection, for a period not exceeding 12 months of:

<p><a name="40312w07.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Morley: </b>  There are no plans to introduce a compensation scheme. Measures are already in place to control noise and smells from landfill sites.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w07.html_para7">The EU Waste Framework Directive requires member states to put in place necessary measures to ensure that controlled waste is recovered or disposed of without harm to human health and the environment. This is done in the UK by means of a Waste Management licence which is issued and regulated by the Environment Agency. The Environment Agency has a range of enforcement tools which it can use to ensure licence conditions are met.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w07.html_para8">Also, in order to obtain such a licence for a landfill site, planning permission would be needed which should address the issue of likely nuisance to local residents.

<p><a name="40312w11.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Timms: </b>  The Department of Trade and Industry is fully committed to regeneration and growth in the Thames Gateway and are aware that it contains an unusual concentration of overhead power lines. My officials have been working closely with ODPM, other Government Departments and the local regeneration agencies to consider whether some of these might be undergrounded or re-routed. They have also had meetings with the utility company responsible for most of the lines involved and with developers working in the Gateway. Ministers have been kept regularly informed of progress and have had discussions with counterparts in other Departments.

<p><a name="40312w11.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Timms: </b>  Undergrounding is one of the options being considered for power lines in the Thames Gateway. Others include re-routeing and keeping lines in situ. The developers working on the major sites in the Gateway are preparing an analysis of those sections of line where they consider undergrounding to be important. As soon as this is available it will be discussed with the various Government bodies involved and the relevant utility companies. This approach will enable a more strategic view to be taken across the Gateway than an approach based on ad hoc consideration of the position on individual sites.

<p><a name="40312w11.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Charles Clarke </b> <i>[holding answer 11&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) makes provision in Part 2 about discrimination in the employment field; in Part 3 about discrimination by providers of goods, facilities and services to the public or a section of the public; in Part 4 about discrimination in the education field (Chapter 1 deals with schools and Chapter 2 with Further and Higher Education); and Part 5 about public transport.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40312w11.html_para0">The DDA will shortly be amended by the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (Amendment) Regulations 2003 (&quot;the 2003 Regulations&quot;) coming into force on 1&nbsp;October 2004. These Regulations largely implement the requirements of the disability strand of the Employment Directive (Directive 2000/78/EC). Substantial amendments are made to Part 2 of the DDA and also in one area of Part 3, namely that of employment services. The 2003 Regulations do not, however, implement the Directive&#039;s requirements in relation to qualifications, vocational guidance and vocational training insofar as those requirements impact on areas covered by Part 4 of the DDA. Separate Regulations implementing the Directive in relation to Part 4 will be made by the

<p>
<a name="40312w11.html_para1">The DDA was amended by the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001 (SENDA), which largely addresses the requirements of the Employment Directive in relation to vocational training in education institutions. The next amendment under SENDA, in relation to education, is not due for implementation until 2005 when a duty in further and higher education regarding &#039;premises&#039; comes into force. At this point only the implementation of the DDA Part 3 affecting premises of service providers (but excluding education institutions) will remain. DfES will consult on any proposed changes needed to bring the Employment Directive fully into effect, but will not bring those amendments in before the final SENDA provisions are implemented in 2005.

Notes:1.&nbsp;The effect of year on year fluctuations on a small population mean that this method of calculating participation rates is unreliable for the City of London.Participation rates have been calculated using the 17-year-old population from the previous year to reduce the distortion caused to LEA populations by the migration of students to their place of study. However, any migration, for whatever reason, at age 17 will affect the rates shown here, particularly between authorities that are geographically close, for example in the London area.Accepted applicants with unknown English domiciles are excluded from the figures.Population figures relate to persons aged 17 as at 31 August in the year prior to entry, counts taken at the following 1 January; accepted applicants are aged 18 at 30 September in the year of entry.<br>

The UK supports Afghanistan in developing a justice system which is speedy, fair, transparent and accessible to all. The UK has contributed &#163;0.5&nbsp;million to a UNDP programme on the reform of the judiciary and has committed &#163;232,000 to penal reform, through Penal Reform International.

<p>
<a name="40312w12.html_para5">The GCPP is intended to support the prevention, management and resolution of conflict, and post conflict reconstruction to help avoid the re-ignition of conflict at a later date. A range of activities are covered, for example: development of new governance and justice systems; disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of fighters into society and development of alternative livelihoods for them; training for police, armed forces and other parts of the security sector in democratic and accountable systems which respect human rights. Most GCPP funding is spent on consultancy and other non-capital support to these objectives. Related technical and other equipment is however sometimes supplied under Ministerially approved guidelines, where this supports an agreed conflict prevention strategy.

Notes:<br>

1.&nbsp;The Weekly Benefit Savings (WBS) scheme recorded estimated savings from fraud detection. It is not possible to measure actual savings from fraud detection because it is not possible to know how long the overpayment would have continued for had if not been detected at that point in time. Estimated savings from the WBS scheme are therefore based on the assumption that the overpayment would have continued for 32 weeks had it not been detected.<br>

2.&nbsp;Amounts have been rounded to the nearest &#163;100,000.<br>

3.&nbsp;Local Authority WBS rules were tightened during this period, and the fall in recorded savings may not reflect a fall in actual amounts detected.<br>

4.&nbsp;For local authorities, the WBS scheme was replaced by the Security against Fraud and Error (SAFE) scheme in April 2002, with some local authorities joining in April 2001; therefore figures for WBS savings are not available for 2001&#150;02 onwards. Like WBS, the SAFE scheme provides rewards for detected overpayments. However, it provides rewards for the detection of both fraud and claimant error overpayments.<br>

Unpaid employers&#039; National Insurance contributions for the twelve-month period prior to the insolvency date are also payable, but are subject to monetary limits depending on the type of pension scheme.

The Pension Credit application line (freephone 0800 99 1234), which is the main method of applying, is working well and has taken over 2.3&nbsp;million calls (to the end of January) since it became operational on 7&nbsp;April 2003. The Pension Service is able to offer alternative ways of applying to suit individual circumstances. Recent independent research, a summary of which is available in the Library, found high levels of customer satisfaction with the application line and with the application process overall. We continue to review and improve the application process in the light of experience, including improvements to make it easier for people with savings to provide the required information and documentary evidence.

<p><a name="40312w21.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b>  The National Clinical Assessment Authority (NCAA) was established to help the National Health Service manage performance concerns about doctors and dentists. For the majority of the NCAA&#039;s casework (about 75&nbsp;per cent.), the average direct cost is estimated at around &#163;330 per case. A smaller proportion of cases (about 15&nbsp;per cent.) require more detailed expert support of local case management, at an estimated average cost of between &#163;7,500 to &#163;8,500 per case. The estimated average cost of full clinical performance assessment is between &#163;22,400 and &#163;24,300 per case, depending on whether it is an hospital and community care or primary care case; full clinical performance assessment occurs in about only 10&nbsp;per cent. of referrals made to the NCAA.

Indications from other countries that have removed donor anonymity are that the initial drop is followed by a climb in donor numbers. To help increase public awareness we will support a public campaign and fund a national helpline for people who are interested in donating. The helpline will give information about donation and provide callers with a list of clinics so that they can decide which clinic is most convenient for them. Although the support we will provide will not do the actual recruitment for clinics, our intention is that it will raise awareness, create interest and provide essential information among those who may be eligible to donate.
