<i> [holding answer 16 April 2007]:</i> The approved UK national allocation plan (NAP) for phase I (2005-07) of the EU emissions trading scheme is set to deliver carbon dioxide emissions savings of around 65 million tonnes (roughly 8 per cent.) below the projected business as usual emissions of the installations covered by the scheme during phase I. The rationale behind emission trading is to ensure that the emission reductions take place where the cost of the reduction is lowest thus lowering the overall costs of tackling climate change. The emissions reductions referred to above may not therefore all take place in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="70425w0001.htm_para9"><a name="07042556000172">Comparing 2003 and 2005 emissions in the UK from installations in the EU ETS shows a reduction of around 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (MtCO2) which equates to 4 per cent. However, a number of new installations commenced operation and entered the scheme in 2004 and 2005, emitting a total of around five MtCO2 in 2005. Therefore, the net total reduction in emissions from UK installations (incumbent and new) in the EU ETS was approximately five MtCO2 between 2003 and 2005.</p>

 10 Division of the Iraqi Army, which covers all four provinces, has made significant progress. This was recently highlighted in Maysan when security responsibility for the province was transferred to the Iraqis. This transition occurred in Al Muthanna and Dhi Qar provinces in July and September 2006 respectively.</p>

Elements of 10 Division are also supporting the Baghdad security plan.

 The temporary increase in levels of disease or non-battle injuries in both Operations Telic and Herrick was a result of the roulements in both theatres. An increase in those being treated for diarrhoea and vomiting type illnesses is common at such times, largely as a result of the climatic, food and environment changes experienced by those deploying into operational theatres. While such symptoms are unlikely to result in a patient being admitted to a hospital in the UK, individuals are admitted to hospital in theatre as returning them to barracks may lead to the spread of disease.</p>

 The Government are committed to ensuring that people across the UK, including Colchester can benefit from, and participate in, the 2012 Olympic games and Paralympic games. We are working closely with the London Organising Committee of the Olympic games and Paralympic games (LOCOG) and the Nations and Regions Group (NRG), chaired by Charles Allen, which brings together representatives from every nation and region. Each nation and region is finalising its own plan to maximise the impact of the games in their area, as well as the wider opportunities to deliver a sustainable legacy from the games. The East of England released its regional plan on 28 March 2007. In developing the plan, consultation has taken place over the last two years. It can be found on the East of England Regional Development Agency website:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_383"><a name="70425w0005.htm_para1"><a name="07042556000484">Further detailed information regarding the region&#146;s plan can be provided by the relevant NRG Coordinator, Katie Huane (East of England Development Agency, The Business Centre, Station Road, Histon, Cambridge, CB4 9LQ).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_384"><a name="70425w0005.htm_para2"><a name="07042556000485">In addition, Broxbourne in Hertfordshire will host the 2012 canoeing and kayaking and Weald country park near Brentwood in Essex will also host the Olympic mountain biking competitions. Together these events will add significant strength to the region&#146;s potential to benefit from the games.</p>

 The Government implemented the National School Sport Strategy in 2002. This is underpinned by a joint DCMS/DfES PSA target, to increase the percentage of five to 16-year-olds participating in at least two hours high quality PE and school sport each week to 85 per cent. by 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_386"><a name="70425w0006.htm_para0"><a name="07042556000654">The 2005-06 annual school sport survey showed that 80 per cent. of pupils in school sport partnership schools are participating in at least two hours in a typical week, which surpassed the target of 75 per cent. We are therefore making excellent progress towards the PSA target of 85 per cent. by 2008. The long-term ambition is to offer all children at least four hours of sport a week by 2010, comprising two hours at school and a further two to three hours delivered by a range of school, community and club providers.</p>

</ul><a name="70425w0007.htm_brev8"><a name="07042556003038"><ul><p class="tabletext">I should explain that Roads Service&#146;s policy in relation to pedestrian crossings is to provide such facilities where there is an identifiable need and where the conditions at any potential site make it difficult for pedestrians and cyclists to cross the road. An integral part of the process is an assessment of the &#145;demand&#146; and &#145;difficulty&#146; of crossing the road at the location concerned. The initial part of our assessment process uses the number of pedestrians (the initial demand factor) and the volume of traffic (the initial difficulty factor) to give an indication of the potential &#145;conflict&#146; at a site. The assessment of the need for a crossing is then supplemented using a scorecard, which assigns scores to various other &#145;demand&#146; and &#145;difficulty&#146; factors, including collision history at the site. This policy is designed to assess the need and to prioritise locations where pedestrians encounter difficulties in crossing the road due to the high volumes of vehicular traffic. This is applied consistently and impartially when assessing all requests in Northern Ireland, so that available funding can be directed at those with the greatest need.</p>
</ul><a name="70425w0007.htm_brev9"><a name="07042556003039"><ul><p class="tabletext">With regard to the number of complaints received in relation to the lack of crossing facilities on the High Donaghadee Road between the roundabout with the East Circular road and the junction with the Ballycrochan Road, I can advise that since September 2005, five individuals have corresponded with Roads Service over this issue. In total these five people have written on nine occasions, with one resident including a petition of approximately 150 signatures. Roads Service has no record of complaints about the lack of pedestrian crossing facilities at this location prior to 2005.</p>
</ul><a name="70425w0007.htm_brev10"><a name="07042556003040"><ul><p class="tabletext">In relation to health and safety implications, I am advised that survey observations, obtained as part of the process for determining the need for a controlled pedestrian crossing facility, concluded that there were a very small number of pedestrians wishing to cross the road at this location and as such, it was considered that there was little conflict between pedestrians and vehicular traffic.</p>
</ul><a name="70425w0007.htm_brev11"><a name="07042556003041"><ul><p class="tabletext">In light of the survey findings, I am afraid that it is not possible to make funding available for a controlled pedestrian crossing facility at this location at this time. However, in such circumstances Roads Service may consider other measures to assist pedestrians, such as footway build-outs and central refuge islands, which shorten the crossing width and improve visibility thereby reducing the crossing difficulty. Central refuges can be particularly useful to vulnerable pedestrians such as elderly people.</p>
</ul><a name="70425w0007.htm_brev12"><a name="07042556003042"><ul><p class="tabletext">I am pleased to advise you that Roads Service is presently designing such a scheme for this location. However, I have to stress that this proposal is at a very early stage and will require a degree of public consultation prior to the detailed layout being finalised. Hopefully we will be able to complete this work within the current financial year.</p>

<i> [holding answer 24 April 2007]:</i> Extending the British Crime Survey to include those aged under 16 years old was one of the recommendations of the independent review of crime statistics led by Professor Adrian Smith that reported in November 2006. Smith recommended the Home Office should draw on the advice of experts in making such changes and there should be careful piloting so that the effect of such a change could be properly assessed before the extension is incorporated into the main BCS sample. We intend to commission work in the near future from experts in sampling and conducting surveys to provide advice on how this work could be taken forward. We expect to reach a conclusion on this work in the autumn of 2007.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many sanctions were imposed on lone parents claiming income support who had missed their first work focused interview in each quarter since 1997. [123579]</p>

<p><a name="st_241"><a name="07042556001940"><a name="70425w0011.htm_spnew2"><a name="07042556003318"><b>Mr. Jim Murphy</b>
<i> [holding answer 26 February 2007]:</i> Work focused interviews were introduced nationally for some lone parents from April 2001. They were extended in stages to all lone parents making new or repeat claims to Income support, and from April 2004 to all lone parents with an existing claim to income support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_428"><a name="70425w0011.htm_para2"><a name="07042556001941">Lone parents making a new or repeat claim for income support are expected to attend a work focused interview before an income support payment is made, unless the interview is deferred or waived. Failure to attend this first interview would result in the claim being disallowed rather than a benefit sanction being imposed. Benefit sanctions are imposed on existing customers who fail to attend their first work focused interview.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_429"><a name="70425w0011.htm_para3"><a name="07042556001942">Between April 2001 and March 2006, 1.76 million initial lone parent work focused interviews have been booked and, in the same period, 1.62 million initial interviews have been attended, with 39,920 sanctions applied for failure to attend an initial work focused interview.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_430"><a name="70425w0011.htm_para4"><a name="07042556001943">The number of work focused interviews (WFIs) booked for lone parents in the year to March 2006 was around one and a half times the number booked two years earlier, and over two and a half times the number booked three years before. This has, inevitably, resulted in an increase in the number of sanctions imposed. However, at less than 5 per cent. of the number of interviews booked, this represents a very low proportion of the total.</p>

1. Figures up to 2007-08 are consistent with the historical out-turn and pre-Budget report forecast expenditure figures published on the Department for Work and Pensions website at: http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd4/expenditure.asp.<br>
2. Figures after 2007-08 are illustrative projections consistent with the 2006 Long-term Public Finance Report, and assume current policy continues throughout the projection period, including the migration of the dependant child element of income support for lone parents to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs as part of the wider child tax credits roll-out. They do not take account of policies proposed in the current Welfare Reform Bill.<br>
3. Lone parents are defined as single claimants with dependants not receiving incapacity benefits. Expenditure refers to the total expenditure directed at working-age adults and any child dependants from income support for lone parents.<br>
4. Expenditure has been apportioned among age groups using data on IS recipients from the 100 per cent. Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study. For all years beyond 2006-07, expenditure is apportioned using age group data for 2006-07.<br>
5. Information prior to 1999-2000 has not been provided because the underlying data series begins in that financial year.<br>
6. All figures relate to expenditure in Great Britain only, but GDP figures used are for the United Kingdom.<br>

 I have asked officials to carry out a review of the IIDB scheme to ensure that it meets the needs of our modern society and is compatible with the Government's broader welfare reform agenda.

1. Employer subsidies are only paid through New Deal for Young People and New Deal 25 plus. Costs for these programmes are calculated excluding employer subsidies and excluding those who have only gained subsidised employment through these New Deals.<br>
2. Cost figures are calculated on latest confirmed spend figures to March 2006<br>
and figures for people into unsubsidised employment through each New Deal<br>
to March 2006.<br>
3. The New Deal 50 plus cost figures up to 2002-03 include the DWP-funded ND50 plus employment credit. In 2003-04 this was replaced by the 50 plus element of the working tax credit, which is the responsibility of HMRC, so New Deal 50 plus costs reduced very significantly between 2002-03 and 2003-04.<br>
4. Following agreement with HM Treasury in 2002/03, ringfences for New Deal were removed from New Deal. Administrative costs are excluded as it is no longer possible to identify the costs of administering the costs of each New Deal separately from the costs of other labour market activities.<br>
5. Cost data includes start-up costs.<br>
6. Following changes to the New Deal 25 plus programme in April 2001 when a mandatory intensive activity period was introduced, programme costs rose significantly resulting in an increase in the costs of helping people into work through the programme.<br>
7. The costs of helping someone into work through New Deal for Lone Parents are lower as support provided to participants is primarily Adviser support and administrative costs are excluded from cost calculations.<br>
8. Costs for voluntary programmes are also lower than the mandatory New Deals as a higher proportion of participants on voluntary programmes will be job ready without additional intervention.<br>
9. Programme start dates are: New Deal for Young People: January 1998; New Deal 25 plus: July 1998; New Deal for Lone Parents: October 1998; New Deal for Partners: April 1999; New Deal 50 plus: April 2000; New Deal for Disabled People: July 2001.<br>
10. Although New Deal for Young People started in January 1998, it only operated in pilot locations between January-March 1998, rolling out nationally from April 1998.<br>
11. Average cost figures are rounded to the nearest pound.<br>

 DFID's 2005-08 public service agreement (PSA) includes a target shared with Her Majesty's (HM) Treasury, that 90 per cent. of heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs) that have reached Decision Point by end 2005 should receive irrevocable debt relief by end 2008. By the end of 2005, 28 HIPCs had reached HIPC Decision Point (thereby demonstrating their commitment to poverty reduction and qualifying for interim debt relief). Of these 28 countries, 22 have now completed the HIPC initiative and received irrevocable debt cancellation. The PSA target requires that four more countries complete HIPC before the end of 2008. Current indications are that this target will be met.</p>

We remain committed to the full implementation and financing of the HIPCs and multilateral debt relief initiatives (MDRI). We exceed our commitments under HIPC, cancelling 100 per cent. of bilateral debts for qualifying countries. We are also the second largest bilateral donor to the HIPC Trust Fund which helps multilateral organisations deliver HIPC debt relief in a timely manner. We continue to pay our share of the costs of the MDRI at the World Bank,  <br>

This Declaration committed to achieve comprehensive HIV prevention programmes, treatment, care and support by 2010. It also agreed that countries would develop ambitious targets, including interim targets for 2008, to measure progress towards universal access.

This programme is designed to extend the Government&#146;s National Priority programmes to Helmand, and will fund projects in the road-building, community development, micro-credit, water/sanitation and agriculture sectors. Since the programme started in January, over 1000 wells have been surveyed and designed. Of these, 120 wells have been completed, benefiting around 21,000 people and work is continuing on a further 30. A second batch of 150 wells will begin construction shortly. Construction has also started on four roads, totalling 51 km. These roads should be completed by May, security permitting. In 2006-07, the UK Government also committed &#163;6.2 million to fund 128 quick impact projects.

 The Darfur Peace Agreement marked an important milestone in the development of the political process for Darfur. It provided for a comprehensive and fully monitored ceasefire, reinforced by detailed measures on Security Sector Reform and Disengagement, Demobilisation and Reintegration, and on humanitarian protection. It provided for fair political representation for Darfur as part of Sudan. It also provided mechanisms for compensation and for fair and transparent redistribution of Sudanese national wealth to Darfur as part of the overall redistribution set out under the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. However, there was insufficient support among the parties to the conflict in Darfur to support the agreement. This is the main reason there has not been further progress in implementing it. We are pressing for a renewed political process under the auspices of the UN and African Union.

 The dental reforms launched in April 2006 give local primary care trusts (PCTs) for the first time the responsibility for commissioning dental services to meet the needs of their local populations. Under the previous system, dentists could set up practice where they wished and choose how much or how little national health service work to provide. If a dentist stopped providing NHS services, the local NHS could do very little to secure replacement services. Under the reforms, PCTs have the resources to commission agreed levels of patient services from local dentists. If a dentist stops providing NHS services in the area, the money for that service now stays with the PCT and is used to commission services from other dentists. PCTs are increasingly using these new powers to commission additional services which better reflect local needs.</p>

The annual resources now allocated for NHS dentistry are some &#163;400 million more than in 2003-04 (excluding the money for annual pay increases). In the two years leading up to the reforms, the Government co-ordinated a major recruitment programme, which resulted in the equivalent of over 1,450 whole time dentists joining the workforce. There are currently some 20,900 dentists on NHS contracts, around 1,500 more than two years ago and 4,000 more than in 1997. To support future  <br>

Since April 2003 over &#163;70 million additional funding has been made available to support the development of these networks. This is in addition to the general increase in national health service funding, from which neonatal services can also benefit. Because of improvements in technology and the development of health care expertise, greater numbers of very small babies are being born alive and surviving. In the past many of these babies would have died just before or just after birth.</p>
