<p><a name="st_1"><a name="60110w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Guidance on biosecurity and on keeping birds separate from wild birds has been issued very widely to those who keep birds commercially, to veterinary practices and to many others including wildfowl trusts, the RSPCA and the Pet Care Trust. Further guidance on local risk assessments and contingency planning is on the DEFRA website. Advertisements have been placed in a variety of journals to bring the biosecurity guidance and the ban on shows, fairs and sales to the attention of keepers of backyard flocks and captive birds respectively.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60110w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">DEFRA is guided by the Department of Health in relation to advice on seasonal influenza vaccination. The current position is that routine vaccination of poultry workers, veterinarians or those dealing with wild birds with seasonal human flu vaccine is not recommended, but should be used in a confirmed outbreak of avian flu as a protection against the possibility of re-assortment with human flu virus for those people who might be exposed to the virus during disease control activities.

<a name="stpa_4">If an EU member state experiences an outbreak of serious disease such as Avian influenza, existing EU trade rules set out the measures that must be adopted by that member state to prevent the spread of the disease.

 The Government believe the best way for aviation to contribute to the long-term goal of climate stabilisation is through a well-designed emissions trading scheme.

The European Commission aims to bring forward a legislative proposal by the end of 2006 and we are pressing for inclusion from 2008 or as soon as possible thereafter.

These include the beam trawl sector and the sector which catches nephrops. The measures adopted by the Council include a cut in the number of fishing days for these sectors and incentives for them to adopt more selective gear.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60110w02.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_14">Decisions on total allowable catches and quotas need to take into account the state of the target stocks as well as their by-catches of cod and other species. On this basis, the Council was able to adopt significant increases in nephrops TACS which will be of significant benefit to the UK fishing industry.

The following table shows a breakdown by year, location, nature of project and cost.

<a name="stpa_99">The projects typically covered a period of two or three years. Some involved the development and improvement of technologies while others studied the institutional and financial issues surrounding the greater deployment of renewable energy sources in developing countries. Most of the projects were carried out in developing countries, working with local organisations and community groups.

<a name="stpa_101">Our overriding interest in energy is to improve access in developing countries to affordable and reliable energy services, especially to the poor and in support of pro-poor growth and social development. We are encouraging the World Bank, through our support to the energy sector management assistance programme (ESMAP), to give greater attention to renewable energy as part of their efforts to improve access to energy. The World Bank is scaling up its financial support for renewable energy and energy efficiency and has recently announced a rise to $748 million for the year to June 2005, compared to $339 million the previous year. This exceeds the commitment they made in 2004 to increase by 20 percent. per annum their renewable energy and energy efficiency investments over the next five years. We very much welcome this increased focus by the World Bank on clean energy investments.

 The Learning and Skills Development Agency&#039;s (LSDA) report into the funding gap between schools sixth forms and further education (FE) colleges for like-for-like 16&#150;19 provision was commissioned by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) as part of the agenda for change development programme. The report was the first attempt at a comprehensive assessment of all the factors that contribute to the total funding gap and estimated it to be in the region of 13 per cent.

<p>

<a name="stpa_160">We recognise that closing the funding gap will not be easy but we have taken some important steps towards doing this. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced on 16 November the progress that we have made and our future plans for addressing the gap.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60110w21.html_para14">
<a name="stpa_161">The LSDA report was based on 2003/04 figures and since then we have increased FE funding rates relative to school sixth forms. In both 2004/05 and 2005/06 LSC funding rates for FE were increased by 5 per cent. compared to 4 per cent. for schools sixth forms. We have committed to matching the schools&#039; Minimum Funding Guarantee for 16&#150;19 FE. We are also addressing a number of technical anomalies between the two funding system through removal of the in-year adjustment and by beginning a phased removal of the Real Terms Guarantee for school sixth forms. We estimate that these measures will together reduce the funding gap to 8 per cent. by 2006/07.

<a name="60110w21.html_para15">
<a name="stpa_162">We will follow this with further work and our next steps will be to bring greater consistency to the treatment of student retention and achievement between the school and college sectors from 2008. That should narrow the gap by a further 3 per cent.

<p><a name="st_192"><a name="60110w22.html_spnew4"><b> Bill Rammell: </b> 
 Sir Andrew has produced an excellent report which recognises the current strengths of the FE sector and sets out a compelling set of arguments for reform. There are challenges for all parts of the FE system with a clear and convincing set of priorities which we must address. The report is full of significant material which we need to take time to consider, and we want to do this in discussion with colleges and other stakeholders. In the light of that debate, the Government intend to set out in the spring the next stage of reform and how this will be implemented. The purpose of the Government&#039;s response will be to set out a coherent programme of reform which draws together Sir Andrew&#039;s report, Agenda for Change and other existing reform strategies to show how this sector can achieve its potential for economic and social impact.

Colleges may enrol students above the numbers they have agreed with the LSC and can do so if they wish, and have the capacity. I would expect colleges to respond positively to learner demand where they are able to do so. I would also expect that any unplanned growth in student numbers will be reflected in the plans colleges agree with local LSCs for the following year. Where individual colleges cannot respond to increased demand local LSCs will ensure there is appropriate alternative provision.

<i>[holding answer 9 January 2006]:</i> My hon. Friend the Minister of State for Schools announced on 7 December the schools funding settlement for 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08. We intend that school 6th form funding for 2006/07 and 2007/08 should align with these new arrangements. The allocations for school 6th forms for 2006/07 made by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) last month, and based on the September 2005 pupil count, therefore are fixed. For 2006/07 there will be no adjustment made, upwards or downwards, for extra or fewer pupils enrolled in school 6th forms in September 2006. The LSC have special arrangements for new and closing schools and will on an exceptional basis look at school 6th forms where provision is planned to increase significantly. In line with our announcement on multi-year budgets for schools, the LSC has also provided indicative allocations for 2007/08 which will be adjusted on the basis of school enrolment data for September 2006. These arrangements notified to the sector through Priorities for Success&#151;School 6th Form Funding, published on 21 October 2005, will ensure better consistency of approach in funding 16 to 19-year-olds in schools and further education colleges and provide more stability of funding.

In addition, Ofsted will be consulting on moving to a more proportionate inspection system, under which high-performing schools might receive minimal inspection, while under-performing schools could be monitored more frequently, with a focus on those issues of concern in the school. This would reinforce the drive for improvement in such schools.

Notes:<br>

1. Data are based on the police district command unit (DCU) in which an offender&#039;s address falls.<br>

2. Police DCUs became operational in April 2001. However, for the purposes of comparability, calendar year 2000 data are also disaggregated by DCU, rather than police division.<br>

3. It is not possible to disaggregate data by DCU for 1999. Missing data relate to those offenders for which DCU information is not available.<br>

The 2001&#150;02 reports state that on 31 March 2002 there were 18,513 registered sex offenders living in the community in England and Wales. The 2002&#150;03 reports state that on 31 March 2003 the number was 21,413. The 2003&#150;04 reports state that on 31 March 2004 the number was 24,572 and the most recent 2004&#150;05 reports state that on 31 March 2005 the number was 28,994. This increase is to be expected before the notification requirement regime, which was introduced in 1997 with a partially retrospective operation, matures and stabilises.

 No estimates have been made by the Department of dispensing patient packs if reimbursement is based on the quantity of medicine prescribed. Work undertaken by the Prescription Pricing Authority has shown that the quantity prescribed matches that of an available pack size in the majority of cases.

 The national service framework (NSF) for children, young people and maternity services recommends that a family is visited at home by the health visitor or midwife when a child is around 12 days old, to assess the health of the child and family. It also recommends that a child receives a physical examination when they are between six and eight weeks old. This should concentrate on the child&#039;s eyes, heart and hips and is normally carried out by the general practitioner or the health visitor. Where a family requires more support or has complex needs the health visitor should offer further visits.

 Young people claiming Jobseeker&#039;s Allowance (JSA) who are interested in further education and training can receive advice and guidance from Jobcentre Plus Advisers on education and training opportunities, including details of educational establishments that provide A Level courses. A condition of claiming JSA is that recipients continue to make themselves available for and actively seek work, so any education or training undertaken must comply with conditions for continuing to receive JSA.

<a name="stpa_330">Young people aged 18&#150;24 who have been claiming JSA for six months are required to participate in the mandatory new deal for young people (NDYP) programme. The primary aim of NDYP is to help move people into sustainable work as quickly as possible, however, participants on the programme may access education and training opportunities through the full-time education and training (FTET) option.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60110w46.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_331">FTET courses assist new deal participants in achieving vocational qualifications at or equivalent to S/NVQ level 2. They are not designed to compete with qualification courses run by further education establishments, for example GCSE or A level courses. FTET provision is delivered across a wide range of employment sectors for varying lengths of time and is tailored to the needs of the individual and local employers. People aged 25 and over who have been claiming JSA for 18 out of the last 21 months are required to join the mandatory new deal 25 plus (ND25 plus) programme. The employment and training option (ETO) within new deal 25 plus provides participants with the opportunity to acquire the formal qualifications, generally up to and including S/NVQ Level 3, that may be necessary for them to their particular jobs or occupational sectors. Personal advisers can approve early entry to both NDYP and ND25 plus for some people if this is appropriate to their needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60110w46.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_332">Some eligible young people may also participate on other new deal programmes. People on new deal for lone parents (NDLP), which is a voluntary programme, have access to a range of new deal training opportunities, including the NDYP FTET option, or may participate in other approved training. They can have access to this help from the first day of joining the programme. Normally NDLP funding can only be used for education and training courses up to NVQ/SNVQ Level 2 or equivalent. However, where it is clear that a lone parent can achieve an NVQ/SNVQ Level 3 in a year (for example where they have the appropriate qualification levels in the subject) funding could be considered. In all cases Advisers must consider whether the training will lead to sustainable employment.

Notes:<br>

1. Projections for numbers in all the tables have been rounded to the nearest 10,000 and for proportions to the nearest 5 per cent. They are subject to a wide margin of error and should be used as broad indications only.<br>

2. These estimates are based on a long term version of the Department&#039;s Policy Simulation Model, which uses Family Resources Survey data for 2003&#150;04 projected forward into the future to estimate the extent of eligibility for each pensioner household on the survey.<br>

3. A dash in the data represents numbers that are negligible.<br>

4. Couples include those with at least one member aged 75 or over.<br>

5. The proportions floated off pension credit are in relation to those who are projected to be in receipt of pension credit if the change in BSP had not occurred.<br>

6. The proportions that remain in receipt of guarantee credit are in relation to those who are projected to be in receipt of guarantee credit if the change in BSP had not occurred.<br>

7. The proportions that become eligible for savings credit are in relation to those who are projected to be in receipt of guarantee credit only, if the change in BSP had not occurred.<br>
