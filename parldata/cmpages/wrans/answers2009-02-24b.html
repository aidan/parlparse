<i> [holding answer 19 January 2009]:</i> We work hard to maintain and build links with our neighbours within the EU, both on a bilateral basis and through European Union institutions. The websites of our embassies to European neighbours such as Ireland, Germany and France detail recent developments on bilateral co-operation. Furthermore, through the EU we regularly meet with EU members at Prime Ministerial, ministerial and official level. The EU today is a unique partnership in which countries work closely together for the benefit of all their citizens, where collective and co-ordinated initiatives can be more effective than individual state action.</p>

The Egyptian efforts to embed the ceasefire and to bridge the divide in Palestinian politics are at the heart of improving the political situation. We strongly support their efforts.

 Following UK Parliament elections, certain election documents and records, including the marked register currently, must be sent to the relevant sheriff clerk for storage. After one year the records must be destroyed. Following a Scotland Office consultation last year, responsibility for the retention and supply of post-election documents and records for UK Parliament elections is to be transferred from sheriff clerks to returning officers. The amendment is being made through the Political Parties and Elections Bill currently before Parliament. This will bring Scotland more in to line with the arrangements in England and Wales as well as with the existing arrangements for local authority and European Parliament elections in Scotland.

 A fund for supporting rail services initially funded by local authorities and passenger transport executives (PTEs) will be formally established at the time the high level output specification for the period 2014-19 is published in 2012. As the fund has only just been announced, we have yet to receive representations from local authorities and therefore have no precise number of the projects likely to meet the Department for Transport&#146;s criteria for funding from this initiative in the period 2014-19. This fund does not include capital funding for projects. Local authorities and regions can already recommend to Ministers that regional funding allocations can be used for investment in rail schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_412"><a name="90224w0008.htm_para8"><a name="09022599000151">The accuracy of the local authority housing waiting list depends on the extent to which housing authorities keep the register up-to-date, e.g. some households might already have found housing, yet remain on the list. It is also important to bear in mind that not everyone on the waiting list will necessarily be in urgent housing need. It will also include those who consider social housing as their preferred choice, or one of a number of housing options, and those who decide to get onto the waiting list ladder before they need or want to move house&#151;particularly where the priority system is heavily based on waiting time.</p>

 To date, 17 Interim Empty Dwelling Management Orders (EDMOs) have been approved by the Residential Property Tribunal Service (RPTS) since the legislation came into effect in April 2006. However, local authorities claim that in many cases the threat of an EDMO has been sufficient to make owners take action to bring long-term empty homes back into use.</p>

We always intended that the legislation should be used only as a last resort where other measures have proved unsuccessful. We want to encourage voluntary re-occupation of empty homes but this can only work well where there is realistic compulsion to back them up. EDMOs provide this compulsion and should therefore be a key component of a comprehensive empty property strategy.</p>

The report lists 16 &#145;major developments&#146; (residential development of 10 dwellings or more, or other new building of 1,000 square meters or more) that were granted planning permission against Agency advice on flood risk.

 Last year the Government commissioned an independent review of the private rented sector from Julie Rugg and David Rhodes of the centre for housing policy in the university of York.

As part of its proposals to improve quality and professionalism within the sector, it recommended that letting and managing agents should be subject to mandatory, independently-led regulation. Such a regime would include independent redress for consumers and policing of the sector.

We also strongly support the continued process of greater market orientation of the CAP and the recent health check agreement will contribute to improved competitiveness by further reducing trade distorting coupled payments and the regulatory burden on farmers.</p>

<i> [holding answer 12 February 2009]:</i> I am very aware of the affordability issues faced by some customers, such as scout groups, following the switch to site area charging for surface water drainage by some companies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_474"><a name="90224w0014.htm_para12"><a name="09022599001852">Our view is that while the basic polluter pays principle of the guidance is correct, something is clearly very wrong if faith buildings, community amateur sports clubs and scout huts are facing such big increases in their bills, and where there are such marked variations between what is being charged in different areas, by different companies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_475"><a name="90224w0014.htm_para13"><a name="09022599001853">Under the powers enshrined in the Water Industry Act 1999, in 2000 the Government issued statutory guidance to Ofwat on water charging policy. Ofwat&#146;s subsequent and more detailed guidance to companies on surface water drainage charging was issued in 2003. Both of these documents addressed the issues surrounding the scale and pace of surface water bill changes for non-domestic, non-business customers and the need for charges to be based only upon the actual area within a property that drains to the public sewer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_476"><a name="90224w0014.htm_para14"><a name="09022599001854">We understand that the highest price increases are occurring in the United Utilities area, and that United Utilities now proposes to set its surface water drainage charges for 2009-10 at 2007-08 levels for customers such as faith buildings, community amateur sports clubs and scout huts (i.e. at levels prior to the introduction of site area charging). This is a very welcome step forward although we will continue to monitor this issue and engage further with Ofwat if necessary.</p>

This followed a call for expressions of interest from local authorities to undertake early implementation of surface water drainage improvements. The purpose of the work was to test new guidance for producing surface water management plans and report back findings by mid 2009.

The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV &#151; for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220.<br>

<i> Guide to quality</i><br>
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of a figure, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV&#151;for example, for an average of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population average to be within the range 180 to 220.<br>

<i> Guide to quality</i><br>
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of a figure, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV&#151;for example, for an average of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population average to be within the range 180 to 220.<br>

<i> [holding answer 9 February 2009]:</i> It is a key principle of Government funding of adult learning that there is a shared responsibility on the part of learners, employers and the Government to contribute towards the costs of learning. The Skills Strategy White Paper 21st Century Skills: Realising our Potential (published in July 2003) set out our intention that employers and learners should contribute towards the cost of their course, in light of the returns they derive from learning. Further Education: Raising Skills, Improving Life Chances (March 2006) confirmed our intention to increase learner and/or employer fee contributions to 50 per cent. by 2010-11 for those not eligible for free provision. Lord Leitch's Review of Skills (December 2006) reaffirmed the importance for a shared responsibility to invest in skills with employers and learners asked to contribute most where they see the greatest private returns. We are therefore increasing private fee contributions for both employers and learners from 42.5 per cent. in 2008-09, to 47.5 per cent. for 2009-10 and 50 per cent. for 2010-11.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_528"><a name="90224w0022.htm_para11"><a name="090225111002102">Apprenticeship funding rates for adults therefore are lower than rates for young people aged 16-18, with employers expected to contribute to the total cost of an adult apprenticeship framework. Employer contributions may be in cash to the training provider or in kind through supporting the delivery of the training activity.</p>

 Apprenticeship frameworks are designed to meet both the skills needs of employers and individuals. Like employment in general there is no presumption that they be full-time or part-time although custom and practice will differ between employers and across sectors. Any employee should be able to apply for an apprenticeship irrespective of whether they work full or part-time and we are making special efforts to break down gender or race stereotypes in apprenticeships. Our aim is to encourage the take-up of apprenticeships. The Government are committed to rebuilding apprenticeships. Since 1997 we have witnessed a renaissance in apprenticeships from a low point of 65,000 to a record 225,000 apprenticeship starts in 2007-08. Completion rates are also at a record high with 64 per cent. successfully completing an apprenticeship&#151;up from 27 per cent. in 1997. A remarkable achievement.</p>

2. These figures include FE, University for Industry, WBL (including apprenticeships, Entry to Employment), Train to Gain and Adult Safeguarded Learning.<br>
3. Final 2007/08 data will be published in March 2009.<br>
4. This table uses learner volumes as a measure for comparative purposes. Full-year numbers are a count of the number of learners that participated at any point during the year.<br>
5. Learners that are included in different data collections e.g. a learner undertaking an apprenticeship and a Train to Gain qualification, will be counted twice in this table.<br>
6. Local authority is based on the home postcode of the learner, for learners participating in England.<br>

 This Government were the first to introduce statutory support for part-time undergraduate students in 2000. In 2004/05 we introduced a package comprising two non-repayable, income assessed grants; a grant towards fee costs and a course grant to pay towards study costs such as travel and books. In 2006/07 we created the most generous package so far for part-time students in England, increasing the maximum fee grant by 27 per cent. and raising the income threshold for receiving support by more than the rate of inflation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_539"><a name="90224w0026.htm_para0"><a name="090225111003737">In the current academic year the maximum course grant is &#163;255 and the maximum fee grant is &#163;1,180. Single students with an annual household income of below &#163;16,090 may be eligible for full fee and course grants; those with incomes up to &#163;26,825 may be eligible for partial grants. These income thresholds are increased by &#163;2,000 if the student has one dependent child, by &#163;1,000 for each subsequent dependent child and by a further &#163;2,000 if the student lives with a partner. Additional discretionary support, via the Access to Learning Fund, administered by the higher education institutions, may also be available to help part-time undergraduates with their fees, child care and other costs.</p>

1. Regions are Government office regions. Data by region are available only from April 2004. Awards are recorded in the region where they are administered. Until January 2005, a small area of the East of England region was administered for social fund purposes from a district within the London region. Until March 2005, a small area of the East Midlands region was administered for social fund purposes from a district within the North West region.<br>
2. In recent years there have been many changes to the boundaries of Jobcentre Plus districts. In some cases, a district has been split and the parts merged with other districts. For the districts involved in such a situation it is not possible to give comparable data for the last five years. The last split took place in August 2006. Since then some districts have merged, so to provide data for the year 2007-08, it has been organised on the basis of the current Jobcentre Plus social fund budget area structure.<br>
3. Figures are for awards, not for the number of people who received an award. (Some people received more than one award.)<br>
4. Figures are for initial awards only. Awards made after review are not included.<br>
5. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10.<br>

This could be due to circumstances such as needing extra support, for example due to disability.</p>

 The &#163;150 million is revenue, not capital expenditure. It is being made available as part of primary care trusts&#146; (PCTs) overall general allocations. These are increasing by 5.5 per cent. in each of 2009-10 and 2010-11, a total increase of &#163;8.6 billion over the two years of which the dementia funding is part. PCTs have flexibility over the use of these resources in line with the operating framework. Total expenditure in each year on dementia, and on each of the 17 objectives that are not central budgets, will therefore be determined by the national health service locally. National estimates of expenditure on each objective are set out in the impact assessment published on the Department&#146;s website alongside the National Dementia Strategy.

The national health service (NHS) spent &#163;5.53 billion on these services in 2007-08, with real term investment increasing by 3.74 per cent. between 2006 to 2007 and 2007 to 2008.</p>

1. Surveillance of hepatitis B is based upon reports of confirmed acute hepatitis B received from laboratories in England. Since 2003, the completeness of data on whether hepatitis B infections are acute or chronic infection has decreased and therefore figures since then are not reliable. The HPA is working to improve the quality of information on acute hepatitis B reporting and provisional data for 2007 should be available later this year.<br>
2. Where fewer than five cases were reported for a category, the table indicates the number of cases reported as &lt;5 rather than the actual number in order to reduce the risk of deductive disclosure of an individual&#146;s identity.<br>

 The way to reduce the number of confirmed cases of measles recorded each year is to increase the number of children vaccinated with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_611"><a name="90224w0037.htm_para1"><a name="0902261002123">To support the campaign the Department has provided extra funding to primary care trusts (PCTs) with PCTs outside London having their funding limits increased by &#163;30,000 and London PCTs&#146; funding limits increased by &#163;60,000. The Department has also sourced additional supplies of vaccine, provided technical support to general practitioners to help them identify children who have not received the MMR vaccine and provided additional online reports to PCTs to help them monitor the effectiveness of their catch-up programmes. The Department has also sent all general practitioner surgeries new measles leaflets and posters.</p>

 The Government are committed to increasing the conviction rate for rape. In order to do so the Government have focussed their effort on improving the response of the criminal justice system by implementing changes to the ways in which the Police and Crown Prosecution Service investigate and prosecute such cases and by providing special measures in court to ensure that victims are confident to come forward and report an offence, and see it through to conviction.

 The data in the following tables shows spend on food and drink by supplier at the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) since its creation on 1 May 2007. The majority of spend is on food for use in HM Prison Service and includes food for resale to staff and catering for prisoners and staff. The remainder represents food for catering across other parts of the Ministry of Justice. 93.4 per cent. of Ministry of Justice spend on food in 2007-08 were through nationally contracted suppliers.</p>

 The requirement for an offender assessment (OAsys) to be completed within eight weeks of arrival applies to offenders received into an establishment following sentencing. As Gartree is a training prison, all prisoners received there should already have an up to date OASys assessment in place. However, Gartree did develop a backlog of OASys assessments that had not been reviewed for over three years and a recovery plan has been put in place to address. It is expected that annual reviews of all outstanding OASys plans will be completed by June 2009.</p>

<i> [holding answer 12 February 2009]:</i> The Department has made no assessment of the effect of the registration with the telephone preference scheme (TPS) on the ability of charities to raise funds through telephone appeals.

It is important to make sure that permission is given in advance to those companies and charities so they can continue to contact potential donors via the telephone.</p>

 In keeping with good procurement practice most consultancy engagements placed by DCSF are based on a requirement for the delivery of outcomes or outputs, and not for the number of people employed. Our management information system reflects this and records the numbers and values of contracts or engagements, rather than individual consultants. We are, therefore, unable to answer the question in the way it has been asked. However, the total number of live consultancy engagements in DCSF at the end of November 2008 was 329 and at the end of November 2007 was 202. The equivalent figure for the Department for Education and Skills at the end of November 2006 was 146. Figures were not kept centrally for previous years. The increase partly reflects the need for additional input from external experts on our delivery programmes (such as academies and contact point) and partly better recording as new systems we introduced in 2006-07 bedded in.</p>

 It is important that individuals, parents and schools should all take responsibility for improvements in educational standards. In fact this is essential if the nation is to get a proper return on the large and growing investment in education in the early years and in schools, colleges and universities. Education standards have risen greatly over the past decade, thanks in part to the partnership between the education system and the young people whom it exists to support, but there is more to do. The Children&#146;s Plan set out the Government&#146;s commitment to put children and young people, their families and their communities at the heart of everything we do. Partnership with parents is a unifying theme of the Children&#146;s Plan, and the chapter entitled &#147;Excellence and Equity&#148; sets out further steps the Government are taking to extend and deepen this partnership, and to respond to the views of pupils themselves. It is also vital to raise educational aspirations at both family and community level, and the recently announced cross-Government project &#147;Inspiring Communities&#148; is one example of how this vision is being carried forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_844"><a name="90224w0061.htm_para13"><a name="0902261005979">The Department's main source of information on children in care is the Children Looked After Survey, but this does not record which schools pupils attend. However, information on whether a pupil is in care is also collected via the School Census. The most recent census data relates to January 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_845"><a name="90224w0061.htm_para14"><a name="0902261005980">This census shows that there were 34,390 pupils aged five to 19 attending primary, secondary and special schools classed as being in care as at January 2008. Data published by the Department as SFR 23/2008: Children looked after in England (including adoption and care leavers) year ending 31 March 2008, shows 47,600 children aged between five and 19 as being looked after as at 31 March 2008. However the School Census does not cover all looked after children; information is not collected for pupils in alternative provision, including pupil referral units, FE colleges, voluntary provision and those not in education or training. These differences in coverage will explain the different counts to an extent, but it is possible that the School Census undercounts the number of looked after children in primary, secondary and special schools.</p>
