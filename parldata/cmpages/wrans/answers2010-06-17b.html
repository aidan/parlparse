1. Statistical Group is a hierarchical variable. A person who fits into more than one category will only appear in the top-most one for which they are eligible. For example a claimant of Disability Living Allowance and Jobseeker's Allowance would appear in "Job Seeker", not in "Disabled".<br>
2. From November 2008 the "incapacity benefits group" includes Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). ESA replaced Incapacity Benefit and Income Support paid on the grounds of incapacity for new claims from 27 October 2008. Prior to this the "incapacity benefits group" referred to claimants of Incapacity Benefit (including credits only) or Severe Disablement Allowance including people claiming Income Support on the grounds of incapacity.<br>
3. Caseload figures are rounded to the nearest 10. Percentages are rounded to one decimal place.<br>
4. Working Age Client Group data has been used as this excludes overlaps where people are in receipt of more than one benefit. Data published at:<br>

UK manufactured cars make up a relatively small proportion (around 16%) of the current GCS fleet, most of which comprises low carbon emission hybrid vehicles manufactured abroad. Changed rules for allocation of cars and the need to reduce the cost of operating the GCS mean that vehicle replacement is likely to be restricted in the immediate future, necessarily limiting the options for reconfiguring the fleet without incurring additional cost. For reasons of efficient and economic fleet management, it is not practical for Ministers to specify a particular vehicle or type of vehicle for a journey in a pool service car.</p>

The attached table provides estimates of migration by KU citizens, where the main reason is for work related reasons, for each year since 2004. These estimates are based on the International Passenger Survey (IPS). The IPS is a sample survey and cannot provide monthly estimates of migration.</p>
</ul><a name="100617w0008.htm_brev5"><a name="100617131000222"><ul><p class="tabletext">Please note that the migration estimates provided only cover those visiting or leaving the UK for periods of twelve months or more. They will therefore exclude those entering or leaving the UK for less than twelve months. Also note that not all those travelling for work related reasons will find work in the UK. Similarly, those who travel for other purposes may subsequently work.</p>
</ul><a name="100617w0008.htm_brev6"><a name="100617131000223"><ul><p class="tabletext">These estimates are of numbers of moves each year rather than numbers of people. For instance, an individual could enter in one year, leave just over a year later and then enter again a year after that. They would appear three times in this table.</p>

 As stated in the coalition's joint programme for Government, we will seek to introduce superfast broadband in remote areas at the same time as in more populated areas. On 8 June, the Secretary of State for Culture, the Olympics, Media and Sport set out the Government's plans for ensuring the UK has the best superfast broadband network in Europe by the end of the Parliament. These plans include enabling access to existing infrastructure to reduce the cost of deployment. Further, the Secretary of State proposed three market testing projects schemes for superfast broadband in rural areas. The Secretary of State's full speech can be read at:</p>

 There are no powers for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to recommend a minimum term under a life sentence imposed for murder. The determination of the minimum term is the responsibility of the judge in all cases.</p>

Under such a sentence, once half of the minimum term has been served the offender can apply for a review of the tariff. The review is conducted by the High Court and, in practice, the Secretary of State honours the recommendation made by the court in all cases.</p>

Sentences may be given at a court outside the prosecuting police force's area. Those prosecutions brought by agencies other than the police are categorised according to the criminal justice area of the sentencing court. As part of the rollout of the Libra case management system in magistrates courts during 2008, a change was made to the categorisation by area. Sentences given at courts using the Libra system are categorised according to the criminal justice area of the court while others are categorised in the same way as the Crown court. By the end of 2008, all magistrates courts were using Libra. Police forces do not prosecute minor offences (those that are sentenced at magistrates courts) outside their areas. Only around 0.01% of sentences at magistrates courts were affected in 2007 and 2008.<br>

In 2008 1.5% of offenders sentenced were recorded as sex 'Not Stated'. Direct comparisons by gender may be no longer be valid.<br>

1. These figures have been drawn from administrative data systems. Although care is taken when processing and analysing the returns, the detail collected is subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large scale recording system.<br>
2. This data has been taken from the Ministry of Justice Court Proceedings database. This data is presented on the principal offence basis. Where an offender has been sentenced for more than one offence the principal offence is the one for which the heaviest sentence was imposed. Where the same sentence has been imposed for two or more offences the principal offence is the one for which the statutory maximum is most severe.<br>

 I have decided to continue to operate the Critical Public Protection Case Notification Scheme and have recently written to all Members, inviting them to receive information about the release of particular offenders into their constituencies. The scheme allows for Members to be informed of the robust arrangements in place to manage those offenders on their release from custody and to make further enquiries. As the vast majority of such offenders are released initially into Approved Premises, formerly known as probation and bail hostels, notifications will mostly be sent to Members with an Approved Premises in their constituencies.</p>

 Integrated offender management (IOM) is developing locally as a partnership approach to the management and rehabilitation of offenders who cause the greatest harm in their area. Currently there is limited direct evidence to assess the effectiveness of IOM in reducing levels of reoffending, although it builds on offender based approaches such as local prolific and other priority offender schemes and the Drug Interventions Programme, for which there is positive indicative evidence of their impact on re-offending.
