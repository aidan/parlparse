<a name="91109w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Welsh: </B> 
To ask the Chairman of the Accommodation and Works Committee what are the estimated running costs for Portcullis House and the running costs in the latest year for which figures are available for 7 Millbank and Norman Shaw North and South.  [96726]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91109w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Sir Sydney Chapman </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 November 1999]:</i> The annual running costs for Portcullis House are estimated to be some &#163;3.6 million. This includes the cost of utilities, rates, cleaning and maintenance. Comparable figures for other buildings on the parliamentary estate for 1998-99 are; 7 Millbank--&#163;2.5 million and Norman Shaw North and South--&#163;1.3 million. The hon. Member will wish to note that Norman Shaw South is overdue for a major refurbishment, and therefore running costs have been somewhat curtailed in the last few years.

 The total cost of the refurbishment is &#163;882,000.

<P>
<a name="91109w01.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Fabricant: </B> 
To ask the Chairman of the Information Committee what arrangements have been made between the Library and the British Museum for the keeping of those parts of the Library's older book stock which are of antiquarian interest but which are seldom needed by hon. Members.  [97838]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91109w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Allan: </B> 
 The Library has a substantial number of books which were acquired when it was re-stocked after the fire of 1834. These volumes, often in fine bindings, are not often used by hon. Members but are of potential interest to scholars. I have been informed that the Librarian has signed an agreement with the Director of the British Museum which will mean that these books will be transferred on a long term loan to the care of the Museum, where they will be housed in the King's Library. This room was vacated when the British Library moved to its new St. Pancras building. The loan will mean that the books will be on display in a fine setting and that the Museum will be able to provide access by scholars, both its own staff and others. If any volumes are needed by hon. Members, the Library will be able to retrieve them, but it will not be responsible for the continuing care of the books and will gain the use of valuable storage space. The books will be transferred when the refurbishment of the King's Library is complete, which is expected to be in 2003.

<P>
<a name="91109w01.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the President of the Council on how many occasions, in each parliamentary session since 1992, Lords amendments to Bills which have been the subject of a motion moved in this House to disagree have been <i>(a)</i> rejected and <i>(b)</i> accepted by this House.  [97820]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91109w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 There appear to be no examples to category <i>(b)</i> in the period in question. The table gives details, according to the records, of Lords amendments disagreed to by this House since Session 1992-93. All were subject to motions to disagree except for one case in 1993-94, where a motion to agree with a Lords amendment to the Sunday Trading Bill was negatived on division.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the mechanism by which Her Majesty's Government can rescind participation in Schengen.  [97527]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91109w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union, annexed to the Treaties by the Treaty of Amsterdam, makes provision in Articles 4 and 5 for the participation of the United Kingdom in the Schengen acquis and in its development. Once the United Kingdom has chosen to participate, to that extent the normal arrangements of the Treaties apply, and it would not be possible to rescind participation. The United Kingdom is otherwise not bound by the Schengen acquis. My right hon. Friend, the Home Secretary, submitted on 26 May 1999, an application on behalf of the United Kingdom to participate in certain provisions of the Schengen acquis, a copy of which is available in the Library.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91109w01.htm_wqn6"><B> Sir Richard Body: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department from which elements of Schengen Information System data, in accordance with Section 13 of the Commission Opinion on the request by the UK to take part in certain provisions of the Schengen acquis, the Commission recommends the UK remain excluded from access.  [97522]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91109w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Commission Opinion refers to the need to study the feasibility of limiting the United Kingdom's access to data held under Article 96 of the Schengen Implementing Convention. This reflects the terms of the United Kingdom to participate in certain provisions of the Schengen acquis; we requested that we should be allowed not to enter or receive such data, which is related to the refusal of admission to third country nationals at the external frontier. This is because we are not seeking to participate in the external frontier control provisions of the Schengen acquis.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list for the latest period for which figures are available the number of people entering the UK from non-EU countries as visitors with permission to stay for up to six months; the proportion of these not permitted to pass immediately through passport control but subject to interview and the proportion of those interviewed refused entry.  [97445]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91109w01.htm_spnew7"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 All non-European Economic Area (EEA) passengers seeking entry as visitors are subject to interview to determine their admissibility under the immigration rules. In the 12 months from July 1998 to June 1999, some 8.2 million non-EEA nationals were granted leave to enter as visitors for up to six months. Information on persons seeking entry as visitors who were subject to further examination is available only for 13 of the largest ports. At these ports, 23,500 non-EEA visitors were subject to further examination in the 12-month period and of these, 68 per cent. (16,100) were refused leave to enter.

 The information requested is not available.
<P>

<a name="91109w01.htm_para0">The length of time involved in assessing a passenger's eligibility for entry varies considerably depending on the particular situation and on factors such as the availability of interpreters and sponsors, which are outside the control of the Immigration Officer.

<P>

 Staff in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) are required by the Immigration Rules to perform their duties without regard to the race, colour or religion of persons seeking to enter or remain in the United Kingdom. Staff dealing with applications are trained in racial and cultural awareness. All IND staff are in the process of receiving training in discrimination issues and equal opportunities. IND investigates all complaints by members of the public against IND staff, including complaints of racial and other unfair discrimination. The independent Complaints Audit Committee, appointed by my right hon. Friend, the Home Secretary, monitors the effectiveness of the procedures, and reports to him annually. Copies of these Reports are placed in the Library. The number of complaints of discrimination since 1995 are given in the table:

<a name="91109w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Secretary to the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) Standing Committee on the Disclosure of Convictions was notified at the same time as the concession was announced so that all Chief Police Officers could, in turn, be advised that the concession was operational. This is now being taken forward through ACPO procedures. ACPO's Standing Committee had previously agreed that immigration caseworkers could make written inquiries of the criminal records office of individual police headquarters about cautions for domestic violence. Referral forms and procedures were agreed with ACPO.

 The draft Freedom of Information Bill provides that all public authorities, including non-departmental public bodies, are required to disclose information they hold, subject to the conditions and exemptions set out in the draft Bill. Even where information is exempted information, the changes to the draft Bill which my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced in a reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, South (Mr. Pearson), <i>Official Report,</i> 21 October 1999, column <i>624</i>, will mean that a public authority will have to consider the public interest in disclosing information when considering whether to exercise the discretionary authority to disclose.

 <i>[holding answer 8 November 1999]:</i> Under the cinema licensing regime provided by the Cinemas Act 1985, local authorities have the power to determine whether particular films may be shown in cinemas in their area. I understand that local authorities generally require cinemas to abide by the classification certificate issued by the British Board of Film Classification and that decisions not to do so are rare. Records of their decisions are not held centrally.

<P>
<a name="91109w03.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 It is not Government policy at this time to seek to license the operators of animal sanctuaries, and there are no plans to change that. Animals in sanctuaries have the same protection against cruelty--afforded principally by the Protection of Animals Act 1911--as those in other privately run establishments. It is not considered that there is sufficient evidence of problems with sanctuaries across the country to warrant additional introduction of a statutory licensing regime.

We and all other member states have concluded that the APEC approach is selective and excludes sectors of importance to the EU. Our preference is to optimise market access within the framework of a comprehensive negotiation rather than accelerated sectoral liberalisation but we see no reason why sectoral agreements reached in the course of a comprehensive negotiation could not be implemented on a provisional basis prior to the formal conclusion of the New Round.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91109w04.htm_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The Government believe that small and medium-sized enterprises also have a contribution to make towards reducing greenhouse emissions. Their initial proposals for the climate change levy reflect Lord Marshall's conclusion that a tax could help improve energy efficiency in small and medium-sized enterprises. The Government are seeking to design and implement the levy in a way that maximises the environmental benefits, while at the same time safeguarding the competitiveness of business of all sizes.
<P>

<a name="91109w04.htm_para0">The Government have previously announced that &#163;50 million per annum of the anticipated revenues from the levy will be used to provide energy efficiency advice for business, including small and medium-sized enterprises; as well as for increased support for renewable sources of energy and a "carbon trust" to develop low carbon technologies. This represents a step change from previous levels of funding. The Government are preparing proposals on the details of these arrangements and expect to make further announcements in due course.

<P>
<a name="91109w04.htm_spnew1"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government aim to design the climate change levy in a way which safeguards the international competitiveness of UK business.
<P>

<a name="91109w04.htm_para1">The United Kingdom is not alone in having to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, nor in using economic instruments to do so. We expect that, on current projections, most OECD countries will have to introduce new measures of one kind or another in order to meet their Kyoto obligations. Governments are considering the policies and measures which they will need to deliver these commitments. This will take account of their various national circumstances, including existing fiscal regimes.

 A direction has been given to Burlington Resources (Irish Sea) Limited under section 14(3) of the Energy Act 1976 in response to their notice under section 14(1) of that Act to prevent the building of a 560 MW combined cycle gas turbine power station to be fuelled by natural gas at Rhosgoch, Anglesey. Although the scheme would make significant heat supplies available, these would not be sufficient to demonstrate the efficiency levels for combined heat and power set out in the October 1998 White Paper. As well as the benefits which would result from the heat utilisation, the project offers other distinct environmental benefits. However, taken together, I do not consider that these are sufficient in this instance to outweigh the Government's concern over new gas-fired generation.
<P>

<a name="91109w04.htm_para5">Consent, under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989, has not been granted to Kent Power Limited (Enron Europe Ltd.) for the construction and operation of a 1,200 MW combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power station on the Isle of Grain, Kent. The company's application will be put on hold unless a case is put forward for a decision to be taken now.
<P>

<a name="91109w04.htm_para6">I have taken these decisions in accordance with the policy set out in the White Paper entitled "Conclusions of the Review of Energy Sources for Power Generation and Government response to fourth and fifth Reports of the Trade and Industry Committee" (Cm 4071). I would be prepared to review these decisions, if requested, when the stricter consents policy announced in the White Paper is lifted.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many persons are employed in the opencast coal industry in <i>(a)</i> Scotland and <i>(b)</i> England; what is the annual output of the industry in each country; and what percentage of the output of each is used by power stations. [R] [97677]<P>

<P>
<a name="91109w04.htm_spnew7"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 At the end of March 1999, employment in the opencast coal industry (including contractors), as declared to the Coal Authority, was 1,301 in Scotland and 1,882 in England. Opencast output in the year to 31 March 1999 was 6.4 million tonnes in Scotland and 7.0 million tonnes in England.
<P>

<a name="91109w04.htm_para8">Information on the percentage of opencast output used in power stations is not readily available, but in 1998, 82 per cent. of all the coal produced in the United Kingdom by the five largest producers (one third of which was from opencast mining) was sold to power stations.

 <i>[holding answer 8 November 1999]:</i> The United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has responsibility for restoring municipal government in Kosovo. The United Kingdom is making a major contribution to UNMIK in terms of finance and personnel. One of the five UNMIK District Administrators in Kosovo is a British national. Four UK local government and two central government experts are working as part of the United Nations civil administration to advise and assist re-establishment of local government in Kosovo. One of the UK secondees, formerly involved in local government in Northern Ireland, has been appointed UN civil administrator for the city of Pristina.

 I would like to take this opportunity to clarify the oral answer I gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Mr. White) on 2 November 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>80</i>. The FCO takes no view as to the innocence or guilt of British nationals on trial overseas--that is a matter for the courts. International law does not allow the FCO to interfere in the judicial procedures of other sovereign states, just as we would not tolerate other countries interfering in our own judicial procedures.
<P>

<a name="91109w06.htm_para1">The FCO therefore cannot intervene in the trials of British nationals overseas. However, the FCO will do everything it can to ensure that such nationals have access to legal representation, and insist that they are treated as well as nationals of the countries concerned.

<P>
<a name="91109w07.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Under Council Regulation 3922-91 on the harmonisation of aviation technical standards the national aviation authorities of member states are required to be members of the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA). The Regulation also adopted some of the JAA's Joint Aviation Requirements (JARs) as the European Community's harmonised standard and established a procedure to adopt future JARs as the EC standard. Where a JAR has not yet been adopted under EC law, JAA member states implement them under national law and are obliged, under the JAA Arrangements, to use their best efforts to implement JARs by the due date. The JAR on Flight Crew Licensing (JAR-FCL) was adopted by the JAA in 1996 with an implementation date of 1 July 1999.
<P>

<a name="91109w07.htm_para0">JARs generally set standards that are compatible with those set by the International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO) under the terms of the Chicago Convention, but can introduce differences, so long as member states notify the differences to ICAO. In drawing up the JAR-FCL, the JAA determined that commercial pilots can safely be licensed to the age of sixty five, provided that only one pilot in a multi pilot aircraft may be over 60: this differs from the ICAO standard under which a person can only act as a pilot in command if they are under 60. The UK and most other JAA member states are, or are in the process of, applying this age limit. However, the French Authorities are continuing to apply the ICAO age limits within French airspace, although co-pilots up to the age of 65 are permitted. The UK has raised this matter both within the JAA and directly with the French authorities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91109w07.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Civil Aviation Authority is responsible for the safety regulation of UK registered aircraft and airlines. Under the Air Navigation Order UK airlines are required to report all in-flight occurrences which could affect the safety of the aircraft so that the CAA can monitor airline safety performance. The CAA review all such reports and publish a monthly summary. If a passenger has a concern about an in-flight incident on a UK airline they should take it up with the airline concerned in the first instance. If they are not happy with the response they should write to the CAA.
<P>

<a name="91109w07.htm_para3">The safety regulation of foreign airlines is primarily the responsibility of the State in which the airline is based. Foreign airlines operating to the UK are required to comply with the minimum standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation. When the Department receives a complaint from a passenger which indicates that a foreign airline operating to the UK is not complying with ICAO standards we will follow the matter up with the airline concerned, or its regulatory authority.

<a name="91109w07.htm_spnew7"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Our regional agenda, set out in the 1997 White Paper "Building Partnerships for Prosperity" is based on a number of principles. These include the need for regional structures to be based on partnership, with each local or regional interest being able to contribute effectively towards an integrated and coherent strategic programme which commands general support. We have, therefore, asked the RDAs to proceed in dialogue with regional partners--local authorities and the private and voluntary sectors--and work to secure the support of regional interests.
<P>

<a name="91109w07.htm_para5">Successful implementation of RDA strategies will mean genuine partnership working in the regions since it will involve co-ordination and coherence in policy and across programmes.

 We believe that most of the actions we are seeking from service providers can be achieved on a voluntary basis, except that home buyers' searches will probably need to be put on a statutory footing. However, sellers' information packs will need to be made compulsory to ensure that everyone benefits from them. The surveyor will be liable both to the seller and the buyer for the House Condition Report which will be part of the seller's information pack. These changes will require legislation and we plan to do this as soon as a suitable opportunity arises.

In the event, official delegations from over 50 countries attended and the final cost remains to be established, although we do not anticipate it will exceed the estimated figure. In addition, the Defence Export Services Organisation (DESO) organised a British Army Demonstration Area at the exhibition which featured a range of UK equipment; the estimated direct cost of this was &#163;108,000. MOD officials and military personnel carried out activities associated with the exhibition as part of their duties, but these costs could be fully identified only at disproportionate cost. A number of MOD Agencies and organisations also participated at the exhibition, the costs for which are not held centrally. MOD support for future exhibitions will be considered in the light of our experience of this year's DSEi and plans for 2001.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91109w08.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The MOD holds information on those Gulf veterans who were referred by their Service Medical Officer or GP for assessment at the MOD's Gulf Veterans Medical Assessment Programme (MAP). Since its establishment in October 1993 and up to 4 November 1999, the MAP has seen 2,893 patients. Of these, 2,283 have had their clinical findings recorded on the MAP database. Of the 2,283, 214 Gulf veterans have a recorded diagnosis of PTSD confirmed by a consultant psychiatrist. Of the 214 patients, the number still suffering from PTSD is not known since the MAP does not routinely monitor their health status nor is it responsible for providing treatment. As the veterans assessed by the programme were all self-selected, these figures cannot be used to determine the extent of PTSD in Gulf veterans as a whole. I will write to the right hon. and learned Gentlemen with information on the prevalence of PTSD in the remaining MAP patients who were seen up to 4 November once their medical notes have been reviewed and catalogued.
<P>

<a name="91109w08.htm_para1">However, the MOD does not keep a central record of all diagnoses made on currently serving personnel. Responsibility for the health of ex-service personnel, if resident in the UK, lies with the NHS which similarly does not keep a central record on all diagnoses. Neither does the NHS routinely communicate diagnostic information to the MOD. No arrangements are in place to monitor the health of ex-service personnel living overseas. Therefore, the total number of service people on active service in 1990-91 or of Gulf veterans suffering from PTSD is not known.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91109w09.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 November 1999]:</i> Volunteer reserve units from all the Services are held at readiness levels appropriate to their role. In the case of the Territorial Army, this varies from 30 days to 24 months. Following call out, a unit would be required to undergo a period of training before deployment on operations. Individual Territorial Army members called out to serve with the Regular Army are trained at the Reserves Training and Mobilisation Centre and then deployed to theatre. Royal Naval Reserve personnel, when mobilised, are deployed as individuals to augment regular units rather than in formed units. It is anticipated that the majority of RNR personnel would be ready to deploy within 30 days of receipt of their call out notice. RAF Planning assumptions also provide for individual reservists to be ready for deployment within 30 days of call out. Operational requirements may necessitate reduced periods of notice and training, and planning is carried out for such contingencies.
<P>

<a name="91109w09.htm_para0">High Readiness Reserves largely drawn from the Territorial Army, have accepted an enhanced liability for call out for permanent service, and in most cases are held at seven days notice to report for duty.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91109w09.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2092/91 provides that as a general rule for organic products, except for perennial crops, the conversion period for the land should be two years before the first planting of a crop to be sold as organic. In the case of perennial crops the period is three years before the first harvest of products to be sold as organic. However, these periods may be varied, having regard to the previous use of the land.
<P>

<a name="91109w09.htm_para11">In the UK the majority of conversions will extend over the full periods prescribed by Regulation 2092/91. However, shorter periods are sometimes agreed by the control body (the UK Register of Organic Food Standards) in cases where there is clear evidence that prohibited inputs have not been used on the land (e.g. the land has been subject to an environmental scheme which prohibits such inputs). Other member states are subject to the same Regulation and operate similar rules.

 MAFF officials on duty at Dover docks have instructions to follow on any occasion when a vessel operator intends to carry livestock for slaughter or further fattening when wind conditions are forecast to reach Force 7 or more during the voyage, and/or the sea state is forecast as rough or worse. These instructions require them to discuss with the master of the vessel his legal obligation to consider if the animals are likely to be caused injury or unnecessary suffering due to adverse weather or sea conditions likely to be encountered during the voyage. If the master decides to sail but our staff have grounds to consider that animals may suffer, they have the legal powers to prevent him from transporting the animals.

Since the beginning of this century, social background has been linked to party affiliation. This has been supported by successive Lord Chancellors. This Government are not, however, convinced that political balance is an adequate proxy and an alternative is being sought.

 <i>[holding answer 3 November 1999]:</i> The training of magistrates is the responsibility of the magistrates courts committees within a framework approved by the Lord Chancellor. Magistrates must acquire specified competences necessary to perform their role, some of which relate to motoring offences. Magistrates also have access to detailed sentencing guidelines, produced by the Magistrates Association, some of which are specific to traffic offences. Magistrates are made aware of the availability of national and local initiatives which are designed to re-educate motoring offenders.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department when he expects to respond <i>(a)</i> to the Law Commission's report of March 1998 on liability for psychiatric illness and <i>(b)</i> to the Law Commission's report of December 1997 on aggravated and exemplary damages.  [97540]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91109w11.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 I am pleased to be able to announce that the Government accept the recommendations on aggravated and restitutionary damages that the Law Commission made in "Aggravated, Exemplary and Restitutionary Damages" (Law Com Rep No. 247). They will legislate when a suitable legislative opportunity arises.
<P>

<a name="91109w11.htm_para0">This Report also made recommendations for legislation on exemplary, or punitive, damages. The Government are grateful to the Law Commission for its important and painstaking work on this subject, and to those who expressed their views during the Law Commission's consultation exercises on the topic. The contending arguments for a complete legislative overhaul of exemplary damages, as recommended by the Law Commission, or abolition as preferred by many commentators, are finely balanced. In the absence of a clear consensus on the issue the Government have decided not to take forward the Law Commission's proposals for legislation on exemplary damages. It may be that some further judicial development of the law in this area might help clarify the issues.
<P>

<a name="91109w11.htm_para1">The Government have carefully considered the Law Commission's recommendations in its Report on "Liability for Psychiatric Illness" (Law Com Rep No. 249). They believe that it would be worthwhile to undertake a comprehensive assessment of the individual and aggregate effects of the proposals for legislation that are contained in this Report and "Damages for Personal Injury: Medical, Nursing and Other Expenses; Collateral Benefits" (Law Com Rep No. 262) and "Claims for Wrongful Death" (Law Com Rep No. 263). I have asked my officials to undertake the assessment in co-ordination with officials from the other Departments which have an interest in the outcome. It is hoped that the full assessment 



<P>
<P><I>9 Nov 1999 : Column: 503</I><P>
will be available to inform the Government's final decision on the Law Commission's proposals early next year.
<P>

<a name="91109w11.htm_para2">This assessment is only concerned with those Reports which recommend legislation concerning eligibility for damages and the size of damages awards. It will not consider "Damages for Personal Injury: Non-Pecuniary Loss (Law Commission Report No. 257)", in which the Law Commission offers opinions of which the courts are free to take such account, if any, as they choose in the assessment of damages. This is an area of law which is in the courts' independent sphere and where the Government have no plans to legislate.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>During 1998/99 28,073 complaints were received by the Agency, 1,536 (5.18%) were received by ICE and 45 (0.15%) were accepted by the Ombudsman for full investigation, a total of 29,654. This total includes cases double counted where they were first dealt with by CSA and then by ICE/Ombudsman.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It may be of interest to note that the 28,073 complaints received by CSA represents a 0.7% increase over the previous year. However, our caseload increased by 22% to 923,960. As a percentage of caseload the complaints rate for the year reduced by 17%.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>ICE have 195 cases awaiting investigation and, if intake levels remain unchanged, they would expect this number to reduce to around 50 by March 2000. I cannot answer the part of your question about the Ombudsman's backlog, if indeed there is one, because that

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>46 staff are currently employed by ICE, of which 38 are engaged in investigation work. There are no plans to recruit additional staff.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I have attached a month by month breakdown of the numbers of complaints received by ICE. It is clear from this that the first six months of ICE operation were unrepresentative.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>No records are held which would allow your question about clearance times to be fully answered without revisiting all cases to extract the information required. However, ICE do record the time taken from receipt of a complaint in the ICE office. Up to the end of September 1999 the average clearance time for a complaint is 29.8 weeks.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A process was introduced in 1998/99 which allows appropriate cases to be identified and referred to the Child Support Agency for early resolution of the problem by taking prompt action. Thus negating the need for a full investigation by ICE. One effect of this initiative is to lengthen the average time taken to resolve those complaints where early resolution proved impossible and full investigation was needed.</FONT></UL>

 The detailed proposals for Scotland were based on recommendations by the Scottish Executive, prepared in close consultation with my department.

<P>
<a name="91109w12.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Proposed new assisted areas announced in July provide continuing coverage for locations which account for a very high proportion of regional selective assistance awarded over recent years. Proposals for Objective 2 coverage put forward in October represent a fair balance between pressing needs in urban and rural Scotland, while transitional funding will be available for areas no longer covered by Objective 2 and Objective 5b. In each case the outcome should minimise any economic impact of the overall reduction in coverage being imposed for the period from January 2000.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS), I have been asked to reply to your recent question on average gross weekly household income for each county in England, for the latest available year.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The latest figures published by the ONS for household income by <i>county</i> are for 1995 and were published in Table 9 of "Regional Accounts 1995: part 2, Economic Trends no. 535, June 1998". Estimates for household income by <i>region</i>, up to 1997, were published in "Regional Accounts 1997: part 2, Economic Trends no. 551, October 1999". Both of these publications are available in the House of Commons Library. <i>Sub-regional</i> estimates of household income in the future will be based on different geographies, owing largely to the reorganisation of local government throughout Great Britain. The first estimates on this basis will be published in the first half of 2000, and will include data for more recent years.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The figures available relate to the income of the household sector, as defined for the purposes of national and regional accounts. In addition to private households, this includes charities, voluntary and other non-profit organisations, and quasi-corporations.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The published figures are normally presented in terms of total annual household income per head of population. The 1995 total income estimates figures, converted to weekly averages for all English counties, are given in the attached table.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what estimate he has made of the value of <i>(a)</i> fixed assets, property and land and <i>(b)</i> moveable assets owned by the Government and its agencies (i) in the United Kingdom and (ii) in Scotland.  [97296]<P>

<P>
<a name="91109w15.htm_spnew4"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Office for National Statistics recently estimated the market value of United Kingdom public sector, tangible, non-financial assets at 31 December 1998 to be &#163;483.3 billion. Of this, &#163;450.3 billion represents land and property and &#163;33 billion represents movable assets (including stocks). These estimates are published in the November edition of Economic Trends (pages 53-68). The figures are provisional and not yet formally part of the National Accounts but updated numbers are expected to be published in the 2000 edition of the National Accounts Blue Book. Separate figures for Scotland are not available.
<P>

<a name="91109w15.htm_para1">In addition, the National Asset Register, published in November 1997, lists all central government owned assets by Department, including the then Scottish Office, without valuations. Departments are preparing balance sheets as part of the move to Resource Accounting and Budgeting.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91109w15.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 We do not have information for May 1997 but in January 1997 there were 1,020 pupils in Key Stage 2 in classes of 41 or more, in January 1998 there were 2,390, and in January 1999 there were 1,690. Primary class sizes, including those at Key Stage 2, rose consistently under the previous administration from 1988 to 1998, reflecting the spending decisions and priorities of the time. Between January 1998 and January 1999, reflecting the first budget of this administration, the number of primary pupils in classes over 30 fell from 1,411,366 to 1,278,607 and new figures for Key Stage 1 will be published shortly. The proportion of children in Key Stage 2 classes over 30 fell from 40 per cent. to 39 per cent. between January 1998 and January 1999. This information was published in the statistical volume "Statistics of Education Schools in England" earlier this year, copies of which have been placed in the Library.

 We have published the following information on numbers of pupils in maintained schools in England taught by one teacher in classes of over 31 pupils and of over 41 in the statistical volume "Statistics of Education Schools in England", copies of which have been placed in the Library. We do not have information for May 1997, so we have given in the table the position in both January 1997 and January 1998. Primary and secondary class sizes rose consistently under the previous Administration from 1988 to 1998, reflecting the spending decisions and priorities of the time. The fall in the number of pupils in large classes in 1999 follows the first budget of this Administration.

<a name="91109w15.htm_para2">The average secondary class remains 6 smaller than the average primary class. Most secondary classes are subject related and these figures do not reflect the varied size of different sets and subject related classes. The Government, in line with Ofsted evidence and most experts, believe that they should concentrate resources on reducing infant class sizes where the numbers in classes over 30 are expected to have fallen from 477,000 in 1997 to below 200,000 in September 1999.

 The information requested for May 1997 is not available. In 1999, there were a total of 309 pupils in nursery classes of 41 or more where the Annual School Census reported there was one teacher and no other adult. In all cases, they were involved in activities such as PE, games, drama, music, watching TV or listening to the radio. There were no cases of normal nursery classes with a single teacher in charge of more than 40 pupils.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, pursuant to his letter of 27 October to the hon. Member for Hertsmere on infant class sizes, if he will break down the figure of 6,000 extra teachers according to type of school indicating the overall net change in the number of teachers taking account of teachers who leave the profession.  [96771]<P>

<P>
<a name="91109w15.htm_spnew9"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Revenue grant is allocated to Local Education Authorities on condition that it is used to employ the additional teachers set out in their approved class size plans. It is for LEAs, in consultation with their schools, to draw up their plans and to determine exactly how they should be implemented. We do not therefore hold precise information breaking down the additional teachers by type of school, but approximately 60 per cent. of teachers will be employed in Community schools, 25 per cent. in VA schools, 2 per cent. in Foundation schools and the remainder in VC schools: broadly in line with the number of primary schools in each category.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, pursuant to the answer of 3 November 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>201</i>, on class sizes in primary schools, what factors underlay his decision to restrict the collection of data to classes for five, six and seven-year-olds.

<P>
<a name="91109w15.htm_spnew10"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The September Class Size Count is designed specifically to monitor the implementation of our Infant Class Size Pledge. It also keeps to a minimum any data collection burden placed on schools and local education authorities at a very busy time of year for them.
<P>

<a name="91109w15.htm_para4">Good quality monitoring information is essential to the effective implementation of the Pledge, to ensure that local education authorities are carrying out their class size plans as agreed, to enable the Government to support local education authorities effectively as they do so, to inform the allocation of funding and to help to ensure that good value for public funds is achieved. The results of the count also enable us to take further action quickly at the start of the school year to promote the implementation of the pledge, if this is necessary. Since more comprehensive

information from the Annual School Census is not generally available until April, it does not serve these immediate purposes.
<P>

<a name="91109w15.htm_para5">Partly as a result of effective monitoring of the pledge, the Government is on target to achieve its target that no 5, 6 or 7 year old should be in an infant class of more than 30 children in virtually all schools by September 2000--18 months ahead of schedule. This September, there were 181,000 children in large infant classes, as compared to 354,000 in September 1998.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will publish a list of assets sold by his Department and their value, by item, in each year since 1991-92; and if he will estimate the value of sales planned for <i>(a)</i> 1999-2000 and <i>(b)</i> 2000-01.  [95645]<P>

 <i>[holding answer 8 November 1999]:</i> The publication of a list of assets sold by the Department and their value, by item in each year since 1991-92 cannot be supplied except at a disproportionate cost to the Department. We can however supply details of total value of asset by type from 1991-92 to 1996-97 and the latter part of 1998-99 (see Table 1). Details for 1997-98 and 1998-99 up to December 1998 were given in the reply by my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie) on 23 February 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>278-81</i>.
<P>

<a name="91109w16.htm_para0">The estimate of the value of sales planned for 1999-2000 and 2000-01 is shown in Table 2. Tables 1 and 2 set out the information for the Department and exclude non departmental public bodies and local education authorities.

 The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment visited the Barking Remploy factory on 26 March 1999 and the Southampton Remploy factory on 10 May 1999. When she was at Southampton the Minister also met Remploy Interwork employees at their placements. In addition she has visited the Newco factory in Central London which provides supported employment for disabled people. She also receives regular feedback from senior Employment Service officials on their factory visits.

<a name="91109w16.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The Teacher Training Agency (TTA) withdraws accreditation from teacher training institutions whose quality is judged by Ofsted to be unsatisfactory. Where this happens, the training places and funding are withdrawn and reallocated to high quality providers. Therefore, there should be no reduction in the number of trainees in the system as a whole, and no impact on overall numbers of primary and secondary teachers completing initial teacher training courses. The work of the TTA in improving the quality of initial teacher training is crucial to the Government's standards agenda.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what appeal procedures will be available to teachers who are dissatisfied with their assessment under performance-related pay.  [97937]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91109w16.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Under the proposed arrangements for the new performance threshold, heads would assess teachers against the threshold standards. Accredited external assessors would work with heads to ensure national consistency. There will be no appeals against individual threshold decisions, but unsuccessful teachers will be able to re-apply each year.
<P>

<a name="91109w16.htm_para1">It is envisaged that headteachers would be responsible for reviewing the outcomes of teachers' annual performance reviews, and that where governing bodies make decisions about discretionary pay awards to teachers, these would be informed by the outcome of performance reviews. The governing body would continue to have statutory responsibility for pay decisions and it is envisaged that appeals will continue to be dealt with under schools' grievance procedures.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91109w16.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is currently consulting on the detail of the new performance review arrangements, including the agreeing of objectives for classroom teachers. We are proposing that teacher objectives should cover pupil progress and ways of improving teachers' professional practice, including professional development. Objectives would be internal, individual and agreed with teach leaders to reflect the particular circumstances of each school. Where governing bodies make decisions about discretionary pay awards to teachers, these would be informed by the outcome of performance reviews.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91109w16.htm_wqn7"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91109w16.htm_spnew7"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The draft Performance Management Framework builds on existing good practice in schools, reinforcing current monitoring and evaluation work, and giving headteachers and line managers the tools to manage their staff effectively. Once implemented, the new arrangements will be an integral part of the management of schools. Headteachers, in common with teachers and governors, will be supported through training and guidance in all elements of the operation of the new arrangements. &#163;20 million will be available to schools via the Standards Fund Performance Management and Threshold Training Grant to support their individual training needs. The Government are also considering arrangements for other aspects of ensuring quality such as advisers to governing bodies on heads' review and assessors for the proposed performance threshold.

<P>
<a name="91109w16.htm_spnew8"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 It is for teachers to decide whether to apply for the performance threshold. 250,000 teachers will be eligible to apply to cross the threshold at its inception next year. An additional 20,000 teachers are expected to become eligible to apply in each subsequent year. We have no set expectations of the numbers but we have made it clear that there is no quota. Over time we expect a majority of teachers to cross the threshold.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91109w16.htm_wqn9"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what plans he has to make additional funding available to <i>(a)</i> local education authorities and <i>(b)</i> individual schools with an above average number of teachers achieving threshold success following the implementation of performance-related pay.  [97931]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91109w16.htm_spnew9"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 We will establish a Special Grant to target resources for the performance threshold separate from schools' delegated budgets. All teachers assessed as meeting the national threshold standards will gain an immediate salary increase and access to an upper pay spine. Schools will be able to draw extra funds from the Special Grant via their local education authority for each teacher promoted through the threshold to the upper pay spine.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91109w16.htm_wqn10"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what assessment he has made of the effect on education spending of introducing performance-related pay over <i>(a)</i> the next three years, <i>(b)</i> the next five years and <i>(c)</i> the next ten years.  [97934]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91109w16.htm_spnew10"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B>

These rights are enshrined in the Employment Rights Act 1996. In addition head teachers, along with other school staff, enjoy a further statutory protection under the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 and the Education (School Government) (England) Regulations 1999. These provide for the governing body of a maintained school to make arrangements for giving any person whom they propose to dismiss an opportunity of making representations to a committee of governors taking the decision, and to afford an opportunity of appealing against a dismissal decision to a separate committee of governors.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91109w17.htm_spnew8"><B> Ms Estelle Morris </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 November 1999]:</i> The current system for dealing with admission appeals began on 1 September, when we also published statutory guidance in the new Code of Practice on School Admission Appeals. The first set of figures for appeals under this system, for the year ending August 2000, will be available in July 2001. The latest available statistics on admission appeals for 1997-98 by Local Education Authority can be found in Statistical First Release 19/1999, Admission Appeals for Maintained Primary and Secondary Schools by Local Education Authority area in England 1997-98, a copy of which is in the Library.

<P>

<a name="91109w17.htm_para19">Surplus places figures are collected annually providing a summary of the level of surplus as at January of that year. For the position as at January 1998 I refer the hon. Member to the reply given to the hon. Member for Rochdale (Lorna Fitzsimons) on the 4 February 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>709-14</i>. New figures as at January 1999 will be published shortly and copies will be placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="91109w17.htm_para20">Under the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, the Local Education Authority is the admission authority for community and voluntary controlled schools. Foundation and voluntary aided schools are responsible for their own admissions. The Act ensures that admissions authorities consult with each other within the relevant area. Where there are disputes, these are a matter for the Schools Adjudicator rather than the Local Education Authority. The Local Education Authority is required to provide parents with a booklet setting out the details of all the admissions policies of schools in their area in order to help parents choose their preferred school.
<P>

<a name="91109w17.htm_para21">Headteachers and Local Education Authorities are encouraged to work together in local admissions forums to discuss admission arrangements and develop a common timetable to assist parents. Many Local Education Authorities have already established Admissions Forums, and many more have plans to do so.
