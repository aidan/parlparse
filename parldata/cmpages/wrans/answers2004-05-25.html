<p><a name="40525w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 The recent performance of the Scottish economy offers grounds for encouragement. The labour market continues to improve, with employment at its highest level since records began in 1992 <sup>1</sup>  and unemployment around its lowest level since the 1970s. Interest rates and inflation are historically low. The Scottish Executive&#039;s GDP index, recently revised to better reflect real changes in the economy, shows that growth in Scotland has closely matched that of the UK in recent years. Business surveys are pointing to a continued strengthening of business activity in Scotland in both services and manufacturing and independent forecasters predict that growth will continue to be above-trend in 2004 and 2005. But there is no room for complacency. The Government and Scottish Executive recognise that Scotland&#039;s growth has been lower over the long-term than the UK average. They have each taken steps to promote productivity and build a more enterprising, innovative and highly skilled economy.

 My right hon. Friend&#039;s view is that, while assistance with the cost of school visits is an option that the House of Commons Commission might wish to consider, the priority is to make a substantial improvement to the learning resources we provide via the parliamentary website. We have some 7,500 educational visitors a year&#151;a figure which I hope we can increase significantly and a further 36,000 schoolchildren visit on constituency tours; but it will always be a minority of schoolchildren who are able to visit in person.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for what reason the target for energy efficiency savings to 2010 from households has been lowered in the energy efficiency saving plan.  [171778]</p>








<p><a name="40525w03.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 In &quot;Energy Efficiency: The Government&#039;s Plan for Action&quot; the Government set out their aim to deliver savings in households of 4.2&nbsp;million tonnes of carbon per annum by 2010. The figure of 5&nbsp;million tonnes of carbon in the Energy White Paper was an initial indication of what might be delivered. This projection has been revised as the Government have obtained more up-to-date information and completed more detailed analysis on the cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency policies and measures in this sector. The change in carbon savings in households reflects the fact that:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">growth in demand for insulation may be slower than originally envisaged;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&#039;comfort taking&#039; (after the installation of measures) may be higher in 2010 than previously thought, and</p>

<p>
<a name="40525w03.html_para4">
Latest revisions of projected carbon savings from other sectors more than offset this recalculation. The Action Plan sets out how the Government aim to cut carbon emissions by 12&nbsp;million tonnes of carbon per annum by 2010 through energy efficiency over the next six years. This is 20&nbsp;per cent. more than the 10&nbsp;million tonnes of carbon per annum by 2010 we said we expected to achieve in the Energy White Paper a year ago.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what predictive modelling has been applied to the possible application of the Bovigam gamma interferon test to control bovine TB under different bovine TB scenarios in the UK, using&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bovigam&#039;s known levels of specificity and sensitivity.  [172564]</p>








<p><a name="40525w03.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Since 1997, DEFRA has commissioned two studies to evaluate the costs and benefits of using the Bovigam gamma interferon test to control bovine TB under different bovine TB scenarios in Great Britain. In carrying out the two economic assessments, predictive modelling was used to determine the likely outcomes under different bovine TB scenarios. The models used values for the specificity and sensitivity of the gamma interferon test published in the scientific literature from overseas field trials.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40525w03.html_para5">
Project SE3018 investigated whether it would be cost-effective to use the gamma interferon test in herds with multiple tuberculin reactor animals. As the gamma interferon test is considered more sensitive than the skin test, its use in infected herds could improve the detection of tuberculous cattle. This would hasten the elimination of infection from herds and reduce the spread of infection among herds. However, this benefit has to be weighed against the extra cost that would result from the unnecessary slaughter of more non-tuberculous cattle due to the lower specificity of the gamma interferon test.

 We sympathise with the desire of the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISG) to maximise the science return of the gamma-interferon field pilot.

<p><a name="40525w05.html_spnew4"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The pilot Entry Level Scheme is an agri-environment scheme that provides payment for good land management. The scheme is being piloted in four areas in England and has proved popular with farmers with a total of 271 agreements that started in August 2003. The Government has announced its intention to roll out the Entry Level Environmental Stewardship Scheme across England, as part of the England Rural Development Programme, using funding generated through modulation.

There is a separate Vocational Training Scheme, which is also part of the England Rural Development Programme. Under current ED rules, it does not involve modulation funding.

 In line with the Government&#039;s overarching commitment, Departments need to consider all aspects of sustainable development when entering into new PFI/PPP contracts. By taking a long term view, PFI/PPPs require an assessment of whole life costs and can promote a more efficient use of resources.

In July 2002, the Department together with ODPM, OGC and DfT jointly issued a guidance note, Green Public Private Partnerships, on how to include environmental considerations within PFI and PPP projects.

<p><a name="40525w07.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Climate Change Agreements are agreements with energy intensive industry through which participants pay a reduced rate of climate change levy in return for meeting challenging energy efficiency targets between 2002 and 2010. The agreements provide for an adjustment to the targets up to 2006 to take account of changes in product mix and output which can increase the energy used per unit of output. The concession lasts only until 2006 because we enter into the Kyoto period in 2008, the date of the next target assessment. The Government must deliver on their commitment to make absolute reductions on CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions in the Kyoto period, and there must be increased certainty of the contribution to be made from each of the UK&#039;s Climate Change Programme policies. Parties to Climate Change Agreements should take the energy use implications of changes in products, and how this will affect their ability to meet their targets, into account when making commercial decisions. The UK Emissions Trading Scheme is available for companies to buy allowances to meet their targets if they wish to produce more energy intensive products. There has been no assessment of the effects on UK salt manufacturers.

<p><a name="40525w08.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the future profitability of farms following the introduction of the single farm payments scheme.  [173691]</p>








<p><a name="40525w08.html_spnew0"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Single Payment will decouple direct subsidies from the type or level of production. This will encourage farmers to respond to market signals rather than produce according to individual subsidy regimes. Decoupling payments from production is expected to lead to higher farm prices and consequently higher farm incomes. Defra economists estimate that overall, UK farm incomes will increase by around 5&nbsp;per cent. of the forecast Total Income from Farming for 2003. This is an aggregate figure and the change in farm profitability will vary between different farm types and sizes. Further information can be found in the Economic Position of the Farming Industry report published on the Defra website at http://statistics.defra.gov.uk/esg/reports/repfi.pdf.

<p><a name="40525w08.html_spnew1"><b> Alun Michael: </b>

 The &quot;Groundwater Protection Code: Petrol Stations and Fuel Dispensing Underground Storage Tanks&quot;, was published by DEFRA in 2002.

<p><a name="40525w13.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 Reliable figures for the number of refugees in Chad are difficult to find because of the inaccessibility of the areas affected. Agencies on the ground are constantly reviewing their estimates. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) press statement on 14&nbsp;May 2004 estimated that there were 120,000 Darfurian refugees in Chad. Refugees International estimated on 19&nbsp;May that the number could be nearer 200,000.

The UK is heavily engaged in the humanitarian response to this crisis. DFID is the second largest donor after the US and so far has committed over &#163;16.5&nbsp;million to agencies working in Darfur and Eastern Chad. A breakdown of these commitments is given below. In addition, DFID has seconded four humanitarian officers to support United Nations Office for the Co-Ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)&#039;s response to the crisis in Darfur and are seconding an additional three for the UN Joint Logistics Centre. DFID is also paying for a despatch of non-food items (22,500 blankets and 15,000 plastic sheets) for distribution by humanitarian agencies.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what representations he has made to the Government of Zimbabwe about its&nbsp;stockpiling of food in the run-up to national elections.  [174777]</p>








<p><a name="40525w13.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 Although the Government of Zimbabwe (GoZ) provides little information about the activities of the parastatal Grain Marketing Board (GMB), donors believe that current GMB stocks are less than 100&nbsp;thousand metric tonnes (MT), compared with a national food requirement of up to 1.8&nbsp;million MT. GMB will build up its stocks in coming months as the harvest comes in, which is appropriate. Donors are particularly concerned about the dishonesty of the GoZ in declaring that the current harvest is in the order of 2.4&nbsp;million MT and that Zimbabwe will be self-sufficient in food for the coming year, as confirmed by Robert Mugabe in a television interview this week.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40525w13.html_para2">
The GoZ cancelled a Crop and Food Supply Assessment that was recently in progress jointly with the World Food Programme and Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN, which would have provided an independent figure. Other recent studies suggest the actual harvest to be at or below 1.2&nbsp;million MT. Donors are concerned that the GoZ is trying to control food supply in the country in the run-up to parliamentary elections next year, pretending that land reform has 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>25 May 2004 : Column 1521W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
been successful. Apart from deceiving its population, the GoZ is putting many of them at great risk of hunger later in the year, while probably needing to divert a substantial amount of its scarce foreign exchange to import grains.

It is important that universities, as autonomous bodies, ensure that their admission decisions are professional, fair and transparent.

In inviting bids to expand medical school places in September 2000, the Department of Health and the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) asked institutions to provide data relating to the following factors pertaining to social and ethnic backgrounds: &quot;A&quot; Level grades of successful medical students and, where known, unsuccessful candidates; demographic profile of applicants and students admitted to medical schools over the last two years by race, gender, socio-economic group and proportion of students admitted straight from state school; and for institutions without existing medical students, the same information for related disciplines, especially healthcare students.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what guidelines he has issued to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(a)</i>&nbsp;schools and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;local education authorities about&nbsp;levels of (i) authorised and (ii) unauthorised absence.  [174717]</p>








<p><a name="40525w17.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis  </b> 
<i>[holding reply 20&nbsp;May 2004]:</i> In December 2001, the Department asked all schools with above average levels of unauthorised absence to set themselves targets to reduce the level of unauthorised absence by the end of this school year. In February 2003, I wrote to all local education authorities reminding them of the importance that the Government attaches to improving the levels of school attendance and urging them to work with their schools in reducing both authorised and unauthorised absences. Also in 2003, we provided 56 local education authorities with expert advisers to help them work with schools to improve attendance levels, in particular, to reduce unauthorised absence to a level closer to that of authorities in similar circumstances. The Department also advises authorities and schools on appropriate levels of absence through analysis of targets set, for example, in Education Development Plans, under the Behaviour Improvement Programme or as part of Local Public Service Agreements.

<p><a name="40525w17.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis  </b> 
<i>[holding reply 20&nbsp;May 2004]:</i> The information is as follows:
</p>


<p>
<a name="40525w17.html_para0">
<i>(a)</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department has recently commissioned the National Foundation for Educational Research to carry out an analysis of data to identify the links between individual pupils&#039; attendance at school and their attainment in examinations. The report is expected in the summer of 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40525w17.html_para1">
<i>(b)</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysis of school level data for the 2002/3 academic year indicates that there is a correlation between attendance and attainment. For example, in schools with absence levels of 6.5&nbsp;per cent. or lower, an average of 74.3&nbsp;per cent. of pupils achieved five or more A*-C grades in GCSE examinations. However, the average fell to 26.7&nbsp;per cent. in schools where absence levels exceeded 11&nbsp;per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40525w17.html_para2">
<i>(c)</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The data also reveal a general correlation at local education authority level with attainment dropping as absence levels increase. Most authorities with absence levels of 7.0&nbsp;per cent. or less have, on average, over 60&nbsp;per cent. of pupils achieving five or more A*-C grades. In those authorities with absence levels exceeding 10&nbsp;per cent., on average, less than 45&nbsp;per cent. of pupils achieve five or more A*-C GCSE grades.

 DCMS and its sponsored bodies have undertaken a range of initiatives aimed at increasing the use of audio description, which, through visual information and interpretive commentary, can greatly enhance appreciation of cultural exhibits and sites by visually-impaired people. Some of the key initiatives are as follows.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40525w20.html_para3">
Arts Council England (ACE) and the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA), with support from English Heritage, funded the &quot;Talking Images&quot; project managed by the Royal National Institute for the Blind, which resulted in extensive guidance for museums, galleries and heritage sites on how to provide audio description and venue access, including a technical specification for user-friendly audio-guide equipment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40525w20.html_para4">
MLA has produced further guidance on inclusive technology, distributed to more than 3,000 museums, libraries and archives, and is also promoting technical web-accessibility for online cultural collections, so that new services such as audio description can be easily accessed. An example of innovation in this area is the Tate Modern&#039;s imap website, which uses audio description and images adapted for the partially-sighted through heightened colour contrast.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40525w20.html_para5">
English Heritage has audio guides at over 50 of its properties and is looking to increase this number. Many sites also have set tours for the visually-impaired and interactive audio tours. English Heritage has also produced a guide on improving access for blind and partially-sighted people.

<p><a name="40525w22.html_spnew6"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Local Criminal Justice Boards (LCJBs) do not directly collect fines. Fine enforcement is the responsibility of local Magistrates&#039; Courts Committees (MCCs). But, given the importance of fine enforcement to public confidence in the Criminal Justice System, LCJBs are encouraged to monitor and to work jointly to improve payment rates within their local areas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40525w22.html_para2">
The table shows the payment rate for April 2003 to March 2004 for each of the 42 local MCCs. This represents the total value of fines (excluding confiscation orders) collected as a percentage of the total value of fines imposed over this period. The Department for Constitutional Affairs set MCCs a target of 75&nbsp;per cent. for the year ending March 2004. Note that it is possible for an area&#039;s payment rate to exceed 100&nbsp;per cent. if a sufficiently high value of fines imposed prior to April 2003 are collected.

 It is incorrect to say that any body or person will have &quot;access&quot; to the register, rather the legislation will permit the Secretary of Sate to disclose information where a person consents or, where a person does not consent, only for specified purposes to specified persons.

People will therefore be free to produce an identity card on a voluntary basis, including to a police officer, as a means of establishing their identity.

<p>
<a name="40525w23.html_para5">
There is an exception to the general bar on disclosing information from the register without consent where disclosure to the police is in the interests of national security and for the prevention and investigation of crime, as set out in Clause 20(3) of the draft Identity Cards Bill. Such disclosure may be authorised only where the Secretary of State is satisfied that it was not reasonably practicable for the police to have obtained the information by other means. For example, if fingerprint information is recorded on the register, the police would first have to search their own fingerprint records before resorting to the register. In addition, Clause 24(2) enables the Secretary of State to impose other requirements that must be satisfied before such a disclosure is made.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment has been made of the costs that will be incurred by businesses in dealing with the guidance of the Equality and Human Rights Commission; and what assessment has been made of the costs that will be incurred by businesses in complying with its codes of practice.  [174703]</p>








<p><a name="40525w26.html_spnew2"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 The Government published the White Paper &quot;Fairness for All: A New Commission for Equality and Human Rights&quot; on Wednesday 12&nbsp;May 2003. The White Paper sets out our proposals for a new body to meet the challenges we must overcome if we are to end discrimination and promote respect for human rights. The establishment of a single organisation to champion equality, diversity and human rights meets the strong call from the business community for a more joined-up approach to these issues.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40525w26.html_para0">
An assessment of the costs to businesses due to the creation of the Commission for Equality and Human Rights (CEHR) has been made in the Partial Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA), which forms part of the White Paper. As the establishment of the CEHR imposes no new regulatory burden on business there will be no costs associated with complying with guidance or codes of practice issued by the CEHR, other than where a business is currently in breach of existing legislation. Guidance and codes of practice issued by the CEHR will make businesses more aware of their legal responsibilities, thus reducing the risk of litigation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40525w26.html_para1">
Nevertheless, there may be small costs associated with reading and understanding initial guidance issued by the CEHR, estimated to be around &#163;39 per business. However as this guidance is likely to cover all areas of discrimination and human rights legislation it should offer an overall saving in time and cost spent in reading guidance related to each individual area, as is currently the case.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how the Government&#039;s energy policy takes account of the cost estimated by Ofgem of reinforcing the transmission grid in order to cope with the scale of wind farm development envisaged.  [174804]</p>








<p><a name="40525w27.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The Government have already undertaken a significant amount of analysis both prior to and after the 2003 Energy White Paper on the costs associated with incorporating increasing amounts of renewable generation into the electricity network.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40525w27.html_para0">
We believe the right framework is in place to deliver the reinforcement of the transmission grid needed to support the Government&#039;s energy policy objectives. The transmission operators are responding to the increased level of demand for connections to the system from renewable energy generators. The market is regulated by Ofgem to ensure that investment in new transmission 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>25 May 2004 : Column 1567W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
infrastructure is cost efficient and the consumer is protected from the consequences of unnecessary transmission expenditure. In addition, the industry is working to ensure that wind and other renewable generation connection to the system in future will have the characteristics necessary to maintain the integrity of the electricity networks.

<p><a name="40525w27.html_wqn2"><b> Miss McIntosh: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how the Government&#039;s energy policy for large-scale intermittent wind power generation addresses the diseconomy of part-time operation thereby forced upon the necessary conventional back-up; and how this deterrent to back-up generation will affect the risks to security and stability.  [174807]</p>








<p><a name="40525w27.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 Although wind generation is undoubtedly less predictable and more intermittent than conventional generation, when aggregated nationally, the implications for the operation of the electricity system are significantly mitigated. Work by the National Grid Company indicates that it will be some years before the growth in wind generation has a noticeable impact on overall reserve plant requirements, although there will come a time when additional reserve will be required.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40525w27.html_para1">
The impact of this in reduced overall efficiency of generation and associated increase in emissions will be negligible compared with the savings in emissions realised by the operation of the wind generation itself. Nevertheless, the Government in conjunction with the electricity industry, is exploring possible means of further mitigating the effects of intermittency and unpredictability.

 Accredited Trade Organisations (formerly known as Sponsors) add value to Government grants by providing support services to exhibitors before, during and after the event.

Notes:<br>

1.&nbsp;Figures are for the financial year 2002&#150;03, the latest date for which data are available.<br>

2.&nbsp;Estimates are for Great Britain.<br>

3.&nbsp;Estimates relate to the status of individuals at the time they were interviewed for the FRS.<br>

4.&nbsp;The estimates are based on sample counts, which have been adjusted for non-response using multipurpose grossing factors that control for tenure, council tax band and a number of other variables. Estimates are subject to sampling error, and to remaining variability in non-response which is not corrected by the grossing regime.<br>

5.&nbsp;The income measure used is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income (that is to say income that is adjusted to reflect the composition of the household).<br>

6.&nbsp;The Households Below Average Income series presents analysis of income of two bases: Before Housing Costs (BHC) and After Housing Costs (AHC). This is principally to take into account variations in housing costs that themselves do not correspond to comparable variations in the quality of housing.<br>

7.&nbsp;Occupational incomes include income from the following: pension from a previous employer, widow&#039;s employee pension and trade union or friendly society pension.<br>

<br>

Notes:<br>

Data was derived by selecting cases where the strategic health authority (SHA) of residence was given as Wales (that is a Welsh postcode).<br>

In-year admissions<br>

An in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1&nbsp;April at the start of the data year.<br>

Periods of care on-going at the end of the data year (unfinished admission episodes) are included. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

Grossing<br>

Figures are grossed for coverage, except for 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03, which are not yet adjusted for shortfalls.<br>

Strategic Health Authority Data Quality<br>

These figures have been derived from the SHA of residence of the patient, which itself is derived from the postcode of the patient. SHA data were added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002&#150;03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. There is 



some change in completeness of residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis need to be aware of this issue in their interpretation of the data.<br>

Data Quality<br>

HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. The Department of Health liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>

 Patients should be able to see a general practitioner within 48 hours if they want. Equally, patients should be able to pre-book appointments further ahead if this suits them.

 Our policy, which is shared by the Department for Education and Skills, is to encourage a &quot;whole school approach&quot; to the detection and treatment of head lice. This entails encouraging parents to check their children and other family members for head lice as need arises, and arranging treatment&#151;either through a combing regime or insecticides&#151;where necessary with such advice and support from the local primary health care team (general practitioner, health visitor, school nurse or local pharmacist) as they may require. If this exercise is successfully undertaken at the same time by all parents of children within a school, then the spread of head lice can be controlled.

Notes:<br>

Main operation: hip replacement<br>

Method of admission: elective<br>

Finished In-Year Admissions<br>

A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1&nbsp;April at the start of the data-year. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

Ungrossed Data<br>

Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

Main Operation<br>

The main operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, e.g. time waited, but the figures for &quot;all operations count of episodes&quot; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.<br>

Time Waited<br>

Time waited statistics from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they 



have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited, as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

The Department is currently working with the national health service, the clinical community and research stakeholders to develop a framework for the provision of PET scanners in England. This will set out, from the evidence, which tumour groups would benefit from PET scanning, likely future demand, and consider the optimal configuration and possible location of PET scanners in England. This will be sent out to stakeholders for consultation in early summer.
