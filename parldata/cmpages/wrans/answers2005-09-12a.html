 To ask the Prime Minister, how many vehicles the Government used in relation to the G8 summit in Gleneagles, broken down by make and model.  [15078]</p>








<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50912w01.html_spnew0"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 I have been asked to reply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50912w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_1">In relation to the G8 summit, the Government used 246 vehicles. These included 20 cars, 47 people carriers, three articulated lorries, 21, 7.5 tonne trucks, six vans and 149 coaches. The cars used, broken down by make and model, were five Jaguar XJ, nine Volvo S80, one Peugeot 607, one Vauxhall Omega Elite, and four Mercedes E-Class. The people carriers used, broken down by make and model, were 31 Ford Galaxy carriers, two Volvo seven seaters, seven Chrysler Grand Voyagers, two Volkswagen Caravelles, three Mercedes V Class, one Volkswagen Sharan, and one Vauxhall Viano. To provide information on vehicle makes and model of the coaches, trucks and vans used would incur disproportionate cost, but the break down in size of the coaches used was 118, 49-seater coaches, 10, 70-seater coaches, 20, 16-seater coaches, and one 38-seater coach.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50912w01.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_2">We went to great efforts, beyond those previously undertaken in Government, to make the G8 as environmentally sustainable as possible. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) investigated using a wide range of low emissions technologies and as a result as many vehicles as possible used an advanced low emission form of diesel. Every effort was made to limit journeys and ensure that the maximum number of passengers were transported at one time. In addition, the FCO looked into the possibility of using environmentally friendly vehicles such as the Toyota Prius and the hydrogen-fuelled bus owned by London buses. Unfortunately, due to various logistical constraints this did not prove possible. The hydrogen-fuelled bus has a very limited mileage and can only be refuelled in London. Therefore, to transport it to Scotland for use during the Summit would not have proved sustainable or environmentally friendly. The FCO were offered the use of Toyota Prius cars as part of a sponsorship package. Unfortunately this offer did not prove to be financially viable to the FCO, as the FCO would have been required to supply both drivers or insurance, as well as transporting the vehicles to Scotland, at considerable cost.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50912w01.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_3">In other areas too, the FCO implemented a range of measures aimed at minimising the environmental impacts of the Summit. These included using local or Fairtrade. produce, drawing up a Supplier Code of Conduct&quot; for contractors to ensure they shared our commitment to demonstrating the highest standard of environmental and social accountability, and as much as possible pursuing the 3 Rs policy&#151;Reduce, Recycle, Reuse. The FCO encouraged and facilitated recycling at

<a name="50912w01.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_4">These efforts continue. Currently, the G8 Climate Change Unit in Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is in the process of calculating the level of carbon emissions attributable to the UK&#039;s presidency of the G8 that could not be eliminated. They will offset these by investing in small-scale Clean Development Mechanism projects, with strong sustainable development benefits, located in Africa.

<a name="50912w01.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_5">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) went to great efforts, beyond those previously undertaken in Government, to make the G8 as environmentally sustainable as possible. However, given the intensity of the workload experienced by the UK delegation in the run up to and during the summit itself, the FCO needed to balance the issue of sustainability against the organisational requirements of the event. In the majority of cases this meant UK officials travelling to Gleneagles in the shortest time possible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50912w01.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_6">153 UK officials travelled to and from Scotland by aeroplane. One UK official travelled to and from Scotland by train. Three Ministers, my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn), and my noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Lord Triesman of Tottenham), also travelled to Scotland by aeroplane. They travelled to and from the Gleneagles Hotel by a combination of helicopters and cars. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary travelled to and from the Gleneagles Hotel by helicopter in order to chair the meeting while the Prime Minister returned to London on 7 July 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50912w01.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_7">The FCO examined other ways to minimise the environmental impacts caused by delegates&#039; travel. 144 UK officials travelled to and from the airports of arrival and departure to the Gleneagles Hotel by high occupancy vehicles including coach or people carrier. Only a small number of these officials accompanied delegations on their helicopter transfers during the summit. Nine UK officials accompanied the Prime Minister and travelled to and from the Gleneagles Hotel by helicopter. In addition, the G8 Climate Change Unit in Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs are currently in the process of calculating the level of carbon emissions attributable to the summit. These will be offset by investing in small-scale Clean Development Mechanism projects, with strong sustainable development benefits, located in Africa.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what conditions he has attached to debt relief for heavily indebted poor countries in Africa.  [14718]</p>








<p><a name="st_4"><a name="50912w01.html_spnew2"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Debt relief is provided to enable countries to make faster progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. It is essential therefore that the resources made available by the relief are used for poverty reduction. In providing debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, the UK abides by the standards agreed internationally. Under these standards, countries must demonstrate a sustained commitment to poverty reduction and macroeconomic stability as part of an International Monetary Fund programme, Macroeconomic stability is critical to provide a foundation for growth, avoid adverse effects of inflation on the poor and to protect Government expenditure that benefits the poor. The debt stock cancellation recently proposed by the G8 would also use these standards.

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="50912w02.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 The UK Government&#039;s principal support to the Government of Belize (GoB) has been relief on its aid debts under the Commonwealth Debt Initiative. This relief is provided to GoB on the basis of its progress in controlling corruption and improving governance, economic management and poverty reduction. It also serves as a tool to encourage greater civil society participation in the GoB&#039;s policy. The UK Government are also providing a Strategic Fund for the GoB (&#163;200,000 per year) to help improve their ability to undertake governance reforms, develop medium term economic plans and identify ways to reduce poverty. The Small Grants Scheme, and other programme funds for Belize, provides a further &#163;35,000 a year that can be used for projects with civil society.

<a name="stpa_8">Although Belize is not specifically a major transit country for drugs destined for the UK, we do continue to help combat drug trafficking on a regional basis within Central America and the Caribbean. As part of CARICOM (the Caribbean Community), Belize benefits from the recently agreed UK/CARICOM co-operation plan that encompasses work on border security, intelligence and information sharing, maritime co-operation and a human resource development strategy. This partnership assists Caribbean states to combat drug trafficking. The UK also funds the training of Belizean officials on regional and UK drug specific training courses.

<i>[holding answer 19 July 2005]:</i> DFID is funding financial sector development programmes, including microfinance, in 25 countries. Four new financial sector programmes are currently being designed in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. DFID also funds international agencies that actively support microfinance and financial sector development, such as the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation and the Asian Development Bank.

<i>[holding answer 19 July 2005]:</i> During 2004&#150;05, DFID funded over &#163;30 million directly to microfinance or financial sector development programmes. DFID also funded microfinance and financial sector development through multi-sectoral programmes and indirectly through its support to international agencies. Multi-sectoral programmes may include a component on financial sector development as part of a range of activities to promote private sector development for example, or as part of a wider programme to improve rural livelihoods.

The Bank is now working closely with parliamentarians in some of its borrowing member countries to involve them in the design and implementation of its lending programmes. The World Bank Institute has a major Parliamentary Strengthening Programme. A key objective is to strengthen the capacity of parliaments to scrutinise the allocation and use of public funds, and oversee the PRS.

<p><a name="st_18"><a name="50912w03.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 The DFID-funded Nepal Safer Motherhood Project operated in nine of the 75 districts of Nepal from March 1997 until September 2004. The project was implemented in partnership with the Department of Health Services, and the Ministry of Health, with a total budget of &#163;5.8 million. The Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) in Nepal is estimated at 539 per 100,000 live births, according to a 1996 survey. Given the methodological difficulties in measuring MMR, levels of skilled attendance at birth and Emergency Obstetric Care are taken as proxies for MMR. The project completion data revealed that within the project supported districts there was an increase in skilled attendance at birth from 3.05 per cent. (1997&#150;98 Nepal fiscal year July to June) to 17.81 per cent. (2003&#150;04). In addition there was an average annual increase of 1.3 per cent. in met need for accessing Emergency Obstetric Care, thus demonstrating that lives had been saved.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50912w03.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_27">An evaluation completed in November 2004 assessed the project as having contributed to a national increased percentage of deliveries by skilled attendants from a 1997&#150;98 baseline of 3.6 per cent. to 18.3 per cent. in 2003&#150;04. Similarly, the project had contributed to a

national increase in Emergency Obstetric Care from a baseline survey of 5 per cent. in 2000 to 14.8 per cent. in 2003&#150;04.

<p>
<a name="50912w03.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_28">Building on this success, DFID has contributed &#163;20 million to help the Government of Nepal implement its Safer Motherhood Programme. This programme aims to extend quality services to all 75 districts over the period 2004 to 2009. The conflict in Nepal makes it harder to deliver programmes effectively, but health services do continue to function and it should still be possible to reduce MMR further through the programme.

 DFID is currently providing &#163;40 million annually to Sierra Leone.

These reforms aim to increase the effectiveness of our aid by strengthening systems of transparency and accountability. The MOU has been key to achieving progress on a range of issues, including establishment of the Office of Auditor General as an independent agency outside the civil service; successful completion of Sierra Leone&#039;s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper and strengthening the power of the Anti-Corruption Commission.

In the interim, an annual statement of progress should be made to demonstrate the ongoing management of fiduciary risk and to meet audit discharge requirements. We have just completed a new FRA assessment for our programme of budget support to the country.

The information gathered from these soundings augments technical and commercial knowledge already held by the programme through its use of technology experts and sharing of information with other Government Departments and agencies.

The procurement process will comply with EU and UK public procurement regulations which will encourage open competition.

 80 per cent. of the civil service below the senior civil service now has the option to remain in work until age 65, while a further 11 per cent. has the option to remain in work on short service concessions. Departments and agencies which retain a retirement age of 60 are expected to continue to re-examine the issue.

<p>
<a name="50912w05.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_44">Legislation which will come into force in October 2006 will provide for a national default age of 65 after which an employer will not have to justify retiring someone on grounds of age. This will be subject to review after five years. To ensure compliance, the civil service is currently quality proofing its terms and conditions in this area to raise the retirement age of its employees, including the senior civil service, to 65. Those areas of the civil service which consider that they need to maintain a retirement age below 65 will only be able to do so if they can objectively justify this by reference to particular circumstances. It is anticipated, however, that this will be a negligible figure against the total number of permanent civil servants which, at 1 April 2004, was 523,580 (full-time equivalents).

The cost of an application for the return of a child is often a matter of concern to parents. In most countries no payment for legal proceedings is required for applications made under the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. The Central Authority for the Convention provides information regarding legal costs in specific countries. There is no charge for the services provided by the Central Authority, including the translation of documents necessary to an application under the Convention. In countries where legal aid is not generally available efforts are made by the receiving Central Authority, in cases of financial need, to provide legal representation for applicants either at a reduced rate or free of charge.

The Wellingborough East (WEAST) development and Milton Keynes South Midlands sub-regional strategy will improve infrastructure in the Wellingborough district in order to attract business and industry and help indigenous businesses grow. However, like manufacturing businesses throughout the East Midlands and the UK, Northamptonshire businesses are facing severe competition from overseas.

Notes:<br>

1. Several indirect measures of state support for CHP were introduced in 2001&#150;02.<br>

2. Of those that can be enumerated, climate change levy exemption on fuel inputs to Good Quality CHP and good quality CHP electricity outputs were valued at up to &#163;80 million per annum, while eligibility for Enhanced Capital Allowances is worth in the region of &#163;10 million per annum to the industry.<br>

3. Capital grants for Community Energy programme schemes were introduced in 2002&#150;03 and the spend on schemes including CHP was: &#163;427,000 in 2002&#150;03, &#163;4,315,000 in 2003&#150;04 and &#163;4,896,000 in 2004&#150;05.<br>

<p><a name="st_107"><a name="50912w14.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ingram  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 21 July 2005]:</i> The Armed Forces Compensation Scheme does not involve the percentage assessment of disabling conditions. Compensation is paid according to a tariff with 15 levels of award for injuries of differing severity. With regard to hearing loss, a permanent bilateral loss of between 50 and 75dB, averaged over 1, 2 and 3kHz, attracts a lump sum award at tariff level 13 (&#163;5,250), if there is mild or no tinnitus. A lump sum award at tariff level 11 (&#163;11,000) is paid if there is severe tinnitus. Level 11 awards also attract a continuing guaranteed income payment. Hearing loss of less than 50dB does not attract compensation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50912w14.html_para6">
The 50dB threshold for compensation is the same used for the war pension scheme, where the rules of the scheme prescribe that a loss of between 50 and 53dB, averaged over 1, 2 and 3kHz, shall be assessed at 20 per cent. It is also used for the assessment of industrial deafness under the civilian Industrial Injuries Benefit Scheme. The independent Industrial Injuries Advisory Council confirmed the appropriateness of the threshold in industrial injuries in November 2002.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50912w14.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_110">The evidence used to determine the degree of disablement due to service-related hearing loss under the war pension scheme is taken from audiometric tests conducted on or about the date of termination of service. Where no such tests were conducted the assessment is on the basis of the earliest available evidence. Assessment on the basis of later evidence would inevitably include hearing loss arising after service and therefore not due to service: a war pension assessment can include only disablement that is due to service.

<i>[holding answer 21 July 2005]:</i> The Ministry of Defence is committed to evidence-based policy and decision making. Current accepted scientific understanding is that permanent hearing loss due to noise exposure does not improve or worsen after removal from the noise. Hearing loss may subsequently worsen due to age and other causes, but there is no evidence that the worsening is caused or increased by prior noise exposure where that exposure has ceased.

 In October 2004, the Ministry of Defence (MOD set up a team to conduct an extensive review of all military byelaws.

A five-year rolling review programme, including priorities, has been drawn up. The Military Lands Act 1892 empowers the Secretary of State for Defence to make a new byelaw. The process takes approximately 18 months in each case. It is intended that the first proposed new byelaw stemming from the review will me made available for public consultation in September 2005.

On that basis, we are looking to prescribe the forms as soon as possible, although this will not be before the 6 August date for converting existing alcohol licences. I have made it clear that, in the meantime, I have no policy objection if licensing authorities in Wales wish to make forms available in Welsh or bilingually, and to accept them in Welsh under their Welsh language schemes.

 The Gleneagles Plan of Action is a new agreement between G8 partners to take action on climate change, clean energy and sustainable development through a series of items on transforming the way we use energy, powering a cleaner future, promoting networks for research and development, financing the transition to cleaner energy, managing the impact of climate change and tackling illegal logging.

 Assessments of the change of carbon dioxide emission have been made throughout the drafting and negotiation of the G8 Gleneagles Plan of Action on Climate Change, Clean Energy and Sustainable Development. Although it is very difficult to quantify the impacts of the package as a whole our assessment of the final Plan of Action suggests that if implemented fully, with full participation from all the countries involved, those measures that can be more easily quantified will deliver annual savings of around 550 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2010&#151;approximately equivalent to the emissions of the UK. By 2030 this is expected to rise to 4,500 MTCO2e&#151;this is equivalent to around 19 per cent. of current global emissions.

 Price negotiations between producers and processors, or processors and supermarkets are a private commercial matter in which the Government cannot and should not get involved, provided competition rules are respected. However, Ministers frequently meet representatives from all parts of the dairy supply chain, and are therefore keenly aware of the issues, particularly current concerns about the sustainability of the industry at current and projected prices. For example, the Dairy Supply Chain Forum, which my Noble Friend Lord Bach chairs, met on 20 July. Lord Bach also attended the board meeting of Dairy UK on 12 July, and met the President of the National Farmers&#039; Union on 21 July.

 The current average farmgate price for milk delivered in April (the most recent month for which figures are available) was 17.68 pence per litre. This is only marginally below the price for April 2004 despite last year&#039;s cuts to intervention prices which were expected to result in lower farmgate prices. In partial compensation for the intervention price cuts, dairy farmers received a dairy premium subsidy payment in November 2004 worth 0.78 pence per litre. (This premium is not included in the farmgate price figures).

 A number of steps are currently being taken to reduce carbon emissions from the road transport sector. These include improvements to average new car fuel efficiency through the voluntary agreements between the European Commission and the automotive industry, complemented by changes to vehicle taxation, and support for low carbon fuels such as biofuels. In the area of fuel efficiency alone, new cars in the UK are now emitting some 10 per cent. less carbon dioxide per kilometre on average than in 1995. Policy measures in the transport sector alone are forecast to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by some 4.4 million tonnes of carbon a year by 2010.

All 42 car brands in the UK have signed up to the introduction of the voluntary labelling scheme, and the label is due to be in all UK car showrooms by 1 September. As well as highlighting the fuel efficiency of every new car on sale, the labels also contain information on how much motorists can expect to pay in fuel bills in a typical year for a particular car, and whether the car qualifies for a reduction in Vehicle Excise Duty.

animals, is effectively separated and disposed of, and is not therefore available for any use. But more directly, there are comprehensive and stringent feed controls which regulate the use of all animal protein products in the diets of all farmed animals, not just cattle. The controls now apply equally across the EU, banning animal proteins, with a few exceptions, from farmed animal feed.

The State Veterinary Service carried out 2,295 inspections and took 17,239 samples under the National Feed Audit during 2004&#151;i.e. nearly 2.5 times more than the recommended minimum number of inspections, and over nine times more than the recommended minimum number of samples. Monitoring over the years has always indicated a high level of compliance with the feed ban, and this is reflected in the continuing reduction of the incidence of BSE in cattle.

<p><a name="st_204"><a name="50912w24.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The meeting with WaterVoice South West dealt with a number of concerns and issues and there were two specific follow up actions. First, we agreed that the affordability pilot study in the South West should be subject to peer review to help ensure its conclusions are robust and intellectually rigorous. Since the meeting, WaterVoice and other organisations have been working with DEFRA to finalise the specification for the work. Second, I invited WaterVoice&#039;s views on DEFRA&#039;s review of tariff structures and I am pleased that they were able to participate in the first meeting and are now helping shape the scope and programme of work.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what evaluation she has made of research by <i>(a)</i> UK organisations, <i>(b)</i> the UK Government and <i>(c)</i> other EU member states into the spread of scrapie in herds of goats; on what scientific evidence the current guidelines for slaughtering an entire herd of goats if only one is diagnosed with scrapie are based; and if she will make a statement.  [14443]</p>








<p><a name="st_209"><a name="50912w25.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Research carried out in the UK provides evidence that goats are susceptible to both BSE and scrapie and naturally occurring scrapie has been recorded in goats in Great Britain. As in sheep, the clinical appearance of these two conditions in goats cannot be distinguished. Control measures to protect public health from BSE are therefore directed at the eradication of all Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE) diseases from sheep and goats within the EU. Research on sheep in the UK and Europe has shown certain PrP genotypes to be more resistant to TSE infection. This is the basis of the national scrapie plan in which selective breeding is used to establish sheep flocks with more resistant genotypes. Studies on goats have shown considerable variability in PrP genotypes but there is no currently available evidence that resistant genotypes exist which can be promoted through genetic selection. Control of TSE disease, and thus any potential for the presence of BSE, in goat herds is based on the culling of herds in which scrapie is found to exist.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50912w25.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_190">As there are very few cases of goat TSE reported in the UK, it has not been possible to carry out scientific epidemiological studies on the spread of TSEs in goats. Research is being done in European countries with much larger goat populations than the UK, notably in Cyprus where there is an ongoing TSE epidemic. DEFRA is monitoring this work to see if it has any implications for the UK goat population. Following the recently reported case of BSE in a goat in France the EU has announced a research call to investigate the topic of BSE infectivity in milk, milk products and meat derived from goats&quot;. DEFRA will also monitor the progress of this proposed research.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50912w25.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_191">The current whole-herd slaughter policy in herds where there is a confirmed case of a TSE in a goat is a requirement of European Community legislation (Regulation 999/2001). When drafting this legislation the commission took into consideration the opinion of their Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) on the safe

sourcing of small ruminant (sheep and goat) material (4&#150;5 April 2002). Because genotyping and removal of susceptible animals is not an option in goats, it was felt that the only way to protect consumers from the theoretical risk of BSE in goats was a whole goat herd cull policy. The commission are currently reviewing their TSE eradication policy for small ruminants.

 The Department&#039;s guidance on the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) and non-agricultural use of land balances the need for diversification opportunities with the necessity to abide by EU rules on eligibility of land under the scheme. The guidance is built around the degree to which non-agricultural use impedes or is inconsistent with normal farming activities. Having considered representations from interested parties, the guidance will now be updated to move paragliding and hang gliding to the list of generally permitted activities. This means that these activities may take place on an unrestricted number of days on land used in support of claims for payment under the SPS in 2005.

 The south-west does have the highest bills in England and Wales, but like other companies, water companies must meet their costs, including those of environmental standards. Ultimately, those costs have to be met by their customers.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and its non-departmental public bodies, such as the Countryside Agency, have invested approximately &#163;65 million in environmentally based grant and programme support beyond mainstream funding since 2003 into the growth areas to support the development, protection and enhancement of all environmental assets.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_109">(ii) how many investigations against childminders have been undertaken by Ofsted in each of the last five years; and how many resulted in action.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_110">In relation to the first question, Ofsted does not record the number of vexatious complaints made against childminders. Ofsted&#039;s role is to help to secure better education and care through effective inspection and regulation. Ofsted looks into complaints which suggest that childminders and day care providers are not meeting the government&#039;s National Standards.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_111">Ofsted&#039;s first concern is with the welfare of the children in the provider&#039;s care. When Ofsted has investigated a complaint it records the outcome of the investigation. This could be the action the provider or Ofsted had to take to bring about compliance with the Standards or that Ofsted found the provider to be meeting the National Standards. Ofsted reports either outcome to parents and in its regular inspection reports. It does not record or report whether a complaint was vexatious. It may be, of course, that even if a complaint was vexatious it could still lead Ofsted to identify some areas for improvement in the childminder&#039;s practice and so have a positive impact on the children concerned.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_112">However, Ofsted does recognise that providers will have concerns about having a number of complaints recorded against their names, even if Ofsted on inspection found that National Standards were being met. For that reason, where it appears that a number of complaints could have been made by the same source and they all resulted in a finding that the Standards were being met, they are not reported on in inspection reports individually.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_113">Ofsted recognises the concern childminders may feel about this issue and is looking at its practice to see if it can handle complaints in a more transparent and effective way. The government has just consulted on a new duty to be placed on providers to investigate and report on complaints. It may be that Ofsted will be able to change its complaints procedures and recording in the light of this. It will work with provider organisations to make sure it does this as well as it can.</p>

<a name="stpa_240">The Department is taking forward a significant programme of work to support children&#039;s holistic development in all early years settings. The widely welcomed Birth to Three Matters and Foundation Stage set out the key principles that enable children to develop the key skills and positive attitude needed for all future learning. As we set out in our Childcare Bill Consultation we will be developing the Early Learning Development and Learning Framework that will ensure that young children are able to access the same high quality experience regardless of the type of setting they attend. The Framework will support practitioners in creating stimulating, inclusive, caring and learning environments so that all children have the opportunity to reach their full potential.

 The information requested can be provided only at disproportionate cost, however the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) estimate that in 2003&#150;04, the latest period for which data are currently available, further education (FE) colleges received approximately &#163;47 million for the education of asylum seekers and their dependants. Information for earlier years is not readily available. Asylum seekers and their dependants are eligible for FE if they are supported by the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) or receive similar (usually local authority) support. Asylum seekers not receiving NASS or similar support are not eligible for publicly funded FE.

<a name="stpa_249">In the first quarter of 2005, the number of asylum applications was 22 per cent. lower than the same period in 2004, and 69 per cent. lower than the fourth quarter of 2002. This fall in intake follows the introduction of a range of measures by the Government to reduce the number of unfounded asylum claims. We are continuing to introduce measures that will reduce the number of unfounded claims still further and increase removals of failed asylum seekers.

<a name="stpa_250">The Department does not keep separate records on the number of children of those in the immigration and asylum system who are being educated at school. Nor do data produced by the Higher Education Statistics Agency separately identify individuals and their families in the immigration and asylum system studying in higher education courses. It is not therefore possible to estimate costs for these areas of education.

Notes:<br>

1.Figures for 2004 are for GCSE and Equivalent qualifications. Figures for 1998 to 2003 are for GCSE and GNVQs only.<br>

2.LEA figures only include pupils at maintained schools. England figures include all pupils.<br>

3.Local government reorganisation took place on the 1 April 1998 and there are therefore no comparable figures for Essex and Southend prior to 1998.<br>

4.Ages are taken at the start of the academic year (i.e. 31 August).<br>

 PSA targets for attainment by age 16 and 19 are based around young people reaching level 2 (5 GCSEs A* to C or equivalent). Provisional matched administrative data show that 49.2 per cent. of 19-year-olds in 2004 in England had attained at least level 2 by age 16 increasing to 67.0 per cent. by age 19. This equates to around 110,000 additional learners attaining at least level 2 between age 16 and 19. Around 3,000 of these additional learners achieved in the Essex Learning and Skills Council (LSC) area. Figures are currently not available for respondents with no qualifications or below local LSC area. This is the first year for which we have matched data to age 19, hence time series data are not available.

<a name="stpa_266">The current funding gap between school sixth forms and further education colleges has arisen due to a number of reasons including the 1992 Further and Higher Education Act and the removal of the incorporated FE sector funding systems from local authority control. This resulted in a divergence from local authority systems and funding differences. These differences were made more apparent when all post 16 funding became the responsibility of the Learning and Skills Council in 2001.

We must be clear that continuing progress on narrowing the gap will not be easy and will depend on the resources available. However, as signalled in the Minister of State for Schools and 14&#150;19 Learning&#039;s statement to the House of Commons 21 July we intend to explore the scope for addressing the technical anomalies between the school sixth form and further education funding systems. We aim to announce decisions on the way forward in the autumn.

 The Government currently have no plans to issue guidance on the amount of time per day that children aged five to 15 should watch television. We are aware of some studies which have found links between excessive television watching and obesity, disruptive behaviour, and poor educational performance in children. Parents are best placed to regulate their children&#039;s television viewing and to ensure that they lead a balanced, healthy lifestyle. To achieve that objective, the Government are working to increase the information available to parents. Through, for example, Extended Schools; our Youth Green Paper proposals; the Healthy Schools Standard; school sports and PE within the curriculum; and volunteering and mentoring in schools linked to PSHE within the curriculum, we are also working to increase the opportunities available for children and young people to participate in a range of constructive activities as an alternative to watching television.

<sup>(86)</sup>For the year 2000 the cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). The codes used by ONS to define alcohol-related deaths are listed below:<br>

291&#151;Alcoholic psychoses<br>

303&#151;Alcohol dependence syndrome<br>

305.0&#151;Non-dependent abuse of alcohol<br>

425.5&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

571&#151;Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis<br>

E860&#151;Accidental poisoning by alcohol.<br>

For the years 2001&#150;04 the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) was used. To maintain comparability with earlier years the following codes were used:<br>

F10&#151;Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<br>

142.6&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

K70&#151;Alcoholic liver disease<br>

K73&#151;Chronic hepatitis, not elsewhere classified<br>

K74&#151;Fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver<br>

X45&#151;Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol.<br>

Deaths were selected using the original underlying cause.<br>

The selection of codes to define alcohol-related deaths is described in:<br>

 The Government do not allocate a fixed budget for carer&#039;s allowance. Expenditure on carer&#039;s allowance is driven by the number of eligible claimants. Expenditure on carer&#039;s allowance in Scotland in 2004&#150;05 was &#163;106.7 million. Expenditure for the United Kingdom in the same period was &#163;1,186.5 million. Depending on their individual circumstances, carers may also be entitled to other social security benefits or tax credits.

<a name="stpa_286">In England the carers grant was introduced in 1999 and since then has provided an extra &#163;450 million over the past five years, to increase the number of breaks for carers.

This is an area of devolved policy and therefore the budget for carers in Scotland is a matter for the Scottish Executive.

<p><a name="st_328"><a name="50912w42.html_spnew5"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 Climate change levy is assessed on UK industry as a whole and it is not feasible to make an assessment of its impact on every business sector or individual company. The CCL was introduced with offsetting tax cuts for business which included a 0.3 percentage point reduction in employers&#039; national insurance contributions introduced at the same time as the levy in April 2001, support for energy efficiency through enhanced capital allowances and the setting up of the Carbon Trust.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50912w42.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_289">The Government published an independent evaluation by Cambridge Econometrics of the climate change levy at Budget 2005 (available from the House of Commons Library or the HMRC website.www.hmrc.gov.uk). This showed that climate change levy is expected to deliver significant annual carbon dioxide savings of over 3.5 million tonnes of carbon in 2010.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50912w42.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_290">No specific assessment has been made of the effects of the levy on individual companies&#039; investment decisions or energy intensity levels.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50912w42.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_291">Businesses in sectors that sign climate change agreements committing them to meet energy efficiency targets receive an 80 per cent. reduction in the levy. Eligibility is currently dependent on a sector being covered by the Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations, although in Budget 2004 the Government announced plans to extend eligibility, subject to state aid approval to their proposals. Under the existing arrangements, climate change agreements were drawn up with relevant trade bodies before the levy was introduced in 2001. Six manufacturers have signed the New Rubber Tyre Manufacturing Sector&#039;s umbrella agreement and therefore receive the 80 per cent. discount. However, there has been no other formal application process under the current eligibility criteria, and therefore no details of successful or unsuccessful applicants in any sectors.

 The White Paper of 24 July 1997 Scotland&#039;s Parliament&quot; estimated that costs of introducing a Scottish variable rate would be in the order of &#163;10 million with annual costs of &#163;8 million. As both administrations of the Scottish Parliament have indicated that they will not take advantage of the Scottish variable rate, the cost estimates have not been uprated. Doing so before a decision was made to introduce a Scottish variable rate would not produce a meaningful estimate of any change bearing in mind continuing modernisation of HMRC&#039;s IT development processes.

 Pension tax simplification replaces the numerous existing tax regimes with a universal regime for tax-privileged pension savings providing greater flexibility to some 15 million pension savers. Currently most pension funds may invest in property, and many do. Under the new simplified regime self-invested personal pensions (SIPPs) and small self-administered schemes (SSASs) may invest in all types of property including residential property from 6 April 2006. Around 200,000 people, compared to over 15 million pension scheme 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>12 Sept 2005 : Column 2401W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
members, hold these specialist pension vehicles. Creating a single set of allowable investments across all pension schemes fits the requirement to create a single regime for tax privileged pension saving and corrects an existing distortion by giving investors greater choice.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_220">although any rental income or capital gains from the disposal of the property will be tax free in the pension fund when the money is extracted it will be taxed at 30 per cent.

These elements cannot easily be separated and therefore the RIA estimates the overall cost of the pensions simplification package to the Exchequer at around &#163;&#188;billion within four years. Paragraphs 55 and 56 deal specifically with the potential consequences of allowing residential property into SIPPs and SSASs.

Notes.<br>

These figures are estimates based on a sample of all awards, therefore due to sampling uncertainty all figures below 0.5 thousand have been withheld.<br>

The level of under or overpayment at 5 April 2004 for each award is based on the 2003&#150;04 entitlement calculated from the family&#039;s circumstances and income in 2003&#150;04 reported by April 2005.<br>

 The Secretary of State for Transport is responsible for the UK National Aviation Security Programme (NASP) which is administered by the Department for Transport (DfT). The NASP allocates legal responsibility for individual security measures to specific elements of the aviation industry and DfT inspectors monitor and enforce their compliance. The NASP is maintained in co-ordination with, and in addition to the work of, other control authorities particularly the Police, HM Revenue and Customs and the UK Immigration Service.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment he has made of the ruling by the European Court of Justice in the case of Altmark Trans, with particular reference to its implications for <i>(a)</i> lifeline ferry services and <i>(b)</i> competitive tendering; and if he will make a statement.

<p><a name="st_408"><a name="50912w49.html_spnew2"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 Our assessment is that the Altmark ruling does not affect the requirement for competitive tendering of these ferry services. We consider that the ruling would apply only where there is no specific EU legislation applying to the services in issue. The requirement to tender ferry services in Scotland stems from Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3577/92 on Maritime Cabotage which does apply to these ferry services.

 Crossrail involves line upgrading work such as track alteration, electrification and platform lengthening.

The best way to achieve this is through dialogue between the Chinese Government and the Dalai Lama, without preconditions.

The fixed price for the contract, had all the work been undertaken by Land Use Consultants, was &#163;93,255 excluding VAT. However, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and Land Use Consultants agreed in early 2005 that it would be better, given the level of planning policy expertise resting within ODPM, for some of the work to be completed in-house.

<a name="stpa_422">Note that the number of social renters in council-owned accommodation may be an over-estimate; conversely the number of households in accommodation provided by housing associations may be an under-estimate. This is as a result of the ongoing transfer of council-owned stock to housing associations. It has been noted (in the 2001 census and in most household surveys&#151;including the labour force survey) that households living in dwellings where there has been a change of ownership have a tendency to continue to report that they rent from the council rather than a housing association for some time after the transfer.

 NI Departments hold information in respect of working days lost due to psychiatric/psychological illnesses. However, it is not currently possible to determine precisely if these absences have been caused by, or made worse by work-related stress. Therefore, the information set out as follows reflects only those cases where work-related stress was specifically reported on either self-certificates or on medical certificates. Information on costs is not readily available and could be obtained only at disproportionate costs.

<a name="stpa_472">A range of corporate measures has been introduced to help tackle stress including the promotion of work life balance, healthy lifestyle programmes and a Workplace Health Improvement Programme. Departments have also produced guidance for staff and managers on how to identify and manage work-related stress and complimented by training and awareness seminars. Managers also have the support of the Occupational Health Service (OHS), including the provision of Psychiatric nursing services, a comprehensive Welfare service and Employee Support Programmes (EAP). These programmes and support mechanisms take a more holistic view of staff health and well-being, including stress. While we can identify the overall cost of the provision of services, such as the OHS, Welfare and EAPs, any costing information, specific to work-related stress, is not readily available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

As part of this validation process, 26 cases were selected at random per business unit (156 in total for the Agency). Internal Assurance Service concluded that they agreed with MAGU&#039;s findings, confirming the validity of their results. I am satisfied that the monitoring of cases undertaken by MAGU forms an appropriate independent assurance; their accuracy rate is therefore not checked on a regular basis.</p>

Notes:<br>

1. GB has been provided in the table to provide a consistent time series because UK information is only available from 2002&#150;03.<br>

2. The table shows national results for the number of children rounded to the nearest 100,000. Regional figures for 2003&#150;04 are presented to the nearest 10,000. The results are drawn from a survey of a sample of households. While the tables give an indication of trends over time, the figures, especially those at regional level, should not be viewed as giving an accurate picture of year-on-year changes.<br>

3. The definition for disabled here is consistent across all year, and is defined where a long standing illness that limits mobility is reported.<br>

The report Family life in Britain: findings from the 2003 Families and Children Study&quot;, which is available in the Library, describes families as either lone parent or couple families as this is consistent with how DWP clients are segmented in welfare-to-work programmes and the benefit system.

 We have been working with the Home Office to identify areas where the identity cards scheme could provide business benefits. On 28 June 2005, my right hon. friend, the Home Secretary placed in the Library a paper containing the latest estimates of benefits of the identity cards scheme which shows that the benefits outweigh the costs once the scheme is fully operational.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50912w74.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_533">The cost of equipping premises will depend on the nature of the use of the identity cards scheme and the type of identity check(s) necessary to deliver the business benefits. In some cases, benefits could be realised without the use of card readers and the cost of installing any readers needs to be considered alongside future plans to refresh or upgrade IT systems. As the design of the scheme matures, during and after the procurement exercise, so will our understanding of where the scheme will be of most benefit which will allow us to further refine our estimates of costs and benefits.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50912w74.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_534">We have conducted a high level assessment of the number of card readers that will be required by the Department. Our initial estimate is that in the region of 4,500 readers may be required. The Home Office currently estimate the cost of a card reader would fall within the range of &#163;250&#151;&#163;750 depending on their level of sophistication and performance.

following further definition of the identity card scheme and DWP business requirements for interaction with the scheme are fully known. However the use of the biometric identity card will facilitate the verification of customer identity and improve customer service. From a counter fraud perspective the production of a biometric identity card will stop an individual registering a claim to benefit in more than one identity.

This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_352">In answer to the first part of your question, the implementation of CMS is being progressed on an office-by-office basis along with various other new initiatives. Unit cost data is generated at this level but you will appreciate that this is not the only change impacting on districts over this period of time. You will also appreciate that the significant changes in processing necessitated by CMS mean that some costs are now incurred in different parts of the business. Due to these complexities work to correctly evaluate the impact of CMS implementation has not as yet been completed and I am not currently in a position to provide this data.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_353">However, as part of the original business case, a work study exercise was performed on the part of the Income Support claim process affected by CMS. This identified that pre-CMS, the average cost of this part of the process was &#163;17.40. After CMS is introduced the average cost is expected to fall to &#163;15.09, representing an average saving per claim of &#163;2.31. Jobcentre Plus processes approximately 900,000 new Income Support claims per annum. This would imply an annual saving in the region of &#163;2 million, but this does not take into account all the other benefits arising from more efficient management of customer information.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_354">Nevertheless, when CMS has been fully rolled out across Jobcentre Plus we will be able to compare costs before and after implementation. We are currently intending to perform a full post-implementation evaluation in Spring 2006 when more detailed unit cost information will be available. However, as other initiatives are being implemented in Jobcentre Plus, changes in unit costs may not necessarily be directly attributable to CMS introduction.</p>
</ul>
<p>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_355">Regarding the second part of your question, up to the week commencing 11 July 2005, CMS had been introduced in 24 contact centres and 437 Jobcentre Plus offices around the country, and has yet to be introduced in approximately 62% of the network.</p>

 This is an important area for partnership between DWP and the three Departments&#151;the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, HM Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry&#151;with responsibility for the regional economic performance PSA target. DWP has given its support to the objectives of the REP PSA and is represented on the steering group that co-ordinates government activity aimed at meeting the target.

<p>
<a name="50912w78.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_552">Over 90 per cent. of local authorities in Great Britain have an employment rate above the EU average. Low employment is concentrated in a relatively small number of areas across the country, particularly in our major cities, some former industrial areas and some coastal towns, including Hartlepool.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50912w78.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_553">DWP&#039;s PSA targets support the Government&#039;s wider agenda by aiming to raise employment rates, especially for groups and areas of the country that currently lag behind the national average. Central to achieving this is the work of Jobcentre Plus and programmes such as new deal, which concentrate resources on areas with concentrations of long-term unemployment and economic inactivity. In addition there are locally focused programmes such as action teams that provide additional support in particularly disadvantaged areas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50912w78.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_554">Initiatives such as the Northern Way complement this approach by providing further help and support on top of existing welfare to work policies. The Northern Way has recognised the importance of tackling the number of people on incapacity benefits. The last year has seen the numbers on these benefits nationally fall for the first time in several decades, partly through the success of Jobcentre Plus, the new deal and pathways to work. Although the improvement has been concentrated in the areas with the highest rates of benefit receipt, parts of the north-east and other regions continue to have disproportionate numbers claiming incapacity benefits.

 The review of the part-time study rules is complete. As a result of that review we will be trialling an Adult Learning Option from autumn 2006 in two or three Jobcentre Plus districts in England. The pilot will test the effectiveness of providing financial support for adult Jobcentre Plus customers whose current qualification is below Level 2 to enable them to take up a first full Level 2 qualification through Learning and Skills Council funded provision. Study will be full-time for those taking up the option. At the same time, for those on Jobseekers Allowance who do not take up the learning option, the benefit rules will be strengthened to ensure that any learning is genuinely part-time and does not interfere with job search activity.

<p><a name="st_709"><a name="50912w82.html_spnew1"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 It is for local agencies to determine what medical history should be considered when applying for an antisocial behaviour order (ASBO). If there is evidence to suggest that a perpetrator of antisocial behaviour is suffering from a medical condition, mental health condition, disability or is vulnerable in any other way then a practitioner with specialist knowledge should be involved in an assessment process to determine the cause of the behaviour and whether an ASBO is the most appropriate tool to address that behaviour. The assessment should take account of any known medical conditions or disabilities as well as uncovering undiagnosed problems.

<p><a name="st_710"><a name="50912w82.html_spnew2"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 An effective approach to tackling antisocial behaviour is based on a mixture of support and sanction. For example, the Home Office recently announced on 29 June half a million pounds funding for individual support orders (ISOs) for young people between the ages of 10 and 17.

 The Home Office has no plans to introduce mediation schemes aimed at individuals across the country who exhibit antisocial behaviour.

 As indicated in my earlier response to the hon.

In cases of those people detained under section 136 of the Mental Health Act 1983, an approved social worker and registered medical practitioner must be called to interview and examine the detainee. The police station is not the most suitable place to detain people suffering from mental disorder and it is not always possible in that environment to ensure that people suffering from mental disorder are identified and given suitable attention.

<a name="stpa_578">These issues are exacerbated at the point of arrest. In cases of arrest which are not pre-planned, the ability to make use of someone from social services is impractical.

In cases of a planned arrest, it is an operational decision for the chief officer of the force concerned how best that should be carried out and any other personnel who should accompany the arresting officer.

 As a general rule, individuals with limited leave to remain in the UK are not entitled to certain income-related benefits, including disability living allowance and severe disablement allowance, because they are funded entirely out of revenue from general taxation and entitlement does not require payment of national insurance contributions. The rationale behind this is that those who have not established their right to remain permanently in the UK should not have welfare provision on the same basis as those whose citizenship or status here gives them an entitlement to benefits when in need.

<a name="stpa_607">Community penalties also display a high compliance rate. Figures for May 2005 show that the compliance rate is 74 per cent. Community penalties allow offenders to maintain employment, education and family links, all factors which are important in reducing the risk of reoffending, whilst punishing the offender and delivering interventions to address offending behaviour.

<p>
<a name="50912w85.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_608">The Criminal Justice Act 2003 changes the structure of community sentences by providing a single order made up of one or more requirements. This allows the court greater flexibility in tailoring the sentence to the offence and the offender in each case, enabling a greater prospect of effectiveness.

 It is estimated that the effect of the introduction nationally of the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) in April 2002 was a 23 per cent. increase in recorded violence against the person in its first year. This will also have impacted on detection rates.
 The introduction of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 in May 2004 resulted in substantial changes to the sexual offences. This means that figures for 2004&#150;05 are not comparable with those for previous years.

<i>[holding answer 21 July 2005]:</i> The Home Office sponsored New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (NEW-ADAM) survey, which involved interviewing and drug testing those arrested by the police, included questions on carrying guns. A paper based on the data has been published by T. H. Bennett and K. Holloway, Possession and use of illegal guns among criminals in England and Wales&quot; (Howard Journal of Criminal Justice, Vol 43, No three, pp 237&#150;252). The Home Office has also conducted an Arrestee Survey which may highlight this issue. The results of this survey will be published later this year. There have also been discussions in the context of the Home Secretary&#039;s round table on gun crime, which has looked at possible links and appropriate interventions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50912w88.html_para15">
<a name="stpa_647">This research is used to inform policy and legislative proposals. The Violent Crime Reduction Bill includes a number of measures designed to further tighten the firearms legislation, including a ban on the manufacture, import or sale of realistic imitation firearms, an increase from a maximum of six to 12 months sentence for carrying an imitation firearm in a public place without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, and an increase in the minimum age for possession of an air weapon to 18. The Bill also includes a new offence of using another person to look after, hide or transport a dangerous weapon. These measures complement existing legislation and demonstrate our determination to tackle gun crime.

This offence could be used if individuals take advantage of the internet to carry out such training; (3) Acts preparatory. This would target individuals and groups involved in preparing, instigating or conspiring to commit an act of terrorism.

If a microbike is ridden on the pavement, the police can deal with this as an offence under the Highways Act 1835. Where the rider is a child the police may choose instead to warn him and advise his parents as necessary.

Further, the figures do not include the numbers of inadequately documented passengers denied boarding by commercial carriers overseas working in conjunction with UK Airline Liaison Officers. Some of these passengers will have held forged documents. Precise figures on the number denied boarding for this reason are not available.

<p>
<a name="50912w96.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_704">Once Schengen passports contain fingerprints, British passports without fingerprints would move from being amongst the most secure in the world to being one of the weaker links and therefore a more attractive target for forgery and fraudulent applications. The inclusion of fingerprints would strengthen the link between the passport and the holder, would make the document more difficult to forge and would reduce very significantly the risk of duplicate identities on the passport database. Fingerprints are more accurate in identifying fraudulent multiple applications than facial image.

<a name="stpa_705">Having the two biometrics, facial image and fingerprint, would increase certainty of identification and help address the situation where one biometric fails to validate the identity. It would facilitate the strengthening of UK border controls for passport holders returning to the UK and hence our national security. Incorporating fingerprints in UK passports would also mean that UK passport holders will not be inconvenienced should other countries further tighten their border controls and would allow British passport holders to benefit from potential future entry control systems in the UK and overseas (e.g. as already being rolled out in Hong Kong).

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what funding each police force <i>(a)</i> should have received under the Government&#039;s formula and <i>(b)</i> received in each of the last three years; and if he will make a statement.  [14028]</p>








<p><a name="st_890"><a name="50912w96.html_spnew21"><b> Hazel Blears  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 21 July 2005]:</i> The information is set out in the table.

<p>
<a name="50912w96.html_para20">
<a name="stpa_721">Government funding for police authorities is chiefly allocated using a funding formula that distributes resources on the basis of relative need and resources. A damping mechanism subsequently applied to protect all authorities against financial instability ensures all authorities receive an increase in grant at least equal to the floor&quot; level on a like-for-like basis year-on-year. Grant floors will remain an integral part of the finance system.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50912w96.html_para21">
<a name="stpa_722">Between 2003&#150;04 and 2005&#150;06, every police authority received the amount of grant to which it was entitled under annual Police Grant Reports and Local Government Finance Reports.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50912w96.html_para22">
<a name="stpa_723">The funding formula is currently being reviewed to ensure it continues to provide a robust and fair distribution of grant. A 12 week consultation period on options for formula change began on 19 July and will last until 10 October. This is an opportunity for all interested parties to comment on a range of proposals.

<sup>(164)</sup>Original allocations.<br>

<sup>(165)</sup>Because the Welsh Assembly does not operate a grant damping mechanism, the Home Secretary has for several years provided additional funding to ensure Welsh police authorities receive at least a minimum increase in grant in line with English authorities. These additional grants, amounted to &#163;5.1 million in 2003&#150;04, &#163;12.2 million in 2004&#150;05 and &#163;13.9 million in 2005&#150;06.<br>

Note:<br>

The City of London police are part of the City Corporation. Grant cannot be directly compared with that for other police authorities.<br>

<sup>(166)</sup>General Government grants comprise Home Office police grant, ODPM revenue support grant and national non-domestic rates.<br>

<sup>(167)</sup>Includes specific grants: Crime Fighting Fund, Rural Policing Fund, Basic Command Unit funding, Community Support Officer funding (including, for 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06, Round one of the Neighbourhood Policing Fund), Airwave, DNA Expansion Programme, special priority payments and capital grants. The Home Office also funds 75 per cent. of the cost of the South East Allowance for all qualifying officers. These figures are not included within the totals.<br>

<sup>(168)</sup>As of April 2000, the Metropolitan police force was reduced in size by a transfer of responsibility for policing some areas to the surrounding forces, including Essex.<br>

<sup>(169)</sup>Figures for 2001&#150;02 are not directly comparable with 2002&#150;03 due to the change in funding arrangements of NCS/NCIS. Adjusted figures for 2001&#150;02 are therefore included.<br>

 The Home Office&#039;s &#163;30 million a year Rural Policing Fund has been specifically introduced to increase the visibility and accessibility of the police in rural areas. 31 police authorities with the most widespread populations benefit from this additional funding. Police authorities who are in receipt of money from this fund may spend it as they see fit. This may involve recruiting additional officers for rural areas or spending the money on other innovative ways to tackle crime and the fear of crime. Examples of existing good practice include the use of mobile police stations or the deployment of community beat officers to patrol clusters of villages or neighbourhoods. Forces are also using dedicated parish or neighbourhood special constables.

This budget setting process has yet to impact upon the areas, but for planning purposes each area is working with their own local planning assumptions and targets. It is, however, difficult at this early stage in the budgeting process to be precise about the detail of local recruitment strategies, and some areas are awaiting further funding information before finalising their plans.

<sup>(179)</sup>Offence under the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994 s. 29 (1)-(3).<br>

Note:<br>

The statistics of court proceedings are based on returns made by the police to the Home Office&#039;s Data Collection Group. Although these include offences where there has been no police involvement such as those prosecutions instigated by Government Departments (in this case the DVLA) and private organisations and individuals, the reporting of these types of offences is known to be incomplete. Moreover, it is thought that for some police force areas, the reporting of court proceedings, in particular those relating to motoring offences and to TV licence evasion, may also be less than complete; the extent of under-reporting may vary from year to year and this could be responsible in part for the annual variations.<br>

 The Health Protection Agency&#039;s (HPA) radiation protection division has a statutory responsibility to advise on health risks from exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF). The HPA comprehensively reviewed the relevant science in 2004 and recommended not only the adoption of new guidelines on EMF exposure but also that the Government consider the need for further precautionary measures&quot; in relation to power frequency (ELF) electromagnetic fields. The HPA provided a considered response to the recent publication by Dr Draper, placing it in the context of the current knowledge of such issues. It noted that the majority of raised magnetic fields are due to variations in the electricity supply and distribution system, the presence of substations and equipment in the home rather than proximity to power lines. The HPA&#039;s response is available on its web site at

Enterocolitis is the commonest illness caused by C. difficile infection. For causes other than enterocolitis that are also known to be associated with C. difficile, it is not possible to identify from ICD codes alone the number of deaths where C. difficile actually contributed to the death. For this reason, the only routinely available mortality statistics on C. difficile are those where it was associated with enterocolitis. The Office for National Statistics is working with the Health Protection Agency on a special study to identify the total number of deaths where C. difficile was mentioned on the death certificate. Until this study has been completed, the number of deaths in particular hospitals will not be available centrally.

<p><a name="st_1054"><a name="50912113.html_spnew2"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The provisions of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 will lead to the major changes needed to achieve the most radical reform of dentistry since 1948. This will result in a more locally focussed service for individuals. Among the major changes which will improve access is a new contract for dentists, which will take effect from 1 April 2006.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50912113.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_943">The new contract, which is based on personal dental service (PDS) pilots, will encourage a more preventive and health promotion focus. There is also a programme to recruit the equivalent of 1,000 dentists by the end of October 2005, leading to some two million individuals being able to access treatment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50912113.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_944">Morecambe Bay Primary Care Trust (PCT), which includes the Westmorland and Lonsdale constituency, has been working towards converting as many practices locally to PDS. As at 31 May 2005, there were 61 dental practices in the PCT area of which 21, or 34 per cent., had open PDS contracts. Similarly, as at 31 May 2005, the PCT was providing personal dental services to 44,675 patients. The figure for 31 May 2004 was 4,226.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50912113.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_945">The PCT has received over &#163;316,000 in dental access funding, which has been used to support local practices to improve their premises and to expand. It is anticipated that this initiative will result in an additional 6,000 dental places.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50912113.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_946">In addition to the PCTs efforts to increase the PDS contracts locally, it has been active in the Department&#039;s international recruitment campaign. As a result, three dentists have recently been recruited from Poland and have joined practices in the South Lakes and Barrow areas of the PCT. A dentist has also been recruited from Portugal to work in the local area. The principal dentist in Barrow has also agreed to the Barrow practice accepting patients from across the whole Morecambe Bay area. These extra recruits are expected to provide a further 5,000 dental places over the next 12 months. The PCT is also targeting dentists who live in the area but who are not known to be working in more local dental practices.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50912113.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_947">Morecambe Bay PCT is also supporting a range of training opportunities as part of a longer-term approach to increasing numbers of clinicians working locally. This includes placements for dental students and dental therapists. During the past year, 50 final year dental students from the Liverpool dental school spent four weeks working in Morecambe Bay. Additionally, eight dental therapists have started a two-and-a-half-year course at Lancaster and a further eight are due to start in September 2005.

There has never been an expectation under the GDS that patients should be re-called for examinations at six-monthly periods, although a dentist will not normally be allowed to claim for more than one examination undertaken within any six-month period. Following the NICE guidance, dentists are now able to claim for more frequent examinations for those few patients where it is clinically necessary.

This and the other dental reforms have been supported by an unprecedented level of Government investment, which is set to increase by over 19 per cent. over two years&#151;2005&#150;06 over 2003&#150;04&#151;resulting in an extra spend of over &#163;250 million a year in primary care dentistry.

Notes:<br>

1.Registration rates (i.e. the percentage of the population registered with a dentist) have been estimated by including registrations in the area of the dentist according to the postcode of the dental surgery (not the patient&#039;s address). So the registration rates for some areas may be affected by some patients receiving dental treatment in a different area from the one in which they live.<br>

2.The registration rates use population estimates for the primary care trust (PCT) areas for the nearest year for which data are available. Figures for 1997&#150;2000 have been calculated from 2001 population data. Figures for 2004 and 2005 have been calculated from 2003 population data as this is the most up to date available.<br>

3.The number of registrations are based on a snapshot of the registration database taken at the end of March each year (September for 1995 and 1996) and subsequent retrospective notifications of changes to registrations have not been included.<br>

4.Some double counting may occur in the totals when a patient has been newly registered with a dentist in PCT A, but not yet de-registered from a dentist in PCT B.<br>

5.The changes in the registration period from two years to 15 months under the General Dental Services from 1 September 1996 affected the registration number from December 1997 onwards, so the 1997 figures are not comparable with later figures.<br>

6.Most PDS schemes that have registrations have a re-registration period in excess of fifteen months, so the figures for PDS scheme; are generally higher than they would have been for the same attendance pattern under GDS.<br>

7.Some PDS schemes do not have any registrations, e.g. dental access centres and their patients will not therefore be included in these figures.<br>

8.There are a small number of unallocated registrations.<br>

 The proposed changes to national health service dentistry, as announced on 7 July 2005, would create a new system for the residents of Portsmouth, as for the rest of the country, which would reduce the maximum cost of NHS dental treatment by more than half while maintaining the existing exemptions for children under 18, new mothers and those on income related benefits. These exemptions cover 25 per cent, of all adult treatments provided by the NHS. They would move from 400 individual charges to three price bands, thereby creating a simpler pricing structure and ensure that patients know how much they are being charged and what treatment they will receive for their money on the NHS.

 The Department is fully committed to the equality and diversity agenda and has policies and processes in place to ensure that there is no unfair discrimination on any grounds. The equality and human rights group, formerly the equality strategy group, was established in 2002 to develop policy and support and promote equality and diversity within the Department and the national health service. It had a central programme budget of &#163;1.3 million in 2002&#150;03, &#163;1.1 million in 2003&#150;04 and &#163;1.12 million in 2004&#150;05. A major focus of the group&#039;s work is to support action that builds equality and diversity into the design and delivery of all health and social care programmes and into the capacity of the health and social care workforce to provide individually appropriate services. The promotion of equality and diversity has therefore become an integral component within many wider policy initiatives, such that it is not possible to disaggregate spending.

 The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 establishes a bespoke insolvency and dissolution regime for national health service foundation trusts (NHSFTs), which is based on insolvency rules for companies but with specific modifications applied to safeguard staff and assets required to deliver essential NHS services.
</p>

<a name="stpa_996">The Act gives Monitor, the statutory name of which is the Independent Regulator of NHS foundation trusts, powers of intervention if a NHSFT is significantly breaching, or has significantly breached its terms of authorisation or any enactment. In most cases, intervention should avert the failure of an NHSFT for financial reasons. However if an NHSFT does fail financially and Monitor considers that the essential NHS services of the NHSFT are at risk, then it may recommend that the NHSFT is dissolved.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50912117.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_997">The Secretary of State is able to dissolve a NHSFT in certain specified circumstances, based on a judgement by Monitor that further exercise of its statutory powers will not secure the provision of the essential NHS services that the body is required to provide under its terms of authorisation. Under such circumstances, the Secretary of State would have the power to transfer the assets, rights and liabilities of the NHSFT to another health service body, which may include another NHSFT, or to herself. It is our intention to lay secondary legislation detailing the failure regime later this year. Section 27 of the Act also sets out the circumstances under which an NHSFT might merge with another.

 Our current assessment of the impact on business of the European Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products is set out in the updated partial regulatory impact assessment included with the public consultation document MLX 325. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has given the industry extensive help in preparing for the Directive, for example, via early website guidance, workshops, individual company meetings and dialogue with the herbal manufacturing industry&#039;s herbal forum. The MHRA has also advised the herbal forum on the possibilities for industry to make a reasoned case to the relevant European scientific committee, the Herbal Medicinal Products Committee, if it sees a need for further elaboration or adjustment of the European guidelines on herbal medicinal products.

 In most cases, it is not currently possible for consumers to tell which herbal medicines are made to acceptable standards of safety, quality and patient information, irrespective of the means by which they are sold. While unlicensed herbal medicines purchased over the internet and by mail order may be of variable standards, many of the unsafe unlicensed medicines found on the United Kingdom market by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency have been sold or supplied in clinics or other retail outlets. Following the European Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products, the introduction of a registration scheme for traditional herbal medicines, alongside licensed herbal medicines, should progressively allow consumers to make an informed choice from a wider range of herbal medicines made to assured standards.

<sup>(204)</sup>Data was collected by health authority only prior to 2001&#150;02. Trust level data was collected from 2001&#150;02 onwards.<br>

Notes:<br>

1.A last minute cancellation is one that occurs on the day the patient was due to arrive, after they have arrived in hospital or on the day of their operation. For example, a patient is to be admitted to hospital on a Monday for an operation scheduled for the following day (Tuesday). If the hospital cancels his/her operation for non-clinical reasons on the Monday, then this would count as a last minute cancellation. This includes patients who have not actually arrived in hospital and have been telephoned at home prior to their arrival.<br>

2.An operation which is rescheduled to a time within 24 hours of the original scheduled operation should be recorded as a postponement and not as a cancellation. The QMCO collection does not record the number of postponements.<br>

3.Some common non-clinical reasons for cancellations by the hospital include: ward beds unavailable; surgeon unavailable; emergency case needing theatre; theatre list over-ran; equipment failure; admin error; anaesthetist unavailable; theatre staff unavailable; and critical care bed unavailable.<br>

Notes:<br>

1.&#039;Healthcare&quot; is the total commissioning of primary and secondary healthcare accounted for by the HAs and PCTs.<br>





2.&#039;Administration&quot; includes an analysis of the costs of administrative staff and certain managers in the relevant PCTs and HAs. Figures for 2002&#150;03 are not available.<br>

3.&#039;Prescriptions&#039; is the total cost relating to prescribing within the areas accounted for by the HAs and PCTs.<br>

4.Expenditure is taken from audited HA summarisation forms and PCT summarisation schedules, which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The figures have not been adjusted for inflation.<br>

5.Figures for 1996&#150;97 to 2001&#150;02 have been prepared using gross expenditure figures. Figures for 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 have been adjusted to eliminate expenditure which would be double counted where an authority acts as a lead in commissioning healthcare or other services.<br>

In recognition of these changes since the launch of the NSF in 2001, Ian Philp, national director responsible for older people&#039;s services at the Department, will, in the autumn, present a Next steps&quot; document, suggesting how the significant momentum that has been generated since the launch of the NSF can be maintained.

 Regulatory and scientific requirements on the testing strategies for new medicinal products have been established at European and international levels. The Note for Guidance on Non-clinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of human Clinical Trials for Pharmaceuticals (CPMP/ICH/286/95)&quot; provides guidance as to what safety tests are required before a medicinal product enters the different stages of a clinical trial program. These safety tests in animals are needed to establish the safety and toxicological profile of a medicinal product before it is used in man. As a result of these tests, a large number of potential medicinal products never make it to use in man because their toxicological profile is unacceptable. These tests serve an essential role in the development of medicines. Therefore, we will not make it our policy to end the requirement for safety testing in animals.

 Compensation for pain and suffering following unsuccessful operations is available where clinical negligence is proved to have occurred. However, the fact that an operation has been unsuccessful does not imply that the healthcare professionals concerned have failed in their duty of care towards the patient. Patients are advised pre-operatively of the possible consequences of operations and sign a consent form to say that they have been alerted to potential risks during and following surgery.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50912135.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_1113">Claims for clinical negligence incurred by national health service bodies are managed by the NHS Litigation Authority, which is a special health authority set up by the Secretary of State for Health. The authority administers the current clinical negligence scheme for trusts, set up under Section 21 of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990. For a claim to be successful, the claimant must show that he/she is owed a duty of care, that the duty was breached and that the breach caused or contributed materially to the injury for which he/she is claiming compensation.

 Working Together: Securing a Quality Workforce for the NHS&quot;, published in 1999, required national health service trusts to set targets for reducing incidents of violence and aggression by 20 per cent. by 2001 and 30 per cent. by 2003. The targets were subsequently incorporated into the Improving Working Lives&quot; standard, launched in October 2000, which all acute, mental health and ambulance trusts were required to put into practice by April 2003. By March 2002, 20 per cent. of trusts had achieved the 20 per cent. reduction target.

In November 2003, the SMS introduced a comprehensive range of proactive and reactive measures to tackle violence against NHS staff. The SMS has begun a programme of work to identify the nature, scale and extent of violence against NHS staff. Following the introduction of this new programme, NHS trusts have not been required to report on the 30 per cent. target set under previous programmes.

Notes:<br>

1.A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the datayear. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

2.The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

3.The main operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, e.g. time waited, but the figures for all operations count of episodes&quot; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.<br>

4.Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data&#151;(i.e. the data is un-grossed).<br>

5.Time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period, whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) if she will list current proposals for ward closures and bed closures at NHS hospitals, including foundation hospitals, known to her Department;  [11695]

</p>



<p><a name="qnpa_140">(2) what assessment she has made of whether any proposals for ward or bed closures in NHS hospitals are the result of patients being treated under NHS contracts at private hospitals. [11696]</p>







<p><a name="st_1289"><a name="50912136.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Byrne  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 12 July 2005]:</i> Decisions on whether to close wards or beds are a matter for determination by local national health service organisations. The Department does not routinely collect this information and as such no assessment can be made of the reasons for any such closures locally.

<a name="stpa_1118">For the first wave of independent sector procurement, additional activity over and above growth in the NHS was secured using the independent sector. In addition, some activity was transferred to the independent sector to free up capacity in NHS facilities. These decisions, and decisions on where to site independent sector treatment centres, were taken in full consultation with strategic health authorities.
