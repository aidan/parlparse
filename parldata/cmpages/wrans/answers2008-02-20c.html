 There has been no specific assessment of the requirement placed on lone parents to meet child care and travel costs in full under the jobseeker&#146;s allowance regime. A full impact assessment of the changes, including impacts on child poverty, announced in Ready for Work was published in &#147;Ready for work: full employment in our generation&#151;impact assessment&#148; in December 2007 which is in the Library. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_466"><a name="80220w0013.htm_para0"><a name="08022138000119">However, lone parents who have genuine reasons, or good cause, for not complying with their obligations to look for, or take up, work will not be penalised. Good cause could include a variety of reasons depending on the circumstances of the individual. For example, problems with child care, illness of themselves or their children or their child care support, transport difficulties, unforeseen family circumstances, domestic violence or relationship breakdown could all be considered as a good cause. However, this will not be a general &#145;opt-out&#146; for those who would prefer to be on benefits.</p>

 The north east London district was one of the six Jobcentre Plus districts that participated in the Employment Retention and Advancement Demonstration project (ERA), which operated between October 2003 and November 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_470"><a name="80220w0013.htm_para4"><a name="08022138000180">ERA was evaluated using a random assignment research method and customers in the six districts were allocated on a voluntary basis to either a group that received the ERA service, or to a control group that did not. The impact of the programme was determined by comparing the subsequent behaviour and outcomes of both groups. It was not possible to offer the in-work credit to customers in the districts participating in ERA until the programme was complete without invalidating the evaluation.</p>

This form of evaluation is dependent on the two groups being identical in every aspect other than receiving the programme being tested, so it was not possible to offer the IWC to the control group alone.</p>

In November 2006 we asked officials to look at the social security benefit rules in place for the treatment of valid polygamous marriages and consider whether any changes were needed.

The other three were opened since September 2006 and will be inspected, as usual, in the second year of operation.

 The Department allocates capital funding to local authorities and schools, and relies on them to prioritise how this should be spent. It expects local authorities and schools to prepare their own asset management plans which set out how resources from the Department, and other resources available locally, should be used. It does not maintain central records of changes made to Milton Keynes or other authorities&#146; asset management plans.</p>

 Legal aid covers a number of different areas of justice, and the extent to which applicants&#146; financial circumstances are taken into account in granting legal aid varies considerably across these areas. It is therefore not possible to give figures for the number of people eligible for legal aid as a whole. However, some estimates of the likely number that would be eligible are available for certain areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_538"><a name="80220w0018.htm_para6"><a name="080221111001351">In criminal cases, all those arrested in England and Wales are eligible to receive free advice and assistance at the police station. Defendants are financially eligible for representation in the Crown Court, subject to judicial discretion to recover costs. We estimate that around half the population of England and Wales would be financially eligible to receive legal aid in magistrates courts cases following the introduction of the means test in October 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_539"><a name="80220w0018.htm_para7"><a name="080221111001352">Prior to April 2001 there was a legal aid contribution scheme in operation for criminal cases. The court decided the level of contributions according to the defendant's means. Estimates of eligibility levels under this scheme would be available only at disproportionate cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_540"><a name="80220w0018.htm_para8"><a name="080221111001353">The following table provides estimates of the proportion of the population of England and Wales that were in principle financially eligible for civil legal aid in those categories for which financial circumstances are taken into account in each of the past 10 years where figures are available. However, decisions on granting of legal aid also depend on the merits of the case, while some areas of civil law are not now covered by legal aid. The decline over recent years in the proportion of the population eligible for civil legal aid is likely to reflect increases in general levels of prosperity, changes to the structure of the benefits system, demographic changes, and also the Government&#146;s drive to focus legal aid support on the most vulnerable people in society and to achieve the more effective delivery of civil legal aid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_541"><a name="80220w0018.htm_para9"><a name="080221111001354">More effective delivery is evidenced by the number of acts of assistance of civil legal aid not declining in parallel with eligibility over the last 10 years and increasing significantly from 856,000 in 2004-05 to 1,137,000 in 2006-07. Moreover, cash expenditure on civil legal aid (excluding immigration and asylum legal help whose costs reflect the volume of people arriving), rose from &#163;615 million in 2001-02 to &#163;730 million in 2006-07.</p>

 Alcohol disorder zones (ADZs) are designed to tackle the problem of alcohol-related crime and disorder in the worst affected parts of town and city centres through a focus on the public space and/or the management of certain licensed premises. There will be no maximum levy that may be imposed on licensed premises, but the purposes to which the money raised can be put will be regulated, and the money raised will have to be spent on additional enforcement services which are over and above the baseline levels already in place.</p>

However, it is unlikely that all areas which move to the action planning phase will continue to implement the full ADZ, as it is expected that as progress is made towards reducing alcohol- related crime and disorder, a significant proportion of ADZs will not proceed further than the action planning phase.</p>

 Dental fluorosis is a cosmetic effect with no implications for systemic (general) health. It may nevertheless, in a small minority of cases, give people concerns about the appearance of their teeth. A research project reported in the British Dental Journal (volume 189 No 4 August 26 2000) on the prevalence of fluorosis of children who had been continuous residents in fluoridated Newcastle or non-fluoridated Northumberland found that 54 per cent. of children in water fluoridated areas had fluorosis and 23 per cent. in the fluoride deficient areas. In response to the advice from the American Dental Association, we are to investigate the aesthetic impact of fluorosis. We are funding a research project involving the use of intra-oral cameras and automated software to obtain consistent readings in surveys of levels of dental fluorosis. If, as we expect, the project is successful, the researchers will use the photographs to obtain the views of a representative sample of people on the appearance of teeth with fluorosis at different levels of severity.</p>

 Data are not available on which to base a valid estimate of the number of heart attacks, strokes and other adverse effects that may have been caused by Vioxx and other COX-2 inhibitors. The underlying medical condition of many patients treated with COX-2 inhibitors means that they are already at higher risk of heart attack and stroke than the rest of the population, and the impact of the COX-2 inhibitor on this risk is not possible to calculate.</p>

The latest evidence suggests that both NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors might pose a small increased risk of heart attacks or strokes, although the exact level of risk may vary between medicines. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has widely communicated the latest information and advice for healthcare professionals in letters and bulletins, and other publications through liaison with the British National Formulary and National Prescribing Centre. In addition, product information (including patient information leaflets) has been updated in order to support informed decision-making in relation to the choice of anti-inflammatory medicine.</p>

A national suicide prevention strategy for England was launched by the Department of Health in September 2002 with the aim of supporting the target to substantially reduce the mortality rate from suicide and undetermined injury by at least 20 per cent. by 2010.</p>

The independent Byron review is looking into helping children and young people get the most from the internet whilst protecting them from inappropriate and potentially harmful material.</p>

The Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) programme was created to develop all children and young people's social and emotional skills at school, which help to underpin emotional wellbeing. SEAL will be supported by an extra &#163;13.7 million over four years, on top of the &#163;7 million a year already confirmed, and the aim is that by 2010-11 SEAL will be available to all schools nationally. In addition from April we will invest an additional &#163;60 million over three years to support schools to work with mental health practitioners and strengthen the provision of targeted mental health services for children and adolescents. We also announced plans in 2007 for an independent review of CAMHS.</p>
