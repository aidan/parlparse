The UK argued that the treaty does not apply to the use of nuclear energy for military activities and that therefore it was under no duty to provide the Commission with data on the decommissioning. The European Court of Justice found that the Euratom treaty is not applicable to uses of nuclear energy for military purposes and held that article 37 did not apply to the decommissioning of the Jason reactor.

 The future aircraft carrier project is in its assessment phase, the aim of which is to inform how best to meet our developing capability requirements and to balance the key parameters of performance, time and cost. The complement and displacement of the carriers form part of that assessment and final decisions on these and other main specifications have yet to be taken. Such details, together with estimated costs, are being constantly refined and it would be unhelpful to focus on specific figures until after the main investment decision.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list UK armed forces units hatted for potential deployment with <i>(a)</i> EU and <i>(b)</i> NATO units.  [16073]</p>

 The Government declare forces to NATO and the EU through the Defence Planning Questionnaire and Force Catalogue respectively. The declarations entail that those forces are earmarked as available in principle for potential deployment on NATO or EU operations. Any actual decision to deploy is taken by the Government, voluntarily and on a case-by-case basis. However the Government are committed under article V of the North Atlantic Treaty to deployment in collective defence as required.

 The European Defence Agency was formally established on 12 July 2004 by a unanimous Heads of State and Government decision. It was established under the Council Joint Action 2004/551/CFSP on the basis of Article 14 of the Treaty on the European Union.

The European Defence Agency (EDA) has a number of workstrands under way that are intended to improve the effectiveness of the European Defence Equipment Market (EDEM), including the possible introduction of a voluntary intergovernmental code of conduct. While this work is not intended specifically at removing duplication, we would expect through a more competitive and efficient EDEM that market forces would have a beneficial impact on surplus capacity and inefficiencies. More generally the EDA intends to look at future demand and capacity in various sectors of the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (such as armoured fighting vehicles), as well as member states&#039; national strategies for these areas, which may lead to recommendations for improving the efficiency in these sectors. However it will be for each member state to decide how or indeed whether to take these forward.

<a name="stpa_8">Our work to formulate a national defence industrial strategy, recently announced by the Minister for Defence Procurement, will identify those industrial capabilities that we wish to retain within the UK in order to ensure appropriate sovereignty and/or contribute to collaborative efforts. We expect to make a major announcement on this work by the end of 2005, along with our initial conclusions on specific sectors. The strategy is one of many initiatives that contribute to the wider aim of ensuring that the capability requirements of the armed forces can be met, now and in the future, on a cost-effective basis.

 The Government&#039;s main mechanism for supporting renewable energy is the Renewables Obligation. The Renewables Obligation, which requires electricity suppliers to source a proportion of their electricity sales from eligible sources of renewable energy, is technology neutral. However, as a market-based mechanism, the Obligation rewards the most cost effective renewable energy sources. As wind energy is the most economically competitive form of renewable technology with scope for expansion, it is likely that most new renewable capacity between now and 2010 will be wind generation (both onshore and offshore).

There might be times when there is no Welsh speaker available who can answer the query in full, especially if it is complex or specialised. In these cases, the caller will be given the option of discussing the matter in English or writing to us in Welsh&#151;in which case, they would receive a written reply in Welsh.

If they receive a call from someone wishing to speak Welsh, the operator will explain that he or she cannot speak Welsh but will offer to try to connect the caller to a Welsh speaker within the department. If none of our Welsh speakers was available, the operator would explain that this was so and offer the caller the option of continuing the conversation in English, or of leaving their details so that a Welsh speaker could ring back later.

<a name="stpa_106">The HIPC initiative provides relief and cancellation of debts owed to multilateral institutions as well as debts to bilateral governments. To date, debt relief worth $56 billion (&#163;30 billion) in nominal terms has been agreed for 28 countries. Other countries are likely to enter the Initiative next year under its extended &quot;Sunset clause&quot;. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimate that in recent years the HIPC Initiative has freed up around $1 billion a year from debt service payments for the 28 countries that have qualified under HIPC. The UK is the second largest contributor to the HIPC Trust Fund, which assists multilateral institutions with the costs of providing debt relief under HIPC. We have pledged a total of $436 million (&#163;240 million) to the Trust Fund ($221 million, plus $88 million of the European Commission contribution in 2000, and a further $95 million, plus $32 million of an EC contribution in 2002).

We expect to spend about $46 million (&#163;25 million) on qualifying countries this financial year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w16.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_110">In June 2005, the G8 Finance Ministers endorsed a proposal to cancel all the remaining debts of HIPCs to the IMF, IDA and the AfDF. When agreed by the international community, the deal will be worth about $55 billion (&#163;30 billion) in debt stock cancellations for the current 38 HIPCs. Donors will provide about $49 billion of this over the next 40 years to IDA and AfDF to compensate for foregone reflows. The cost of debt relief at the IMF ($6.1 billion) will be financed from internal resources, although the donors have committed to provide additional resources if needed to ensure that the IMF&#039;s ability to assist poor countries is not diminished. Annual resources for poverty reduction freed up by the proposal will be around $1 billion in 2007, rising to around $1.7 billion in 2010.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w16.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_111">The precise costs to the UK of the G8 proposal are yet to finalised, but are likely to be about $6 billion (&#163;3.3 billion) over the whole 40-year period of implementation. The G8&#039;s proposal, when agreed, will supersede the MDRI for HIPCs, although the UK will continue to meet its obligations under the MDRI to qualifying non-HIPC countries. Assistance under the MDRI is likely to be worth $184 million (&#163;100 million) over the period to 2015 for currently qualifying countries, and up to $463 million (&#163;256 million) if all potentially eligible countries qualify.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w16.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_112">G8 Finance Ministers also reiterated in June their continued commitment to the full implementation and financing of HIPC. The UK already exceeds its commitments under HIPC. Our commitment to HIPC and other bilateral debt cancellation policies continue and were not altered by the G8 Finance Ministers&#039; decisions in June.

 DFID relies on the joint united programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) for official figures on children affected by HIV. UNAIDS has the global mandate for collating and publishing official statistics on global and sub-Saharan African AIDS epidemics. They publish an annual epidemiological update, which outlines the status of the global and regional AIDS epidemics. However, UNAIDS does not release specific data on future projections, due to methodological constraints. As such, DFID has neither made nor received projections of the number of children infected by HIV in each year up to 2015.

At least &#163;150 million has been earmarked for orphans and vulnerable children, 80 per cent. of which will be spent in Africa. For example, we are supporting UNICEF with an estimated &#163;38 million over three years to assist the worst affected countries in east and southern Africa and some post- conflict countries, to take essential steps to develop and implement comprehensive national action plans.

 Sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning, are some of the most cost-effective and beneficial health service interventions available. However, the unmet need for condoms, and other methods of family planning, is very high. The United Nations population fund (UNFPA) estimates that global condom needs for prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections is around &#163;9 billion annually. Every year there are 340 million new cases of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Most occur in young people. Many go untreated.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w19.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_134">DFID is working to change this situation. We work with governments and others to help poor countries develop and implement their own national strategies to overturn the HIV epidemic and to promote sexual and reproductive health and rights. As for so many other aspects of basic health, improving sexual and reproductive health depends on well functioning health systems and improving the access of people to supplies such as condoms. We believe that effective HIV prevention programmes include providing universal access to sexual and reproductive health information and services including condoms. We also believe that it is important to make special efforts to ensure that those who are most vulnerable have access to these services. This includes sex workers.

<p>
<a name="51010w19.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_135">DFID provides significant support for reproductive health commodities including condoms, through its country programmes and assistance to multilateral organisations such as the UNFPA. The UNFPA estimates that some one billion condoms supplied by donors were used in developing countries in 2001. Nearly half of these were provided by the UK. For the past 10 years, DFID has been the fourth largest provider of condoms, supporting the distribution of about 150 million condoms annually. We are currently looking at a sustainable long-term response to reproductive health commodity shortages with other donors, in order to provide a more predictable basis for the funding and availability of these essential supplies.

 There is a strong link between Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) and HIV infection, particularly in Africa where unsafe sex is the main mode of HIV transmission. DFID supports raising awareness as an integral part of broader approaches to STI and HIV prevention, which include other activities such as provision of sexual and reproductive health services and commodities (e.g. male and female condoms). We are also helping to remove financial, social and geographical barriers to the poorer populations, accessing information, health services and commodities; we also advocate against stigma and discrimination related to HIV.

 DFID recognises the important role that parliaments in developing countries can play in the scrutiny of the management of public resources, including aid agreements entered into by the respective governments.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w21.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_144">However, DFID has not provided support specifically for parliamentary scrutiny of the terms and conditions of aid agreements but we are currently working with many African countries to support and strengthen parliamentary oversight bodies, e.g. Public Accounts Committees and Supreme Audit Institutions such as National Audit Offices. These are the key links in the formal system of financial accountability in most countries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w21.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_145">This support includes assistance in Malawi for strengthening the institution of parliament to have powers over state spending, the budget and taxation. In Zambia, a new multi-donor public financial management reform programme, to which DFID is contributing, includes a component to enhance a parliamentary oversight of public resource management. In Uganda, together with other donors, DFID has supported the Office for Parliamentary Development, which has helped to strengthen the parliament, including by the provision of training for parliamentarians.

 DFID recognises the importance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank being transparent and accountable to parliaments in developing countries. Clearly, such accountability needs to be at the heart of their relationship.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w21.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_146">The main means by which parliaments should engage with the World Bank and the IMF activities is through the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) process. This is a national strategy for development that sets the agenda, which donors, including the World Bank, should follow in each country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w21.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_147">In the past, parliamentary engagement in the PRS process has often been weak. However, over the past two years, DFID country offices have begun to support 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Oct 2005 : Column 74W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
stronger involvement of parliamentarians in the PRS process. DFID is providing support for parliamentary engagement in Malawi and Tanzania, where an independent monitoring group was established to oversee the joint commitments made around the PRS.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w21.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_148">At board meetings, DFID encourages the World Bank and IMF to engage with parliaments as much as possible. We also actively push for them to make more of their documents public and will continue to pursue this both at board meetings and in discussions with staff. In fact, in March this year a new World Bank disclosure policy was approved which, among other things, makes board minutes public. The World Bank is now working closely with parliamentarians in some of its borrowing member countries to involve them in the design and implementation of its lending programmes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w21.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_149">The World Bank Institute has a major Parliamentary Strengthening Programme. A key objective is to strengthen the capacity of parliaments to scrutinise the allocation and use of public funds, and oversee the PRS. Since it began in 1996, it has held workshops in a range of countries including Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ghana, Kenya, Indonesia and Uganda to raise awareness among parliamentarians.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w21.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_150">The World Bank Institute has also supported the African Parliamentarians Network Against Corruption (APNAC) and the Global Organization of Parliamentarians against Corruption (GOPAC) to encourage parliamentary scrutiny and action against corruption.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w21.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_151">Outside the PRS, the main means of oversight is the Parliamentary Network on the World Bank. This provides opportunities for parliaments to scrutinise the World Bank and engage more deeply in development policy issues. The independent network has some 450 members from over 90 countries and facilitates direct dialogue between parliamentarians and the World Bank to achieve greater transparency of policies and practices.

<p><a name="st_154"><a name="51010w21.html_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 In December 2004 the UK agreed a new poverty reduction budget support (PRBS) arrangement with Uganda which provides a grant of up to &#163;145 million over three years to support the implementation of the Uganda Government&#039;s poverty eradication action plan (PEAP). We indicated at that time that &#163;40 million would be set aside as PRBS in the financial year 2004&#150;05.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w21.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_152">The arrangement links budget support to reforms detailed in the PEAP. It includes criteria on Uganda&#039;s political transition to multiparty politics, which will help maintain the stability required to make progress in reducing poverty, alongside criteria relating to macro-economic and sector policies and management. All the indicators are drawn from the PEAP and are designed to ensure our support is transparent and predictable. When our last release of budget support fell due in March 2005 we were concerned by several aspects of the political transition, including that insufficient progress had been made towards establishing a fair basis for a multi-party system. We, therefore, decided to withhold &#163;5 million out of the total of &#163;40 million for the financial year.

<p><a name="st_155"><a name="51010w21.html_spnew4"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The conflict in northern Uganda severely disrupts normal economic activity and for the moment constrains economic recovery. Over 90 per cent. of the population in the districts that are most affected are currently displaced and dependent upon humanitarian relief. We are providing substantial humanitarian support in response to this need. In 2004&#150;05 we provided over &#163;11 million of emergency assistance which was channelled mainly through the World Food Programme, UNICEF and the Red Cross. In 2005&#150;06 a further &#163;3 million for emergency assistance has already been committed and more is planned. The UK and other donors are discussing with the Government what assistance will be required to support economic recovery in the north once the security situation has sufficiently improved.

<p><a name="st_156"><a name="51010w21.html_spnew5"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 In recent years, we have provided resources for UNICEF&#039;s humanitarian programmes in northern Uganda, which includes support for emergency education provision and vocational training. In total, we provided &#163;650,000 for UNICEF&#039;s work in northern Uganda in 2002&#150;03, &#163;1.62 million in 2003&#150;04 and &#163;1.37 million in 2004&#150;05.

 A high proportion of the disposable cups and take-away containers currently used by the House of Commons Refreshment Department are potentially recyclable. However, because they are all inherently contaminated with foodstuffs and there are very limited facilities for the separation of waste, there is little opportunity for effective recycling of these items other than by incineration to generate electricity, as presently happens.

Bidders have been asked in general to propose materials and packaging that deliver environmental benefits and, specifically, to propose disposable catering cups and take-away food containers that are more readily recyclable. The waste management contract is also in the process of being re-tendered by the Parliamentary Estates Directorate and arrangements for the better separation of waste are being reviewed as part of this process.

 Two legislative proposals relating to harmonisation of social legislation relating to road transport are currently being negotiated within the EU institutions. The first is a proposal to replace the existing rules on drivers&#039; hours as contained in EU Regulation (EEC No. 3820/85). The second is a proposed directive (known as the &quot;enforcement directive&quot;) to replace the current requirements relating to the levels of checks member states must undertake to ensure compliance with the driver&#039;s hours rules.

<a name="stpa_13">The transport council reached a political agreement on both these proposals on 11 June 2004, and the Common Positions were formally adopted on 9 December 2004. Under the Common Position on driver&#039;s hours the main changes proposed for the core provisions on driving and rest times are:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">an increase in the minimum uninterrupted daily rest period from 8 to 9 hours (plus changes to the way total daily rest is taken);.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48">2. While these figures represent gross payments actually made to the barristers during the year, some of those monies have been (or may in the future be) repaid to the Community Legal Service Fund by other parties. This will happen in cases where the legally aided party wins the case and recovers costs from the opponent. Once those costs are recovered the legally aided party&#039;s solicitor refunds some or all of the money to the CLS Fund. As a consequence the figures may not reflect the actual cost of the barristers&#039; fees to the Fund. In some cases where costs are recovered from the losing party the actual cost to the CLS Fund may be very little or even nothing.</p>

<a name="stpa_63">On 29 August, the executive director of the UNODC Costa announced provisional cultivation and production figures for 2004&#150;05 from their annual poppy survey. They estimated that opium production was around 4,100 metric tonnes (mt), a decrease of only 100 tonnes (2.4 per cent.) compared to 2004. Good weather and an absence of crop disease were responsible for a significant increase in yield since last year. UNODC will publish their final report in October, but these figures are unlikely to change. The yield figures are disappointing, but the cultivation figures give a better picture of farmers&#039; intentions (a 21 per cent. reduction in poppy cultivation from 131,000 hectares (ha) in 2003&#150;04 to 104,000 ha in 2004&#150;05).

<p><a name="st_94"><a name="51010w34.html_spnew2"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 In July 2000, the Taliban imposed a ban on opium poppy cultivation. By July 2001, the tactics they employed had led to a 91 per cent. reduction. This ban was enforced with a combination of fear and bribery, and led to a rise in the price of opium so that those with opium stockpiles profited, many of whom colluded with the Taliban Government.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w34.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_64">The lack of a viable central state and war-damaged infrastructure in Afghanistan created conditions in which opium cultivation could thrive once again. Opium is highly profitable for those controlling land, and for the warlords and Governors controlling peripheral parts of this mountainous country. There has been little incentive for them to engage with the embryonic central state and, until recently, government institutions have been unable to impact on the trade. President Karzai, with support from the international community, is working hard to change this and is increasing central government presence in the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Oct 2005 : Column 117W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
provinces. The President has made clear that eliminating opium is vital for Afghanistan&#039;s future and is key to stability.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w34.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_65">Progress has been made. The provisional cultivation and production figures for 2004&#150;05 announced by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in August show an estimated 21 per cent. reduction in poppy cultivation over the previous year. Production and yield, however, are expected to be down since last year by only 2.4 per cent. as good weather and an absence of crop disease brought about a significant increase in yield. It is going to take a long time to uproot something so deeply entrenched in Afghanistan&#039;s culture and economy. But like the Afghans, the UK has always maintained that we are in this for the long term.

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary last had discussions with the Government of Sri Lanka on the peace process when he met Foreign Minister Kadirgamar in London on 14 March. The tragic assassination of Mr. Kadirgamar on 12 August was an unconscionable act of terrorism which we and our international partners have condemned unreservedly. This and the ongoing violence in Eastern Sri Lanka have put the Ceasefire Agreement in Sri Lanka under increasing strain and the peace process is facing its most serious challenge since the Ceasefire Agreement came into force in 2002. It is incumbent on both the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the Government of Sri Lanka to implement the Ceasefire Agreement fully.

<a name="stpa_80">In statements on 19 September and 26 September respectively the Tokyo Co-Chairs, including the UK as the EU Presidency, and the EU condemned the LTTE&#039;s continuing use of violence and called on the LTTE to take immediate public steps to demonstrate their commitment to the peace process and their willingness to change. An immediate end to political assassinations and the recruitment of child soldiers would be two such steps. It is essential that the LTTE responds. The European Union has also made clear that delegations from the LTTE will no longer be received in any of the EU member states until further notice. The EU is also actively considering the listing of the LTTE as an organisation engaged in terrorism (the UK has proscribed the LTTE since 2001). We also deplore the activities of paramilitary groups which fuel the cycle of violence and unrest. The Government of Sri Lanka have a responsibility under the Ceasefire Agreement to disarm or relocate these groups from the north and east.

Steps were taken to launch a new Commission for Rural Communities division as a distinct body within the Countryside Agency&#039;s legal framework on 9 March 2005, pending the passage of legislation to establish the Commission as a statutory body in its own right. The Regulatory Impact Assessment for the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill contained an estimate of around &#163;458,000 for the cost incurred in 2004&#150;05 for the establishment and launch of the Commission.

<p>
<a name="51010w42.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_144">PVR I is required at all UK petrol stations with sales above 500 cubic metres of petrol a year. The PVR I controls should prevent all petrol vapour from this source escaping to the atmosphere. Statutory guidance reflects the mandatory requirements relating to the technical standards systems must meet when installed. The guidance also specifies the maintenance regime which must be carried out to ensure PVR I systems continue to operate effectively. Local authorities carry out periodic inspections of petrol stations to ensure compliance with the requirements.

<p>
<a name="51010w42.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_145">Research has shown that PVR II systems under laboratory conditions can reduce emissions of petrol vapour to air by around 85 per cent. We are considering whether to require some petrol stations to install PVR II equipment.

 The Department&#039;s current estimate for the number of plastic bags given away in England between these dates is 66.8 billion bags. This estimate is based around a figure of 10 billion per annum for UK carrier bag usage, contained within a consultant&#039;s report for WRAP in 2005. This figure was cited by in the Scottish Executive&#039;s Extended Impact Assessment for the plastic bag levy bill. The figure for England per annum is generated by calculating the proportion of the UK population that live in England (currently 83.5 per cent.) and adjusting the UK figure accordingly. In calculating this figure over several years it has to be assumed that the figures have been constant since 1997 as we do not hold any data relating to the fluctuations in usage over this period.

<a name="stpa_273">To encourage the provision of private and occupational pensions that work for women, we introduced part-time workers regulations which ensure that terms and conditions of employment, including those related to access to occupational pension schemes, do not discriminate against part-time workers. We have also introduced stakeholder pensions to offer a low-cost, portable and flexible pension option which can be particularly suitable for women taking career breaks. Measures in the Pensions Act 2004, such as new rules to increase the pension rights of early leavers, are also beneficial to women.

 Under the Private Finance Initiative, the estate of the former DSS, was transferred to the private sector in April 1998 for the provision of fully serviced accommodation. Following the formation of the Department for Work and Pensions, the estate of the former employment service became subject to the same partnership contract (known as PRIME) in December 2003. Within the contract, there are specific clauses that cover environmental impacts, and encourage the private sector partner to develop environmental improvements The Department&#039;s Estates partner&#151;Land Securities Trillium, whose Environmental Management System is accredited to International Standard ISO 14001, works closely with the DWP corporate Sustainable Development Team to identify opportunities for environmental improvements. The Sustainable Development Team contract manages this element of the partnership, and continually assesses performance. Regular partnership meetings are held between the Department and Land Securities Trillium to monitor progress.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w54.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_276">The partnership approach has enabled innovative measures to be developed&#151;such as the use of spend to save projects designed to improve energy and water efficiency across the estate, and a programme to maximise the recycling of paper waste. Full details of all measures can be found within the annual DWP Sustainable Development Report, to which Land Securities Trillium make a full contribution.

 The Department funds research to support policy and to provide the evidence needed to underpin quality improvement and service development in the national health service; and through the health technology assessment programme funds research into the effectiveness, appropriateness and cost of health treatment and prevention regimes. Over the last 10 years, research projects funded as part of these and other centrally funded programmes have included some 48 randomised controlled trials.

<p><a name="st_33"><a name="51010w60.html_spnew2"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 None. A placebo, in itself, would have no adverse effect and a national health service research ethics committee would be unlikely to approve a trial that denied participants the benefit of standard therapy that in doing so put them at greater than minimal risk.

 The national health service exists primarily for the benefit of people who live here lawfully. Arrangements have been in place since 1982 to charge anyone who is not ordinarily resident here for any NHS hospital treatment received. The current rules are set out in the NHS (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 1989, as amended. The Department conducted a wide-ranging review of the operation of the hospital charging regime during 2002&#150;03. This identified loopholes and implementation difficulties arising from changes in travel and migration patterns since the 1989 regulations were first introduced. Amendment regulations, to close the loopholes and make the regulations easier to operate, came into force in April 2004. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the hospital charging regime is being operated more effectively since that time. No further changes are currently planned.

Notes:<br>

1. A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the datayear. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

2. The main operation is the first recorded operation in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, eg. time waited, but the figures for &quot;all operations count of episodes&quot; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.<br>

3. Time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

4. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data is ungrossed).<br>

<sup>(74)</sup> Nominal.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Where &#163;1 nominal is quoted, the circumstances are typically that the ongoing management costs of or obligation of ownership extinguish any value.<br>

2. Some properties have yet to be valued and the entries for these are marked as n/k (not known).<br>

3. Estimates of value are necessarily provisional in nature. They will be subject to ongoing review so that any changes in circumstances, for instance to planning approvals, can be taken into account prior to disposal.<br>

4. Departments are obliged to keep their property holdings under continual review. Therefore, although the list of properties for disposal is accurate as regards current plans, it may be subject to future amendment.<br>

<sup>(76)</sup> The figures in column 2 were supplied by DARD and relate to the number of farm businesses in operation in Northern Ireland each year. The figure for 2005 is not yet available. The statistical definition of an operational farm used for this answer is as follows. &quot;All active farm businesses having one hectare or more of farmed land, whether owned, leased or taken in conacre, and those with under one hectare having any cattle, sheep or pigs or with significant poultry or horticultural activity. Landowners who lease out or rent out in conacre all of their land are not included.&quot;<br>





<sup>(77)</sup> These figures are based on the Standard Industrial Classification of agriculture e.g. &quot;arable and livestock farming, horticulture and all related services&quot;, and by definition therefore not all the people declared bankrupt under this classification could be regarded as farmers.<br>

<sup>(86)</sup> For the year 2000 the cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). The codes used by ONS to define alcohol-related deaths are listed below:<br>

291&#151;Alcoholic psychoses<br>

303&#151;Alcohol dependence syndrome<br>

305.0&#151;Non-dependent abuse of alcohol<br>

425.5&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

571&#151;Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis<br>

E860&#151;Accidental poisoning by alcohol.<br>

For the years 2001&#150;04 the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) was used. To maintain comparability with earlier years the following codes were used:<br>

F10&#151;Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<br>

142.6&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

K70&#151;Alcoholic liver disease<br>

K73&#151;Chronic hepatitis, not elsewhere classified<br>

K74&#151;Fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver<br>

X45&#151;Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol.<br>

Deaths were selected using the original underlying cause.<br>

The selection of codes to define alcohol-related deaths is described in:<br>

The response sets out Government policy on the matter in more detail. Like the Treasury Committee, we see charging cash machines as being a legitimate business model. The majority have been introduced recently in locations where previously there was no cash machine and where there would not be a sufficiently high number of transactions to support a free ATM. The Government does not believe there is evidence to suggest that free ATMs are under threat from charging machines as the number of free ATMs in the UK is still increasing. However, if evidence were found of a significant reduction in the number of free ATMs, then the Government would be concerned.

 The external routing interface component system (ERIC) is being delivered as part of the ASPIRE contract that HM Revenue and Customs has with Capgemini.

ERIC is part of the Modernising PAYE Processes for Customers (MPPC) programme. MPPC is a phased programme and the total business and IT projected costs for phase one, which incorporates ERIC, were &#163;164 million, over six years which includes both the set up and ongoing maintenance costs.

 As the Prime Minister pointed out in his statement to the House on 20 June 2005, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 523&#150;25, the Luxembourg Presidency proposal would have cost the UK &#8364;25 billion over the period of the next Financial Perspective. This estimate was calculated on the basis of European Commission figures. The Government&#039;s most recent forecast of the UK abatement and net contributions to the EC Budget, covering the period to 2007&#150;08, is given in Table 3.2 (page 15) of the annual &quot;European Community Finances&quot; White Paper (Cm 6580) published on 23 June 2005.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question concerning what assessment has been made of the statistical robustness of the methods used by Eurostat to estimate and allocate extra-regio shares of off-shore GDP. (15739)</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64">In 2001, the Office for National Statistics, along with 5 other EU Member States, participated in a Task Force set up by Eurostat to review a number of quality issues concerning Regional Accounts. The Task Force recommended that extra-regio GDP should be shown as a distinct item in the accounts and that regional GDP per head figures should therefore exclude that part of GDP attributed to extra-regio. The ONS considers that the Task Force recommendation is easy to implement and makes statistical sense. Apart from the assessment of the Task Force, I am unaware of any other assessment specifically made of Eurostat&#039;s treatment of extra-regio shares of GDP.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65">Eurostat&#039;s current treatment of extra-regio GDP, however, does not comply with the Task Force&#039;s recommendation; they allocate estimates of extra-regio GDP to regions pro rata to their share of national GDP. The Office for National Statistics regards this treatment as inconsistent with the European System of Accounts (ESA) regulation of 1995 and the European Commission&#039;s NUTS regulation (2003). The latter regulation specifically identifies extra-regio as a separate statistical entity and therefore any relevant statistics should be shown separately.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66">I should say, to avoid any doubt, that there is no difference between the ONS and Eurostat regarding the method used to estimate extra-regio shares of GDP; the ONS in fact supplies Eurostat with extra-regio estimations based on the 1995 ESA regulation.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67">My predecessor wrote to the Director General of Eurostat earlier in the year to argue that the extra-regio component of GDP should not be allocated to the regions of the Member State, in keeping with the Task Force recommendation and the intention and spirit of the NUTS regulation.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68">Eurostat have agreed that our concerns are well-founded and demand further examination.</p>

 Pension tax simplification replaces the numerous existing tax regimes with a universal regime for tax-privileged pension savings providing greater flexibility to some 15 million pension savers. Currently most pension funds may invest in property, and many do. Under the new simplified regime self-invested personal pensions (SIPPs) and small self-administered schemes (SSASs) may invest in all types of property including residential property from 6 April 2006. Around 200,000 people, compared to over 15 million pension scheme members, hold these specialist pension vehicles. Creating a single set of allowable investments across all pension schemes fits the requirement to create a single regime for tax privileged pension saving and corrects an existing distortion by giving investors greater choice.

Initial analysis suggests that in its first year, child tax credit achieved an estimated take-up rate of 80 per cent. by caseload, considerably higher than the take-up rate in the first full year of working families&#039; tax credit (62 to 65 per cent.) and the first year take-up rate for family credit (57 per cent.).

 The procurement policy of HM Treasury and HM Revenue and Custom&#039;s, covers timber used on and in the construction of departmental building projects. HMRC and HMT&#039;s procurement policy pays proper regard to environmental issues while still securing best value for money. Assessments of environmental impact and against sustainable development criteria are made by the Departments&#039; procurement staff, who consider environmental issues at the start of a procurement. Details of any environmental requirements that suppliers need to be aware of will always be included in our invitation to tender documents. To support the general greening Government policy, we would expect a potential supplier to have environmental management systems in place on the lines of ISO 14001, which is increasingly being adopted by the more responsible sections of industry.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what representations the Government have received from schools seeking its support in how to deal with bullying.  [15513]</p>




<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51010w92.html_spnew2"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 Between June 2004 and June 2005 the Department received approximately 1,300 calls from those seeking support on bullying, of which an estimated 70 per cent. are from parents. Unfortunately, since parents and schools contact the Department on an ad hoc basis we are unable to provide more specific data. Those wanting assistance and guidance are also able to make contact electronically, using the Department&#039;s dedicated anti-bullying mailbox. Since March 2005, the mailbox has received 13 requests for support directly from schools.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w92.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">The Department is also involved in funding several prominent organisations, who are actively involved in providing support for schools, parents, children and young people and promoting anti-bullying good practice. The Department therefore often recommends that inquiries are directed to these organisations themselves for a response. According to recent figures, the ChildLine partnership in schools (part-funded by the Department) was contacted by 425 primary schools, 482 secondary schools and 63 other education settings all requesting support with anti-bullying practice over the period. Furthermore, the Anti-Bullying Alliance (an 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Oct 2005 : Column 336W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
independent umbrella organisation part-funded by the department) reports that 3,505 schools attended ABA training courses and conferences on anti-bullying, or requested an information pack between September 2004 and April 2005, whilst the ABA also gave direct support to 223 local authorities.

 As data on bullying is not collected centrally we do not have statistics relating to the number of cases of bullying in each London borough. Bullying cases appear to be reported more often now than previously but we have no hard evidence that bullying is increasing or that it is affecting more children. Indeed, as children and young people increasingly feel safe at school to report bullying, and confident that it will be tackled effectively and sensitively, it is likely reporting will rise.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51010w92.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">However, any level of bullying is too high and we are determined to help schools tackle the problem. Our guidance pack &#039;Bullying: Don&#039;t Suffer in Silence&#039;, the anti-bullying Charter and the anti-bullying website www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying offer detailed advice on preventing and addressing bullying. We also offer specific advice to schools on tackling homophobic bullying and are developing advice on racist bullying.

<p>
<a name="51010w92.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">We have raised awareness of the importance of children who are being bullied telling an adult about what is happening, through our public information film &#039;Tell Someone&#039; and our leaflets and postcards for children and their parents. Our recent &#039;Beat Bullying&#039; blue wristband campaign was launched in partnership with Radio 1, during the first national anti-bullying week in November 2004. By the end of December, one million children and young people had answered our call to &#039;Make a Stand, Wear a Band&#039; and make a visible commitment that they are not prepared to tolerate bullying and will stand by their friends.

 The Government&#039;s Skills Strategy, reaffirmed in the White Paper published on the 22 March, sets clear priorities for public funding to support the drive to ensure that employers have the skills they need to be successful, and individuals have the skills they need to be employable and personally fulfilled. Finding a new balance of responsibilities between Government, employers and learners is crucial. My Department&#039;s policy is that employers should pay a contribution towards the tuition fee costs for all employees undertaking publicly supported training unless those learners are eligible for free provision eg if the learners are studying for a first full level 2 qualification or undertaking a literacy, numeracy or English language course.

As part of the normal annual cycle of planning provision, colleges decide on their continued support for local Team Programmes on the basis of their effectiveness in meeting the needs of young people, value for money, quality of provision and contribution to meeting the targets outlined in the college&#039;s development plan agreed with their local LSC. I met with the Trust&#039;s Chief Executive earlier in the summer and I am confident that through the LSC and local providers we will continue to support Team Programmes that meet the needs of vulnerable young people.

Also included is the funding delegated to primary and secondary schools identified as &quot;notional SEN&quot; and the individual schools budget for special schools. The figures recorded against &quot;notional SEN&quot; are only indicative of the amount that might by spent by schools on SEN and, from 2004&#150;05 onwards, &quot;notional SEN&quot; delegated to nursery schools was reported on section 52 for the first time and this accounts for &#163;10,975 and &#163;16,944 of the 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 totals respectively. In 2005&#150;06 Milton Keynes LEA also budgeted &#163;1,662,081 for the transport of pupils with SEN but this is not included in the above totals as figures are not available prior to 2005&#150;06.<br>

2. The figures reported are the amount allocated for SEN by Milton Keynes, as recorded on their section 52 budget statement, and are shown in cash terms and rounded to the nearest thousand pounds.<br>

The new National Employer Training Programme will provide packages of free training in the workplace, and subsidised training at higher levels, designed for employers and delivered to suit their operational needs. Employers will have increased opportunities to lead the design and delivery of training through the network of 25 Sector Skills Councils, to be completed next month, and 12 National Skills Academies by 2007/08.

 Teaching involves a variety of skills and trainee teachers learn how to create lessons where pupils want to learn and where teachers do not need to shout. To meet the rigorous standards for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS), trainee teachers need to demonstrate that they can create such learning environments. Nonetheless, voice care is important for teachers at every stage of their careers. The training leading up to QTS is the very beginning of a teacher&#039;s learning about how to teach. Once a teacher has gained QTS they will pursue continuing professional development opportunities throughout their careers including, if their school agrees it is needed, voice care training.

 Over a 15 year period (2004&#150;05 to 2018&#150;19) running the control service and implementing the FiReControl project is expected to cost &#163;988 million. Over the first six years, the Government will spend an additional &#163;74 million over and above Fire and Rescue Authority&#039;s forecasts for replacing existing controls, as part of its substantial investment in the modernisation of the fire and rescue service. After all nine controls are operating it is expected that there will be annual savings of over &#163;20 million (30 per cent. reduction in annual running costs), recouping the initial investment and freeing up additional resources, which will be available for spending on other local initiatives such as community fire safety. Over the same 15 year period, leaving the control service in the existing 46 controls would cost &#163;1,090 million and would not provide a fully resilient service.

 The Local Government Pension Scheme in England is administered by 81 separate pension fund authorities. The Suffolk County Council Pension Fund is the responsibility of the county council; district councils are employer-members. Actuarial valuations of the pension fond take place every three years, as required by the Local Government Pension Scheme Regulations 1997. Contribution rates for each employer are set having regard to the employers&#039; liabilities and the investment programme of the fond. The rates are designed to ensure that Scheme pension funds remain solvent and meet their statutory pension payment responsibilities. Individual local authorities in Suffolk, other than the county council, do not have separate pension funds. The assets and liabilities for the Suffolk county council pension fond for the last three actuarial valuation exercises are as follows:

The fitness requirements are to be replaced by a new framework under Part 1 of the Housing Act 2004. The Housing Health and Safety Rating System will enable local authorities to assess whether any of 29 health and safety hazards&#151;including those relating to poor sanitation or hygiene, structural collapse and electrical safety&#151;are present in a dwelling, and to require landlords to take action to protect occupiers from such hazards.

The final results and recommendations from this work are not yet available, but early indications are that such a system is a practical possibility. ODPM expect to receive a final report from the contractors later this month. Assuming that the final report is positive, we would hope to take forward the debate on the development and application of such systems in managing risk, both within the fire and rescue service-community, the wider fire industry and other interested parties. Plans for this wider debate will be finalised in the coming months and we will aim to ensure that all stakeholders have the opportunity to join the debate.
