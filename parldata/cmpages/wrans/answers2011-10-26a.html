 The Open Public Services White Paper, published in July 2011, states that we are giving public sector workers who want to form mutuals or co-operatives to deliver public services a right to provide. This will enable public sector workers who want to form new employee-owned mutual companies to take over the running of services. We are working closely with Cabinet Office to help facilitate this in children's services where the conditions are right, and have already made some initial good progress. As part of the Cabinet Office's mutuals pathfinder programme, a small number of local authorities are currently working with their employees in children's services to explore new models of delivery. A grant with 4Children is exploring a range of children's centre delivery models to encourage increased commissioning out of children's centres services by local authorities. This will include exploring opportunities for public sector workers to take over the running of services.</p>

These initiatives will help us to understand, by learning from the front line, what type of support and structures will best enable the development of employee-led mutuals on an ongoing basis.</p>

 Freezing the capital gains tax annual exempt amount at its current level of £10,600 for individuals and £5,300 for most trusts is equivalent to reducing it from what it would otherwise be by an amount that depends on inflation. Based on the September 2011 annual increase in the consumer prices index and thereafter forecast inflation, the reduction amounts to £600 for individuals and £300 for most trusts in 2012-13 and no more than £600 and £300 respectively for the years 2013-14 to 2015-16.</p>

 There are very few ground-based species whose migratory paths cross motorways and other busy roads.

 There are 4,837 individual river water bodies in England. 3,135 of these rivers are 'natural' rivers and 1,702 are modified rivers. The default objective of the Water Framework Directive (subject to certain exemptions) is to aim to achieve good ecological and chemical status for natural rivers and good chemical status and ecological potential for heavily modified rivers by 2015. Where these water bodies are already at “good” or better, the requirement is to ensure there is no deterioration in status.</p>

 In 2010, 22% of English river water bodies were assessed to be at good ecological status or good ecological potential. Ecological quality may be impacted by multiple environmental pressures, including changes to land use, river channel modifications, chemical quality, and alterations to flow. Obstructions can impact on the connectivity of rivers, which can affect the suitability of river habitats for different species, or may present a barrier to fish migration. Natural or man-made barriers impacting on fish migration are a contributing pressure in about 6% of English river water bodies failing good ecological status. Other factors affecting the connectivity, form and function of rivers are a contributing pressure in about 21% of rivers failing good ecological status. The main polluting pressures include nutrients, in about 46%, and organic (sanitary) pollutants in about 21%.</p>

 The Government propose to move away from a 'one size fits all' model of prescriptive regulation to one focused on outcomes and based on risk, using security management systems as the means of delivering, measuring and improving security outcomes. Under this model it will be for airport and airline operators to determine how those outcomes can be achieved in ways that maintain or enhance security, while also improving the experience for air transport users.</p>

However, the Government are encouraging local authorities to develop proposals for permit schemes under the Traffic Management Act 2004, which requires authorities to treat their own works in the same way as those carried out by utility companies and other statutory undertakers. The Government's draft guidance on lane rental schemes, currently out to consultation, also encourages local authorities to apply the same financial incentives to their own works contractors as they propose to require of utility companies.</p>

            <p>their dependants to pursue compensation claims for injury or death were moved: they were defeated or withdrawn. The view then, as it is now, was that there was no logical point at which to draw a line, short of trying to cover all types of injury, and this would create more examples of unfairness and injustice.</p>

               <a name="11102667000242"> This position was challenged in the other place on the basis that Section 10 of The Crown Proceedings Act 1947 is incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. The noble Lords, Lord Bingham, Lord Hoffman, Lord Millett, Lord Hope and Lord Walker heard the matter on 13 and 14 January 2003 and a unanimous judgment was handed down on 13 February 2003 in favour of the MOD. The MOD's position concerning the payment of claims predating the repeal of Section 10 of The Crown Proceedings Act remains unchanged.</p>

               <a name="11102667000243"> When compensation claims are submitted, they are considered on the basis of whether or not the MOD has a legal liability to pay compensation. Where there is a legal liability to pay compensation we do so. As the incident leading to Sergeant Major Adamson's tragic death was before the repeal of Section 10 in 1987, any claim in respect of this tragic death is prevented by law.</p>

 The Ministry of Defence (MOD) takes a proactive approach to the assessment of land quality across the estate and to the management of the risks to human health and the environment. This includes radium 226 associated predominantly with the historical maintenance and disposal of luminised instruments especially during and after the second world war and which are present to some degree at many current and former MOD sites.</p>

Such contamination on MOD sites is present in a relatively non-mobile form, with there being little to no leaching to soils and limited solubility in groundwater. As such, it is believed that radium and for that matter radiological contamination on MOD sites poses a relatively low risk to human health and the wider environment.</p>

 Government recognises that some people find unsolicited mail and phone calls a real nuisance. That is why we have made sure that there are preference services in place to stop them. More information about postal preference services can be found on the Mailing Preference Service website:</p>

               <a name="11102670000049"> We strongly advise people to be very wary of unsolicited offers which sound too good to be true, as they often are. Where people receive material through the postal system which they believe is either misleading or may promote a scam or fraud, they should inform the appropriate authorities (Advertising Standards Authority, Trading Standards or Action Fraud). Consumers and businesses are protected from unsolicited marketing telephone calls through the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (PECR). This prohibits calls to a consumer who has either previously notified the caller that they do not wish to receive such calls or has been registered with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS), or for business through the Corporate Telephone Preference Service (CTPS) scheme, for at least 28 days. Companies are legally required not to call a number that has registered on the TPS or CTPS list. Redress is available if registration is ignored. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is responsible for enforcing the TPS and CTPS and is able to issue a fine of up to £500,000 for the most serious breaches of the regulations.</p>

               <a name="11102670000050"> Consumers are also protected from unsolicited automated recorded calls through the same PECR regulations. Companies that make recorded calls to sell or promote their product or business have to comply with Regulation 19 (1) and (2) of the Privacy Regulations, which require that prior consent of the recipient has to be obtained before such calls can be made. Regulation 24 (1) (a) states that all messages must include the identity of the caller and an address or freephone number at which the caller can be contacted.</p>

 The British Government are engaging at the highest level with the National Transitional Council (NTC) in Libya on a wide range of issues including the recovery of assets and to secure debt and compensation payments on behalf of British companies. The NTC have already said that any future administration in Libya will honour existing legal and contractual obligations, including to foreign companies. Although HMG is unable to intervene directly in individual cases, we will continue to remind the Libyan authorities of their commitment and urge them to honour it. It is essential that companies, like Sellers International Ltd of Huddersfield, return to Libya once the situation on the ground allows, not only to pursue new business but to recover their assets and to pursue debts.</p>

<i>Notes:</i>
1. DWP cannot break its supplier base into the distinct small, medium and large classifications required for this PQ.
2. We do have a limited classification of small and medium-sized enterprises (SME's). This SME classification is used in the response above.
3. DWP awarded 1,129 contracts in total in this period (of which, CIT low level contracts total 598). SME suppliers represent 3.01% of the overall total.
 4. Of the 1,129 contracts, we have 356 contracts where the supplier's SME status is unknown.
5. The DWP also contracts with a number of prime suppliers who are supported by a high number of SMEs. The Department is currently working with these suppliers on how best to track the volume of business that flows through prime suppliers to SMEs.
6. The data includes DWP and its NDPB's.
7.The data is extracted from the BMO Contracts database using the contract start date as the filter.
8. Some contracts have a nil value because there is no firm contractual commitment to spend.
9. The period covered by this response is 1 May 2010 to 30 September 2011.

A number of Department for International Development programmes in Burma include the provision of capacity building for Burmese non-governmental organisations as well as training for individuals such as farmers, community teachers, and health staff and volunteers responsible for the direct delivery of health services. DFID does not provide capacity building for the Burmese central government.</p>

 In all countries where the Department for International Development (DFID) operates, the effectiveness of spending is maximised by: identifying the sectors and areas where DFID can have the greatest impact; preparing detailed business cases for each project which focus particularly on expected results and value for money; regularly monitoring and evaluating projects; and working closely with the organisations which implement projects and receiving feedback from project beneficiaries.</p>

            <p>Improving basic TB control is critical to prevent the further spread of drug resistant tuberculosis. Our three priorities are to help increase access to and use effective diagnosis and treatment of TB; to invest in research and product development into more effective vaccines and diagnosis and treatment of TB, including drug resistant TB; and to support countries to strengthen health systems to deliver quality TB programmes. We do this through our support to UNITAID, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, and our research and bilateral support.</p>
