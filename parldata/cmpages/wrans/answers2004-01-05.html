<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Ben Chapman: </B> 
To ask the Leader of the House how many representations have been made to his Office which are <i>(a)</i> for and <i>(b)</i> against (i) the present sitting hours of the House and (ii) September sitting of the House.  [145067]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Most of the representations I have received on these matters have been oral and informal, and have not been recorded by my Office. And many could not be simply categorised as entirely for or against the changes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w01.html_wqn1"><B> Brian Cotter: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will give new powers to the Office of Fair Trading to enable it to address competition issues within the banking payments system; and if he will make a statement.  [145255]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The Government announced in the pre-Budget Report that the Office of Fair Trading will shortly take on an enhanced role in relation to payment systems for a period of four years. The Government will not legislate to give the OFT new statutory powers to carry out this enhanced role. However, the Government will review competition in the industry after a period of four years and legislate unless there has been significant improvement. Further details on these proposals will be announced by the OFT in due course.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w01.html_wqn2"><B> Brian Cotter: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer on what evidence he has based his decision to adopt a non-legislative route to tackle competition issues within the banking payments system; and if he will make the evidence public.  [145256]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 Since the publication of the Cruickshank report on Competition in UK Banking, the payments industry has made moves to address some of the competition concerns the report identified, in areas such as price transparency, wholesale pricing, access, and governance. In addition, in response to the findings of the Competition Commission report into SME banking, the OFT has negotiated agreements with the main clearing banks to improve conditions for competition and consumer choice in SME accounts. Finally, the OFT is currently investigating the interchange fee arrangements in the MasterCard credit and charge card schemes under the Competition Act 1998. The OFT will continue to use Competition Act powers where appropriate to address competition concerns in this sector.




<P>

<P>

<a name="40105w01.html_para0">However, the Government recognises that problems remain and that an increased focus on competition in the industry would deliver significant benefits. It believes that the OFT could provide this focus and address the remaining concerns, in advance of any legislation. The Government therefore announced in the pre-Budget Report that the Office of Fair Trading will shortly take on an enhanced role in relation to payment systems for a period of four years. The Government will then review competition in the industry and legislate unless there has been significant improvement. Further details on these proposals will be announced by the OFT in due course.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w01.html_wqn3"><B> Brian Cotter: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what recent discussions he has had with <i>(a)</i> the banking industry and <i>(b)</i> small business organisations in relation to competition within the banking payments system.  [145258]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 Ministers and officials regularly meet representatives from the banking industry and small business organisations and discuss a range of issues, including competition in payment systems.

<a name="40105w01.html_sbhd2"><H3 align=center>Iraqi Money</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what steps are being taken to trace funds which may have been deposited in UK banks by members of the former Iraqi regime; and if he will make a statement.  [145198]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 All financial institutions in the UK have been obliged to identify and freeze Iraqi funds since August 1990. The implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483, 22 May 2003, subsequently required that such funds be transferred to the Development Fund for Iraq, with serious penalties for non-compliance.
<P>

<a name="40105w01.html_para1">While active monitoring continues, this process is now largely complete. To date the UK has transferred &#163;112 million to support the reconstruction effort in Iraq. If further such funds were identified, they would be immediately transferred to the DFI.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w01.html_wqn5"><B> Brian Cotter: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what measures have been used by the Inland Revenue to notify small businesses of their obligations under section 660A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988; and if he will make a statement.  [145233]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Inland Revenue's Trusts Settlements and Estates Manual is publicly available and contains some guidance on this. Further detailed guidance (with examples) of the interpretation and application of Section 660A Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 was published in Tax Bulletin 64 in April 2003 and was followed by further explanations and examples in November and December 2003.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the impact that backdating payments under section 660A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 will have on small businesses.  [145235]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w01.html_spnew7"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Section 660A Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 applies to individuals. By paying tax under this section for earlier years individuals are simply paying the tax that would have been due if they had not sought to avoid tax.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w01.html_wqn8"><B> Brian Cotter: </B>

<P>
<P>

 None. Section 660A Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 applies to individuals not companies.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) on what grounds children of asylum seekers would be taken into care under his proposals to change asylum laws;  [141050]
<P>
<UL>(2) who will be responsible for the care of children removed from the care of asylum seekers;  [141051]

(3) whether the children of failed asylum seekers removed from their parents will be deported contemporaneously with their parents;  [141052]

<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w02.html_spnew0"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 There is nothing in the Bill which changes in any way the grounds on which children may be taken into care. The Bill simply provides that families, illegally resident in the UK once their claims have failed, would no longer be entitled to support at the expense of the taxpayer if they refuse opportunities to leave the country. If, by putting themselves in this position, parents put their children at risk, it would be for the local authority to decide how the interests of their children should be protected under existing child protection legislation. We do not believe that many, if any, parents would put their children in this position. If this were to happen the costs would be met by central Government. We intend that in all cases the children concerned would be removed along with their parents.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Anne Campbell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the impact of UK immigration policies on the health services of developing countries, with particular reference to Malawi; and if he will make a statement.  [144103]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w02.html_spnew1"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 International healthcare recruitment makes a key contribution to the delivery of services in the NHS. It can also benefit the migrant and the country of origin; but in certain contexts, migration of skilled workers, including health professionals, can have negative impacts. For that reason, the Department of Health, in consultation with the Department for International Development, has published a Code of Practice for NHS employers involved in international recruitment of healthcare professionals. This seeks to ensure that developing countries such as Malawi and countries suffering significant skill shortages of their own are not targeted.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w02.html_spnew2"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The offence is intended to act as a strong deterrent. For anyone who nevertheless arrives undocumented without reasonable excuse, the possibility of prosecution will exist. Enforcement and prosecution guidelines will be developed for this offence.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department where, in his proposals for a new asylum and immigration appeals system, the burden of proof will lie for establishing that a person has destroyed their documents.  [143472]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w02.html_spnew3"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 For the criminal offence in clause 2 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Bill, it will be for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the offence of arriving undocumented has been committed. It will be a defence for the defendant to prove that he or she had a reasonable excuse for not being in possession of a document.
<P>

<a name="40105w02.html_para0">Clause 6 of the Bill on claimant's credibility sets out various behaviours that a deciding authority must take into account when considering an asylum or human rights claim, including the destruction of a document without reasonable explanation. It will be for the deciding authority to come to a view, based on all the relevant information (including explanations provided by the applicant), as to whether one of these behaviours is present.
<P>

<a name="40105w02.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Rosindell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what his latest estimate is of the number of asylum seekers in the United Kingdom; and how many of them are illegal asylum seekers.  [143516]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w02.html_spnew4"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Information on the total number of asylum seekers currently in the UK, including failed asylum seekers, is not available. This could be obtained only at disproportionate cost by examination of individual case records. In addition some applicants may leave the United Kingdom without informing the Immigration Service.
<P>

<a name="40105w02.html_para1">There is no official estimate of the size of the illegally resident population in the United Kingdom. The Government have commissioned research into the methods used in other countries to estimate the size of the illegal population in order to define methods appropriate for the UK.
<P>

<a name="40105w02.html_para2">The work required is challenging because, by definition, illegal migrants fall outside of official statistics and are therefore difficult to measure. People illegally present in the UK are also motivated to ensure they remain hidden, which is a challenge to conducting research.

<a name="40105w02.html_para13">The UK signed its first three bilateral readmission agreements with Romania and Bulgaria in February 2003 and Albania in October 2003. These agreements are due to enter into force in 2004. We will continue to negotiate bilateral readmission agreements and less formal re-documentation arrangements in order to facilitate removals operations.
<P>

<a name="40105w02.html_para14">In addition, at EU level, the Commission has been authorised by the Council to negotiate Community readmission agreements with 11 third countries: Morocco, Sri Lanka, Russia, Pakistan, Hong Kong, Macao, Ukraine, Albania, Algeria, China and Turkey.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many illegal entrants have been discovered at <i>(a)</i> Dover and <i>(b)</i> other UK ports in the last 12 months; and what percentage have been removed forthwith.  [142162]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w02.html_spnew11"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Locally collated, provisional management information, which may be subject to change, indicates that 2,950 illegal entrants were detected at or close to the port of Dover having entered clandestinely between 1 January 2003 and 30 September 2003. 7.9 per cent. of those detected, 230 did not claim asylum and were speedily removed to their continental port of embarkation. In the corresponding period during 2002, before the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act was passed, and before we put in place a wide range of measures, including deployment of new detection technology and enhanced juxtaposed controls, there were 8,370 detections of which 4 per cent., 340 did not claim asylum and were removed immediately.
<P>

<a name="40105w02.html_para15">Similar information for ports outside of Dover indicates that 280 were dealt as clandestine illegal entrants between January and September 2003. We do not routinely break down the percentage who do not claim asylum and who are immediately removed.
<P>

<a name="40105w02.html_para16">We expect that the phased implementation of full juxtaposed controls will further reduce the number of people able to enter the UK illegally.

 As of the 1 September 2003, there were 3,119 full-time equivalent Immigration Officers employed by the UK Immigration Service. Of these 2,394 Immigration Officers were deployed at the UK ports of entry.
<P>

<a name="40105w02.html_para17">The remainder were engaged in other immigration activity, including enforcement, intelligence gathering and detention.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps have been taken to ensure that investigations into deaths in prison or police custody are <i>(a)</i> independent, <i>(b)</i> thorough, <i>(c)</i> in compliance with relevant mental health standards and <i>(d)</i> respond to the concerns of the families of the deceased.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w03.html_spnew7"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 An external team investigates all deaths in prison custody. Out of area investigations are recommended as good practice. A review of investigations into deaths in custody has resulted in some investigations being led by an investigator independent of the Prison Service or with the support of a multi-agency advisory panel. In two recent cases the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman has been commissioned to conduct an investigation and plans are in hand to transfer the function to him.
<P>

<a name="40105w03.html_para1">Prison Service staff leading investigations into deaths in custody attend two training courses, the first covering investigations generally and the second dealing specifically with investigating deaths in custody. Two detailed and comprehensive Prison Service Orders (1300 "Investigations" and 1301 "Investigating death in custody") provide guidance and advice to ensure that investigations are thorough.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w04.html_spnew5"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The Prison Service's efforts to reduce the numbers of self-inflicted deaths in prisons are supported by a number of broader strategies for which money is allocated at a national level. It is not, therefore possible to identify the resources that have been allocated to suicide prevention specifically.
<P>

<a name="40105w04.html_para2">A proactive three-year programme to develop policies and practices to reduce prisoner suicide and manage self-harm in prisons commenced in April 2001. The main principles of the strategy apply across all types of prisons and prisoners whether male or female. An investment of over &#163;21 million through the three-year programme is enabling physical improvements (now 75 per cent. complete) to be made at six 'Safer Local' pilot sites, one of which is the women's prison and YOI Eastwood Park. At Eastwood Park where there is a centrally funded Project Manager, &#163;1.5 million has been dedicated to Reception and the Healthcare Centre, while a further &#163;1.5 million is being spent on installing safer cells (cells which contain specially designed furniture and fixtures which are manufactured and installed to make the attachment of ligatures very difficult).
<P>

<a name="40105w04.html_para3">A targeted and separate suicide prevention and self-harm management strategy is being developed specifically for women prisoners.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on <i>(a)</i> offences for which sexual activity in public lavatories may be prosecuted and <i>(b)</i> the suitability of those offences for dealing with such behaviour.  [143478]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w04.html_spnew6"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 Sexual activity in public lavatories will be covered by a specific new offence in section 71 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. Persons engaging in such activity may also commit the existing common law offence of outraging public decency or an offence under section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986. The Government believe that sexual activity in public lavatories is unacceptable and the new offence will cover any activity that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a reasonable person would, in all the circumstances but regardless of any person's purpose, consider to be sexual".
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="40105w04.html_para5">The maximum penalty will be six months imprisonment, or a level five fine, or both.




<P>
<P><I>5 Jan 2004 : Column 15W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40105w04.html_para6">The new offence will not require that someone should be caused "alarm, distress, or offence" by the activity, which is a requirement of section 5 of the Public Order Act. Similarly, the common law offence contains a requirement that the conduct must be lewd, obscene or disgusting. While it is a requirement that it should not be inordinate, the common law offence does not have a maximum penalty and so could be used to prosecute more serious cases where the conduct is particularly unacceptable. This offence has been made triable summarily, as well on indictment, by the Criminal Justice Act 2003 which should give greater flexibility in its use.

 The most recent information available on this matter is derived from a survey of 301 white and Afro-Caribbean (or mixed-race) female prisoners who were drug users. This survey was carried out in 2001 and published in 2003. It showed that 70 per cent. (211) had children under the age of 18. Between them, the 211 mothers had 473 children. This suggests that, for every female prisoner, there are roughly 1.5 children in the community.

<a name="40105w04.html_para11">The general prison population, and the women's estate in particular, contains a very large number of prisoners exhibiting a combination of factors which raise their risk of suicide: these include psychiatric disorders, relationship problems, previous abuse and family background problems; and histories of self-harm, drug and alcohol abuse and homelessness. As women tend to be the primary carers in their families, concerns about child care arrangements and associated issues also come to the fore with imprisonment.
<P>

<a name="40105w04.html_para12">Any member of staff who has cause for concern that a prisoner may be at-risk can open an F2052SH and it is mandatory to open an F2052SH following any incident of self-harm. The inherent vulnerability of many women in custody, combined with the high levels of self-harm in the women's estate, results in a very large number of women prisoners presenting themselves as requiring special care, and being made subject to F2052SH procedures. However, staff caring for women prisoners face exceptional difficulties in distinguishing between those women who are intensely vulnerable and those who may be actively suicidal.

<a name="40105w04.html_para13">To address this issue, the F2052SH system is under review. The pilot of a replacement care planning system will begin in January 2004 at five establishments, one of which is the women's prison and YOI Low Newton. The potential replacement for the F2052SH aims to build on the successful aspects of the existing system, yet be more flexible and task teams of specially trained staff to assess the level of risk that at-risk prisoners present.

 A survey carried out by the Prison Service in 2003 demonstrates that a wide range of support is given across the prison estate to women who report that they have been abused. This includes offering women individual support and/or counselling; the provision of advice and information and referral to appropriate outside agencies. Individual establishments work closely with local community agencies with specialist expertise in abuse issues. The support offered to individual women who report that they have suffered any kind of abuse and have asked for help, will be determined following a full assessment of their needs.
<P>

<a name="40105w04.html_para16">The support offered varies between establishments and reflects local circumstances. The Prison Service is currently working with a small group of local practitioners, including both prison staff and voluntary agencies, to develop good practice principles so that consistency in the standard of support offered can be achieved. This work will be completed by March 2004 and will draw on a recently published literature review by Carol-Ann Hooper (2003), from the University of York on "Abuse, Interventions and Women in Prison".

 All of these equipment projects are due to come into service on an incremental basis in the period from 2004 to the end of the decade. Our first priority is to ensure that the currently planned capability (including planned upgrades where appropriate) is brought into service on time and to cost. We keep all our equipment capability requirements under review and will consider making further investment in, and upgrades to, these assets if that were the best way of meeting our future capability requirements. For Skynet 5, where we have contracted for service provision for a period of 15 years under PFI arrangements, the contractor will need to invest to meet his service obligations and is incentivised to provide technology refresh during the course of the contract.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w06.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The maintenance and repair of the Sea Harrier is undertaken at a variety of locations: operating units (first and second line); the Defence Aviation Repair Agency (third line); and a number of aerospace companies in the United Kingdom (fourth line). Maintenance work falls into a number of categories, some is preventative or routine, other work is based around fault diagnosis and rectification. The wide range of information is not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w06.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 There are no plans to further enhance the air defence capability of the RAF's Harrier GR7/9 fleet. However, it is estimated that the cost of fitting air to air radar and the beyond visual range advanced medium missile system to these aircraft would be in excess of &#163;600 million.

<P>
<a name="40105w06.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 When the Harrier GR7 fleet is upgraded to GR9 standard it will be optimised for the offensive support role rather than air defence. Harriers will continue to carry the very capable Sidewinder AIM 9-L missile, but we currently have no further plans to enhance the air defence capabilities of the GR7 or GR9 Harriers.

 HMS Echo was accepted into service on 17 October 2003. HMS Enterprise was accepted from the prime contractor, Vosper Thornycroft in September 2003 and is expected to enter service in the third quarter of 2004. Both vessels' in-service dates have been delayed by design and production difficulties at the shipbuilder and subsequent technical difficulties. Neither vessel is laid up; however, HMS Enterprise's trials programme is currently on hold because of technical problems with her propulsion system. She is expected to resume her trials programme in April next year and in the meantime her crew are using the time to undertake training and vessel familiarisation.

 United Kingdom Forces continue to mount security operations in Iraq. Recent operations against smuggling, for example, have been a considerable success and were widely welcomed by the Iraqi people. Our forces are also closely engaged in developing Iraq's own security capabilities so that Iraqis can take greater responsibility for their own security. Already more than 10,500 Iraqi police are on patrol in the Multinational Division (South East), and more are being trained; other Iraqi security personnel are guarding vital infrastructure, facilities and coastline.

 The Seawolf Mid-Life Update will improve the performance of this short range air defence system which is fitted to the Royal Navy's frigates, and will maintain its effectiveness well into this century. Against an original forecast In-Service Date (ISD) of late 2004, slippage of 13 months was reported in the 2001 Major Project Report. Following incorporation of an associated programme into the project to realise efficiency benefits through the harmonisation of work packages, the programme to ISD will be reviewed early in 2004. While slippage to ISD will delay the first ship fit, compression of the ship fitting programme will enable earlier delivery of the total capability across the frigate fleet.

<P>
<a name="40105w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The formula for determining the gross compensation to ex-servicemen whose invaliding pensions were wrongly taxed for more than six years, involves uprating the sum owed by the Retail Prices Index plus 2 per cent. per annum. The sum payable is to be based on compounding annually. Over the last 20 years this provides a slightly lower return on average than applying the National Savings rate (based on a deposit of &#163;10,000). However, in the preceding decade the Ministry of Defence's formula gives the higher return. Over the whole 30 years, the return using MOD's formula is slightly more generous than one linked to the National Savings rate.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w08.html_spnew7"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The indicators for a good poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) are those defined by the Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) Guidelines of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. The JSA guidelines reflect the main principles underlying the PRSP approach. The PRSP should be prepared by the Government, including broad participation that promotes country ownership of the strategy and its implementation as well as partnerships among the government, domestic stakeholders and development partners. The JSA guidelines also reflect the expectation that, although the specific content of PRSPs will vary widely among countries, a PRSP will include four core elements: a description of the country's participatory process; poverty diagnosis; targets, indicators, and monitoring systems; and priorities for public action. Good governance measures, including those which address transparency and corruption fall under the public action section.
<P>

<a name="40105w08.html_para3">The UK has been working closely with the Government of Angola to ensure that the PRSP adheres to all of the JSA guidelines. The donor community in Angola fully expects the next draft version of the paper, likely to be published early in the new year, to include a strategy for good governance. Key components of that strategy will be greater transparency on Government income and expenditure as well as plans to eradicate corruption from all levels of government. The UK will continue to work closely with the World Bank and other donors to ensure that the text and implementation of the Angola PRSP meets the high standards demanded by the JSA guidelines.

Research and monitoring is carried out nationally by the National AIDS Control Programme based in Kinshasa. DFID is doubling its core contribution next year as are others. DPID recently published its Country Engagement Plan for the DRC which sets out the key aims for a post-conflict DRC. The fight against HIV/AIDS is one of those aims and we will be working with partners on this as we build up our programme.
<P>
<BR>
Rwanda: &#163;2.95 million to the National AIDS Commission over the period April 2002 to March 2005. The primary objective is to substantially enhance the effectiveness of Rwanda's response to HIV/AIDS. DFID has also committed &#163;895,993 to PSI over the period February 2002 to February 2005 to support social marketing of condoms and &#163;521,000 to support an HIV/AIDS unit within the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology over the period April 2001 to March 2006. In addition, since 2000&#150;01 DFID has provided &#163;65.4 million in general budget support to the Government of Rwanda (GoR) and is planning to provide a further &#163;84 million over the period 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06. This provides core funding so that GoR can tackle its Poverty Reduction Strategy objectives, which include improving HIV/AIDS related health care activities.
<P>
<BR>
Research on the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS was carried out in Rwanda before 1994 and looked at the historical background of HIV infection. In 1997 the Ministry of Health carried out research on the number of people infected and 11.1 per cent. were found to be HIV positive. During six months

Uganda: In 2000&#150;01 a total of &#163;1.5 million was spent on HIV/AIDS; in 2001&#150;02 &#163;0.9 million was spent; in 2002&#150;03 &#163;1.23 million was spent. A total of &#163;0.78 million has so far been spent in 2003&#150;04 (&#163;1.27 million is forecast for this financial year). For 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 &#163;2 million is forecast respectively for each year. In addition, since 2000&#150;01 general budget support has been provided to the Government of Uganda. However, it is impossible to estimate how much is being spent on HIV-related and health care activities. The numbers of people infected are currently measured through a sentinel surveillance system where they are anonymously tested.

 Accurate data of the number of children orphaned as a result of HIV/AIDS is limited throughout the Great Lakes region. In Burundi it is estimated to be about 30,000 a year. In DRC it is estimated to be about 800,000 a year. In Rwanda it is estimated to be about 40,000 a year. In Uganda, according to the situation analysis of orphans in Uganda November 2002, it is estimated that there are a total of 2 million orphans of which 884,000 are AIDS orphans.

The Government's accountability for honouring their commitments therefore primarily rests with the Rwandan people, through Parliament and civil society organisations.

 Human rights abuses are an increasing cause for concern in Zimbabwe.

 Criteria for the distribution of food aid through the World Food Programme have been set out in a recent Memorandum of Understanding between WFP and the Government of Zimbabwe.

 In Zimbabwe it is unlikely that there will be sufficient food for the 5.5 million people who are expected to need assistance during the pre-harvest season, i.e. January to April. DFID is again providing almost &#163;20 million for emergency feeding programmes this year, but the Government of Zimbabwe's contribution to the humanitarian feeding operation is expected to be negligible. The World Food Programme has responded by reducing rations, and is now providing about 50 per cent. of daily needs. DFID is working with the World Food Programme, other UN agencies and various non-governmental organisations to ensure that the available humanitarian resources are used efficiently and prioritised to reach the most vulnerable, including households affected by AIDS.

 In paragraphs 12.15 to 12.18 of the SERAS consultation, the Department asked for views on the potential of six existing business aviation sites including Farnborough, Northolt and Southend, to accommodate future demand for business aviation. This took account of the findings from the Department's study of business aviation in the South East which was published as the part of the consultation in July 2002.
<P>

<a name="40105w11.html_para3">In addition to these sites, the business aviation study also considered that two predominantly general aviation airfields, White Waltham and North Weald, were well located to meet some of the demand for business aviation in the longer term, but the case for White Waltham would be largely dependent on the future provision of capacity at Luton, Farnborough, and Northolt during the 30 year period of the White Paper. Consequently, the White Paper recognised this potential but did not arrive at any conclusions about whether White Waltham should be expanded to meet demand for business aviation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what steps his Department will be taking to implement the EU voluntary agreement for improving average fuel efficiency for new cars.  [145733]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government strongly supports the Voluntary Agreements on new car fuel efficiency between the European Commission and the automotive industry, and has put in place a number of policies to incentivise the uptake of fuel-efficient vehicles in the UK. These are set out in detail in the Powering Future Vehicles strategy, copies of which are available in the Libraries of the House and via the Department's website.

<P>

<a name="40105w12.html_para3">The main measures include a number of fiscal incentives to encourage the purchase of more fuel-efficient vehicles, such as the graduated Vehicle Excise Duty and company car tax regimes. We also provide Government grants to support the purchase of certain types of fuel-efficient vehicle, including petrol-electric 'hybrid' vehicles. In recent months, we have been piloting colour-coded energy efficiency labels for new cars in some showrooms, as a way of getting clearer information on fuel efficiency to consumers, and we will be supporting the European Commission as it seeks to develop an EU-wide car energy efficiency labelling scheme. As a result of these and other measures, average new car fuel efficiency in the UK has improved by almost 10 per cent. since 1995.




<P>
<P><I>5 Jan 2004 : Column 49W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40105w12.html_para4">The Government's Energy White Paper, published in February 2003, confirmed the Government's strong support for the Voluntary Agreements, and committed us to working with the European Commission in developing further Voluntary Agreements to continue the improvement in average new car fuel-efficiency. We have written to the European Commission setting out our view that new Agreements should be reached at an early date, establishing a new time horizon such as 2015. We have suggested that new targets should be based on authoritative evidence on available technology improvements, having regard to the full range of environmental, social and economic factors.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 "Powering Future Vehicles&#151;The Government Strategy", published in July 2002, describes the action which the Government are taking to promote the shift to clean, low carbon fuels and vehicles, including low duty rates for liquefied petroleum gas, natural gas, hydrogen and biofuels, the introduction of CO2 -based graduated VED (Vehicle Excise Duty) and company car tax, and grants towards the purchase or conversion of cleaner fuelled vehicles, including electric and hybrid vehicles. Details of these purchase grants can be found at: www.transportenergy.org.uk The First Annual Report on implementation of the Strategy was published in October. Copies of both documents are available in the Libraries of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w12.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 No primary legislation sponsored by the Department for Transport in the 2002&#150;03 Parliamentary session was introduced to implement EU requirements. The secondary legislation sponsored by the Department comprised both general and local instruments. The proportion of all these instruments which were introduced to implement EU requirements was approximately 1 per cent. In the case of general instruments alone the proportion was approximately 13 per cent.

<P>
<a name="40105w13.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Value management is a structured process used by the Highways Agency to establish priorities and best value from the available budget for maintaining the strategic road network. A range of factors is taken into account in programming maintenance projects that include the latest information on surface conditions and opportunities to combine maintenance work with other projects in order to minimise disruption to traffic. The re-phasing of projects is not the result of value management work, but arises from a reappraisal of factors that influence the appropriate timing for works to be undertaken, in the light of better information.

 Through the Music and Dance Scheme, the Department is providing significant means-tested support for over 800 exceptionally talented children aged eight and over at eight independent specialist schools in England. Around one in five families using the scheme are entitled to full remission of fees because of the level of their incomes. Figures for the regional take-up of places are not collected centrally although we are aware of regional disparities in provision. To help address those disparities we are seeking to develop the scheme, over time, by introducing non-residential complementary models to serve as focal points in regions currently poorly served.

Through the strategy set out in "Excellence and Enjoyment" we have a comprehensive agenda for schools and local education authorities to address the strengths and weaknesses identified in the report.

<a name="40105w17.html_spnew7"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The fundamental principle of the Children Act 1989 is that any court decision must be based on what is best for the child. There is no automatic "right" to contact for either fathers or mothers, but in practice the courts have taken the view that in most cases the child's welfare is best served by contact with both parents. This was stated by the Court of Appeal in Re: O (Contact: Imposition of Conditions) [1995] 2 FLR 124 in the following terms:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Where parents of a child are separated and the child is in the day-to-day care of one of them, it is almost always in the interests of the child that he or she should have contact with the other parent."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="40105w17.html_para1">This judgment means that inherent in the courts' interpretation of the Children Act 1989, is a belief that there would normally be contact between children and both their parents.
<P>

<a name="40105w17.html_para2">The Adoption and Children Act 2002 contains a provision that clarifies the definition of harm set out in the Children Act 1989. This makes clear that harm includes any harm a child may suffer or is at risk of suffering as a result of witnessing the ill-treatment of another person. The Adoption and Children Act 2002 received Royal Assent on 7 November 2002. When implemented, this new definition will apply to family proceedings relating to contact and residence applications.
<P>

<a name="40105w17.html_para3">There are currently no plans to establish a legal presumption of contact between children and their non-resident parents. The interest of the child should be the basis for any decision. However, the Government support the view that, in general, children benefit from a continuing relationship with both parents following parental separation, where it is in the best interests of the child and safe for all family members.

<a name="40105w17.html_para4">A recent study suggested that it was rare for courts to refuse a father all contact with his children and that of finalised contact cases initiated by fathers, only

<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w17.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 As set out in the Skills Strategy White Paper, "21st Century Skills Realising our Potential", in each local area the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) is responsible for securing a full range of lifelong learning opportunities for adults suitable to meet local needs. Adult and Community Learning programmes will be seen as an integral part of the wider learning opportunities for the areas.
<P>

<a name="40105w17.html_para5">To safeguard the availability of these types of learning, the Government and the LSC have agreed an overall indicative budget to support non-qualification bearing programmes. That budget covers, for example, family learning, learning for older people, active citizenship, community development, and learning through cultural activities.
<P>

<a name="40105w17.html_para6">From within that national budget, the LSC will agree with local LSCs a minimum figure to spend on such learning activities. Each local LSC will now decide with its local partners-including local education authorities, colleges, community and voluntary groups-the priorities for spending those funds in order to maximise the civic, social and cultural gain for the area.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what representations he has made to the leader of Burundi on preventing the supplying, training and arming of rebel groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. [145154]<P>

<P>
<a name="40105w20.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 We strongly support the arms embargo introduced in UN Security Council Resolution 1493 of 28 July 2003 which calls on all states, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), to take measures to prevent such support. We are supporting proposals for an arms monitoring mechanism in the DRC.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what his assessment is of the situation in Burundi.  [145155]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w20.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Recent developments in Burundi are encouraging but there is a long way to go. The implementation of a cease-fire and inclusion of former rebels into government following agreement in Dar es Salaam in November is good news. The African Mission in Burundi (supported by the UK) is deployed and preparing for the disarmament., demobilisation and reintegration of rebel forces. The country is preparing for elections and the end of the transition in November 2004. However, many challenges remain. Poverty remains widespread and the economic situation is poor. One rebel group remains outside the peace process. The UK will continue to support efforts to bring peace, security, stability and progress to Burundi.

<a name="40105w21.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs pursuant to his answer of 9 December 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 421W, on the Central Asian Drugs Action Plan, what effect the implementation of the Central Asian Drugs Action Plan has had on the importation of heroin from Afghanistan into the UK.  [144497]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w21.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 It is estimated that over 80 per cent. of Afghan heroin reaching the UK arrives via Turkey, with Pakistan and Iran being key staging posts en route. The majority of Afghan heroin trafficked via the Central Asian Republics is judged to be destined for 



<P>
<P><I>5 Jan 2004 : Column 81W</I><P>
consumption in Russia and other countries in the region, rather than for onward transit to the European Union and United Kingdom. The trafficking of Afghan heroin via the Central Asian Republics is therefore not a significant factor in determining the amount of heroin reaching the UK.

 We continue to be concerned over the human rights situation in Chechnya and consistent reports of human rights abuses, including reports of rising numbers of abductions and disappearances. We regularly raise UK concerns on the situation in Chechnya with the Russian Government. We most recently did so following the Chechen Presidential elections, when I called for human rights to be upheld in Chechnya. The UK also supported EU statements before and after the elections which raised similar concerns.

 We have raised Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche's case with the Chinese authorities on a number of occasions. I did so most recently with Assistant Foreign Minister Zhang Yesui in Beijing on 17 December 2003. He replied that Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche had had a fair and public trial and been sentenced in accordance with Chinese law. We will continue to express our concerns about this case.

 Article III-167 paragraph 2 of the Convention on the Future of Europe's draft Constitutional Treaty for the EU concerns the Union's common policy on asylum. The UK tabled an amendment to the Convention draft of this article because it believed that the text could be improved by focusing it more on general provisions setting out the desired purpose and outcomes of European cooperation in this area. However, in the light of discussions during the IGC, and given that any UK participation would be on the basis of the Title IV Protocol, the Government decided not to pursue these proposals, and is content with the latest draft Treaty text.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the effect of the reactive cull component of the Government's randomised badger culling trials on the incidence of TB in dairy cattle.  [144403]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w24.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB carried out an interim analysis of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial data collected up to the end of August 2003. The analysis indicated that there is an increased risk of TB breakdowns occurring in trial areas where reactive culling has taken place, compared to the related control (survey-only) areas. The increase is estimated at 27 per cent.
<P>

<a name="40105w24.html_para2">This conclusion is statistically valid and has been reached after taking into account factors other than culling (e.g. history of breakdowns in the area, number of herds, herd size etc.) which may have an impact on the number of breakdowns in a particular area. This outcome is consistent across nine of the 10 triplets; there has not been any reactive culling in the 10th reactive trial area.
<P>

<a name="40105w24.html_para3">On the basis of these findings, ministers have decided to suspend culling in reactive trial areas, because the evidence suggests that such culling leads to more cases of TB in cattle.

<P>
<a name="40105w24.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Defra figures are only one of a number of sources of information available to the market and individual buyers and sellers have to use their own commercial judgment. Although there was an initial increase of approximately &#163;5 per tonne immediately following publication of corrected figures, this had reduced by about half within a few days with the price back on trend. This reflects the UK's position as a price taker rather than a price maker in an international commodity market. UK production is about only 13 per cent. of EU production, and EU production is just over 20 per cent. of world production. On average, however, wheat prices this year are now some &#163;50 per tonne higher than at the same period last year. They have risen steadily throughout the marketing season in response to serious reductions in supply elsewhere in Europe as a result of heat and drought in the summer. This has also coincided with a tighter global market which has seen world wheat prices at their highest levels in recent years. There was no discernable effect on prices when the provisional agricultural census results were published in the middle of September.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w25.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. May: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what guidance her Department has issued to local authorities wishing to take part in trials of demountable flood barriers;  [143167]
<P>
<UL>(2) what the specification for the Environment Agency's trials of the Pallet Barrier system are in <i>(a)</i> Shrewsbury, <i>(b)</i> Worcester and <i>(c)</i> Ironbridge Gorge;  [143168]
<P>
(3) what assessment she has made of the impact of temporary demountable flood barriers upon flood prevention.  [143169]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w25.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 Demountable defences have been used in numerous places and include for example gated openings and the demountable wall at Bewdley. Where tested these have all generally performed well as flood defence structures.
<P>

<a name="40105w25.html_para3">In addition we have funded the Environment Agency to trial movable temporary defences including the pallet barrier system. These are at Shrewsbury, Worcester and Ironbridge Gorge. The trials are designed to test the 



<P>
<P><I>5 Jan 2004 : Column 95W</I><P>
security of the defence that might be achieved by such systems. The results of these trials will be made publicly available once they have been completed.
<P>

<a name="40105w25.html_para4">We will then make an assessment of the potential impact of temporary flood barriers on flood alleviation and will issue guidance to operating authorities accordingly. However it should be noted that these temporary systems are only likely to be suitable for particular locations and where there is adequate notice of rising river levels such as on the River Severn.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w25.html_spnew3"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="40105w25.html_para5">The protocol additional to the UK/Euratom/IAEA safeguards agreement will allow the IAEA to request complementary access to nuclear sites and other locations in the UK under the terms set out in the protocol. Although the protocol is not yet in force, we are willing to allow complementary access visits on a voluntary basis. The IAEA has not requested any such access.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w25.html_wqn4"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what advantages to parish councils and their communities will follow from an award of quality council status to that council.  [145137]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w25.html_spnew4"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Achieving quality parish status demonstrates that a council has met certain minimum standards expected from an effective, representative and active parish council. The Council will then be in a position to do more for it's communities on behalf of the principal local authorities thus making services more responsive to local needs. The main beneficiary of Quality status will be the local community as the Council takes on an enhanced role:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As an integral part of all consultation arrangements set up by principal local authorities and other service providers on how services are delivered in its area;
<P>
<BR>
In the management, delivery and discussion about the future of services which parish councils may carry out and deliver, on behalf of the principal local authority; and
<P>
<BR>
In the provision of access points to information on services of principal local authorities and other service providers.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="40105w25.html_para6">This enhanced role will be achieved through the negotiation of charters with principal local authorities. We shall be monitoring the development of these charters and the impact of the Quality Town and Parish Scheme to ensure it achieves real benefits, but at the level of anecdote there is evidence of real engagements and enthusiasm among parish Councils up and down the country. This is very encouraging.

 Reservists who are called out into permanent service benefit from employment protection under the Reserve Forces (Safeguard of Employment) Act 1985. Under Section 1 of that Act an employer is required to take back into his employment former employees who have completed called-out service. Should an employer fail to reinstate a reservist in accordance with the provisions of that Act, the reservist may apply to a Reinstatement Committee to hear his case. The Reinstatement Committee can order the employer to reinstate the reservist, or to pay compensation, or both. Failure to comply with an order of a Reinstatement Committee is a criminal offence, and an employer may be fined on summary conviction. All reservists are advised of this process on call out.

 There have been no recent discussions with European Union (EU) counterparts on mutual recognition of identity cards.
<P>

<a name="40105w27.html_para0">There are currently no EU standards for the content and format of identity cards, and it is for member states to decide whether and how to issue them.

 It is not a criminal offence for a person simply to use another identity. However, false identities are often used to facilitate other offences such as deception and money laundering.

<P>

<a name="40105w27.html_para3">Any victim of a crime occurring in England and Wales can apply to be a member of the Victims Advisory Panel. The next recruitment campaign for lay members will take place in 2005. Civilian victims of the Northern Ireland Troubles who live in Great Britain can apply. None did so when we first advertised for members in 2002.
<P>

<a name="40105w27.html_para4">There are no centrally held statistics about claims for compensation from victims of terrorist crime before the introduction of the tariff-based scheme in April 1996. In the period between then and 11 September 2001, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority received 588 claims arising from incidents of terrorist bombings in Great Britain. There is no reliable way of giving a definitive breakdown between those related to the Troubles or to other terrorist incidents.
<P>

<a name="40105w27.html_para5">No specific representations have been received about including the needs of victims of the Troubles within the remit of the Commissioner for Victims and Witnesses. The Commissioner, once appointed, will have a responsibility to promote and champion the needs of victims and witnesses of all crimes, who are resident in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="40105w27.html_para6">The National Strategy for Victims and Witnesses published in July 2003 set out the Government's plans for improving services to all victims. Although not specifically identified as a group separate from others who are bereaved or seriously injured as a result of crime, victims of terrorist incidents in England and Wales are included within the strategy. Work to implement the strategy has now begun, although there are no immediate plans to set up a group to study the needs of the victims of the Northern Ireland Troubles from Great Britain.
<P>

<a name="40105w27.html_para7">There are already a number of independent victims' organisations operating in England and Wales at both national and local level, most notably the voluntary organisation, Victim Support, which this year received a grant of &#163;30 million from the Government. Victim Support provides practical advice and emotional support to victims of all types of crime, including terrorist crime. If people who have been affected by the Troubles wish to set up their own independent support network, they are free to do so.

 The National Probation Service Information Systems Strategy (NPSISS) ran from 1994 to 2001 and was the subject of a National Audit Office (NAO) report. A full breakdown of the cost of NPSISS can be found in the NAO report published on 26 April 2001, HC401 Session 2000&#150;01. While the NAO identified significant weaknesses with the management of NPSISS, particularly in the development of the case record and management system, (CRAMS) they did not conclude that the project had 'failed'. As a result of NPSISS, 38 out of which 42 Areas were linked to a network which enabled them to communicate electronically between themselves as well as with the Directorate and other parts of the Home Office.

<i>[holding answer 17 December 2003]:</i> We do not collect data on this and are not aware of reliable estimates. We do undertake a regular survey of information security breaches in the business community based on a sample of one thousand companies. We use the results of this survey to inform our message to business about the importance of protecting information assets and the advice we give, particularly to smaller companies, about techniques and technologies to prevent problems. The Home Office, as a supplement to the British Crime Survey, surveys households' experience of breaches of this kind, though obviously victim surveys only identify those who are aware their machine has been used in this way. The activities described are criminal acts and should be reported to the police when users become aware of them.

 My Department's Public Service Agreement includes a target to increase the rate of business innovation. On 20 November, my Department published an economic report, "Competing in the Global Economy&#151;The Innovation Challenge", that reviewed existing evidence on the UK's innovation performance. The report shows that UK innovation performance across a range of measures was around&#151;or below&#151;average relative to other advanced economies although some indicators have moved in the right direction in recent years. For example, after a period of decline of Research and Development spending from 1.5 per cent. of GDP in 1981, to 1.16 per cent. in 1997, we have seen an upturn in more recent years as summarised in the following table.

 Business investment per worker has increased over the last decade in the UK, although it has been subject to a cyclical decline since 2001, in common with our major G7 competitors. Investment drives long run growth, and the Government are committed to ensuring that the UK provides a business environment where investment can flourish. That is why the Government have made major reforms to the macro-economic framework, which have helped to deliver low and stable inflation and to avoid large, destabilising fluctuations in output. Economic stability helps businesses plans for the long-term, giving them the confidence to invest. The Government have also reformed the corporate tax regime to give powerful incentives to invest, improved institutional investment arrangements through the Higgs and Myners reviews, and removed the regulatory barriers to investment in the planning system.

<a name="40105w29.html_para9">However, the Government does not want to see a dilution of the general duty in relation to functions which have been contracted out, and bodies to which the duty applies will need to be mindful of their obligations when discharging their functions through others. In placing contracts, for example, such bodies might want to consider whether the contract should be used to specify actions that the contractor should take to ensure that the body in question does not fail to meet its obligations in this area. This does not, however, mean the duty is transferred to the contractor. The responsibility for complying with the duty in relation to public functions relevant to it remains at all times with the listed body.

 Government's Manufacturing Strategy, published in May 2002, identified the UK's long-standing weakness in investment as a key factor for the gap with our main competitors in manufacturing productivity. Manufacturing investment has declined from &#163;20.4 billion in 1998 to &#163;14.6 billion in 2002, due in part to weakness of external demand, spare capacity and increased uncertainty about the prospects for the global economy. It is also the case that UK manufacturing investment is cyclical with respect to the UK economy. The accelerating economic growth currently being experienced by the UK is likely to engender stronger manufacturing investment, albeit with a lag. This is consistent with the CBI's November 2003 forecast (Economic and Business Outlook) that UK manufacturing investment will grow by 0.8 per cent. in 2004 and 4.8 per cent. in 2005.
<P>

<a name="40105w30.html_para9">The Government are taking action to provide a climate conducive to investment for the long-term in UK manufacturing, by maintaining a stable macro-economic framework, together with measures such as reforming capital gains tax; making permanent enhanced capital allowances for small and medium sized firms; introducing the R&D tax credit for small and large firms; establishing Regional Venture Capital Funds; and extending the Small Firm Loan Guarantee.

That is why the Government have reformed the macro economic framework and are undertaking extensive reform of the product, labour and capital markets. For example, in terms of capital markets, the Government have reformed capital gains tax; made permanent enhanced capital allowances for small and medium sized firms; introduced the R&D tax credit for small and large firms; established Regional Venture Capital Funds; and extended the Small Firm Loan Guarantee.
<P>

<a name="40105w30.html_para12">The Pre-Budget Report contained a number of announcements that further build on this, including: measures to overcome barriers to raising finance for small business, notably a pathfinder round of Enterprise Capital Funds and proposed enhancements to Venture Capital Trusts and the Enterprise Investment Scheme. It also announced a new, clearer and more accessible R&D tax credit definition and extension of the scope of qualifying costs.

<a name="40105w31.html_para0">We provided the substantial amount of &#163;129 million to implement the recommendations of the Rover Task Force. Some &#163;11 million has been spent on actions which needed to be taken immediately, for example to support the automotive supply chain. A further &#163;17 million has supported the Modernisation of the automotive supply chain and nearly &#163;20 million has been used for Diversification, to support and encourage businesses to engage in new activity. In addition &#163;22 million has been agreed to create three High Tech corridors to attract and develop more high tech and high value added businesses. Overall up to March 2003 &#163;28 million of these amounts has actually been spent and further &#163;21 million is expected to be spent in 2003&#150;04.

 There are many companies within the UK, ranging from major boiler manufacturing companies such as Baxi Potterton and Worcester-Bosch, to small "one man" companies who install and maintain domestic central heating boilers and systems. Many are registered with the Oil Firing Technical Association (OFTEC) and I would refer my hon. Friend to OFTECs own website&#151;http://www.oftec.org/&#151;which gives access to a comprehensive list of these companies.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry whether the Royal Mail is required to conduct environmental impact studies when considering the closure of a large number of post office outlets in urban areas, with particular reference to the effects on the use of private cars to access post offices.  [144174]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w31.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 There is no such requirement. The urban network programme is designed to manage change in the urban post office branch network by closing branches where there is oversupply and poor viability and investing in branches which continue to serve the area in order to prevent unmanaged decline of the network. In putting forward proposals under this programme, Post Office Ltd undertakes extensive analysis of an area, using a modelling system showing where customers live and where they shop, and how demand for post office services is currently met. It also shows overlaps in provision where two or more branches are chasing the same customer base and where the network may need to change to create viable businesses while ensuring that branches are still accessible to the customers in the area. Checks are made of local authority plans, environmental and transport information, local shopping habits, and other local developments and features are assessed on site visits. Each closure proposal is subject to a six week public consultation in accordance with the Code of Practice agreed with Postwatch.
<P>

<a name="40105w31.html_para2">At the end of the programme, 95 per cent. of the urban population will still live within a mile of the nearest post office and the majority within half a mile.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will list, for each regional development agency, its board members showing <i>(a)</i> for councillor members, their party and local authority and <i>(b)</i> for other members, any declared party affiliation and the principal business or voluntary organisation to which they belong.

 RDA Boards are chaired by business people and at least 50 per cent. of Board members have business experience. Each Board has a maximum of 15 members. Ministers have given a commitment that four will be elected local Councillors and one will have knowledge of rural issues. The balance will have backgrounds in Trade Unions, the voluntary and community sector and higher/further education interests.
<P>

<a name="40105w31.html_para3">Board members are there to further the success of the RDA. They should not consider themselves to be the delegates of a particular group or body, but take into account the interests of the region as a whole.
<P>

<a name="40105w31.html_para4">The following table lists the people currently serving on the boards of England's Regional Development Agencies. For those who were appointed to positions allocated for councillors the table gives the relevant authority and the party they represent on that authority.
<P>

<a name="40105w31.html_para5">The Commissioner for Public Appointments Code of Practice, which is followed when making appointments to the Regional Development Agency Boards, requires that when announcing the appointments any press release should include details of the appointee's response to the political activity question. If no political activity has been declared this should be made clear. This information is therefore set out in the biographies of the Board members.

<a name="40105w31.html_para6">Biographies for all Board members are available in the Libraries of the House.

A regulatory impact assessment is produced for all SIs that have a cost to or benefit for business, and copies are available from the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="40105w32.html_para1">The Government are committed to regulating only where necessary and with as light a touch as possible. However, regulations are necessary for creating open, dynamic markets and introducing minimum standards. It is important not to confuse the costs of minimum standards with red tape: over 1 million workers have benefited from the national minimum wage and over 3 million people have gained an entitlement to four weeks paid annual leave.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w32.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Universal service obligations are a matter for the Regulator, Postcomm. Postcomm are currently seeking views, via a consultation process that runs through to mid-February, on their proposals which aim to clarify precisely which services make up the universal service in the UK and how they should be provided by Royal Mail. It is Postcomm's primary responsibility to exercise its functions in a manner which it considers is best calculated to ensure the provision of a universal service, as set out in the Postal Services Act 2000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what discussions she has had with the Treasury regarding <i>(a)</i> the decision to backdate payments under section 660A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 and <i>(b)</i> the impact this will have on small businesses.  [145237]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w32.html_spnew3"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 Section 660A-660G of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 is a long standing piece of anti-avoidance legislation which prevents avoidance of tax by, for example, a taxpayer with a higher rate of tax transferring income to someone who is liable at a lower rate.
<P>

<a name="40105w32.html_para5">The legislation when applied does not impact on small business but on the very small number of owners who set out to exploit the system and avoid tax.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w32.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Ministers and officials in my Department are in regular contact with universities to discuss a range of issues including funding. Although neither myself or my noble Friend the Minister for Science and Innovation has had any recent meetings with universities specifically to discuss venture capital, it has formed part of many of the discussions which my noble Friend has had with universities and venture capitalists in the last year. The OST has been supporting universities' access to venture capital through University Challenge and the Higher Education Innovation Fund.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w32.html_spnew7"><B> Tessa Jowell: </B> 
 My Department is working closely with Sport England to create 3,000 full and part-time Community Sports Coaches by 2006. Community Sports Coaches will work across a range of schools, clubs and local authorities to ensure that the maximum number of young people benefit. This will support delivery of the PSA target that I share with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills to increase the percentage of school children who spend a minimum of two hours each week on high quality physical education and school sport within&#151;and beyond&#151;the curriculum to 75 per cent. by 2006.

<P>
<a name="40105w32.html_spnew8"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 One of my Department's strategic priorities is to open up our cultural institutions to the wider community. This is reflected in our Public Service Agreement, which includes increasing arts attendance by under-represented groups. We are working with Arts Council England towards increasing diversity among audiences.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w32.html_spnew9"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The Government have no direct role in the provision of local authority or independent museum services.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w32.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B>

<P>
<a name="40105w33.html_spnew1"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The Chancellor's commitment to consider the extension of fiscal support for the film industry through the tax system is very good news for the industry. It reinforces this Government's commitment to the development of a flourishing and sustainable film industry which brings with it huge cultural and economic benefits for the UK. Over the next few months, DCMS will be working closely with the industry and with the Treasury to identify the best means of delivering the support.

 The Communications Act 2003 sets audio description targets for broadcasters. 10 per cent. of non-excluded programmes are to be audio described for the blind and partially sighted by the tenth anniversary of the start of the service. The Act extends this requirement to digital cable and satellite broadcasters for the first time.

<a name="40105w33.html_para0">At present, the widespread availability of audio description modules needed to receive the service has been delayed owing to technical, manufacturing and distribution difficulties. However, we understand from discussions with manufacturers that receivers compatible with audio description on the digital terrestrial platform have recently come onto the market. We hope this will increase the take-up of the audio description service.

 The criteria set for switchover are that: everyone who can currently get the main public service broadcasting channels in analogue form must be able to receive them on digital systems; switching to digital is an affordable option for the vast majority of people; and as a target indicator of affordability, 95 per cent. of consumers must have access to digital equipment. The objective of the Digital Television Action Plan Project is to ensure these criteria are met so that we can, if we choose, take the decision to proceed to full switchover by ordering the switching off by 2010 of analogue terrestrial transmissions.

 The Department has no plans at present to change the rules on the advertising of food to children, but is taking part in the consultations being undertaken by the Food Standards Agency on the possible impact of broadcast advertising on childhood obesity. The Secretary of State has also asked OFCOM to review the adequacy of its codes regulating such advertising, in the light of the conclusions of the FSA Report, the Department of Health's Food and Health Action Plan and the Health Select Committee's inquiry into obesity. It is principally the responsibility of OFCOM to ensure that there is an appropriate code for the regulation of broadcast advertising and my right hon.

 I have received a wide range of representations, both from individuals and from key sectoral organisations, including the National Museums' Directors' Conference, the Museums Association and the Association of Independent Museums. There is strong support for the main planks of our policy: namely, free access to the National Museums and Galleries in London and the regions, the Renaissance programme for regional museums, and support for improved museum education services, particularly to children. The views received will make an important contribution to the Department's developing thinking during the 2004 Spending Review and thereafter.

<P>
<a name="40105w34.html_wqn4"><B> Miss Kirkbride: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (1) what targets the Government have set to increase social inclusion through museum policy;  [145556]
<P>
<UL>(2) what financial incentives are in place to encourage museums to increase the number of visitors from different sections of the community;  [145558]
<P>
(3) what the Government's policy is on museums and social inclusion.  [145559]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w34.html_spnew4"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 As set out in the publication "Libraries, Museums, Galleries and Archives for All" (PP 383 January 2001), our policy objective is that social inclusion should be a priority for all museums and galleries. To that end we have set two Public Service Agreement targets for the 2003&#150;06 period: an 8 per cent. increase in adult C2DE visitors to the national museums and galleries; and 500,000 visits by new users, predominantly from social classes C2DE and ethnic minorities, to regional hub museums participating in the Renaissance in the Regions programme.
<P>

<a name="40105w34.html_para1">Renaissance in the Regions is the main funding programme specifically targeted at increasing the number of visitors from different parts of the community. Two of the programme's eight priority areas&#151;reaching a wider community and improving access to knowledge and information&#151;are particularly relevant. Funding for the programme is &#163;60 million during the 2003&#150;06 period. The grant in aid the Department provides to the national museums and galleries also supports the social inclusion activities they undertake.
<P>

<a name="40105w34.html_para2">From 1 April 2001, all National Museums and Galleries that are free have been able to recover input VAT on their expenditure associated with free access and those that charged previously have been compensated for their loss of admission income.

<P>
<P><I>5 Jan 2004 : Column 134W</I><P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will make an assessment of the impact on collections in museums of the Government's free admission policy.  [145561]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w34.html_spnew6"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Free admission together with investment in new galleries has enabled more people to see and appreciate the great collections of the national museums and visit them more frequently. Visits to the former charging museums rose from 9 million in 1998&#150;99 to 15.3 million in 2002&#150;03, an increase of 71 per cent. There is a good mix of new and repeat visitors. In consequence earned income from trading has held up well and was greater in 2002&#150;03 than in 2001&#150;02 before the introduction of full free admission. There is therefore no reason to suppose that free access has inhibited care of collections. All those museums that went free received year-on-year compensation for loss of admissions income.

 The Government made a commitment in the National Lottery Funding Decision Document to increase the public's involvement in decisions on Lottery spending. The Lottery distributors, in partnership with the National Lottery Promotions Unit and this Department, are already looking at ways to do this&#151;for example, in relation to setting lottery funding themes and making local Lottery awards. The New Opportunities Fund and Community Fund are also developing new ways to consult people about local decisions which the new merged distributor will pioneer.

 The National Lottery Funding Decision Document, published in July, outlined our plans to merge the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) and the Community Fund to create a new Lottery distributor, to be responsible for distributing 50 per cent. of Lottery money to good causes.
<P>

<a name="40105w34.html_para7">There is significant overlap between NOF and the Community Fund and an opportunity in merging them to create a new, dynamic Lottery distributor, more responsive, more streamlined and better able to exploit opportunities for joining up funding streams. We want the new body to be more than sum of its parts, and we believe it will successfully be able to set the pace for modernising delivery of Lottery funding, making a real difference to the lives of disadvantaged people and communities.
<P>

<a name="40105w34.html_para8">The new body will continue funding for charities and the voluntary sector, and health, education and the environment, and will also assume the Millennium Commission's ability to fund large scale regenerative projects.

<a name="40105w34.html_para9">Establishing the new body will require primary legislation. We are encouraging NOF and the Community Fund to work as closely together as possible in the meantime to begin to exploit the synergies between the two bodies and to ensure that full merger can happen quickly when the legislation is in place.

The Department is working closely with the National Lottery Distributing Bodies and implementation of some of the reforms has already begun. Others will require legislation, which we would hope to bring forward over the next two years, subject to the availability of Parliamentary time.

 Statistics on applications for school playing field sales were not collected until our playing fields legislation came into force. Public concern about the loss of school playing fields led directly to the introduction in October 1998 of Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. Before Section 77 was introduced, only grant-maintained schools were required to seek consent from the Secretary of State before selling land, including areas of their playing fields. Local authorities and other schools that owned their own playing fields were free to sell without restriction.

 The information requested is not held centrally and can be obtained only at disproportionate cost, as such statistics are normally collected on the basis of administrative units (such as local authorities) rather than Parliamentary constituencies. The matter is further complicated as the constituency in question covers parts of two Local Authorities.
<P>

<a name="40105w36.html_para0">However, many of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's policies will have impacted significantly on the Regent's Park and Kensington, North constituency, including increased funding for local government, housing, neighbourhood renewal, and specific programmes to reduce rough sleeping and tackle social exclusion.

 The legislative provisions governing the Disabled Facilities Grant means test are set out in the Housing Renewal Grants Regulations 1996.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister considers that local authorities should take account of opportunities to convert redundant commercial property for housing use alongside their more traditional role of encouraging the re-use of vacant residential property. This is reflected in guidance we published earlier this year&#151;Empty Property, Unlocking the Potential&#151;which provides guidance to local authorities on establishing empty property strategies and covers a wide spectrum of property from empty homes to commercial property.

<P>

<a name="40105w36.html_para7">In relation to the provision of loan finance, the circular explains that local authorities and housing associations will be exempt from the Financial Services Authority regulatory regime on mortgage lending which will take effect from October 2004. However, local authorities and housing associations must still adhere to the underlying key principles of such mortgage regulation and The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, in consultation with the Housing Corporation and Local Government Association, is considering what further advice, guidance and training should be provided to them.

 Tabled as follows are details of revenue grants received by Kirklees Metropolitan Borough Council as part of gross Aggregate External Finance (AEF) between 1996&#150;97 to 2004&#150;05. This does not include the amount raised by the local authority through council tax. Most of the funding is paid as general grant and it is not therefore possible to provide a figure for the amount of this funding which was targeted on specific services. Funding for grants within AEF are paid through local authorities.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether the number of people in receipt of disability living allowance and attendance allowance within a local authority area is taken into account in determining the amount of central Government block grant funding the local area receives.  [145158]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w37.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The number of older people in receipt of disability living allowance and attendance allowance within a local authority area is one of the data indicators used in calculating the Social Services for Older People Formula Spending Share (FSS). An authority's total FSS is one of the major determinants in calculating the amount of Formula Grant for the authority.

<a name="40105w37.html_wqn3"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what additional resources he is giving local authorities to meet the responsibilities he recently gave them.  [145010]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w37.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Government's proposals for the funding of local authority revenue spending in 2004&#150;05 provide for an increase in Government grant of &#163;3.6 billion, which is an increase of 7.1 per cent. over the current financial year on a like for like basis. Additional resources are provided to cover all new responsibilities when local authorities are required to meet.
<P>

<a name="40105w37.html_para0">Over the past seven years, local authorities have received a 30 per cent. real terms increase in grant from Government.

<a name="40105w37.html_wqn4"><B> Sir Teddy Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on the procedures adopted to circulate the additional money to local councils announced in the pre-Budget Statement, with particular reference to the allocation to the Southend-on-Sea Unitary Authority.  [145354]

<P>
<a name="40105w37.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The additional &#163;340 million announced in the pre-Budget Statement was provided to help with the provision of children's services and liveability issues. It was therefore provided to those authorities that have responsibility for these services. This includes all unitary authorities such as Southend-on-Sea.
<P>

<a name="40105w37.html_para1">As announced on the 11 December 2003 the floor for authorities with education and social services responsibilities was raised from 3.5 per cent. to 4.0 per cent. and the ceiling from 5.8 per cent. to 7.5 per cent. For Shire districts, the floor was raised from 2.2 per cent. to 3.0 per cent.
<P>

<a name="40105w37.html_para2">Without the application of floors and ceilings, Southend-on-Sea would have received &#163;125.829 million, a decrease of 0.5 per cent., before the pre-Budget Statement, and &#163;126.993 million, an increase of 0.4 per cent., after the pre-Budget Statement. These increases are obviously below the floor. However in addition to the floors the Government also announced that no authority would receive a smaller grant increase than the increase in their schools FSS. This increased Southend-on-Sea's grant above the 4 per cent. floor to &#163;131.519 million before the pre-Budget Statement. The &#163;4,142 increase in grant received by Southend-on-Sea following the pre-Budget Statement was a consequence of the technical adjustment to the base position for floors and ceilings made for new capital investment.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w37.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Flook: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will list the extra amounts given to each local authority in the pre-Budget report; and what proportion of Government support already announced for 2004&#150;05 this represents in each case.  [145622]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w37.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 A table showing the provisional distribution of the additional &#163;340 million announced in the pre-Budget report was published on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website on 11 December 2003 (see http://www.local.odpm.gov.uk/finance/0405/con2grntdiff.xls). For convenience a copy of this table is also available in the Libraries of the House.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has appointed lead officials to work with the 13 education and social services authorities rated "poor" under the Comprehensive Performance Assessment (CPA) carried out by the Audit Commission in 2002; also with two authorities which were rated "weak" in 2002 but with poor corporate capacity to improve; and at present with one district council rated as "poor" in October 2003. These authorities are: Bedfordshire, Coventry, Hackney, Islington, Kingston-upon-Hull, Lambeth, North East Lincolnshire, North Tyneside, Oldham, Plymouth, Swindon, Torbay, Torridge, Wakefield, Walsall and Waltham Forest.
<P>

<a name="40105w38.html_para5">In addition, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has been working on a voluntary basis prior to CPA assessment with Chester-le-Street, Erewash and Rossendale district councils. Discussions are currently also under way with a number of authorities who were rated "weak" in 2002 with a view to working on a voluntary basis with them.
<P>

<a name="40105w38.html_para6">It is for the councils themselves to identify the key steps needed to achieve recovery through improvement. The role of lead officials is to monitor their rate of progress, and to provide advice to Ministers on whether that rate of progress is acceptable. Under the provisions of the Local Government Act 1999, the Government do have power to intervene in authorities which fail to comply with their duty of best value.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether parents under 18 will be able to make decisions on trust funds for their children.  [145705]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w40.html_spnew6"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 In England Wales and Northern Ireland where a parent under the age of 18 has a child who is eligible for a CTF account it will not be possible for that parent to manage their child's CTF account. This is because although parents have parental responsibility for their children under the Children Act 1989 they do not have the legal capacity to enter into binding contracts to purchase equities.
<P>

<a name="40105w40.html_para5">As a result they are not able to make decisions about CTF accounts. In these circumstances the Inland Revenue will open a stakeholder account CTF account on behalf of the child. Once the parent reaches the age of 18, they will be able to assume responsibility for managing their child's CTF account.
<P>

<a name="40105w40.html_para6">The situation is different in Scotland where 16 year olds are entitled to make their own decisions about their property, including CTF accounts. This means that a parent aged between 16 and 18 in Scotland will be able to manage their child's CTF account.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Estimates for council taxes are based on the analysis "The effects of taxes and benefits on household income 2001&#150;02" produced by the ONS and published on the National Statistics website on October 21st 2003. The analysis can be obtained from the House of Commons Library or from the National Statistics website at: http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits. It includes measures of income inequality for the United Kingdom as a whole based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey. This is a sample survey covering about 7,500 households in the UK and sample sizes are only sufficient to give approximate estimates for pensioner households.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Pensioner households have been defined as those where the Head of Household is retired or unoccupied and aged 65 or more and male, or 60 years of age or more and female, and economically inactive. Answers to other recent parliamentary questions about council tax broken down by household type, relating to 2001&#150;02, have used the definition of the Household Reference Person rather than the Head of Household. Detailed information on the definition of these identifiers can be found on the National Statistics website.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Council tax is not paid in Northern Ireland. Estimates for 1997&#150;98 for Great Britain are shown in the following table for gross and net council tax as a percentage of disposable income for all pensioner households (single and couples) and non pensioner households, and for all households. Equivalised income has been used to divide households into quintiles. However, the estimates of Council tax as a percentage of income use unequivalised rather than equivalised income (i.e. without the adjustment for household size). Equivalisation is a standard methodology that takes into account the size and composition of households and adjusts their incomes to recognise differing demands on resources. It is used for ranking households in particular. It is more usual to analyse unequivalised income in relation to expenditure items (which are unequivalised) such as Council tax. However, if the same equivalisation factors were applied to income and expenditure, the factors would cancel each other out and the percentages would remain the same.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<a name="40105w41.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Flight: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what his estimate is of the level of central government gross debt interest in <i>(a)</i> 2006&#150;07 and <i>(b)</i> 2008&#150;09 derived from the projections for public sector net debt up to 2008&#150;09 in Table B5 of the 2003 pre-Budget report.  [145179]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w41.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 PBR projections for public expenditure after the end of the 2002 Spending Review period are based on assumptions about overall growth rates, as set out in paragraph B27 of the pre-Budget report, rather than on forecasts of individual spending components. Therefore no forecasts of debt interest after 2005&#150;06 are available.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w41.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Flight: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the size of the increment in central Government gross debt interest from 2004&#150;05 to 2005&#150;06 relative to the size of the increments for the years <i>(a)</i> 2002&#150;03 to 2003&#150;04 and <i>(b)</i> 2003&#150;04 to 2004&#150;05.  [145186]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w41.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Estimates of central Government gross debt interest depend on a combination of factors. In the PBR projection there is a large increase between 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04, mainly due to higher RPI inflation in 2003&#150;04, and between 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05, mainly due to assumed interest rates, based on market expectations, which are much higher in 2004&#150;05, and a larger rise in the RPI. The increase in debt interest between 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 is smaller because assumed interest rates rise by less than in the previous year and RPI inflation is lower.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer for (1) what reason he proposes to end gift aid tax relief on admission charges to charity venues;  [144987]
<P>
<UL>(2) what discussions he has had with heritage and conservation charities about the ending of gift aid tax relief on admission charges;  [144988]
<P>
(3) what his estimate is of the cost to charities of the ending of gift aid tax relief on admission charges;  [144989]
<P>
(4) if he will list those charities which will be affected by the ending of gift aid tax relief on admission charges;  [144990]
<P>
(5) how much money has been rebated to charities as a result of gift aid tax relief on admission charges since its inception.  [144991]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w41.html_spnew10"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Many heritage and conservation charities benefit from a special exemption which means they can offer free admission to donors, without that admission being regarded as a benefit under Gift Aid rules. This was originally introduced in 1989 and applied to deed of covenant arrangements. Since the change to Gift Aid in April 2000 an increasing number of heritage and conservation charities are granting free admission in return for a donation equal to the entrance fee. Charities are able to claim Gift Aid on such donations. This is an undesirable and unintended side effect of the Gift Aid legislation. It is unfair for some charities to be able to reclaim Gift Aid whilst others cannot.
<P>

<a name="40105w41.html_para5">The amendments to the legislation will ensure that the special exemption for certain heritage and conservation charities applies as it was originally intended and not to "day memberships" of this kind.
<P>

<a name="40105w41.html_para6">The Government will be consulting closely with charities which might be affected, through their associations and representative bodies, on the detail of how the change may be best achieved.
<P>

<a name="40105w41.html_para7">Information on the amount repaid in relation to admission charges is not available, as there is no mechanism within Gift Aid to distinguish amounts repaid to charities according to the type of the donation. For this reason there are no estimates available of the cost to charities of the ending of the relief on admission charges.
<P>

<a name="40105w41.html_para8">Information about individual organisations claiming Gift Aid is not available; Exemption 15 (Statutory and other restrictions) of the Open Government Code applies.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many adverse drug reactions have been reported by <i>(a)</i> nurses and <i>(b)</i> all health professionals to the electronic yellow card scheme since it was launched.  [144313]<P>

<P>
<a name="40105w43.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 By 12 December 2003, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) had received 77 reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) submitted by nurses using the electronic Yellow Card, out of a total of 293 electronic Yellow Card reports from all health professionals since the launch of the electronic Yellow Card on 31 October 2002. The MHRA is developing proposals to increase the awareness of the electronic Yellow Card by all healthcare professionals.

<a name="40105w43.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Dhanda: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps his Department is taking to ensure that the National Institute for Clinical Excellence guidance on the use of photodynamic therapy for age-related macular degeneration within the NHS in England and Wales is implemented as soon as possible; and when he expects the implementation to be completed.  [142980]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w43.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Implementation of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance is underway. Patients are already receiving photodynamic therapy (PDT) on the national health service and we expect implementation of the NICE guidance to have been completed by July 2004. We are working with the NHS to facilitate the implementation and to give patients increased access to PDT during this time.




<P>
<P><I>5 Jan 2004 : Column 172W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40105w43.html_para9">NICE have recommended that PDT should be made available to individuals who have a confirmed diagnosis of classic with no occult subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation (CNV), and best-corrected visual acuity of 6/60 or better. PDT is not recommended for the treatment of people with predominantly classic subfoveal CNV (that is, 50 per cent. or more of the entire area of the lesion is classic CNV but some occult CNV is present) except as part of ongoing or new clinical studies.
<P>

<a name="40105w43.html_para10">Department of Health officials held a meeting on 4 November 2003 with specialised services commissioners who are leading the implementation process. It was made clear to specialised services commissioners that full implementation is to be complete by July 2004 and that it is expected that services that have the capacity to increase more quickly should do so. It was also made clear that patients with suspected classic with no occult CNV, for whom treatment has been recommended, should be treated wherever capacity exists to do so.

The national service framework for CHD, published in March 2000, sets the agenda for the modernisation of CHD services over a 10 year period in order to achieve this target.

The Department is investing in diagnosis, investigation and treatment of cardiac related problems. In November 2001, the Department announced &#163;65 million from the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) and &#163;60 million from the Department of Health to enable the rapid expansion of facilities for angiography, to fund 89 new or replacement catheterisation laboratories.

In this financial year, we are investing &#163;1.56 million in specific initiatives to increase the capacity of individual audiology departments. We are introducing a new, more streamlined patient process in modernised sites. We are looking at ways to increase the number of trained audiologists in the longer term and are encouraging partnerships between national health service trusts and high street registered hearing aid dispensers to increase

 A 1999 study titled, "Attitudes and Aspirations of Older People: A Review of the Literature", by Boaz, A, et al and published by the Department of Social Security, found that up to 80 per cent., of older people would strongly prefer to remain in their own home for as long as possible.

<a name="40105w45.html_para2">The source of the 10,000 spare capacity in care homes is Laing & Buisson's "Care of Elderly People Market Survey 2003". The report indicates in Table 2.2 that there are 470, 600 places in care homes (excluding long stay NHS beds). According to Table 5.1 demand for care places is some 460,000 people. Thus, there is 'spare' capacity of over 10,000 places in the United Kingdom. Further detail about the care home market can be found in the report.

<sup>(51)</sup> 2001 ONS mid year population estimates based on the 2001 census<P>

<P>

The registration rates are calculated by dividing the number of patients registered with a dentist who is located in the area by the estimate of the total population for that area. Some patients attend a dentist in a different area from the one in which they live and so the registration and population numbers do not cover the same people.<P>

<P>





<P>

Registrations lapse if patients do not return to their dentist within 15 months and so the registration figures exclude patients who have not been to their general dental service dentist within the past 15 months. Also excluded from the figures are patients who receive dental treatment from other national health service dental services including dental access centres.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the rationale was for reducing the number of posts in his Department by 1,400; and from which policy areas the posts will be taken.  [145024]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w47.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 We recognised that the Department must change to reflect recent changes in the national health service and social care. It was clear that, with the Government's focus on shifting power to the frontline and the formation of many independent bodies, the Department's role and functions would reduce. We decided a reduction of at least a third was necessary to reflect our new role in providing strategic direction and leadership to the NHS and social care.
<P>

<a name="40105w47.html_para13">The radical Change Programme will reduce the size of the core Department by 1,400&#151;from over 3,600 posts to 2,200&#151;by October 2004. This represents a 38 per cent. reduction at the centre. Half of those posts will not be replaced and will be achieved by efficiency savings, while the rest of the reduction will result from transferring posts to other national bodies, which are also the subject of review.
<P>

<a name="40105w47.html_para14">We have indicated our intention to maintain the current proportion of Departmental staff in Leeds and London. The final numbers at each location are yet to be finalised. We estimate that most of the reductions will be through natural turnover or early retirements. A voluntary scheme has already been launched for those over 50. The Department has had a 'vacancy freeze' in place for the last six months, to ensure staff are given the best opportunities to seek alternative posts, and we are actively monitoring turnover. The Department is using professional support to help those staff affected by the changes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40105w48.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The national health service electronic care record is one element of the national programme for information technology (NPfIT) in the national health service. Central funding for the NPfIT in the NHS is to be made available from the Spending Review 2002 as follows: &#163;370 million in 2003&#150;04: &#163;730 million in 2004&#150;05 and &#163;1.2 billion in 2005&#150;06.

<P>
<a name="40105w48.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Jobs which appear on the electronic recruitment site are with national health service employers. These employers are independent statutory corporations. They own the copyright to the job vacancies. The Department of Health hosts the vacancies on their behalf. The Department does not own the copyright and is not able to allow existing publishers to copy vacancies from the site for advertising in other media. The electronic recruitment project is intended to reduce the cost to the NHS of advertising job vacancies and to allow the NHS to make better use of its resources.
<P>

<a name="40105w48.html_para1">The project team is committed to working with existing publishers both through the digital content forum and bi-lateral meetings with individual publishers to develop the service.

As a key preventative measure to tackle physical assaults on staff and professionals in the NHS, the CFSMS has developed a national syllabus for the provision of conflict resolution training for staff and professionals working in the NHS and is in the process of developing a separate national syllabus for the provision of conflict resolution and physical intervention training in the mental health and learning disability settings. The National Institute for Mental Health in England also has a programme of work on the management of violence in mental health settings.

<a name="40105w52.html_para12">The Department of Health and the Home Office have commissioned, for completion in spring 2004, a health strategy for older prisoners. This will include recommendations on the location and type of residential accommodation needed by older prisoners, the nature of the prison regime, and individual healthcare planning and throughcare arrangements. It will also identify the core principles that should apply to the management of older prisoners throughout their period in custody, including the transfer to residential or nursing homes of prisoners with degenerative diseases.

The smallpox plan requires that each standard Government region should have a regional response group, consisting of five response teams, each comprised of five members.

 The Government has consistently said that smoke-free places are the ideal. We have also said that we do not think a universal ban on smoking in all public places is justified while we can make fast and substantial progress in partnership with industry. Over the years we have seen real increases in smoke-free workplaces. In 1996, 40 per cent. of people reported their workplace as being completely smoke-free. The latest figures for 2002 show this has risen to 50 per cent. We look forward to faster and more substantial progress from employers and businesses.

 The Department continues to explore concerns about the relatively low rate of organ donation with ethnic minority communities.

A campaign launched in 2002 is targeting the black community, which has similar problems.

 In line with our policy on "Shifting the Balance of Power", responsibility for local services now rests with local national health service trusts. In the same way continuing professional development and post-registration training needs for all NHS health care staff are determined locally through skills auditing of teams against priority local needs and through the appraisal process.
