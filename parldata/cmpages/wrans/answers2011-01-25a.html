We are also investigating how member states within Europe approach offender management and particularly whether comparable systems to our Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) exist. Through this work we will assess whether we can seek to extend these MAPPA principles across borders to reduce the risk posed by travelling offenders.</p>

 In common with other areas of the UK yet to undergo digital switchover, it is the case that reliable coverage of digital terrestrial television (Freeview) signals is currently unlikely to be available in some parts of Rochester and Strood. The primary reason for this is that until digital switchover takes place, the power of the digital transmitters is necessarily restricted to relatively low levels in order to prevent interference being caused to the existing analogue signals. However, when switchover takes place, the power of the digital transmitters will be raised to, on average, 10 times their current levels which will significantly extend their coverage. By the time that the nationwide switchover process is complete, digital TV signals will reach the same number of households as the analogue signals they replace (approximately 98.5% of the UK population).</p>

 The efforts of the UN Secretary General and his Good Offices Mission to facilitate national reconciliation and dialogue in Burma have been consistently hampered by the unwillingness of the Burmese regime to co-operate with him, and engage seriously on issues of international concern. This lack of co-operation has included a reluctance to grant visas for visits by the UN Secretary General's special adviser on Burma, and rigid control of the special adviser's programme, restricting his ability to meet key political actors in Burma, including opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. We nonetheless applaud and strongly support the leadership shown by the UN Secretary General on this issue, and urge him to continue his efforts despite the difficulties.

 DEFRA has not made an assessment of the likely requirement for Government incentives in order for the development of biochar to be commercially viable. However, DEFRA, in collaboration with the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC), has undertaken a review of the potential benefits, costs and issues surrounding the addition of biochar to soil. This found that the evidence base supporting the addition of biochar to soil was not particularly developed or robust, particularly under UK conditions, and that the potential for introducing contaminants to the soil from biochar was a particular concern. No further work has been planned. The study is available on the DEFRA website:</p>

The prospect of such reallocation can encourage a race to fish, which could mean that a fish stock is targeted out of season, thus increasing effort and discards of other stocks. Such reallocation may also impact on prices due to a surplus of fish on the market. Furthermore, there is also a risk of 'ghost' fishing in order to secure ongoing access and prevent reallocation-something that is difficult to enforce against.</p>

This ring-fenced reserve will be annually reallocated to individual programmes according to the DEFRA's Chief Scientific Adviser's advice on evidence priorities.<br>
<i> Notes</i>:<br>
1. Flexibility in the evidence allocation process for 2012-13 onwards is essential so that we can adjust our investment in evidence to respond to developing challenges. For example, significant changes to the direction of DEFRA's investment in evidence could result from the outcomes of White Papers or other major assessments that impact on priorities. At the same time it is recognised that DEFRA has to meet a number of 'less flexible' statutory monitoring and animal health surveillance requirements, i.e. classed as 'non-discretionary' spend.<br>
2. To allow DEFRA investment to align to top evidence priorities, an unallocated evidence reserve has been created by 'top-slicing' the discretionary element of the evidence budget. The proportion of the discretionary element contributing to the unallocated reserve will be 10% in 2012-13, 25% in 2013-14 and 50% in 2014-15. This reserve will be reallocated back to individual programmes annually, taking into account overall evidence priorities.<br>
3. Statutory monitoring and animal health surveillance budgets are not contributing to the unallocated evidence reserve. However, in order to meet the total evidence savings needed across the spending review period, these budgets are generally being reduced by 5% year on year as a minimum. It is anticipated that these savings will be achievable through seeking efficiencies. Where this will not be possible, funds from the unallocated evidence reserve will be accessible.<br>

 There is no simple means to prevent the harlequin ladybird from spreading. Scientists at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology are undertaking some detailed analysis on the trends of native ladybird species in response to the arrival of the harlequin ladybird, using Biological Records Centre data collected through volunteer recording schemes. This work could help in the consideration of any future actions. They are also studying the adaptation of native parasites to the harlequin ladybird and there is an increase in the prevalence of these attacking harlequins.

 Himalayan balsam is widespread in the wild in Britain and it would not be efficient use of Government resources to tackle this plant above other priorities. However, the Administrations in England, Scotland and Wales launched the Invasive Non-native Species Framework Strategy for Great Britain in 2008 as a joint policy framework. Its aim is to minimise the risk posed by invasive non-native species in Great Britain and to reduce the negative impacts which they cause.

 There is no statutory requirement for landowners to remove the plant from their property, nor is strategic widespread control the sole responsibility of any particular body. All landowners on whose property Japanese knotweed occurs however should take care to prevent its spread onto neighbouring land or generally into the wild. Local authorities can require landowners to clean up "land adversely affecting the amenity of the neighbourhood" and also have the power to undertake clean-up works and to recover costs from the landowner. If Japanese knotweed is growing on the local authority's own land, it is reasonable to expect that authority to take appropriate action. As public bodies, they are subject to section 40 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act 2006 which requires all public bodies to have regard to the conservation of biodiversity when carrying out their functions and this may be relevant where the weed is affecting biodiversity interests.</p>

 DEFRA's assessment is that there is a continual low risk of the introduction of foot and mouth disease (FMD) into the UK (and the EU) from currently affected regions around the world. Additional measures have been put in place as a result of the ongoing situation in Bulgaria, including alerting industry to the situation. More generally, preliminary outbreak assessments are published regularly on the DEFRA website for FMD and other disease incidents around the world.</p>

 At the stakeholder event referred to in my answer of 20 December 2010, consideration was given to a range of approaches to setting the trigger for an early review of the Feed-in Tariffs (FITs) scheme.

 The Ministry of Justice HQ (MoJ) and the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) have spent £2,496,596 on furniture since May 2010. MoJ and NOMS share a procurement department so their total spend is produced as a single figure. As a part of the estates rationalisation project NOMS HQ moved from two buildings; Cleland house and Abell house, to one building; Clive house, during the summer of 2010. Some of the spend during this period was on furniture for the new HQ building, where some of the furniture from older buildings couldn't be reused due to wear and tear.

Following the decisions announced on 14 December, HMCS has commenced an internal consultation on staff impacts using the Management of Organisational Change Framework (MOCF) to look at staff impacts across the Court Estate Reform programme. During this period, HMCS will conduct discussion with the Department Trade Union Side and with staff (on a one-to-one basis) to consider how the changes will effect them.

 The initial cumulative equalities impact assessment (EIA) that was published alongside the consultation 'Proposals for the Reform of Legal Aid in England and Wales' identifies the potential for some of the civil legal aid proposals to disproportionately affect women, disabled people and Black, Asian, and minority ethnic people. This appears to be primarily a reflection of the composition of the client base of civil legal aid recipients. People from these groups are overrepresented among recipients of civil legal aid services-because of this any changes to the system have the potential to affect them more.</p>

We will take this feedback into account in finalising our proposals and making decisions on the final proposals for implementation. We will also complete a final EIA, updating the analysis we have already published and incorporating evidence on the impact on different groups submitted during the consultation.

 The Education Sector Support Programme in Nigeria (ESSPIN) is subject to regular scrutiny, and the last major review took place in May 2010. This provided strong evidence that the programme is increasing the accountability of the Nigerian Government to its citizens. ESSPIN works closely with another programme which is funded by the Department for International Development (DFID)-the State Accountability and Voice Programme (SAVI)-to identify, train and support civil society organisations to mobilise communities and encourage greater government accountability. ESSPIN works with local government officials to establish school based management committees, which make schools, teachers and local officials more accountable to the local community.</p>

 It is not possible to make meaningful comparisons between the level of compensation made to individuals in the Republic of Ireland and the level of ex-gratia payments made to individuals here in the United Kingdom, because the two systems are completely different. In the Republic of Ireland, lump sum payments are made, the size of which varies according to the circumstances of the individual claimant. Here in the UK, there is a system of lump sum, annual, and discretionary ex-gratia payments. The recurrent annual payments will be made over the lifetime of the infected individual, so it is impossible to ascertain how much individual patients might receive in future.</p>

payments by reference to Irish principles of law governing the calculation of damages. In consequence, the basic awards made in Ireland (leaving aside exemplary or aggravated damages) are compensatory in nature but are paid without proof of negligence in any given case. The article in <i> The Irish Times</i> on 5 August 1997, has already been placed in the Library on 14 October 2010, demonstrates that there is a clear indication of an acceptance by the Irish Government that in many, if not all cases, the claimants were likely to have a good cause of action because the Irish Attorney General advised that the Irish Blood Transfusion Service Board (for which the Irish Government are responsible) would be found guilty of negligence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_579"><a name="110125w0004.htm_para14"><a name="11012573000754">In my remarks to the House on 10 January 2011, <i> Official Report</i>, columns 33-42, I referred to the question of liability in relation to the Republic of Ireland. For the avoidance of doubt, I am aware that no liability was formally accepted by the Government of the Republic of Ireland, nor was such a determination made by a court. My response to questions highlighted that, in view of the acknowledgement of mistakes made by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service Board, the nature of the payments in Ireland were consistent with a finding of liability leading to compensation as was set out in that article. The approach we have taken in the UK is therefore distinct and different, and is ex gratia in nature. Our payments are not equivalent to those that would be made on the basis of legal liability.</p>

1. These data cover attendances at all types of A&amp;E departments, including major A&amp;E departments, single specialty A&amp;E departments, walk-in centres and minor injuries units.<br>
2. The duration to treatment refers to the time from arrival at A&amp;E to the time that a treatment intervention takes place during an A&amp;E attendance.<br>
3. A&amp;E HES are the only source of nationally available data which contain information on the time spent in A&amp;E from arrival to treatment. Official information on the total time spent in A&amp;E is collected as part of the Department of Health's Quarterly Monitoring of A&amp;E (QMAE) data collection.<br>
4. Some shortcomings remain with the quality and coverage of A&amp;E HES data, and variation in the time to treatment across trusts may reflect varying data quality and coverage as well as variation in genuine activity. For example, in some cases unusually short or long times to treatment in A&amp;E are reported due to default times being recorded instead of the actual time of treatment. These data issues will have a larger effect on the mean, rather than the median, time in A&amp;E.<br>
5. The A&amp;E HES publications addresses some of the key data quality and coverage issues. These are available on HESonline:<br>

 Apprenticeships is a demand-led programme for young people and adults. Government funds apprenticeship training, in full for 16 to 19-year-olds and in part for adults; but relies on employers and providers to work together to offer sufficient opportunities, in the context of the greater freedoms and flexibilities that we have created in the further education system. Therefore, Government does not plan apprenticeship places but provides funding and forecasts the number of places that may be afforded as a result.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_613"><a name="110125w0004.htm_para48"><a name="11012580000066">We have recently set out indicative forecasts of apprenticeships in documents published by the Young People's Learning Agency and BIS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_614"><a name="110125w0004.htm_para49"><a name="11012580000067">For 16 to 19-year-olds, the YPLA document "16 to 19 Funding Statement", published in December, states that we plan to have 131,200 apprentice starts in 2010/11 and 133,500 in 2011/12.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_615"><a name="110125w0004.htm_para50"><a name="11012580000068">The BIS documents "Skills for Sustainable Growth and Investing in Skills for Sustainable Growth" set out the abolition of central targets and increased freedom and flexibility for further education colleges and training organisations to respond effectively to the needs of employers, learners and their communities. It will be for individual colleges and training organisations, working directly with their local partners, to determine the offer that best meets the needs of their communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_616"><a name="110125w0004.htm_para51"><a name="11012580000069">From the 2011/12 academic year, there will be a single Adult Skills Budget, with earmarked delivery for apprenticeships. As part of its allocations process later this year, the Skills Funding Agency will set out a minimum expectation of apprenticeships delivery. Further education colleges and training organisations will be able to use their single Adult Skills Budget allocation to expand apprenticeships. Meanwhile, any diversion of funding away from apprenticeships will be agreed with the agency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_617"><a name="110125w0004.htm_para52"><a name="11012580000070">In this context, "Investing in Skills for Sustainable Growth" offers an indicative forecast for apprenticeship learner numbers, including apprentices expected to continue learning from the previous year. It does not provide a direct comparison in starts for adult (19+) apprentices and does not differentiate by age band. Officials have converted the learner numbers to starts for comparison, so the indicative forecast is for 220,900 adult (19+) starts in 2010/11 and 227,100 in 2011/12.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_618"><a name="110125w0004.htm_para53"><a name="11012580000071">We have not published forecast starts figures beyond 2011/12.</p>

 The Government are establishing a new framework, with increased responsibility on universities to widen participation; and greater investment in improving attainment and access for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Universities wanting to charge more than a £6,000 annual graduate contribution will have to demonstrate what more they will do to attract more students from disadvantaged backgrounds through outreach activities, targeted scholarships and other financial support. This will include a requirement to participate in the new £150 million National Scholarship Programme. This forms part of a package of measures to support disadvantaged young people through their education, including the introduction of the £2.5 billion pupil premium which will support them to achieve at school and turn that into success at university.</p>

 All of the prime providers who are awarded Work Programme contracts will be required to undertake the new Merlin accreditation process within 12 months of their contract start date.

<p><a name="stpa_669"><a name="110125w0005.htm_para21"><a name="11012580001160">The accreditation process begins with a provider self-assessment against the published Merlin standard principles.
