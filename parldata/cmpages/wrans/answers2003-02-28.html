 My Department's contributions to UNRWA in recent years have been &#163;25.6 million (2001) and &#163;21.7 million (2002). This money is used to provide urgently needed health, education and emergency services for Palestinian refugees. This helps to relieve the growing humanitarian crisis resulting from the on-going conflict and closures. We expect our funding to continue at a similar level in 2003. UNRWA has sophisticated and robust financial, accounting and audit systems. There is no evidence of any kind that their funds are used for anything other than intended purposes.

 My Department has been monitoring the situation in the Congo very closely and is ready to provide assistance if this is deemed appropriate. We provided &#163;150,000 through Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) during the last ebola outbreak in the Congo in February 2002. The current death toll from the latest outbreak is 75, but WHO believes the situation is now under control. The Government of Congo has made available $68,000 to deploy medical teams, and the national authorities are being supported by a team of 10 WHO epidemiologists, medical anthropologists and social mobilisation experts. The Congolese Red Cross are working on raising public health awareness and social mobilisation and an appeal was recently launched. WHO has established isolation wards which have helped to contain the disease: most of the people who became infected have now unfortunately died. My

The Gabonese authorities have responded swiftly to this latest outbreak of the virus by closing the Gabon-Congo border in the north-east of the country and has sent a team of experts from the Health Ministry and the Medical Research International Centre in Franceville to the two areas, near the border with Congo, where there was an outbreak last year. Guidelines have been issued to locals asking them not to touch dead animals in the forest, or those with an unusual behaviour (primates are often carriers of the ebola virus), as well as reporting any suspected cases of ebola to the authorities.

The Court of Appeal indicated that it would be inappropriate to lay down guidelines in this difficult area without the Sentencing Advisory Panel having first been involved.

 No such assessment has been made. The migration of benefit payment to ACT begins this year and the Post Office's strategy is to respond to that challenge with a range of banking and other services. How the migration of benefit payments affects the revenue of post offices will depend on a number of factors, not least how benefit recipients and other post office customers respond to change. The income from the various contracts Post Office Ltd. has with the spending Departments and various financial institutions, and the remuneration of sub-postmasters for banking services, is a commercial matter between the parties.

CO2 injection techniques have been successfully used in the United States to enhance oil recovery.

Studies are being carried out by the Department on the feasibility of CO2 capture and storage and its use for enhanced oil recovery on the UKCS and findings are due to be published this Spring.

 The Department provides grant aid to the flood and coastal defence authorities&#151;the Environment Agency (EA), local authorities and (in areas with special drainage needs) internal drainage boards to assist with their capital works to manage flood risk. However grant aid is not provided for defences to protect proposed new development, although it is possible for such development to benefit incidentally by defence schemes designed to protect existing assets. In such cases, authorities are expected to seek a commensurate contribution from the developer to the

<P><I>28 Feb 2003 : Column 744W</I><P>
extent that he benefits from the public investment. No specific provision for new development has been made therefore, either by the EA or Defra.

The Guidance will assist local authorities, along with other local agencies, in identifying the practical steps they can take to build community cohesion at local level. The Guidance sets out the vital role that education, the youth service and the Connexions service can play in building cohesive communities.

 While the lead responsibility for the welfare of greyhounds rests with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, we have made clear to the British Greyhound Racing Board our concern that the industry should take proper responsibility for the welfare of retired greyhounds, and support for the action which it has already taken to increase its financial contribution to the Retired Greyhound Trust.

 Maternity benefits are being improved as part of the Government's drive to help pregnant women and parents financially and to achieve a better balance between their work and home lives.
<P>

<a name="30228w08.html_para0">In order to qualify for statutory maternity pay a woman must have average weekly earnings that at least equal the lower earnings limit for National Insurance contributions. The lower earnings limit is currently &#163;75 a week. An average is taken of the gross earnings actually paid to a woman in an eight week period running up to the 15th week before the week baby is due. The period used may vary slightly depending on the woman's own pay period.
<P>

<a name="30228w08.html_para1">Maternity Allowance is available for those women who do not qualify for SMP. From this April we are changing the earnings calculation, so that women will be able to choose the 13 weeks that reflect her best earnings during the test period (the 66 weeks up to the week before the week her baby is expected). This change will, of course, be beneficial to those with part year earnings. It will mean that women's entitlement to Maternity Allowance is maximised so that more will qualify for the standard rate.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what steps he is taking to decide the employment status of term-time workers; whether he intends to ensure that term-time workers are eligible for Job Seekers' Allowance during unpaid holidays; and whether the actual annual salary of a term-time worker will be the basis for calculating his or her hourly rate for minimum wage purposes.  [97655]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30228w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 Jobseeker's Allowance is paid to support people who are out of work and actively seeking employment. People who are in remunerative work, i.e. averaging 16 hours or more per week, are not entitled to Jobseeker's Allowance.
<P>

<a name="30228w08.html_para6">For term-time workers the average number of hours they work is calculated over the whole academic year, including the school holidays. If this average is less than 16 hours a week then they may be entitled to Jobseeker's Allowance. This calculation would apply if an application was made during term-time or during the vacation period. We have no plans to change the rules on remunerative work.
<P>

<a name="30228w08.html_para7">The National Minimum Wage has to be paid for every hour worked, averaged over the pay reference period, to most people who work in the UK. The calculation to determine if a person is receiving the National Minimum Wage depends on whether the worker is a time worker or a salaried-hours worker.
<P>

<a name="30228w08.html_para8">If the term-time worker is paid a set amount at regular periods (i.e weekly or monthly) throughout the year regardless of whether they have actually worked during that period then they are a salaried worker. For salaried work, the contract between the employer and the worker must set out a basic number of hours for which the worker must be paid at least the minimum wage. If the salaried worker works any hours in excess of their contract, then the National Minimum Wage will also apply to those additional hours.

 It is clear that the child care tax credit is removing an important barrier to work by making child care more affordable. According to the Repeat Survey of Parent's Demand for Childcare, around a quarter of respondents said that the impact of the child care tax credit had an effect on the number of hours they worked; and of those, 80 per cent. said that they had increased their hours. Recent data suggests that among families in receipt of WFTC and using eligible child care, around 85 per cent. claim the child care tax credit. Among lone parents receiving WFTC the figure is higher still, with over 90 per cent. of lone parents who receive WFTC and use eligible child care claiming the child care tax credit. The majority of claims for child care tax credit come from lone parents, for whom child care costs can represent one of the biggest barriers to making work pay.

 As we announced in the pre-Budget report (PBR), the Government will consult on a revenue-neutral proposal to increase the rate of landfill from 2005&#150;2006 as a way of encouraging more environmentally friendly methods of dealing with waste. Since the PBR, discussions have been held with a wide range of businesses and other groups, including the Confederation of British Industry, on how the additional revenue raised from the landfill tax increases will be recycled. An announcement will be made in the Budget.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30228w11.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 28 February 2003]:</i> The sentencing provisions in the Criminal Justice Bill will make it possible to ensure that the most serious violent, sexual and persistent offenders spend longer in prison while allowing other offenders to be dealt with by means of tougher and more effective community sentences. Current projections indicate that the long-term net effect of implementation of these provisions will be a small increase of about 1,000 in the prison population.
<P>

<a name="30228w11.html_para0">The proposal contained in the Bill in relation to retrial for serious offences would only permit a retrial in cases where new and compelling evidence subsequently came to light. Furthermore, to prevent the possible harassment of acquitted persons or where it is not in the public interest, the personal consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions will be required to the re-opening of investigation and an application to the Court of Appeal. Given these safeguards it is estimated that only a very small number of cases are likely to be retried each year and that the impact upon the prison population will be negligible.

 Evaluation of the heart choice scheme is being informed by the independent patient choice trustees at a national level through a survey of patient views and with information from patient care advisers in each cardiac centre.
<P>

<a name="30228w12.html_para1">The early indications from the first six months of the scheme are that the initiative is popular with patients, with just under half of those eligible choosing to be treated elsewhere. Patients and their carers have particularly welcomed the continuity, advice and support of patient care advisers. These reforms, combined with substantial investment, are making a dramatic impact, improving patient experience and bringing a rapid reduction in waiting times for heart surgery.

 We are committed to tackling hospital acquired infections and have set standards to ensure that there is a managed environment that minimises the risk of infection to patients, staff and visitors. These standards are now supported by the inclusion of infection control procedures and a methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) improvement score in the national health service performance management system for 2002&#150;03. In addition, a targeted action plan for healthcare associated infection is being developed as part of our strategy against infectious diseases, "Getting Ahead of the Curve".

<a name="30228w12.html_para3">Hospital acquired infections range from the serious to the trivial. Although it is good practice <sup>1</sup>  to assess residents for risk of infection on admission an infection is not necessarily a contraindication for admission. For example, if basic good hygiene precautions are followed, individuals with MRSA are not a risk to other residents, staff or visitors and should not be excluded.

 It is for National Health Service trusts to determine their local hospital waste contract requirements and specifications, and fulfil all statutory and legal obligations. However, a significant amount of guidance on clinical waste management and disposal is available to the NHS. The Health and Safety Commission guidance, Safe disposal of clinical waste, states:

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Identifiable human tissue is clinical waste unless it has been rendered safe and non-infectious. After treatment, identifiable human tissue remains an offensive waste.

All contract terms will be individual and specific. NHS trusts are autonomous bodies and as such have local responsibility for all contracts dependent on their needs and specifications. Contracts will differ in terms of requirements and contract period. NHS Purchasing And Supply Agency are currently reviewing their total waste management contract terms and conditions.<P>

Since the introduction of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the loss of Crown Immunity in 1991, the NHS has moved away from disposing of its own waste to contracting out that service to the private sector. The consequence of legislative changes relating to clinical waste disposal resulted in NHS owned and operated incinerators being shut down and replaced with modern large scale incinerators, provided, in the main, through joint ventures between the NHS and the private sector, or the private sector alone.<P>

The NHS continues to handle some 8 per cent. of clinical waste disposal for England.<P>
