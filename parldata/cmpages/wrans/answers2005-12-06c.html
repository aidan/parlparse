 Anyone who keeps poultry has an obligation to report signs of illness in their birds, and must know what to do about an avian influenza notifiable disease: this includes operating adequate biosecurity, and consulting their vet.

<p>
<a name="51206w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">My department has distributed guidance material to our partners in the industry who are helping to distribute this material to their members, who cover the great majority of birds. We have also produced a simple one-page leaflet on biosecurity and surveillance for smaller concerns and back-yard keepers. This was posted on our website and sent out to organisations representing the industry to send on to their members.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206w01.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">In addition we have placed adverts in trade and specialist press targeting the same audience to get biosecurity and surveillance messages across. All these pieces of guidance are available on the Defra website.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>6 Dec 2005 : Column 1086W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51206w01.html_spnew2"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 The bee health programme is funded from the Departmental vote. Funding is allocated in order to achieve the best available value for money in achieving the Department&#039;s objectives.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps her Department <i>(a)</i> has taken and <i>(b)</i> is planning to take to safeguard bee health against the threat of the varroa mite.  [34610]</p>








<p><a name="st_3"><a name="51206w01.html_spnew3"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 DEFRA (and MAFF before it) has been helping the beekeeping sector to better equip itself to manage varroa infestations ever since the pest was first discovered in England in 1992. The Department has funded a range of measures delivered by the National Bee Unit, including the provision of a free diagnostic and inspection service to beekeepers and a comprehensive training and advisory programme, as well as R&D.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206w01.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">Although varroa continues to pose challenges to contemporary beekeeping particularly with the development of mite resistance to chemical treatments, it is now endemic in the UK and has been for several years. The Department has issued a consultation document on plans to remove the mite from the list of notifiable diseases in March 2006. However, the National Bee Unit will continue to offer advice to beekeepers about its management and control, as it does now for other serious but non-statutory diseases.

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="51206w01.html_spnew4"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 Information on the removal of tree tops and branch wood for use as fuel following conventional timber harvesting operations is not routinely collected. However, the Forestry Commission estimates that less than 2,000 tonnes of this material, from a possible 500,000 tonnes, was removed from woodland and used as fuel in England last year.

The VMD held a meeting in 2004 involving DARC group members, and external specialists in MRSA, to consider how the issue should be addressed. It was decided to turn this group into a MRSA sub group of DARC.

The earlier phases of the development have no planning conditions that require the A1 to be widened.

This would be under the provision of a S278 agreement which is equivalent to S106, but for a trunk road not a local road.

 The Blue Badge scheme is a European and national scheme offering parking concessions primarily for disabled people with severe walking difficulties who travel as drivers or passengers. The scheme applies to on-street parking only.

<p>
<a name="51206w10.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_52">The Blue Badge scheme does not apply to off-street car parks, private roads or at most airports. Charges for and conditions of use in off-street car parks, which are likely to be privately owned and managed, are a matter for the landowner. It is unlikely that spaces in such off-street car parks marked for blue badge holders are legally enforceable and the regulation of such parking is at the discretion of landowners and depends on the courtesy and consideration of drivers.

<p>
<a name="51206w10.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_53">It is the Department for Transport&#039;s view that it is possible in law for the owners of a private car park to agree with the local authority that a parking place order be made in respect of that car park. Conditions of use can then be enforced as if it were a local authority car park, with penalties or excess charges levied on offenders. It would, therefore, be an offence under the Traffic Regulation Order rather the Blue Badge regulations.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what plans his Department has <i>(a)</i> to protect consumers from unregulated products sold by banks and <i>(b)</i> to ensure that consumers are made fully aware of which products are regulated and which are not; and if he will make a statement.

<p><a name="st_143"><a name="51206w15.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 The Financial Services Authority (FSA) regulates all banks and financial services providers operating in the UK. The FSA has a statutory obligation to protect consumers and is responsible for policing the regulatory perimeter and for drawing attention to where the boundary lies. FSA rules require banks to explain to customers that a particular product or service is regulated by the FSA.

<p>
<a name="51206w15.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_82">The FSA Handbook includes requirements that firms must ensure that they should not make any misleading statements to a client, whether expressly or by implication, that its affairs, or any aspect of them, have the approval of the FSA. This does not, of course, prevent firms from indicating that they are authorised and regulated by the FSA, in conjunction with selling products regulated by the FSA.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206w15.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_83">In addition to FSA regulation, the Banking Code is a voluntary code which applies to the large number of banks that subscribe to it. It covers some regulated services, such as deposit-taking, and some unregulated services, such as foreign exchange services. The existence of the Banking Code is one of the reasons why the FSA has not introduced significant additional conduct of business regulation except where required by European legislation.

<p><a name="st_153"><a name="51206w16.html_spnew0"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick: </b> 
 The Government have, with the support of all sides of the House, brought forward a reform of general fire safety legislation in the form of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (SI 2005 No. 1541). The Select Committees that considered the draft order (the Regulatory Reform Committee and the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in another place) considered that continuance of the necessary protections afforded by the Fire Precautions (Sub-surface Railway Stations Regulations 1989 (as amended) by the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 could be demonstrated by guidance. The Government are firmly of the view that all necessary protections are either continued or enhanced by the new regime. However, in the light of the consideration given by the hon. and noble Members of the Committees, the Government decided to withdraw revocation of the 1989 regulations until such time as guidance was in place which shows how the protections are continued.

<p>
<a name="51206w16.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_86">Although the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is convinced that the case is made, we always listen to concerns about fire safety. We therefore propose to run the new regime in tandem with the old so that ample evidence of the efficiency and broad ranging nature of the new regime can be shown. Once that evidence has been gathered we expect to proceed to remove the 1989 regulations. However, the evidence shows there to be a gap, or a problem we have not foreseen, then we will work to make sure any such gap or risk is fully addressed before the 1989 regulations are removed.

<a name="51206w16.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_87">We believe the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order, addressing as it does all general fire safety risks and placing prevention of fire and mitigation of the effects of fire as of equal standing to safe evacuation is the right way forward. However, the safety of the public using and staff working on the underground railway systems is of vital importance and it is not something we will compromise.

However, such freedoms also bring responsibilities, and we have to balance freedom of speech with the need to protect national security and the rights of citizens not to be put at risk from criminal and violent acts.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills pursuant to the answer of 7 November 2005, <i>Official Report,</i> column 127W, on school non-attenders, what mechanisms are in place to ensure that <i>(a)</i> 16 to 19 year olds and <i>(b)</i> adults on publicly funded courses do not absent themselves from those courses.

 Attendance in learning over the age of 16 is voluntary. However our aim is that all young people should stay in learning up to age 19, and continue in learning throughout life, to secure the skills that they, and the economy, need. Participation and attendance in post-16 education and training depends on the quality, relevance, effectiveness and perceived value of the provision and outcomes for each learner alongside sound information, advice, guidance and pastoral care.

 The Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 recognise the different needs of pupils in day and residential schools. A greater provision is required in the latter because washroom facilities must be located near to sleeping accommodation, with easy access, in addition to the facilities required convenient to teaching accommodation. Some of the daytime provision may count towards that required for boarders if it is in an appropriate location and offers good access to residential pupils.

However, the Department&#039;s design team is producing new design guidance for extended schools. This does say that additional facilities may be needed to cope with a wider range of adult and child users, and gives the example of additional adult toilets being needed in a primary school. This should be published early in 2006. A review of the Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 has not been undertaken and is not currently planned.

These issues remain a focus for the UN Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Burma, Professor Sergio Pinheiro, and the UN Secretary General&#039;s special envoy to Burma, Tan Sri Razali Ismail, whom we urge the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) to allow to return to Burma.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what action he is taking to ensure that International Monetary Fund conditions allow increases in spending of money provided by the IMF on health in countries fighting HIV/AIDS.  [34783]</p>








<p><a name="st_286"><a name="51206w31.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 DFID is working with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other donors to improve the predictability of aid flows, the effectiveness of IMF signalling, and countries own expenditure management capacity. This will ensure that countries are better able to plan for increased spending in health and other key sectors identified in their Poverty Reduction Strategies, while maintaining the fiscal sustainability and macroeconomic stability which are essential to long term growth and poverty reduction.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206w31.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_216">DFID has supported a series of High Level Meetings on the health related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) over the past 18 months. These meetings have brought together senior representatives of Ministries of Health and Finance from developing countries, donors and international organisations including the World Bank and the IMF. The meetings have looked to develop solutions to the systematic barriers to faster progress in realising the MDGs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206w31.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_217">The IMF&#039;s focus is appropriately, on maintaining fiscal sustainability and overall macroeconomic stability, as an essential underpinning to planned Government programmes and economic growth. Within these objectives, DFID has worked with the IMF on the issue of creating &#039;fiscal space&#039;&#151;that is increasing the financial scope for countries to expand their allocations to provide critical services such as health and HIV/AIDS services. The IMF has led much of this work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206w31.html_para13">
<a name="stpa_218">The UK has also worked with the IMF to improve its role in &#039;signalling&#039; and donor co-ordination. The unpredictability of future aid flows from donors is a significant constraint on countries&#039; ability to plan future spending, creating uncertainty about both overall budgets, and about the availability of resources to finance individual programmes, including in the health sector. The IMF has a role to play in supporting countries&#039; own budget processes, and in working with donors to improve the predictability of their aid.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206w31.html_para14">
<a name="stpa_219">The UK is pushing for greater predictability and less volatility of aid and longer-term financial commitments. This would provide confidence to Ministries of Finance to establish more ambitious financial frameworks and take on the long term recurrent costs associated with, for example, scaling up comprehensive HIV/responses. Malawi is a good example where the IMF has worked effectively with the Ministry of Finance to support the implementation of an ambitious emergency human resource programme for health.

The framework had clear recommendations around the importance of ensuring medicines, including ARVs, were available in appropriate paediatric formulations. In the context of this work, DFID has convened a series of meetings with the industry, at which this issue has been addressed.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what training in <i>(a)</i> literacy and <i>(b)</i> numeracy is offered to employees of his Department.  [21124]</p>








<p><a name="st_302"><a name="51206w33.html_spnew5"><b> Mrs. McGuire: </b> 
 The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) makes a number of learning resources available to meet the work-related literacy and numeracy needs of its staff. These resources address specific business needs such as effective briefing and written communication with customers and are provided either as face-to-face courses or as blended learning solutions. All staff have a Personal Development Plan which is reviewed twice yearly with their manager and any development needs, including literacy and numeracy needs, are identified and addressed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206w33.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_240">In addition, DWP has entered into a partnership with its main trade union, the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), to address the basic literacy and numeracy needs of its staff. Since March 2004 this has been the main focus of activity of the union learning representative (ULR) network that has been established within DWP.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206w33.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_241">ULRs encourage staff to assess their skills and support them to address any learning need they identify through a local college or Learndirect. The DWP is committed to help staff by providing any necessary time off to attend learning designed to bring their skills up to level 2 of the national qualifications framework.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51206w33.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_242">The PCS has made provision for staff at our offices in Newcastle and Leeds to access learning to level 2 at their workplace. This type of internal provision is likely to increase as more staff assess their basic skills using an online diagnostic tool that will be available to them in the new year.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_172">It may be helpful if I explain that CMS is an Information Technology system used by staff in our contact centres to gather information from customers when they make a claim to benefit. To make a claim the customer calls a contact centre where CMS is used. Contact centre staff ask the customer a series of questions to assess their potential eligibility to Jobcentre Plus benefits and then arrange to call the customer back at a mutually agreed time, to assist in completion of a claim form. This removes the need for customers to complete a lengthy claim form and instead allows the customer to provide information by telephone.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_173">Jobcentre Plus did not consult with customers about the introduction of CMS as it is an IT system used by staff. However, we do conduct an annual customer satisfaction survey which canvasses the views of our customers across the full range of our services, including the channels we provide. The surveys give us a clear picture of how our services are perceived by customers, including how well delivered they are, and how easy or difficult they are to access. These provide baseline information on customer expectations and satisfaction and also provide the basis for tracking, over time, how customer perceptions of the service change as Jobcentre Plus implementation is rolled out, helping to drive the process of performance improvement.</p>
</ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_174">The results of the 2004 survey were published on 30th September 2004. The 2005 survey commenced in September.

Contact centre staff ask the customer a series of questions to assess their potential eligibility to Jobcentre Plus benefits and then arrange to call the customer back at a mutually agreed time, to assist in completion of a claim form.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_187">Prior to implementation of CMS, customers wishing to claim social security benefits were required to either telephone a local office, or visit an office to request a claim form. It would then be necessary for them to complete the form and return it by post or take it back to an office. If there was any need for further information, forms would be sent back to customers, who would then need to re-submit them, prior to their entitlement to benefit being established. Individual customer circumstances vary, as did standards of self-completion of forms and, therefore, the cost of this process for individual customers would vary greatly. It would particularly depend on the extent to which further information was needed following initial submission of claim forms.</p>

Notes:<br>

1. State pension age is 60 for a woman and 65 for a man. State pension does not have to be claimed at state pension age. A person can also stop claiming it once they have claimed it.<br>

2. A woman may not be entitled to a state pension based on her own national insurance contributions when she reaches her state pension age. She may be able to get a state pension based on her husband&#039;s contribution record but will have to wait until he starts claiming it.<br>

3. Local authorities are assigned by matching postcodes against the relevant Office for National Statistics (ONS) postcode directory.<br>

4. The figures for March 2000 and March 2001 are based on data from the 5 per cent. samples. These figures have been adjusted to make their totals consistent with the later WPLS data. These figures are subject to a degree of sampling variation.<br>

5. The figures for May 2002 to May 2005 are directly from the WPLS 100 per cent. data.<br>

6. The pensioner population figures are the ONS mid-year population estimates.<br>

7. All figures are rounded to the nearest 100.<br>

8. The data are taken from extracts of PSCS as at 31 March and 31 May for the appropriate years.<br>

9. The total figures for Hertfordshire and Essex are composed of the sum of the relevant local authorities shown in notes 10 and 11. Due to overlap in geographical boundaries, these figures may not include all cases within these counties.<br>

10. The local authorities for Essex are: Basildon; Braintree; Brentwood; Castle Point; Chelmsford; Colchester; Epping Forest; Harlow; Maldon; Rochford; Tendring; Uttlesford.<br>

11. The local authorities for Hertfordshire are: Broxbourne; Dacorum; East Hertfordshire; Hertsmere; North Hertfordshire; St Albans; Stevenage; Three Rivers; Watford; Welwyn Hatfield.<br>

12. The pensioner population is defined as the sum of all females aged 60 or over and all males aged 65 or over.<br>

1. Entitlement estimates are subject to a wide range of uncertainty; they are rounded to the nearest 100,000 and the proportions of individuals over pension age are rounded to the nearest 5 per cent.<br>

2. Individuals entitled include a small number of partners below state pension age.<br>

3. The pension credit projections assume the continuation of the current uprating of the standard minimum guarantee by earnings, although the Government is not committed to this beyond 2008.<br>





4. Estimates of the number of households and individuals eligible for pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit in the future are available for Great Britain. These are based on a long term version of the Department&#039;s Policy Simulation Model, which uses Family Resources Survey data for 2003&#150;04 projected forward into the future to estimate the extent of eligibility for each pensioner household on the survey.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Caseloads are rounded to the nearest hundred therefore totals may not sum.<br>

2. Pension credit (PC) replaced minimum income guarantee (MIG) on 6 October 2003. Existing MIG recipients were automatically converted onto pension credit on that date (assuming they still met the eligibility criteria)<br>

3. Data from the Generalised Matching Service (GMS) 100 per cent. scans taken on 17 October 2003, 15 October 2004 and 10 June 2005. All figures have been rated up to give month-end estimates.<br>

4. These figures are early estimates. Operational processing times mean that a number of claim commencements and terminations are not reflected in the figures. The final figures incorporated within the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) will take account of such cases.<br>

5. Parliamentary constituencies are assigned by matching postcodes against the relevant ONS postcode directory.<br>

<i>[holding answer 28 November 2005]:</i> The Department does not allocate funding to national health service trusts. Primary care trusts (PCTs), with their specific local knowledge and expertise, are now responsible for the commissioning of all health services and, to reflect this responsibility, funding is allocated to PCTs. Funding for NHS trusts is therefore dependant on the level of services they are able to contract with commissioning PCTs.

Over the two years covered by this allocation PCTs will receive an average increase of 19.5 per cent.

T51(A)&#151; toxic effect of alcohol<br>

1. The data only cover 2003&#150;04 because the 2004&#150;05 data will not be ready for release before December 2005.<br>

2. The data shown are only for 1996&#150;97, rather than 1994&#150;95, for two reasons: international classification of diseases (ICD) 10 codes as requested are not applicable for 1994&#150;95 because ICD10 was only introduced in 1995&#150;96. Attempts to back reference the codes to the ICD9 code list do not reveal a comparable data set. Secondly, strategic health authorities (SHAs) were introduced from 2002&#150;03 and we have done a mapping exercise to apply the new boundaries back to 1996&#150;97. Before this point, SHA breakdowns are not applicable. As such, 1996&#150;97 has been presented as the earliest year where both diagnosis and geographical conditions can be met.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

2. Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier is derived based on patient&#039;s date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.<br>

3. The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the hospital episode statistics (HES) dataset and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

4. Figures are grossed for both coverage and missing/invalid clinical data, except for 2003&#150;04, which is not yet adjusted for shortfalls.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

2. Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier hospital episodes statistics identification (HESID). This identifier is derived based on patient&#039;s date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.<br>

3. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data, that is, the data is ungrossed.<br>

 I understand from my right hon. friend the Secretary of State for DEFRA that, in-line with Government policy there has been no disposal of solid radioactive waste at sea since 1982. Any need to notify instances of disposal of radioactive waste at sea has therefore not arisen. In the unlikely event that such unauthorised disposals did arise, these would need to be reported to the appropriate environmental regulator as they would be in breach of the Radioactive Substances Act 1993, and therefore would constitute an illegal act. The environmental regulator in Northern Ireland would be the Environment and Heritage Service; in England and Wales, the Environment Agency; and in Scotland, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.

 Evidence from elsewhere suggests that, in addition to protecting the public and employees from exposure to second-hand smoke, comprehensive controls help to reduce smoking prevalence which is greater among lower socio-economic groups. During the course of my fact-finding visits to Dublin and New York in July, I was struck by the strength of the argument that partial controls would, in effect, create a two-tier work force whereby some employees would be protected and others would not.

 Water charges will not be based on the level of local rates levied on a domestic property.

This will mean that separate charges for water and sewerage services will be based on a standing charge, together with a variable charge based on the discrete capital value of the property. The charges will be levied and collected by the water company and will be entirely separate from local rates.
