 The Government recognise the damaging economic impact of copyright theft and infringement, and unlawful peer-to-peer file-sharing in particular, on the creative sector. Although the music industry is currently affected most by this, other industries&#151;such as film, computer games and publishing&#151;will be increasingly affected as higher broadband speeds are introduced. Last year we set up a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Government, internet service providers (ISPs) and rights holders, as a first step to finding agreement on a way forward. Outcomes from the MOU informed the proposals set out in the Digital Britain Interim Report (DBIR) in January. The DBIR proposed a requirement for ISPs to notify their customers when rights holders identified them as engaging in unlawful file sharing. Information on the most serious infringers would then be made available to rights holders (based on the collection of data on the notification requests from rights holders, and subject to a court order) to help them prioritise legal action against those infringers. This would provide a form of graduated response up to prosecution for the most serious infringers. Other forms of graduated response have been suggested to us in response to consultations on this issue, and we are considering the merits of these. We have also consulted on the idea of creating a rights agency, the establishment of a code of practice and Ofcom&#146;s possible involvement in this. We have discussed these issues and ideas at ministerial and official level both between Departments and with many interested parties, including ISPs, the UK Film Council and other rights holders&#146; representatives. We will issue a further consultation on the legislative proposals shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="90518w0001.htm_para1"><a name="09051813000094">More generally, the DBIR acknowledged the structural and cyclical pressures on the UK&#146;s media industry and the threats to continued investment in UK-originated content in the digital world. We recognise the challenges and opportunities presented by the transition to digital, and the DBIR made a commitment to investigate ways to address these issues further. Our conclusions will be published in the final Digital Britain report.</p>

 The Department for Transport has recently published a consultation paper on possible changes to the administration of concessionary travel. Option 3 within this consultation paper is for the administration of the statutory minimum bus concession to be moved to central Government and for bus operators to be reimbursed through national negotiation with the Department.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="90518w0003.htm_para9"><a name="09051813000405">If this option was chosen following the consultation, the Department would need to undertake further detailed assessment of the administrative and financial consequences of such a model.</p>

A move to central administration and reimbursement would bring with it a number of complexities, including the potential for duplication of reimbursement negotiations if enhanced concessions continue to be offered at a local level. In addition to any transitional start-up costs, the Department currently estimates a move to central administration would have an average annual cost of &#163;8 million, offset by average annual savings to local authorities of &#163;10.6 million.</p>

<i> [holding answer 11 May 2009]:</i> Piracy in the Gulf of Aden and off the Coast of Somalia is a symptom of the ongoing instability and lack of economic opportunities in the horn of Africa. Although the security situation makes it difficult to access the region to conduct a full assessment, it is likely that poverty in rural communities in Puntland is one of several contributing factors.</p>

<i> [holding answer 11 May 2009]:</i> The Transitional Federal Government have stated that its priorities are reconciliation, security and the development of governmental institutions. Given Somalia&#146;s recent history, it faces considerable challenges. However, it is receiving international support and has produced an initial three-month budget, which harnesses port revenue to enable the re-establishment of key Ministries in Mogadishu to take its priorities forward.</p>

 We have received a number of reports from non-governmental organisations (NGOs) stating that the trials of those connected with the disturbances in Tibet in March 2008 were not compliant with international standards, and that the evidence against the individuals concerned was unsound and the convictions therefore unsafe. We have consistently expressed our concern at the need for proper due process for all those detained, and our belief that any trials should be conducted justly, fairly and transparently. The fact that independent observers were not allowed at these trials means that we have been unable to verify that the human rights of the defendants were respected, and that the trials were free from political interference. This, together with the reports from NGOs, does give us real cause for concern, as does the verdict of the death penalty, to which the UK is opposed in principle. As a consequence, and working closely with our EU counterparts, we are urging the Chinese authorities not to carry out the sentences imposed on those convicted. I made these points in similar terms in my written response to Free Tibet and the Tibet Society at the beginning of May.</p>

<i> [holding answer 11 May 2009]:</i> Discussions were held with all Government Departments involved in countering terrorism. The long-term aim of the Contest strategy is to reduce the risk to the UK and its interests overseas from international terrorism, so that people can go about their lives freely and with confidence. All communities continue to play a role in helping to ensure the success of the strategy by rejecting violent extremism and challenging it. Strong and empowered communities are better equipped to effectively reject the ideology of violent extremism, isolate apologists for terrorism and provide support to vulnerable individuals and institutions.</p>

 The Home Office no longer sets top down numerical targets for the police (with the exception of a single target to raise public confidence) and local target setting is therefore a matter for local criminal justice boards (LCJBs). The Police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), along with other partners, are members of LCJBs which co-ordinate criminal justice planning and activity at the local level. LCJBs are required to agree local targets to improve their efficiency and effectiveness in bringing crime, in particular the most serious acquisitive, sexual and violent offences to justice.</p>

 We have previously sought to measure our ability to bring force elements from their peacetime readiness levels up to the level required to deploy on potential contingent operations at the most demanding scale of effort, known as force generation, and to deploy them on such operations, sustain them there and recover them to their home base thereafter. This system has been predicated on the assumption that, for the most part, the armed forces will be operating below the concurrency level envisaged in defence planning assumptions and that they should therefore be working to maintain their capacity to deploy on potential contingent operations. The longer we have been operating above that concurrency level, the more theoretical this has become.

and recovering force elements above the long term concurrency levels assumed in our long term planning. The metrics we have been using to measure and report our hypothetical capability have consequently provided little or no meaningful management information. We are therefore working to develop a more useful way of measuring and reporting performance in this area for the time when the operational tempo has reduced and the forces structure is recuperated to the point where it is appropriate once more to seek to measure our contingent as opposed to our current capability.</p>

 Tax avoidance has the potential to damage the public finances and the provision of public services in the UK. For this reason, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) monitors tax avoidance closely at all times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="90518w0015.htm_para1"><a name="09051829000818">Since 1997, the Government have been taking steps to tackle avoidance, by reforming the tax system, closing loopholes and introducing the disclosure regime. Anti-avoidance measures brought in as a result of the disclosure rules have closed over &#163;11 billion in avoidance opportunities. The disclosure regime ensures that should further avoidance schemes emerge, the Government can quickly take action to protect tax revenues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="90518w0015.htm_para2"><a name="09051829000819">The Government agree that more action is still needed to mitigate the effects of tax avoidance. Budget 2009 sets out measures to close down avoidance schemes, including principles-based legislation on financial product avoidance, the successful introduction of which could facilitate this approach being applied to other areas, and work to further extend and improve the disclosure regime. These measures raise over &#163;1 billion during the period 2009-10 to 2011-12, and protect a further &#163;3 billion per year of tax receipts by 2010-11. The Government keep the need for further measures under review.</p>

 The Government consulted extensively on the possibility of a general anti-avoidance rule in 1998. Based on the outcome of that consultation, we made the decision not to introduce such a rule at that time, although the situation would be kept under review. That position is unchanged.</p>

 As at 12 May 194,303 people have been registered in more than 40 camps for displaced persons. More than 173,000 of these are in Vavuniya, most of them in three very large camps at Menik Farm. The conditions are far from ideal but starting slowly to improve. There is no reliable data available for deaths in the camps or to what extent those could be attributable to the conditions there. By far the greatest concern is the terrible loss of life in the conflict zone and in hospitals overwhelmed with sick and wounded patients.</p>

 In terms of international standards for assistance such as shelter, water and sanitation, food, health and education, the camps started from a very low standard but are gradually improving. Large influxes such as more than 113,000 people in one week made camp conditions very difficult to manage, particularly their sanitation. The UK Government have repeatedly pressed the Government of Sri Lanka to abide by international humanitarian standards and to work with humanitarian agencies to improve both protection and assistance, with a view to meeting their commitment of early return of at least 80 per cent. of the displaced population before the end of the year.</p>

 We have no firm figure. Access to Government of Sri Lanka controlled camps was a serious concern earlier this year, especially with regard to non-governmental organisations (NGOs).

 Although the situation is far from ideal the 194,303 internally displaced people registered in camps in Vavuniya, Jaffna and Mannar do have access to humanitarian assistance. The situation is improving slowly. However, the population trapped in the conflict zone in Mullaitivu district is almost entirely isolated from any humanitarian assistance. Only the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has any kind of access and is able only to deliver 25 tonnes of food and other emergency items three times a week to a population of at least 50,000&#151;barely three days of food each week. The UK Government repeatedly press at the highest level for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to enable the ICRC to evacuate the sick and wounded and to deliver sufficient humanitarian aid.</p>

<i> [holding answer 14 May 2009]:</i> The protection of wharves for river-related use is a matter for the Mayor of London and the relevant local authority, which in this case is the London borough of Newham. The London Plan contains policies to protect a number of safeguarded commercial wharves on the Thames and the Lower Lea and to require referral to the Mayor of any proposals for non river-related uses of these wharves, including housing development. The borough development plans are required to reflect the strategic policies through the inclusion of detailed development control policies. In the case of the Lower Lea, north of Prescotts Lock, there are two safeguarded wharves, Mayer Parry and Priors wharves and these are protected through the saved policies of the Newham Unitary Development Plan of 2001. Change of use of unprotected wharves would be subject to the borough's general policies and, in determining applications for housing development, it would be for the council to judge the suitability of the proposal.</p>

 Local authorities who wish to consider transferring their social housing to a registered social landlord (RSL) need to ensure that there are clear benefits from doing so and that the proposal would have the support of tenants. The Department has published guidance to local authorities, the Housing Transfer Manual 2005 and a 2006 supplement, which sets out the process and assessments required.</p>

 The UK does not have a national mandatory retirement age.

 The figures requested are shown in the following table. The increase in the level of payments in 2005-06 was principally caused by one fraudulent transfer which resulted in payments of more than &#163;8.1 million. The raised level of payments in subsequent years is attributable to a range of factors&#151;including increasing numbers of registered transactions, greater availability of credit providing more opportunities for fraudsters, increases in property values resulting in the losses from each fraud being higher, and more professional as opposed to domestic frauds. The number of frauds must be seen against the overall numbers of transactions processed in each year. For example, in 2007-08, Land Registry processed 5,638,226 applications to alter the register and there were 60 successful indemnity claims based on fraud.</p>

We are making progress with the proportion of young entrants from lower socio economic groups going to university increasing steadily, reaching almost 30 per cent. in 2007. This year we are investing &#163;89 million in the Aimhigher programme which raises the aspirations of young people to progress further and enter HE, and launched Aimhigher Associates across England with 5,500 undergraduates from state schools mentoring 21,000 learners to promote progression to HE from state schools.</p>

 Apprenticeship frameworks typically take between one to three years to complete depending on the level and type of framework, the prior attainment and needs of the apprentice. These factors and an individual&#146;s speed of learning mean that length of time as an apprentice can vary enormously. Our primary measure of quality is the completion rate which last year was 64 per cent.; up from 37 per cent. in 2004/05.</p>

 As we said in the Children&#146;s Plan, over 60 per cent. of head teachers are now over 50, which means that within the next decade a whole generation of head teachers will be retiring. Of the number of head teachers in post in 2009 we estimate that by 2010, 6 per cent. will have retired, by 2015 this will have risen to 38 per cent. and by 2020 it will have reached 55 per cent.<sup>(1)</sup> Dealing with the loss of their skills and experience will be a challenge but also an opportunity for innovation and reform. We have invested &#163;30 million in the National College for School Leadership&#146;s succession planning strategy which is working with schools, local authorities and faith bodies around the country to develop local solutions to find, develop and keep great head teachers.</p>

 We asked Sir Jim Rose to review the primary curriculum in order to reduce prescription and give schools more time to teach essential knowledge and skills in greater depth. In the revised primary curriculum, it is proposed that, from 2011, schools will be required to teach children the broad chronology of major events in the UK, from ancient civilisations to present day. At least two key periods of history that were significant to the locality and the UK must be studied in depth. A consultation on these proposals will run until 24 July.</p>

 Between 2001 and 2009 the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) has supported a significant number of initiatives to increase both the number and quality of school based mentors in initial teacher training (ITT) and in continuing professional development. Since 2001 the number of trainee teachers has risen from 27,000 to over 36,000 this year. In order to ensure that all trainees have a well trained mentor in their placement schools the TDA has invested in significant programmes:</p>

This project is a two-year evaluative pilot, being delivered by the Learning and Skills Network that will provide face-to-face, telephone and e-mentoring for 600 (rising to 800 in the second year) science and mathematics trainee teachers, newly qualified teachers and teachers in their second year of teaching.

The Government are committed to the introduction of the Masters in Teaching and Learning programme from 2009/10, an initiative that will establish teaching as a masters-level profession. A key element of that will include the identification and training of in-school coaches.</p>
