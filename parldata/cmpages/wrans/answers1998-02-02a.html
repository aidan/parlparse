<P>
<a name="80202w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Ann Taylor: </B> 
 The UK Anti-Drugs Coordinator, Keith Hellawell, took up his post as a special adviser to Government on 5 January. He therefore has no specific powers, and has been tasked with reviewing all aspects of the Government's existing action against drugs--including overseeing a Comprehensive Spending Review of existing drug resources. When this review is complete, he will advise Ministers on a new strategy.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80202w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 I have received 2 representations specifically about overcrowding on the trans--Pennine routes between Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield. Both representations were complaints about journeys affected by disruption which caused some cancellations and delays, affecting available capacity. The Franchising Director places an obligation on operators to avoid excessive overcrowding by requiring train operators to make reasonable endeavours to ensure that sufficient capacity is provided on each train.

<P>

<a name="80202w01.html_para0">Performance on services in the West Yorkshire area has improved significantly in recent months as Regional Railways North East have reduced the impact of driver shortages. I want that improvement to be sustained.

<P>
<P>

 No United Kingdom transport operators have powers to prevent the publication of safety information relating to their operations beyond those that are provided by normal rules of commercial confidentiality.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80202w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 It was the previous Government which proposed the privatisation of London Underground. We are totally opposed to wholesale privatisation and are developing proposals for public-private partnership. We have received over eight hundred letters about the Underground since the election. While detailed figures are not kept, it is clear that, of those letters which referred to privatisation, only a handful supported it and the vast majority opposed it.

 Private prosecutions under health and safety legislation can be brought with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The role of the Health and Safety Executive in relation to a private prosecution would be to disclose to the parties, on request, any information available publicly under the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information and/or the Environmental Information Regulations 1992, and any other information it has which the Court requires it to provide.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80202w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 My Department has issued, in 1995, a Guidance Note for Departments entitled "Government Residential Property--Securing Better Use of Empty Homes", which encourages Government Departments to liaise with local authorities about the use of empty homes and encourages temporary letting, particularly when empty properties are not being sold immediately. It is for individual health trusts to decide for themselves how best to make use of surplus property, but the guidance was circulated to all trusts in June 1995 so that they could have regard to its advice.

[26823]<P>
<P>
<P>

 The Commission proposed a standard of one milligramme per litre for boron. The Council in its Common Position unanimously accepted that value.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is his policy in respect of the terms of the amended EC Directive on Drinking Water as they relate to the powers given to exempt drinking water supplies <i>(a)</i> of less than 10 cubic metres of water per day and <i>(b)</i> serving 50 people or less from the terms of the directive; and if he will make a statement. [26821]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80202w01.html_spnew11"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The proposal for a revised Drinking Water Directive is at the stage of the Council having agreed a Common Position.

Policy on implementation cannot be decided until the terms of the Directive are settled, which may not be for some time.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80202w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 I have no plans to do so. Decisions about early retirement for local authority employees are the responsibility of locally elected councillors. It is for them to establish their own policies and decide, within the appropriate regulations, whether or not to award added years in each particular case. However, my Department will be reviewing several aspects of the early retirement compensation arrangements, taking into consideration the Audit Commission's recent report on early retirement in local government.

 In the light of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions statement to the House on Wednesday 28 January 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 466-74, about the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL), the Secretary of State has decided to defer until 25 March the date by which he must reach a decision on whether to hold a public inquiry into Thameslink 2000. The reason for this is that powers for works which form important components of the Thameslink 2000 project are contained in the CTRL Act 1996 and cannot be used other than as part of the CTRL.

<a name="80202w02.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Etherington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he expects to announce the outcome of consultation on the local government finance settlement; and if he will make a statement. [27182]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80202w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Prescott: </B> 
 I am today laying before the House the Local Government Finance Report (England) 1998-99, the Limitation of Council Tax and Precepts (Relevant Notional Amounts) Report (England) 1998-99, and the Special Grant Report (No.31). These reports establish the amounts of revenue support grant (RSG) and non-domestic rates (NDR) to be paid to local authorities in 1998-99, and the basis of their distribution; specify the amounts which are to be used as the basis of comparison for measuring increases in certain local authorities' budgets in 1998-99 for the purposes of capping, and provide for a special Standard Spending Assessment (SSA) reduction grant to be paid to certain authorities for 1998-99. Drafts of these reports were issued for consultation on 2 December 1997. I also announced on that date my provisional guidelines for capping the budgets of local authorities. The Department received written representations from 248 authorities and my Ministerial colleagues at DETR met 95 delegations from local councils.
<P>

<a name="80202w02.html_para0">I have considered the views of local authorities and others who have commented on my initial proposals. However, I have decided to make no changes in the SSA methodology which formed the basis of consultation, nor in the capping guidelines. The SSAs for individual authorities may be slightly different from those at consultation, generally reflecting more accurate data that have become available since then.
<P>

<a name="80202w02.html_para1">This year's local government finance settlement is better, fairer and more flexible than the plans set out by the previous Government. We have been able to achieve this within the tight constraints on public expenditure needed to achieve this Government's economic aims. The Government's intention is that local authorities should be able to respond by giving top priority to education--the Government's and the nation's priority. That is why we have made available &#163;835 million extra for education on top of what was originally planned.
<P>

<a name="80202w02.html_para2">We are also publishing, for the first time, a Plain English guide to the dauntingly complex world of local government finance. This carries the Crystal Mark of the Plain English Campaign. I am keen that hon. Members and members of the public have the clearest possible understanding of how local government finance works.
<P>

<a name="80202w02.html_para3">I shall be sending copies of these reports and the Plain English guide to all authorities, together with tables showing each authority's Standard Spending Assessment and its entitlement to RSG, NDR and special grant, and information on capping guidelines and limits. Copies of the reports, tables, the capping information and the guide have been placed in the Library.

 <i>[holding answer 29 January 1998]:</i> The tax law rewrite project continues to make good progress. The project aims to rewrite the UK's direct tax legislation so that it is clearer and easier to use. It commands widespread support from tax professionals and is overseen by a small high-level Steering Committee, chaired by the right hon. Lord Howe of Aberavon CH, QC. In addition a Consultative Committee of representative bodies and other interested parties meets every month to consider issues in more detail.
<P>

<a name="80202w04.html_para0">There will be full consultation throughout the life of the project. The first example of rewritten legislation (on trading income of individuals) was published for consultation last July. It was very well received. A response document will be sent later this week to all who offered comments. A Discussion Document to confirm that our rewrite techniques work on complex provisions, was published in November. A second Discussion Document, examining possible purposive approaches to drafting will be published next month.

[25736]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80202w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Two staff operate the system for receipt and safe-keeping of wills. Their combined annual cost is &#163;60,500. This does not include the cost of storing the wills and the management of the staff, which are incorporated into the overall cost of running the Principal Registry of the Family Division and could be obtained only at a disproportionate cost. 13,732 wills were deposited in 1997 at a fee of &#163;1 each and so the net annual cost is &#163;46,768. It is not possible to assess the cost of operating the system as an open register with facilities for inspection and registering third parties' interests as there is no information available on the number of requests such a system would generate. To research the number of requests that might be made would incur a disproportionate cost. In any event, the wills of living persons are not public documents.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what arrangements will be made to provide ground-based and simulator training for the Army's Attack Helicopter air and ground crew. [27241]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80202w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Subject to satisfactory completion of contract negotiations, we intend to place a Public/Private Partnership contract with a Joint Venture Company (JVC) formed by GKN Westland Helicopters Limited and the Boeing Corporation. The JVC will provide a service to meet all our requirements for ground based training and simulators in support of Attack Helicopter.
<P>

<a name="80202w06.html_para0">This contract will ensure that we can take full advantage of the capabilities of the Attack Helicopter. The contract will run for 30 years and the JVC will be responsible for supplying all the equipment and instructional staff necessary to provide the required level of service.

<P>
<a name="80202w06.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Gordon Marsden: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will publish the results of the study called for by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch on the probability of a random mid-air collision. [27250]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80202w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The study, by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency, concluded that the principle of 'see-and-avoid' in the open Flight Information Region below 2,000 ft resolved confliction in over 99 per cent. of occasions. This implies a worst-case collision rate of 0.118 per 10,000 flying hours for single seat military fast jet aircraft and 0.005 per 10,000 flying hours for General Aviation aircraft.
<P>

<a name="80202w06.html_para1">The Study acknowledged that certain conspicuity measures could further increase the effectiveness of see-and-avoid. We have already initiated a programme to paint the majority of training aircraft black including the Hawk, the Tucano, the Dominie and the Jetstream; training helicopters and the Firefly aircraft are painted in a combination of yellow and black. In addition, the majority of military aircraft are being fitted with High Intensity Strobe Lights, and RAF aircraft with High Power Light Assemblies where installation is not cost prohibitive.
<P>

<a name="80202w06.html_para2">The Study also concludes that an effective safety enhancement would be the installation of a collision warning system to military fast jets. The procurement of CWS is under consideration as part of the Strategic Defence Review.
<P>

<a name="80202w06.html_para3">Flight safety is, and will remain, a key priority and we will continue to pursue initiatives that promise further improvements in that area.
<P>

<a name="80202w06.html_para4">Copies of the Study Report and an accompanying MOD commentary have been placed in the Libraries of the House.

 Statistics are not held in the form requested. My Department has a target of reply to letters from hon. Members within 15 working days of receipt. Since 14 May 1997, ministers have replied to 63 per cent. of letters within this target and to 79 per cent. within 20 working days. All replies are normally taken by hand to the mail room at the House of Commons, unless we have been asked to make other arrangements by the hon. Member concerned, within 1 working day of being signed.

The EC has encouraged the Government to consult international partners to make a clear statement of how they intend to proceed with land reform.

 The Government support the aim of providing a better international framework for investment, which we believe has an important part to play in helping the poorest countries attract inward investment. My Department is commissioning a study to look at any implications the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) may have for developing countries, which we will share with our negotiating partners. Although the MAI is not designed for poorer developing countries, we support continued consultation with them on this matter.

 My right hon. Friend the Chancellor for the Exchequer leads on debt policy. But my Department is closely involved because debt relief can make an important contribution to the elimination of poverty in developing countries. In agreeing the Government's line to take for Paris Club meetings, the Department for International Development seeks to ensure that, in determining the amount of relief to be provided, due account is taken of the debtor country's ability to pay, and that essential public expenditure, particularly in the social sectors, can be maintained.

Where funeral directors do not do this, I urge consumers to report them to the relevant trade association of the Funeral Ombudsman Scheme as applicable. I am concerned that there is not enough transparency in this and in other aspects of the funeral business and I am looking to the industry in the first instance to improve consumer protection.

There is, of course a constructive dialogue between the Departments for implementing policy in this area.
<P>

<a name="80202w09.html_para4">A detailed survey was carried out in May 1995, commissioned by the DTI's New and Renewable Energy Programme. The objectives of the survey were to establish how many active solar water heating systems have been installed, how many are still in use and how they have performed. As part of the work, a questionnaire was sent to about 1400 households, 50 per cent. of which were returned. The report concluded that some 49,000 active solar heating systems had been installed in Britain, of which 42,000 were still in use. In general, systems were performing well and the majority of users were 'very satisfied' with their system. The report is available from the Renewable Energy Enquiries Bureau at ETSU--"Survey of Active Solar Heating Systems in the UK--ETSU S/P3/00238/REP".

 The Office of Electricity Regulation is currently investigating the performance of the Public Electricity Suppliers (PES) in dealing with the aftermath of the recent storms.
The investigation includes the problems that occurred with the communication system and why it took so long to reconnect the supply of some nursing homes.

<P>
<a name="80202w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 No. In the first instance the ticket allocation system for the 1998 Football World Cup is a matter for FIFA and the French organising authorities. My hon. Friend, the Minister for Sport, is concerned about the inadequacy of World Cup tickets and I understand he has discussed this with the FA. I also understand that both they and the Scottish Football Association are doing everything they can in making representations to the French World Cup organisers and to FIFA to maximise the number of World Cup tickets available for English and Scottish supporters.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80202w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 January 1998]:</i> From data readily available exposure under ECGD guarantees for defence business with Algeria was &#163;97.8 million at end of December 1997 with a further &#163;82 million exposure in respect of non-defence business giving total exposure of &#163;179.8 million. Over &#163;160 million of this total exposure has been paid as claims, but these sums have been rescheduled and thus are expected to be recovered. There is currently no medium term ECGD cover available for defence-related goods as ECGD cover for new business is primarily available for sales of equipment to the Oil and Gas sector.
The Government maintain trade relations with Algeria within the framework of the EC/Algeria Co-operation Agreement: we support the current negotiations on a new EU/Algeria <i>Association</i> Agreement, providing for reciprocal liberalised trade: we also welcome Algeria's application to accede to the World Trade Organisation.

<P>
<a name="80202w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mrs. Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 January 1998]:</i> Reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel takes place at two sites in the UK: BNFL'S Sellafield site in Cumbria and the UKAEA's Dounreay site in Caithness. Both these sites are subject to the nuclear safety regulatory system enforced by the nuclear industry's independent safety regulator, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). Under the nuclear site licensing regime, continued operation of any civil nuclear installation, including reprocessing facilities, is dependent on the HSE being satisfied about its safety.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade if she will list by category, the records which her Department maintains on exports over the last 30 years of British <i>(a)</i> agricultural machinery, <i>(b)</i> motor lorries and <i>(c)</i> motor cars. [27018]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80202w10.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Information on UK exports of goods is collected and published by HM Customs and Excise ("Overseas Trade Statistics of the United Kingdom, HM Customs and Excise"). In 1997 under the combined Nomenclature classification system there were approximately 60 categories of agricultural machinery, 15 categories of motor cars (excluding motor caravans) and 30 categories of lorries. The exact number of categories has varied from year to year as the classification system has been adapted to changes in the range of products. The last major revision to the classification system was 1988.
The Department holds copies of the relevant publications for 1976, but the cost of extracting the data for the relevant categories would be disproportionate. However, the 1997 edition of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders' publication "World Automotive Statistics" helpfully reproduces Customs and Excise data on car, commercial vehicle, and agricultural tractor exports from 1946 to 1996. A copy of this publication is available in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80202w11.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Barry Jones: </B> 
To ask the President of the Board of Trade is she will make a statement about the application by British Aerospace for launch aid for the Airbus 340X. [27297]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80202w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce that the Government have agreed to a public/private partnership with British Aerospace involving a long-term investment of up to &#163;123 million in British Aerospace towards the design and development of the wing for the new Airbus A340. This represents a major step forward for the UK's involvement in Airbus Industries, which enjoyed its most successful year to date in 1997; it is also a further 



<P>
<P><I>2 Feb 1998 : Column: 486</I><P>
demonstration of British Aerospace's world class expertise in wing design and manufacture--expertise which it has brought to all Airbus programmes to date.
<P>

<a name="80202w11.html_para0">The agreement with British Aerospace continues the Government's drive to create a new partnership between Government and industry. The investment by the Government is repayable and will be on a commercial basis. The terms of the partnership reflect the risk that the taxpayer has been asked to share. The Government will monitor the programme carefully to ensure that the employment and other economic benefits are fully realised, and that all the conditions of the partnership are met.
<P>

<a name="80202w11.html_para1">The new Airbus A340-500 will be the longest range aircraft on the market, operating up to 8,500 nautical miles. Seven launch customers have already placed orders and commitments for around 100 A340-500/600 aircraft; this represents an excellent start which I hope bodes well for the success of the programme.
<P>

<a name="80202w11.html_para2">I am also delighted that Rolls-Royce will provide the engines for the new aircraft, taking the overall British interest in the aircraft to around 50 per cent. The Government announced in November that they would support Rolls-Royce in its engine development programme for this aircraft.
<P>

<a name="80202w11.html_para3">British Aerospace is a major investor in R&D in the UK and much of its technology is diffused to other sectors of the UK economy. Some of the new technology to be incorporated in the new wing has been researched with support from the DTI's Civil Aircraft Research and Technology Demonstration (CARAD programme.
<P>

<a name="80202w11.html_para4">My Department will be discussing the investment with the European Commission.

<P>

<a name="80202w11.html_para5">Parliamentary constituency level information is not available for all DSS benefits. I have asked my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security to write supplying the data that are available.
<P>

<a name="80202w11.html_para6">The Office for National Statistics measures unemployment using the internationally standard ILO unemployment rate. This is measured through the Labour Force Survey, which is a survey of households in the United Kingdom. This is internationally-agreed and counts as unemployed people who are: <i>(a)</i> without a paid job; <i>(b)</i> available to start work within the next two weeks

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The questionnaire used by the BIP is based on the DLA claim pack in use until October 1997. However, it also takes account of customer research undertaken by the Benefits Agency in 1996-97 which highlighted that more "free text" space was needed rather than using a "tick box" format. Although the questionnaire is more than 30 pages long this makes sure that people have the opportunity to fully describe their circumstances and that we obtain enough information to allow Adjudication Officers to reach properly informed decisions. Project staff are considering to what extent the improvements in the revised DLA claim pack can be introduced into the BIP questionnaire.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The most appropriate and sensitive method of gathering information from people receiving the higher rate of mobility combined with the highest rate of care is to visit them and complete an enquiry form. This form is designed to provide an up to date picture of their circumstances. The visits are by appointment and are made at least a week in advance. The letter informing the person about the appointment invites them to have a friend or carer present, reassures them the appointment can be rearranged if it is inconvenient and asks them to contact the Disability Benefits Helpline if they have any special needs, such as an interpreter. Calls to the Helpline are charged at British Telecom's local rate.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>People receiving the higher rate of mobility combined with the middle rate of care are sent an enquiry form by post. They have three weeks to complete and return the form. The letter accompanying the form informs people that they can contact the Disability Benefits Helpline if they have difficulty completing or need more time to return it.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There has been no formal monitoring of the difficulties encountered by DLA customers who have been sent a questionnaire as part of the BIP. Approximately 10 people a week have made use of the BIP forms completion service, which involves a member of the BIP team. This suggests that generally people do not find completing the questionnaire difficult. The average time taken to return the questionnaire is 19 days compared with the 21 days allowed, as at 30 November 1997.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>At 30 November, a total of 33,490 cases had been examined of which 6,953 have been changed. Of these changes, 2,232 have been disallowed, 3,880 reduced and 841 increased. Figures for the period to 31 December and subsequent months will be placed in the House of Commons Library.

 The information requested cannot be ascertained, because the existing Cold Weather Payments scheme does not contain a trigger criterion which combines wind speed with external air temperature.
<P>

<a name="80202w14.html_para1">A number of formulae are used to calculate the combined effects of air temperature and wind speed on the human body when in the open air ("wind chill"). The Building Research Establishment advises that this way of combining temperatures and wind speed is not appropriate when assessing heat loss from buildings, because different heat transfer mechanisms apply.
<P>

<a name="80202w14.html_para2">The amount of additional heating required during a spell of low air temperatures depends on a number of varying factors in addition to wind speed. These include the house type, site and location, insulation standard, the method of heating and its efficiency.

 The pensions review, announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on 17 July, is looking at the central areas of insecurity for elderly people. A key objective of the review is to ensure that pensioners should have an adequate pension in retirement; that they should share fairly in rising prosperity, and that public finances should be both sustainable and affordable.
<P>

<a name="80202w14.html_para5">The first part of the review ended on 31 October and we are now carefully considering the many responses we have received. We are also consulting on how best to take forward our proposals for Stakeholder Pensions and have asked for comments by the end of this month. We aim to publish an initial framework for change in the first half of this year. There will then be a period of further consultation before final proposals are developed.

Redbridge and Waltham Forest District Health Authority (DHA) was established in 1993-94 from the merger of Redbridge DHA and Waltham Forest DHA. 3. Allocations to DHAs were made by regional health authorities (RHA). These figures have been adjusted to take account of the effects of different regional allocation policies. 4. The 1995-96 figures are not comparable with those for earlier years. This is due to additions which were made to DHA allocations for: <i>(a)</i> entry of special health authorities into the internal market. <i>(b)</i> inclusion of certain former national top sliced budgets. <i>(c)</i> inclusion of capital charges. <P>

 <i>Notes:</i> 1. Allocations have been expressed in real terms by using the relevant gross domestic product deflator for each year to convert them to 1993-94 prices. Consequently, the real terms increases between years will not equate to the announced real terms growth. 2. Figures for 1996-97 are not comparable with earlier years because of: <i>(a)</i> the merger of DHAs and family health services authorities (FHSAs). This means that some elements of expenditure that were previously FHSA will be accounted for in the heath authority allocation. <i>(b)</i> loss of population caused by boundary changes at the formation of Redbridge and Waltham Forest Health Authority in 1996-97. <i>(c)</i> re-calibration to ensure that 1996-97 HA baselines were constructed on a common basis (as RHAs pursued different sub-regional allocation policies). This includes funds which were built into DHA baselines before 1996-97 which subsequently former parts of national levies. <P>

 We have no plans to specify which viral load tests should be used by the National Health Service. The choice of treatment regimen for people with HIV and AIDS is a matter for discussion between doctor and patient. The British HIV Association published guidelines for antiretroviral treatment of HIV seropositive individuals last year. These guidelines suggest treatment regimens based on biological markers including viral load measurements. The choice of which test system to use for viral load measurements needs to be informed by clinical and virological expertise.

It is known that a study was conducted at Broadmoor Hospital between 1971 and 1973 under the auspice of the Special Hospitals Research Unit of the Department of Health and Social Security to measure the effect of hormones in the treatment of deviant sexual behaviour. 12 male patients participated in the study on a voluntary basis. The study's findings were published in the <i>British Journal of Psychiatry</i> (volume 125, September 1974). No records of any other tests involving hormones have been traced but hormones are used in the treatment of patients at Broadmoor Hospital on a regular ongoing basis, for example hormone replacement therapy.

We are also looking to the Comprehensive Spending Review, which is now in progress, and the prisons/probation review, in particular, to identity further measures to strengthen the credibility of community sentences as effective and demanding forms of punishment.

<P>

<a name="80202w18.html_para0">The two new objectives which I have set for the police in 1998-99 on dealing speedily and effectively with young offenders and targetting and reducing local problems of crime and disorder reflect the particular importance which the Government attach to tackling these problems. For the first time there will also be a separate key objective on drug-related crime in the light of widespread concern that a high proportion of all crime is attributable to drug misuse. We recognise that it not the responsibility of the police alone to deal with these problems. So all three of these objectives focus on what the police can do in partnership with other local agencies.

<a name="80202w18.html_para1">We have kept the existing objectives requiring the police to maintain and, if possible, increase the number of detections for violent crime: to increase the number of detections for burglaries of people's homes: and to respond promptly to emergency calls from the public. We have done this to provide some continuity in the objectives and, more importantly, to reflect the fact that these continue to be issues of serious public concern.

 We wish to offer greater protection in court for vulnerable witnesses, means of doing so are currently being considered by the inter-departmental review of vulnerable or intimidated witnesses, which were announced by my right hon. Friend on 13 June 1997. The review, which is nearing completion, is wide-ranging and is covering procedures relating to the investigation stage through to the trial itself, including ways to assist vulnerable and intimidated witnesses to give their best evidence safely to the court.

 The Crime and Disorder Bill contains a number of tough new powers to deal with anti-social behaviour. There will be an anti-social behaviour order which local authorities and the police will be able to seek from a court to restrict such conduct, with firm penalties for anyone who breaches an order; a child safety order, which is a welfare-based order to prevent children from behaving in an anti-social manner; local child curfews to protect both young children and their local communities and the establishment of statutory local crime prevention partnerships between local authorities and the police.

 The case for wider availability of in-cell television has been raised in a number of contexts, including the Learmont report in 1995, the all-party Home Affairs Committee report in March 1997, and reports by Her Majesty's Inspector of Prisons. The Government are reconsidering policy in this area and will announce a decision as soon as possible. Any extension of in-cell television would preserve the principles that this privilege should be earnable and similarly liable to be forfeited, and that prisoners should substantially meet the costs involved.

<a name="80202w19.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 A comparison of mandatory drug test results from 1996-97 with those from April to October last year shows a reduction from 19.9 per cent. to 17.4 per cent. of random samples testing positive for cannabis. Similarly, the percentage of random samples testing positive for the opiates has fallen from 5.4 per cent. to 4 per cent. The causes of these trends are not yet established. Work is currently underway to review the entire Prison Drug Service Strategy. In addition, the results of two pieces of research on the effects of mandatory drug testing are expected imminently. Together, this should provide a clearer picture and indicate how these encouraging trends might be maintained.

The Framework Document also applies to the secondment of probation officers to directly managed prisons.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80202w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 A court judgment (Cawley in 1995) has made it clear that the power to imprison fine defaulters should be used only as a last resort. Before imprisoning a fine defaulter, the court must be satisfied that the default is due to the offender's wilful refusal or culpable neglect to pay and it must have tried or considered all other methods of enforcing payment before rejecting them as inappropriate or unsuccessful.
<P>

<a name="80202w20.html_para7">It must be remembered that, in some cases, the imminence of a short prison sentence leads to the payment of fines which have been outstanding for some time, during which the offender has made no effort to pay them. However, prison is an expensive option and we are keen to explore other options for dealing effectively with defaulters. That is why we are currently piloting provisions contained in the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 which allow courts to impose community service orders, curfew orders enforced by electronic monitoring, or a disqualification from driving on fine defaulters who might otherwise be committed to custody.

In March of this year, we will also be contacting all Youth Courts to find out what progress has been made locally to tackle delays and to establish fast tracking arrangements for persistent young offenders. It is intended that the monitoring of a clearly identified group of persistent offenders will ensure that it is clear whether our objectives are being met. However, it is intended that the youth justice system will also fast-track those who would be regarded as persistent on common-sense judgment but who fall outside the monitoring definition of "persistent offenders"--for instance "spree" offenders. We will ensure that the youth justice system hits the real targets.

 The Home Office Research and Statistics Directorate has been monitoring the effects of the 1994 right to silence legislation since its introduction. The findings of the first part of the research, published last December, covered the changes in the frequency of the suspect's use of the right to silence in police interviews. The key findings were a significant reduction in the use of right to silence in police interviews. This reduction applied to both the number of suspects giving complete "no comment" interviews and those who refused to answer questions on a selective basis. The research also shows that those accused of serious offences still exercise their right of silence more frequently than other criminals. The second part of the research is due to be published in the spring and will look at the wider impact of the provisions on the criminal justice system. I shall take a close interest in the findings of this research.

The Appeal in the fourth case above is by the Home Office against a District Judge's refusal to strike out the case as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. A further case, before a Sheriff Court in Scotland, has been struck out. Under Order 38, Rule 1(3) of the County Court Rules and Order 62 Rule 3(3) of the Rules of the Supreme Courts, the normal practice in interlocutory applications is that costs are borne by the unsuccessful party. Standard correspondence from the Treasury Solicitor warns Plaintiffs of this, especially where a case involves a litigant in person who may be unaware of the rules relating to costs.

It will not be possible to indicate future employer pension costs arising from the abolition of tax credits to local authority pension funds until the completion of the 1998 LGPS valuation exercise.

 I have given very careful consideration to the representations I have received. I chaired a meeting of the Welsh Consultative Council on Local Government Finance on 15 December 1997 and met a delegation from Welsh local government last week at which settlement matters were discussed.
<P>

<a name="80202w22.html_para7">I have decided to confirm total standard spending (TSS) at &#163;3,090.5 million and aggregate external finance (AEF) at &#163;2,701.9 million for 1998-99. The increases on 1997-98 in TSS and AEF are 4.0 per cent. and 3.2 per cent. respectively. TSS includes &#163;352.9 million to fund police authorities; &#163;50.3 million extra for schools; an additional &#163;4.4 million for 4 year old education; and &#163;190.2 million for care in the community. I acknowledge that the settlement will mean some authorities will have to make tough decisions, I too have had to make hard decisions on spending priorities within the Welsh block. Under the provisional capping limits I announced in December, Welsh local authorities will be able to increase their year-on-year revenue spending, on average, by 4.8 per cent. The increase for police authorities is 3.8 per cent. In the circumstances I believe it to be a fair deal for local government in Wales.
<P>

<a name="80202w22.html_para8">AEF will comprise &#163;1,799.9 million in revenue support grant; &#163;612.0 million in distributable non-domestic rates; &#163;258.8 million in specific grants (including police grant); and &#163;31.2 million to help local authorities limit council tax increases.

We want to give people the self-respect that comes from working and we want to give the Welsh economy the talent and skills that it needs to compete now and into the next century.

 <i>[holding answer 28 January 1998]:</i> About 10 per cent. of staff equivalent to Grade 5 and above, joined the FCO from other Government departments and at least a third have had (or are on) secondments, loans or attachments outside the FCO. In the past, about three quarters of these have been to other Government departments or Governments overseas, but we have been expanding our Interchange programme and the number of loans to the private sector has increased. More precise information could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80202w24.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 We receive reports from a variety of sources about human rights in Kenya. We are particularly concerned about the persistent problem of police brutality and the evidence of torture and extra-judicial killings. The Kenyan Government are bound under international obligations to end such practices. We will play a full part in ensuring that pressure for such progress is maintained.

<a name="80202w24.html_para0">We have been deeply concerned by recent violence in parts of Kenya's Rift Valley, which appears to have both ethnic and political origins. Our High Commission in Nairobi issued a public statement on 28 January, in concert with other diplomatic missions, expressing concern over the slow and ineffective response by the Kenyan security forces. The statement also urged the Government of Kenya to take prompt, effective action to put an end to the violence and to bring its perpetrators to justice.

<P>
<a name="80202w24.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 We maintain a vigorous dialogue with the Kenyan Government on human rights issues through our High Commission in Nairobi and at Ministerial level when the occasion arises. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary raised human rights issues with the then Kenyan Foreign Minister during the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Edinburgh. The subject was also raised during my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister's meeting with President Moi on 4 January and my telephone conversation with the new Kenyan Foreign Minister on 28 January.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs how the Government's ethical approach to international relations will be applied to the combating of reported human rights violations in <i>(a)</i> Kenya and <i>(b)</i> Algeria.  [26703]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80202w24.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 We have made our concerns about civil and political rights abundantly clear to the Kenyan authorities. Human rights remains an important issue in our bilateral dialogue with the Government of Kenya. Concerns over police brutality have, for example, led to decisions under the revised criteria for licensing arms exports to reject applications for various categories of riot control equipment for the Kenyan police.
<P>

<a name="80202w24.html_para1">On Algeria we, along with EU partners, have made clear our concern for the protection of the Algerian people from terrorist attacks. During the EU Troika mission to Algiers on 19-20 January, we made clear the concerns of the British and European people and pressed the Algerians

The most recent discussions were held at Foreign Minister level at the General Affairs Council in Brussels on 26 January when my hon. Friend, the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Derek Fatchett, reported on the EU ministerial Troika visit that he led to Algiers on 19-20 January.

<P>
<a name="80202w25.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 24 of the 25 A Points in document 5487/98, the text of which will be placed in the Libraries of the House as soon as it is available, were approved. Germany asked for the point on the adoption of a common position with a view to adopting a directive of the European Parliament and the Council on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products to be withdrawn.




<P>
<P><I>2 Feb 1998 : Column: 540</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80202w25.html_para0">At the instigation of the UK Presidency, the General Affairs Council adopted as an A Point a new EU Common Position on Afghanistan. It supports UN peace efforts and promotes work on respect for human rights (particularly the rights of women) and the fight against drugs.
<P>

<a name="80202w25.html_para1">The Council noted the resolutions adopted by the European Parliament listed in Documents 11496/97 and 11502/97. Copies of these documents will also be placed in the Libraries of the House as soon as they become available.
<P>

<a name="80202w25.html_para2">The Council opened with an open debate on the Presidency work programme for the first half of 1998. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, as President of the Council, highlighted the main issues in the coming months: EMU, unemployment, crime and drugs, enlargement, and making Common Foreign and Security Policy more effective. The President of the Commission then explained the Commission's programme with reference to the Presidency's intentions. Other Member States commented and gave their full support to the programme's implementation.
<P>

<a name="80202w25.html_para3">In discussion of relations with the Western Balkans, Ministers welcomed the formation of a new Government in Republika Srpska and, in particular, the commitment by the new Prime Minister, Mr. Dodik, to cooperate fully on the implementation of the Dayton/Paris peace agreement. The Council agreed to provide an initial 6 million ecu in financial assistance. The appropriate Council bodies, in close coordination with the Office of High Representative, will be taking this forward urgently.
<P>

<a name="80202w25.html_para4">The Council welcomed the intended immediate Presidency/Commission visit to Banja Luka to review further assistance for the new government. The Council also looked forward to receiving detailed recommendations on the Commission's proposals for modifying procedures for delivering aid.
<P>

<a name="80202w25.html_para5">The Minister of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Fatchett) reported to the GAC on the Troika Mission which he led to Algeria from 19-20 January. The Council reaffirmed the strong commitment of the Union to remain engaged and agreed to take forward the EU/Algeria dialogue, notably through the negotiations for the EU/Algeria Association Agreement and the proposed meeting between Foreign Minister Attaf and the UK Presidency. The Council expressed its regret that offers of humanitarian assistance had not so far been taken up: they remained on the table. The Council also urged greater transparency on the part of the Government of Algeria. It regretted that the Government had not been able to provide unhindered access for international organisations, NGOs and the media. It looked to the Government of Algeria to accept a visit by representatives of the United Nations in the near future and encouraged greater contact between Algerian and European parliamentarians.
<P>

<a name="80202w25.html_para6">The Presidency briefed the Council on its proposed handling of the European Conference launch in London on 12 March, the launch of the accession process on 30 March and the start of accession negotiations on 31 March.




<P>
<P><I>2 Feb 1998 : Column: 541</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80202w25.html_para7">On China, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary reported on his recent visit to China and Hong Kong. The Council agreed this proposal for an EU/China summit and the need for an intensified dialogue on human rights questions.
<P>

<a name="80202w25.html_para8">Ministers expressed their concern at the increase in violence in Burundi and the stalled regional-sponsored peace process. The EU will review the situation in the Great Lakes region in early February, once the EU Special Envoy for the Great Lakes has returned from the region, and consider further action.
<P>

<a name="80202w25.html_para9">Sir L. Brittan presented the Commission proposal for removing Russia and China from the list of Non-Market Economies for the purposes of anti-dumping. The Presidency informed Member States that they expected to deal with this issue formally at the February GAC.
<P>

<a name="80202w25.html_para10">The GAC took note of the written report on the seventh EU/Japan Summit (Tokyo, 12 January 1998).
<P>

<a name="80202w25.html_para11">In response to the major influx of migrants from Iraq and the neighbouring region, the Presidency has drawn up a 46 point action plan covering elements from all three pillars to deal with the problem. It has also established initial contact with the Turkish government and the UNHCR. The Action Plan was adopted and will be considered at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 29-30 January. Progress will be reviewed at the next GAC on 30 March.
<P>

<a name="80202w25.html_para12">The Council had a lengthy discussion on Iran and agreed that, given Iran's record of support for terrorism and its efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction, the EU should keep in place and develop measures to deter and impede Iranian activity in these areas, including by working for greater EU/US cooperation in these shared areas of real concern. However, the Council also agreed that recent political events in Iran were encouraging and merited a review of the common position adopted by the General Affairs Council on 29 April 1997. Until this review is completed, the existing common measures will remain in force.
<P>

<a name="80202w25.html_para13">The Council discussed the situation in the Middle East Peace Process in the light of my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary's recent visit to Washington, the visit to Israel and the Occupied Territories by the Minister of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Fatchett) and President Clinton's talks with Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Arafat.
<P>

<a name="80202w25.html_para14">The Council reiterated that full and unconditional implementation of commitments made by the parties under the existing agreements is essential to restore mutual confidence in the peace process and provide a firm basis for a full resumption of negotiations on the Palestinian track. It stressed in particular the need for early progress on credible and significant further redeployments in line with the commitments made at the time of the Hebron Agreement, as well as on other outstanding commitments under the Interim Agreement. The Council also underlined the importance of maximum and sustained cooperation between the parties in fighting terrorism, and of the avoidance of unilateral acts which pre-empt final status talks, in particular on settlements and Jerusalem.




<P>
<P><I>2 Feb 1998 : Column: 542</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80202w25.html_para15">The Council reiterated its support for US efforts to restore momentum in the peace process and reaffirmed its intention to play an active role in support of the negotiations, including through the activities of its Special Envoy, Ambassador Moratinos.
<P>

<a name="80202w25.html_para16">The Commission presented a communication on the role of the European Union in the Peace Process and its future economic assistance. The Communication will be discussed in depth at a later Council meeting.
<P>

<a name="80202w25.html_para17">In the margins of the GAC, Ministers also held the first Cooperation Council with Russia following the entry into force of a partnership and cooperation agreement with Russia on 1 December 1997. There was a useful discussion on foreign policy issues, and the EU and Russia agreed to continue with ongoing consultation on key foreign political topics.
<P>

<a name="80202w25.html_para18">There was also a Political Dialogue meeting with Albania at Foreign Minister level on 27 January. EU Ministers gave their full support to helping Albania achieve reconciliation and a return to normality but stressed that primary responsibility lay with the Albanians themselves. The meeting reinvigorated the contact between the parties under the 1992 Cooperation Agreement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80202w25.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The UK Presidency is committed to using the Euro-Mediterranean process to increase co-operation and trust throughout the region; to liberalise trade and to promote investment in the region. The recent tragic events in Algeria underline the importance of the European Union having a wide-ranging dialogue with Algeria, including through the Euro-Mediterranean process.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80202w25.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 Our proposals for an EU Code of Conduct develop the EU's eight Common Criteria agreed in 1991 and 1992 using language in the UK's national criteria announced by my right hon. Friend, the Foreign Secretary on 28 July 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>26-29</i>. Those criteria did not include prior parliamentary scrutiny of licence applications and we are not proposing such a requirement in the Code of Conduct.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what discussions he has had with the French Government concerning his proposed EU code of conduct on arms sales; and if he will make a statement.  [26963]<P>

<P>
<a name="80202w25.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 Following a number of contacts at Ministerial and official level with the French Government, we have succeeded in agreeing on a draft text for an EU 



<P>

Code of Conduct on arms sales. We have now circulated this draft to EU partners and look forward to discussing it with them in detail, with a view to having the Code adopted by Council Declaration during our Presidency of the EU.
<P>

<a name="80202w25.html_para19">The text which we have circulated develops the eight EU Common Criteria agreed at the Luxembourg and Lisbon European Councils of June 1991 and June 1992, using language from the UK's national criteria announced by my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary on 28 July 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>26-29</i>. It also includes a no-undercut mechanism which will involve notifying all partners of denials of export licences and provide for bilateral consultation if one partner is considering a similar export to that which another partner has refused.
<P>

<a name="80202w25.html_para20">If agreed, these measures will break important new ground in regulation of the arms trade. Never before has a no-undercut mechanism been applied to conventional arms exports.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what progress he is making in agreeing on EU code of conduct on arms sales during the United Kingdom's presidency of the EU; and when he intends to publish the code.  [26962]<P>

<a name="80202w27.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 January 1998]:</i> Conditions on Intra-Community trade in meat, and third country imports, are subject to Community rules. These do not include requirements relating to the feed of the animals from which the meat was obtained. Commission Decision 94/381/EC prohibits the feeding of mammalian protein, with certain exceptions, to ruminants. In addition, Switzerland has equivalent provisions in its national legislation. Thus, all countries which have reported cases of BSE in home-bred animals have restrictions on the feeding of mammalian protein to ruminants.
<P>

<a name="80202w27.html_para0">Within the UK, to prevent the risk of cross examination between different types of feed, there is also a ban on feeding mammalian meat and bone meal to all farmed livestock. The UK has had far more cases of BSE than anyone else and that is why our measures go considerably further than those taken elsewhere.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80202w27.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 I have no plans to review arrangements for the labelling of beef in supermarkets. The Government have recently launched the beef labelling scheme, which takes full effect from 31 March 1998. From that date all retail outlets, including supermarkets, will be required to seek prior approval from a competent authority for use of any detailed information, such as geographic origin, which cannot easily be verified at the point of sale. While the Scheme will be voluntary in the first instance I expect the majority of beef sold retail will be covered.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80202w27.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Apart from their inclusion in studies of the PrP gene sequences of species that are apparently resistant to BSE, MAFF has no specific programme of research on spongiform encephalopathies in canines. A survey carried out in 1990/91 on the brains of hounds culled for a variety of reasons from packs in all parts of Britain found no conclusive evidence of spongiform change. The outcome was, however, hampered by the fact that the majority of the 444 brains examined did not come from animals that were suffering from neurological disease.
<P>

<a name="80202w27.html_para1">With respect to cats, MAFF receives notifications of diagnoses of spongiform encephalopathy in domestic and exotic felidae. In collaboration with colleagues in universities and other institutes, MAFF scientists have

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what estimate he has made of the cost to an average family of the financial support paid to the farming industry in each of the last five years.  [26471]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80202w27.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 During the most recent five years for which data are available, the cost of the Common Agricultural Policy in the UK is estimated to have been between &#163;12 and &#163;15 per week for a typical family of four. This consists of costs to consumers due to higher prices for food and expenditure by taxpayers. In addition, UK taxpayer expenditure on national agricultural policies was typically of the order of &#163;1 per week for a family of four, although it was closer to &#163;2 per week in 1996.
<P>

<a name="80202w27.html_para2">These estimates are based on calculations by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development of total transfers resulting from agricultural policies in the European Union, with adjustments in respect of the abatement to the United Kingdom's contribution to the European budget.
<P>

<a name="80202w27.html_para3">The estimates are likely to overstate the savings which could be made by UK consumers and taxpayers if the CAP were removed; in the absence of support, world prices would be higher than at present.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80202w27.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 In addition to the ban in Scotland since 1983, retail sales of unpasteurised cows' drinking milk have been banned in the Republic of Ireland since July 1996. On 1 January 1998 Germany banned the serving of unpasteurised milk in catering in all regions. Other member states permit the sale of such milk under restrictions of varying types.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80202w27.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 We have received a large number of unsolicited representations on the subject of the Government's proposed controls on vitamin B6 in dietary supplements, many in the form of standard letters. It is our policy to reply to all representations received, regardless of the status of the correspondent. We see no reason to either record or assess the qualifications of those making representations.
<P>

<a name="80202w27.html_para4">The regulations required to implement the proposed controls on dietary supplements will be the subject of a formal consultation exercise and, subject to the views of respondents, the responses received will be made publicly available.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80202w27.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The role of the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) is to provide independent advice on matters within its remit. Its members are recognised nationally and internationally as experts in their disciplines which include the interface between toxicology and nutrition. Representations from scientists criticising the COT's advice on the safety of vitamin B6 have been copied to the COT secretariat and, where appropriate, to the Chairman of the COT for comment.

<P>
<a name="80202w28.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. John Cunningham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 January 1998]:</i> I am currently awaiting the Commission's views on detailed proposals for ensuring that all British registered fishing vessels maintain a real economic link with those populations in the UK dependent upon fisheries and related industries. Those proposals are based on a consultation paper issued in July 1997 and subsequent discussions with all sectors of the fishing industry. Once the Commission's views are known, an announcement will be made on the way forward.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what research his Department has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> evaluated into the potential for canine immunity to BSE-related disease to be used to develop vaccines for BSE and CJD.  [25920]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80202w28.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Any resistance that canines may have to infection with BSE may not be associated with an immune response. Indeed there is no "immunity" in the traditional sense of the word with any of the TSEs, so consequently vaccination in its recognised form is unlikely to be possible. In experimental studies in mice, defects in the immune system actually lead to resistance to infection with TSE agents.
<P>

<a name="80202w28.html_para2">Current thinking suggests that "resistance" to infection is associated with significant differences in amino acid sequences of the "incoming infectious agent" and the amino acid coded for by the PrP gene of the animal being challenged. The greater the disparity, the greater the resistance to infection. Studies are currently in place to evaluate the extent of differences in PrP gene sequences of some species, including canines, that appear to be resistant to BSE. These studies are incomplete.

 Some 307,700 tonnes of meat and bonemeal (MBM) and 159,500 tonnes of tallow from cattle rendered under the Over Thirty Month (OTM) and Selective Cull (SC) Schemes are being safely and securely stored in the UK. The Government are considering a number of options for the disposal of these products. I refer the hon. Member to the reply given to my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson) on 15 January 1988, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>294</i>, in which I stated that the Intervention Board has now terminated the restricted stage of its 1997 incineration tender in order that it can pursue disposal options which appear to offer a better prospect of safe, prompt and economical disposal of waste from these schemes. In the interim some MBM is already being burned in high temperature waste incinerators and a number of rendering plants are burning tallow produced from the OTM and SC Schemes as a fuel to power the rendering process.

<a name="80202w29.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 A judgment against the United Kingdom in the European Court of Justice has made clear that there are severe constraints on our power to prevent the export of livestock because of the way they may be treated in the Member State of destination. We are however considering the position. We will in particular be contacting the French government to seek their assurance that steps will be taken to prevent a repeat of the sort of scenes that have occurred with the Festival of Eid-el-Kebir in recent years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80202w30.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Under the new higher education funding system being introduced from 1998-99 universities and colleges will receive &#163;1,000 for every home or EU full-time undergraduate new entrant--from the student and/or from the local authority depending on income assessed. We estimate that this will amount to around &#163;130 million in England in 1998-99, after allowance has been made for costs of some 5 per cent. for collection and any default. This includes tuition fees for new veterinary undergraduates.
<P>

<a name="80202w30.html_para5">The Government have made it clear that the savings from the introduction of tuition fees would be used to improve quality, standards and opportunity for all in further and higher education. For 1998-99 we have announced an extra &#163;165 million for higher education to spend, including a total of &#163;129 million for higher education institutions.

9 January from the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells), what estimate he has made of the extent of the deficit in veterinary graduates qualifying from United Kingdom veterinary schools. [25517]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80202w30.html_spnew14"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Veterinary graduates are employed largely in private practice and the Government do not attempt to forecast demand for them or to estimate whether supply does or does not meet requirements. However, the increase in the numbers of overseas registrations as shown by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons' registration statistics suggests that demand for veterinary graduates in the UK is not being met from UK registered graduates.

The total incomes to which the residual income figures correspond will vary according to individual circumstances. The residual income below which no contribution is expected ("low income") is &#163;16,945: on average this might equate to a total income of around &#163;23,000. The residual income at which parents will be expected to contribute the full &#163;1,000 towards fees ("middle income") is &#163;27,119, which on average might equate to a total income of around &#163;35,000.
