(1) On 1 April 1995, police authorities became authorities in their own right. Prior to that date, police expenditure formed part of county council overall expenditure. For consistency across years, police expenditure has been excluded throughout.<P>

<P>

 Higher and further education colleges transferred out of the local authority sector on 1 April 1992 and 1 April 1993 respectively and this may affect patterns of expenditure before and after these dates.<P>

 Up to 1995-96 includes county and district services to be consistent with 1996-97 unitary authority figures.<P>

<a name="70731w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Opik: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales how many people are employed in each of the executive bodies outlined in annexe B of the White Paper on a Welsh Assembly: what changes to these numbers he envisages following the changes to their status proposed in the White Paper; and if he will make a statement. [11929] 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Davies: </B> 
 Details of staff numbers are published annually in "Public Bodies", a Cabinet Office publication, copies of which are available in the Library of the House. I expect that the reforms detailed in the White Paper will lead to efficiencies in the delivery of services, but it is not possible to say precisely at this stage how this will affect staff numbers. This will depend upon decisions yet to be taken by the boards of the bodies concerned, the Welsh Assembly and me.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Opik: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what savings in administration costs he calculates will accrue from the proposed changes to the executive bodies listed in the White Paper on a Welsh Assembly; and if he will make a statement. [11930]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Davies: </B> 
 I expect that savings in administration costs will accrue from the abolition or merger of five executive non-departmental public bodies, two special health authorities and two training and enterprise councils, because there will be fewer boards, chief executives and so on. But it is not possible to calculate precisely at this stage what the savings will be, because that depends on decisions yet to be taken by the boards of the bodies concerned, the Welsh Assembly and me.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Davies: </B> 
 The telephone helpline cost &#163;13,054.25 to set up. This figure has been included in the published estimates. The Government believe that it is necessary that the public be fully informed of their proposals for a Welsh Assembly, the establishment of which was a key element in the election manifesto.

<a name="70731w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales how many copies of the White Paper on the Government's proposals for a Welsh Assembly have been printed; what forecasts he has made of their likely sales; what has been the total subsidy towards production of the White Paper to date; and if this figure has been included in his Department's published estimates of the cost of disseminating information relating to the Welsh Assembly. [12020]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Davies: </B> 
 Twelve thousand five hundred copies of the White Paper have been printed. Sales forecasts for White Papers is a matter for the Stationery Office. However, it is my intention that this document should be easily available to anyone throughout Wales. Up to now, I have agreed a subsidy of &#163;17,200. Any additional subsidy--for example, because of particularly high demand--will be a matter for negotiation between my officials and the Stationery Office. It is my intention that costs will remain within published estimates. The Government believe that it is necessary that the public be fully informed of their proposals for a Welsh Assembly, the establishment of which was a key element in the election manifesto.

 A printed summary of the Government's proposals will be delivered to every household in Wales. This will be supported by television advertising and telephone helpline. I have no plans to produce a separate video.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales if he will ensure that all publicly broadcast information in relation to the forthcoming referendum in Wales carries subtitles and sign language interpretation. [11999]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Davies: </B> 
 Television advertising in support of the referendum information campaign will carry Teletext subtitles. I will examine the practicality of also including sign language.

 My right hon. Friend announced the broad terms of a strategic review of the trunk roads programme in Wales on 3 July, and we are today publishing a consultation document.
<P>

<a name="70731w01.html_para0">The review will be set firmly within the context of the development of a balanced, integrated transport policy for Wales. I intend to take a strategic approach to the process of making decisions on the roads programme, judging proposals--including those relating to the Gwent levels--on the criteria of accessibility, safety, economy and the environment, together with their contribution to the achievement of an integrated strategy.

<a name="70731w02.html_wqn0"><B> Ms Julie Morgan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what consultations he has had with the chairmen of the Welsh health authorities concerning recent changes in the provision of family planning services; if he will list recent changes in family planning service provision notified to him; and what guidance he has issued to health authorities on the commissioning of such services. [11927]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 I have had no consultation with chairmen of health authorities regarding family planning services. Government policy is that people should be free to choose their source of contraceptive advice and that health authorities' family planning services complement rather than duplicate those services provided by GPs. Guidance which reminded health authorities of their responsibilities was issued to the service in Wales in 1990 and reinforced in 1993 by the "Protocol for Investment in Health Gain: Healthy Living".

 The following figures show the general downward trend of abortions in Wales. The increase in the first quarter of 1996 might be attributable to the reaction to publicity about oral contraceptives and thrombosis in October 1995.

 As required by the statute, we shall decide each application for sanction on its merits having regard both to our policy on sanction applications and to the circumstances of the individual case concerned. Our policy is to continue the approach previously followed--that the power to sanction should not be exercised too widely. Sanction may be appropriate in those cases where the expenditure is incurred in good faith, but in ignorance of the strict letter of the law, or inadvertently without observance of requisite formalities, or under such circumstances as make it fair and equitable that the expenditure should not be disallowed by the auditor.

The Department also processes data for the payment of fees and retainers for the clerks to the general commissioners of income tax, the Lord Chancellor's advisory committee on legal education and conduct and staff of the legal services ombudsman's office. The unit also inputs data to enable the payments of some pensions.

To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster what plans his Department has to extend benefits currently enjoyed by spouses of members of the principal civil service pension scheme to partners of members who are the same sex or a common law spouse.[11829]

<P>

 Any extension of benefits would have a cost and could be made only if there is a willingness on the part of scheme members to meet the cost in full.

<a name="70731w04.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. David Clark: </B> 
 Where a civil servant believes that he or she is being required to act in a way which would be in breach of the Civil Service Code, he or she should report the matter internally in accordance with departmental procedures. If the civil servant involved believes that the response is not a reasonable one, he or she may report the matter in writing to the civil service commissioners.
<P>

<a name="70731w04.html_para0">Two appeals falling within the terms of the civil service code have been investigated by the civil service commissioners and upheld. Details are provided in the commissioners' annual report for 1996-97. A third approach is still the subject of internal departmental procedures. A fourth was resolved within the Department before it became clear whether it fell within the terms of the code.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what estimates his Department has made of the number of over-30-months scheme cattle in Kent requiring incineration over the next three years. [10355]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 A designated abattoir in Kent has been awarded a contract to deal with those animals coming forward for slaughter under the scheme in Kent and the neighbouring counties, notably Sussex and part of Hampshire. It is estimated that 25,000 animals over 30 months of age from these counties will be slaughtered in Kent each year. It is not possible to give an estimate of the numbers which will be incinerated over the next three years because the majority of animals being slaughtered under the scheme at the present time are being rendered prior to disposal. However, a carcase incineration facility may be established adjacent to the over-30-months scheme abattoir in Kent which will offer significant efficiencies.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w04.html_wqn4"><B> Dr. Julian Lewis: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what is the average weight of cattle slaughtered under the over-30-months cattle slaughter scheme; and what proportion of the cattle slaughtered under the scheme exceeded that average weight. [10159]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 July 1997]:</i> The average weight of cattle slaughtered under the over-30-months slaughter scheme is 595 kg.
<P>

<P>
<P>

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how many cattle weighing <i>(a)</i> between 560 kg and 609 kg, <i>(b)</i> between 610 kg and 659 kg, <i>(c)</i> between 660 kg and 709 kg, <i>(d)</i> between 710 kg and 759 kg and <i>(e)</i> over 760 kg live weight have been slaughtered under the over-30-months cattle slaughter scheme during 1997.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Under the Department's action plan for green housekeeping, there is a requirement on all our sites to minimise the generation of waste. So far, it has not been considered appropriate to set specific targets in what is a diverse and changing departmental estate. Although the scope for setting targets remains under consideration, a series of formal environmental audits of our laboratory sites is planned for later in 1997-98.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 This information is not available. Paper recycling schemes are in operation at many of the Ministry's 230 sites and the responsibility for handling such schemes is decentralised. At our London headquarters buildings, 37 tonnes of good-quality waste paper was recycled during 1996-97, which considerably exceeded expectations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 A waste minimisation strategy already forms part of the Department's action plan for green housekeeping, with the objective of reducing the amount of waste produced, encouraging recycling schemes and reusing materials. A leaflet and notices have been issued to all staff and local campaigns have been undertaken to encourage participation, including exhibitions, presentations and the introduction of schemes for recycling paper, tin cans and other materials.

<a name="70731w06.html_para0">Under the Heads of Sheep and Goats Order 1996, the heads--excluding the tongue--of sheep and goats of any age other than those born, reared and slaughtered in Australia and New Zealand must be disposed of as specified waste material. This would include the horns if still attached to the head. However, horns themselves are not considered to be a risk, provided they are removed without breaking into the cranial cavity in order to ensure that there is no risk of contamination with brain material.

 The scientific evidence relating to the safety of vitamin B6 has been reviewed by Department of Health's independent Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment--COT--on two separate occasions.

 The Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment--COT--has considered the toxicity of vitamin B6 on two occasions. The committee reviewed the scientific papers published in national and international journals and noted reports of peripheral sensory neuropathy in humans. There was evidence of nerve damage in animals. It recommended that the level of vitamin B6 in dietary supplements be limited to 10 mg per day. This recommendation applies to supplements sold under food law.
<P>

<a name="70731w06.html_para5">In the light of the COT's recommendation, the Medicines Control Agency's Committee on Safety of Medicines reviewed vitamin B6 containing medicinal products and recommended that those sold on the general sales list--GSL, that is, those freely available to the public--should be limited to 10 mg, while those above 10 mg and below 50 mg should be available under the supervision of a pharmacist while those of 50 mg and above should be available under the supervision of a doctor--prescription only medicines.

 The Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment--COT--has considered the toxicity of vitamin B6 on two occasions. Lists of the references from national and international scientific journals which it considered are lodged in the Library. Following its consideration, the COT published a statement on 4 July 1997. Officials have no specific information on adverse health reactions to higher dose vitamin B6 products in America, but in the years 1987-96 the UK yellow card adverse drug reaction--ADR--reporting scheme administered by the Medicines Control Agency has received a total of 42 reactions associated with products containing only vitamin B6.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to his answer of 23 July, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>591</i>, on changes in disposable income, for what reason the effects of indirect tax changes including excise duties, in the July 1997 Budget were not included in his answer. [11367]

<P>
<a name="70731w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Geofrey Robinson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 July 1997]:</i> The hon. Member asked for the percentage change in after-tax disposable income. Disposable income is generally defined in economic literature as personal income minus personal taxes, where personal taxes consist of inheritance taxes, property taxes and personal income taxes. Disposable income is that part of income which households may use in any way they wish. The amount of indirect taxes paid depends upon what individual households choose to consume--for instance, those households who choose to spend their income on cigarettes will pay more indirect tax than those who choose to spend their income on books.

<P>
<a name="70731w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced in his Budget that a new individual savings account will be introduced in 1999. This will extend the principle of TESSAs and PEPs to encourage people, through tax reliefs, to raise the level of their long-term savings. Individuals, including PEP investors, will have the opportunity during 1999 to switch to the individual savings account, which will provide a tax-free environment for savings. Consideration is being given, in consultation with interested parties, to the scope of a tax-free environment for savings after 1999. A consultative document will be published later in the year.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Robinson: </B> 
 Research suggests that most of the funds going into TESSAs do not represent new savings, with a considerable amount coming from other deposit accounts, but for PEPs there may be a somewhat greater element of new equity investment. The new individual savings accounts will be attractive to a wider range of savers. Extension to those with little or no financial savings at present should make them more effective in attracting new savings.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to his answer of 23 July, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>595</i>, what effect he expects the reduction of VAT on domestic fuel to have on <i>(a)</i> the retail prices index increase in Septemberr 1997 and <i>(b)</i> the basic pension uprating in April 1998, assuming that the uprating is in line with prices and average earnings respectively. [11492]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 July 1997]:</i> The effect of reducing VAT on domestic fuel from 8 to 5 per cent. would be to reduce retail prices index inflation by 0.12 percentage points. The state retirement pension is uprated in April of each year by the annual RPI inflation rate for the preceding September. Uprating by the RPI reflects the changes in prices paid for goods and services; so the real value of the pension is not affected.

 The Government's policy is in line with international customs agreements to which the United Kingdom is a party and under which individuals travelling abroad are entitled to purchase goods duty and tax free, up to specified quantitive or monetary limits. Duty-free shopping for intra-EU travellers is due to be abolished on 30 June 1999 in line with the decision taken by the Council of Finance Ministers towards the end of 1991. Duty-free shopping will, however, continue to be available to those travelling to destinations outside the European Union.

 Goods imported into the UK normally bear VAT at the standard rate 17.5 per cent. Under the terms of a derogation from the sixth VAT directive, as amended by the seventh VAT directive, certain works of art, antiques and collectors' pieces are eligible until 30 June 1999 for an effective rate of VAT at importation of 2.5 per cent.

On 24 July, HM Treasury published a booklet to inform businesses about the practical implications of EMU, which will arise whether or not the United Kingdom joins the single currency. The Treasury has also recently announced the establishment of an advisory group of private sector representatives to provide a two-way exchange between the Government and business about the practical effects of EMU.
<P>

<a name="70731w11.html_para1">The Bank of England participates fully in the work of the European Monetary Institute. The Governor is a member of the Council of the EMI. The Bank of England will continue to be responsible for co-ordinating preparations in the financial sector, especially the wholesale financial markets which will need to be able to use the euro whether or not the United Kingdom joins the single currency.

<a name="70731w13.html_para0">These key targets take forward the work of the previous year's targets in the context of the agency's continuing collocation and restructuring plans. Collocation of the agency will ensure the agency remains in a position to benefit from opportunities for further rationalisation and provide the scope to reform activities which are essential to the achievement of the agency's corporate and business plans. Given all the other pressures on the agency, particularly downward financial pressure, I believe they are challenging but achievable. I have previously arranged for copies of the agency's framework document to be placed in the Library of both Houses and the annual report and accounts for 1996-97 have also been so placed.

 The importance of an air transport capability in the new strategic environment has been demonstrated in numerous recent operations such as the Gulf conflict and Bosnia.
<P>

<a name="70731w13.html_para2">My Department has been closely involved in discussions with European partners on the future large aircraft programme, which is a potential solution to our future air transport requirements. I have now decided that the UK should join partners in issuing a request for proposals to Airbus Military Company for the future large aircraft, and formally endorse the European staff requirement and statement of principles governing the commercial management of the programme.
<P>

<a name="70731w13.html_para3">The programme offers an important opportunity for European industry. The Government believe, however, that there is a need to maintain competitive pressure to ensure best value for money. We shall, therefore, be encouraging our partners to join us in seeking bids from other aircraft manufacturers.

A statement of contribution by the company, a copy of which has been placed in the Library of the House, forms part of the agreement with the Ministry of Defence. We have decided that in the light of this agreement the company will become eligible to be considered for Ministry of Defence orders, although normal commercial relations will not be resumed for some months. Discussions are continuing with the successor companies to Fratelli Borletti SpA, the third company involved in the Foxley case, against whom proceedings are still in train.

 The Commission regularly discusses the costs of the National Audit Office's activities, most recently on 23 July 1997 when it considered the NAO's corporate plan for 1998-99 to 2002-03. The costs of inspecting the accounts of NHS trusts are included in the plan, but were not separately identified or discussed.

<P>

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 In 1996, in response to the White Paper "A Strategy for Sustainable Waste Management", we commissioned consultants to propose a waste minimisation strategy. Before then, there were no statistics available. Our consultants estimated that in 1996 this Department produced around 3,900 tons of solid waste per annum; 2,280 came from our London sites and 1,620 from our Hanslope Park site near Milton Keynes. Of the total, around 2,900 tons went ultimately to landfill. The balance, around 1,000 tons from the London sites, was incinerated by Westminster city council and the heat recovered for power generation.
<P>

<a name="70731w17.html_para0">Our current aim for central London by recycling, mainly paper, is to reduce by the year 2000 the amount of solid waste sent for landfill by 400 tons per annum. equivalent to a 33 per cent. reduction. Elements of this strategy were already in place in 1996 whereby white paper and toner cartridges were recycled.
<P>

<a name="70731w17.html_para1">At our Hanslope Park site, we are aiming for a reduction of 300 tons on the same time scale, representing a 20 per cent. reduction. At Hanslope Park, where we have a dispatch and packing operation, we introduced a recycling arrangement, whereby incoming cardboard packing material is shredded for reuse as an alternative to polystyrene products. We estimate that the financial savings from not dumping the cardboard as landfill, and not having to buy as much polystyrene packing materials, will meet the cost of the shredding equipment within 18 months. This is in addition to significantly reducing the amount of material sent to landfill.
<P>

<a name="70731w17.html_para2">The long-term aim of our waste minimisation strategy is to reduce by the year 2000 the proportion of waste going to landfill to 60 per cent. of the 1996 figure.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs for what reason he proposes to give up British claims to the area of the Atlantic around Rockall. [11779]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 British fishery limits to the west of Rockall will be redrawn upon the UK's accession to the United Nations convention on the law of the sea. The conversion will bring many advantages to the UK, including the right to impose strong anti-pollution measures around our shores and important freedom of navigation. The convention provides that rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.
<P>

<a name="70731w17.html_para3">Even before accession, the UK's claim to 200-mile fishery limits based on Rockall was highly questionable. Rockall itself will remain part of Scotland with a 12-mile territorial sea, and will remain within British fishery limits, as will the Rockall Bank and the new deep water fisheries to the east of Rockall. Redrawing our fishery limits has no effect on our continental shelf to the west of Rockall.

<P>
<a name="70731w17.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the rules relating to straddling stocks under the UN law of the sea convention 1983; when they come into force; and if he will make a statement on the capacity of flag states to take action against foreign vessels taking straddling stocks. [11955]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w17.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 The United Nations convention on the law of the sea--UNCLOS--of 10 December 1982, which enters into force for the United Kingdom on 24 August, contains a number of provisions relevant to straddling fish stocks, including a requirement that the states concerned seek to agree measures to conserve such stocks in the high seas. A detailed framework agreement of 1995 implementing these provisions of UNCLOS has been signed by the United Kingdom, but is not yet in force.
<P>

<a name="70731w17.html_para4">A costal state may pursue into the high seas foreign vessels fishing for straddling stocks within its fishery limits in breach of its law and regulations. The control of vessels fishing for straddling stocks on the high seas is primarily the responsibility of the flag state. A coastal state will also be able to take action to the extent provided in the 1995 straddling stocks agreement, once it enters into force.

 The Departments most involved in matters related to defence exports are the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and HM Customs and Excise. The Defence Export Services Organisation, in the MOD, provides British defence exporters with the strongest possible Government support, within the framework of our defence, security and foreign policies. Licences to export controlled goods are issued by the President of the Board of Trade. All relevant individual licence applications are circulated by DTI to other Government Departments with an interest. These will normally include the FCO, MOD and Department for 



<P>

International Development. The DTI is also the sponsoring Department for the defence industry itself. It works closely with industry on the whole range of issues relating to its effectiveness. The FCO plays an active role in promoting British industry overseas and advises on the foreign policy implications of defence exports. Finally, HM Customs and Excise are responsible for the enforcement of export controls.

We believe that it is important that neither side acts in a way that damages the prospects for peace.

[11732]
<P>

<P>
<a name="70731w20.html_spmin2"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The proposed procedures for identifying and resolving problems over the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament are set out in the White Paper, "Scotland's Parliament" at paragraphs 4.15 and 4.17. The Government believe that problems would normally be resolved amicably, but there would be procedures for establishing the competence of the Scottish Parliament both before and after legislation is considered by it; and there would be provision for unresolved disputes about vires to be referred to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. There is no reason why the courts should not evolve a consistent body of rulings.

<P>

<a name="70731w20.html_spmin3"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The White Paper, "Scotland's Parliament" makes clear that all matters that are not specifically reserved would be devolved and would therefore fall within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament.

 It is made clear in the White Paper "Scotland's Parliament" that responsibility for the criminal justice system and prosecution system for the civil and criminal courts in Scotland would be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. It would be a matter for the Scottish Parliament to determine how it discharges that responsibility, although I would expect it to pay full regard to the independence and standing of the judiciary. The two most senior judicial appointments in Scotland--The Lord President of the Court of Session and the Lord Justice Clerk--would however continue to be made by the Queen, on my advice, but on the basis of nominations from the Scottish Executive.

 Appointments to public bodies are governed by the overriding principle of selection based on merit.

However, even then, age should not be used as the deciding factor when making appointments.

 The Government firmly believe that age discrimination is unfair and makes no economic sense for business or society. However, tackling it is a complex matter and it is important to ensure that any action we take will bring real benefits. That is why we have already announced our intention to consult widely on age discrimination in employment to obtain a consensus on the best way forward.

 Opportunities for work, education and training under our new deal for young people and long term unemployed adults will be provided pursuant to arrangements made by the Secretary of State under the Employment and Training Act 1973, as amended by the Employment Act 1988. The new deal will deliver high quality options for 18 to 24-year-olds who claim the jobseeker's allowance for six months or more. We intend to amend the Jobseekers Allowance Regulations 1996, subject to the approval of Parliament, to ensure that young people who are entitled to benefit from the new deal also have responsibility for participating in the programme, and that there is no additional option of continuing indefinitely on full benefit.

These figures are at 1995-96 prices. In the first year of the new funding arrangements, 1998-99, the savings associated with the introduction of tuition fees and the shift from maintenance grants to loans will be offset by the cost of additional loans expenditure.

 Expenditure on mandatory awards made to students by local education authorities in England and Wales in the academic year 1995-96 was &#163;2,059 million, of which &#163;1,075 million was for maintenance grants. For most students, the grant is means tested primarily on the taxable income of his or her parents and not on the net income of the household. It is not possible to relate the total expenditure on grants to particular levels of parental income. However, in 1995-96, the parents of some 198,000--33 per cent.--dependent students were assessed to make a nil contribution to grant because their income was &#163;15,510 or below. The parents of a further 149,000--25 per cent.--dependent students were assessed to make a contribution of between &#163;45 and &#163;1,000 because their income was between &#163;15,510 and approximately &#163;25,300.

<a name="70731w23.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Waste minimisation forms part of the Department's green housekeeping strategy. The strategy for 1997-98 is based on measuring several streams of waste collected for recycling--paper, aluminium cans, bottles, copier toner cartridges and fluorescent tubes. Within the framework of the strategy, facilities management teams on each of our four main sites--Darlington, London, Runcorn and Sheffield--decide which streams they will measure.
<P>

<a name="70731w23.html_para2">At the end of the year, it is intended that progress will be reviewed against the overall minimisation target and all sites will be urged to extend the range of streams to be measured during 1998-99.

 The Department has set a target of reducing waste by 5 per cent. during 1997-98 and plans to compare records for the period from April to September with those from October to March. The year 1997-98 will then be adopted as the base year for setting realistic future targets.

 We intend that unemployed disabled people will get the help they need to meet the aim of improving their skills, employability and job prospects. Ministers have already decided that disabled people claiming jobseeker's allowance will have early access to the opportunities for work, education and training provided by the new deal for young unemployed people. We will also encourage and enable those with disabilities or a long-standing illness to access training and work, to improve their employability and thereby reduce their dependency on long-term incapacity benefits. Some &#163;200 million from the windfall levy has been set aside to fund this and other measures.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (1) if he will list the amount, and proportion, of paper recycled by his Department in each of the last five years; [11531]
<P>
<UL>(2) what plans he has to introduce a waste minimisation strategy for his Department; [11529]
<P>
(3) if he will make a statement on existing targets set to minimise waste within his Department. [11530]

<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w25.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Tom Clarke: </B> 
 My Department recycled approximately 32 tonnes of paper last year, but no records are available for previous years. Arrangements are now being made to record the proportion of all waste paper which is recycled.
<P>

<a name="70731w25.html_para0">As part of a green housekeeping strategy, my Department is committed to adopting the best environment practices wherever possible and practicable, including reducing the amount of waste produced and maximising that which is recycled. Initiatives already implemented include guidance to staff on paper-saving practices such as using electronic mail, double-side copying, and reusing envelopes, the installation of green bins to collect paper or cardboard for recycling and schemes introduced for the recycling of cans, plastic cups, and printer toner cartridges.
<P>

<a name="70731w25.html_para1">A waste audit was recently undertaken and we will use the results of the audit to help us set a target for minimising waste by the end of August.

 Representations have been received from the Byron Society, the Newstead Abbey Byron Society, the Thoroton Society of Nottinghamshire and four individuals. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is very concerned by reports that the mining will have adverse effects on the structure of these nationally important buildings and is considering what can be done to mitigate the likely impact on these structures or prevent damage from occurring.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w25.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Tom Clarke: </B> 
 My Department is creating a new office for the additional Minister announced following the election. This involves work to one other Minister's office and moving some private offices. In total, five offices will be redecorated. As this work is being tendered, the estimated cost is commercially sensitive at present.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w25.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 Although I am not persuaded that a statutory levy is justified, the Government do want to see sports bodies re-investing a good proportion of television money into youth development of their sports. The sports' own code of conduct on the sale of television rights itself accepts this point.

 In 1995, 49 per cent. of visitors said that our theatres and performing arts were an important part of their decision to come to Britain. In 1996, 35 per cent. of overseas visitors to London said that London's culture and arts had greatly encouraged them to visit and a further 41 per cent. said that culture and arts had influenced their decision to come. The British Tourist Authority fully recognises the importance of arts and culture in attracting overseas visitors, and these play an integral role in its overseas marketing campaigns.

<a name="70731w25.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Clarke: </B> 
 The latest available information from the society of London Theatres, from 1991, showed that up to one third of seats in London's theatres were filled by overseas visitors and many other by domestic tourists. I understand that the society will be updating this information later this year. The English tourist board announced last week that tourist spending in England rose by 7 per cent. to a record level of &#163;10.7 billion in 1996. The British Tourist Authority estimates that earnings from overseas tourism in 1996 increased by 5 per cent. to &#163;12.69 billion. All the evidence therefore suggests that London continues to attract record numbers of visitors.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what measures are being taken to ensure an equitable distribution of lottery funds to museums and galleries across the United Kingdom. [11701]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w25.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 The national lottery distributing bodies have already announced awards worth over &#163;465 million to museums and galleries throughout the country, notably through the Heritage Lottery Fund's major museum, library and archive projects programme which aims to achieve a good regional spread of major projects across the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="70731w25.html_para3">The White Paper "The People's Lottery", Cm3709, published on 21 July, makes clear the Government's objective that there should be more confidence that lottery money generally is allocated fairly and equitably in the light of need across all regions and parts of the United Kingdom.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w25.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 The National Heritage Act 1997 will extend the powers of the trustees of the National Heritage Memorial Fund and enable them to support a wider range of projects and applicants. The powers will open up new opportunities for the Heritage Lottery Fund to assist museum and gallery projects. The Heritage Lottery Fund is currently consulting on the use of the wider powers. We are considering implementation of the Act as part of our wider review of lottery distribution.

<a name="70731w26.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has previously announced that, as part of our new approach to sport, we are looking at the way that the current sports council structures are working. As part of that review, we have looked carefully at the regional structure of the English Sports Council, the proposed role of ministerial nominees to the council's regional offices, and the relationship between the council and local authorities and governing bodies of sport in the regions. While there is still work to be done on what new arrangements might be introduced, my right hon. Friend and I have decided to stand down all the ministerial nominees that have either been formally appointed or were nominees-designate to work alongside the English Sports Council.
<P>

<a name="70731w26.html_para0">This decision is no reflection on the ability of the individuals concerned to play a part in developing the Government's plans for sport. I will make a further announcement later this year about how we intend to rebuild the relationships between the English Sports Council and its partners in the regions, which were once so strong, and to help ensure that the role of local government and of local sport organisations in providing sports opportunities are given the credit they deserve.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if he will require public television broadcasters to ensure that all public information, party political and party election broadcasts are fully accessible to the deaf and hard of hearing people in the United Kingdom. [12001]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w26.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Fisher: </B> 
 The Broadcasting Act 1990 set a target of 50 per cent. of transmissions for subtitling of programmes by 1998 for Channel 3 services and by the fifth anniversary of the commencement of the service for Channel 5. After that target is reached, it is for the Independent Television Commission to set the level of future targets. It is also a condition of the Channel 4 licence to ensure that 50 per cent. of its programmes are subtitled by 1998. I understand from the ITC that all Channel 3 licensees subtitle all their national news programmes and current affairs programmes and that Channel 4 subtitle their main news and current affairs programmes. Party political broadcasts are also subtitled.




<P>
<P><I>31 Jul 1997 : Column: 514</I><P>

<P>

<a name="70731w26.html_para1">Under the terms of the Broadcasting Act 1996, digital terrestrial television services have to meet a target of subtitling 50 per cent. of programmes by the 10th anniversary of the digital programme service starting. The 1996 Act required the Independent Television Commission to draw up a code on promoting the understanding and enjoyment of programmes by persons who are deaf or hard of hearing. As part of that code, the Independent Television Commission has also set interim targets for subtitling digital services.
<P>

<a name="70731w26.html_para2">In its statement of promises to viewers and listeners, the BBC is committed to subtitling 50 per cent of all its programmes by 1998. The statement also contains a commitment to subtitle all national daily news programmes, regional news and current affairs broadcasts.
<P>

<a name="70731w26.html_para3">The existing arrangements allow the ITC and the BBC flexibility to meet viewers' needs as fully as possible, constrained by statutory minimum subtitling levels and by what is technically and financially realistic. Within these arrangements, broadcasters place particular emphasis naturally on subtitling programmes which inform viewers of news and current affairs. The detailed arrangements for determining which programmes are subtitled, however, are not a matter for government.

The table, however, illustrates the number of deaths that have occurred directly due to the security situation and those casualties attributed to paramilitary style attacks by "Republican" organisations. The Royal Ulster Constabulary uses the term "paramilitary assaults" as opposed to punishment beatings as the latter tends to imply a certain justification for these appalling offences.

In both cases, the chief electoral officer shall grant an application if he is satisfied that the applicant's circumstances on the date of the poll will, or are likely to be such, that he cannot reasonably be expected to vote in person.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As explained in my letter of 17 June 1997, the Social Security Agency does not maintain records on the costs of Disability Living Allowance reviews and appeals, processes to which people who are dissatisfied with adjudication officer decisions have a statutory right of access. Compiling and maintaining this information would require a major clerical work programme at disproportionate costs and the Agency has no plans to introduce such a system.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Current available information indicates that around one third of reviews and appeals for Disability Living Allowance are successful. This is broadly in line with other similar benefits. While the Agency aims to get as many decisions as possible correct at the initial claim stage, it frequently happens that, when given a decision on their application, customers provide further evidence of their disability which then has to be reviewed. This is the main reason for the success rate for reviews and appeals.

 The Government's objective is to create a modern welfare state where social security benefits are to bring people into mainstream society and are not simply hand-outs. The delivery of benefits has to be modernised as well as the system itself. Privatisation is not the only way of improving quality and reducing costs, but we see no reason why the public sector should deliver services if there are more efficient ways of doing so. The Society Security Agency, in conjunction with the Benefits Agency, has initiated a project to involve private sector consortiums to explore opportunities for the modernisation of service delay. This project fits well with our approach to public-private sector partnerships and

 All radioactive discharges in England and Wales must be authorised by the Environment Agency under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993. Limits for discharges of radioactivity are set by the Environment Agency in accordance with national and international standards, and the potential cumulative effects of discharges are carefully considered. Levels of actual radioactive discharges reported to the Environment Agency are placed on the public registers.
<P>

<a name="70731w33.html_para0">The Environment Agency also monitors levels of radioactivity in the waters and sediments of the River Thames. The results of this monitoring programme demonstrate that levels of radioactivity in the River Thames are low and consistently below World Health Organisation guidelines for drinking water. MAFF undertakes a separate monitoring programme, which includes levels of radioactivity in certain fish, plants and sediments of the River Thames.
<P>

<a name="70731w33.html_para1">Both the Environment Agency and MAFF produce annual reports of their monitoring programmes.

<i> [pursuant to her reply, 24 July, c. 694]:</i> Employment advertisements placed by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions have not carried age restrictions for some years. This Department believes that older workers have a great deal to offer in the way of skills and experience and we welcome applications from people irrespective of their age. However, certain advertisements placed by its agencies have reflected age criteria appropriate for specific jobs. A lower age limit of 25 is imposed on the Vehicle Inspectorate's traffic examiners and the Driving Standards Authority's driving examiners. The Coastguard Agency used to recruit watch officers only between the ages of 27 and 50, but this restriction ceased in 1995. In 1996 the planning inspectorate advertised for inspectors who could offer 10 years' service prior to the normal retirement age.

 At our first meeting, we agreed to establish a programme of work to support the strategic decisions taken by the new Cabinet Committee on the Environment. We considered ways of building sustainable development into policy formulation at the highest level and looked at ways of ensuring that Departments consider sustainable development and the environment in implementing their policies and programmes.

The study shows that while Departments had begun to take better account of environmental impacts, much more needed to be done to ensure that policies were systematically considered. Copies of the study will be placed in the Libraries of the House.

It will also provide a central contact point for Departments.
<P>

 The Government recognise the special needs of people who live and work in rural areas and of the need to tackle poverty. My Department is responsible for the Rural Development Commission which operates a number of economic and community support programmes, designed to promote regeneration and tackle disadvantage in the countryside. We have been discussing with the Commission its draft 1997 corporate plan which sets out the Commission's future expenditure proposals. The Commission expects to publish its plan later this summer.
<P>

<a name="70731w35.html_para3">We are currently considering how the proposed new regional development agencies might promote economic regeneration in rural areas. We are in the process of consulting interested parties in the regions to hear what they have to say about our proposals.
<P>

<a name="70731w35.html_para4">A number of programmes in my Department and others may impact on rural poverty. The policies and programmes of my Department are being reviewed as part of the comprehensive spending review, in order to consider how far we are meeting the aims of enhancing opportunity, fairness and sustainable development, while promoting employment and investment for sound economic growth.

My Department has written to interested bodies inviting comments and in reply has received representations from religious bodies on the issues raised in the review, including the basis of charging for religious and community premises. The Government will consider all the representations before making proposals on charging. There will then be a period of formal consultation.

<P>
<a name="70731w36.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 In calculating each authority's entitlement to housing revenue account subsidy, the allowance made for expenditure on management takes account of a target management and maintenance score determined annually for each authority based on a number of indicators including the characteristics of its stock. Allowances for individual authorities are calculated to move gradually towards the target figures thus ensuring no dramatic changes in subsidy entitlement from one year to the next.

 The average weekly rent for local authority tenants in England increased from &#163;6.49 to &#163;40.05 between 1979-80 and 1996-97, which represents a 135 per cent. increase in real terms after adjusting for inflation as measured by the GDP market price deflator. The closest comparison that can be made for average private sector rents is between 1978 and 1996-97 when rents rose from &#163;6.70 to &#163;76.49, a 263 per cent. increase in real terms. These average private sector rents are estimates from the 1978 private renters survey and the 1996-97 survey of English housing and are subject to sampling variability. No data on overall average housing association rents are available before 1984.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what were <i>(a)</i> the total and <i>(b)</i> the average overtime payments for police officers in each police force in England and Wales for each year since 1992-93. [11506]
<P>

<P>
<a name="70731w38.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The following tables show overtime costs, where available, for each police force in years 1992-93 to 1995-96. Figures for 1996-97 are not held centrally. The information for years up to, and including, 1994-95 is taken from the police grant claim forms. The format of this changed in 1995-96, when police authorities were no longer required to submit detailed expenditure information. The figures for 1995-96 are therefore taken from returns submitted by police forces to Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary's matrix of indicators. However, that return also changed in 1996-97, since when information on overtime costs has no longer been available. Nor are details of overtime costs included in the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy statistics of actual police expenditure from 1994-95 onwards. The average overtime payment has been calculated by dividing the total cost of overtime for the force by its recorded police strength as at 31 March in the year in question.

 Prisoners who are mentally disordered in accordance with the criteria in the Mental Health Act 1983 for detention as in-patients for medical treatment can be transferred to psychiatric hospital. Prisoners with mental health problems who do not meet those criteria receive care and treatment in prison, often under the supervision of a qualified psychiatrist as occurs in the community.
<P>

<a name="70731w39.html_para7">On their first reception into prison, all prisoners receive a physical and mental health examination which includes a psychiatric history. Prison staff may, with the prisoner's agreement, request individual records or other medical reports from the national health service in cases where that is considered necessary.
<P>

<a name="70731w39.html_para8">Where there is a need for continuing treatment after release, medical information is transferred from the prison doctor to the prisoner's general practitioner or other responsible agency in the community. Where a prisoner does not consent to such disclosure, but his or her mental ill health places them or others in the community at significant risk, such information would be disclosed to an appropriate person or agency and the prisoner informed accordingly. The Prison Service plans to issue a new health care standard on "Continuity of Health Care" which will give additional advice to establishments on exchanges of information about health care matters between the Prison Service and other agencies.

Depending on the level of check, the cost of such checks has been estimated at between &#163;5 and &#163;10. We are currently considering the implementation of part V of the Police Act 1997 and will honour an undertaking to consult voluntary organisations before reaching a decision.

 I have recently met representatives of the National Council for Social Concern to discuss their proposals to promote restorative justice in England and Wales. Our long-standing commitment to introduce a reparation order demonstrates the Government's wish to restore a proper balance of rights and responsibilities which will be taken forward in the Crime and Disorder Bill later this year. The concept of "restorative justice", like the concept of "relational justice" developed by the Jubilee centre in Cambridge, provide useful tools for understanding crime and disorder when combined with a careful analysis of local problems and an objective assessment of "what works".

<P>

<P>
<a name="70731w42.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Since the inception of the project in April 1996, seven consultancy firms have been employed by the Prison Service to provide specialist advice on legal issues, corporate finance, procurement procedures and specification processes. The need for consultants has been steadily reduced as skills transfer into the service has taken place. The service now retains four consultancy firms.
<P>

<a name="70731w42.html_para0">To date, the Prison Service has spent &#163;2.5 million on consultancy fees. The costs of the whole procurement process, including consultancy fees, are expected to be recovered from the net savings generated by implementation of the project.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the savings planned in his departmental budget for <i>(a)</i> 1997-98 and <i>(b)</i> 1998-99 in order to allow for the higher than planned expenditure on the Prison Service announced in his statement of 24 July; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="70731w42.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 It is too early for me to be able to identify the savings in the Home Office budget which might cover the extra spending on the Prison Service. For both 1997-98 and 1998-99, I will be looking rigorously at my whole programme to find offsetting savings. I expect this process to take several months.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the amount, and proportion, of paper recycled by his Department in each of the last five years. [11543]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w42.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Home Office takes its responsibilities to the environment seriously and increasingly participates in local paper recycling schemes. For example, the Department has been operating the Westminster city council's "Green Bin" scheme very successfully for almost two years in its central London headquarters buildings. However, no central record is kept of the amount of paper utilised or recycled.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w42.html_wqn6"><B> Ms Walley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to introduce a waste minimisation strategy for his Department. [11541]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w42.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Home Office is committed to seeking improvements to its green housekeeping and is currently revising its energy and environmental strategy and will address waste minimisation as part of this. A draft of the new strategy and accompanying guidance material will be discussed at a property managers seminar to be held on 15 September. The expectation is that the new strategy will be adopted as Home Office policy and receive its official launch by the end of the year. 




<P>
<P><I>31 Jul 1997 : Column: 573</I><P>

<P>

<a name="70731w42.html_para2">In the meantime, the current Home Office green housekeeping strategy, published in August 1993, requires that property managers carry out an annual audit against environmental objectives which include waste minimisation. Specific reference is made to the continued need for attention to the efficient use of all resources, to the effective and economic use of paper and to extending the recycling of other departmental waste, such as glass, plastics, cans and batteries. The Department has also promulgated all the central guidance on waste minimisation and can claim considerable success with its recycling of paper, bottles and toner cartridges and most recently with reuse of its computers and printers.

<a name="70731w42.html_wqn7"><B> Ms Walley: </B>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w42.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 My Department is strongly committed to minimising waste. In encouraging its local property managers to make the most effective use of the limited effort they are able to devote to green housekeeping, the Home Office has sought their full co-operation with local and central environmental initiatives for improving waste management in preference to their administering the setting up and monitoring of specific waste minimisation targets. Once a year, the local property managers are asked to report progress against their action plans under the terms of the 1993 Home Office green housekeeping strategy. The Department is in the process of revising its energy and environmental strategy and, in line with the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions' recommendations, will be giving due consideration to the appropriateness of future waste minimisation targets.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w42.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 I have recently approved the UK Passport Agency's plans for the introduction of a new, more secure British passport from the end of next year. The agency has awarded two contracts under the public-private partnership arrangements to the private sector. Siemens Business Services will undertake the receipt of passport applications, and the collection, storage and transmission of the data needed or the new passport. The Stationery Office Ltd. will undertake the printing and issuing of the new passport. The enhanced security features will include digitised photographs and signatures.
<P>

<a name="70731w42.html_para4">The UK Passport Agency is not being privatised. It will retain its core function of establishing eligibility for a British passport, and will continue to operate from its six existing regional offices. There will be a reduction in the agency's staffing, but there should be no need for compulsory redundancies for permanent staff.

 The Home Office police scientific development branch, together with the Department of Health and the Ministry of Defence, fully evaluated all scientific data relating to methyl isobutyl ketone, MIBK, before police trials of CS spray canisters containing this solvent were conducted last year. The Home Office has not produced any reports, either internally or published, about MIBK.
<P>

<a name="70731w43.html_para5">The ideal solvent for use in CS spray will present no risk to health--in particular, the eyes--and will evaporate as soon as it has done the job of delivering the CS irritant to the target. I am told that MIBK is the solvent which comes closest to achieving this. It occurs naturally in oranges, grapes and vinegar. It has many applications, including use as a food additive. It has been used in CS sprays in France for many years without serious difficulty: in particular, extensive research there has shown that it has a low toxicity to the eyes. Its only drawback is that it has a relatively low volatility, which means that it remains on the skin of someone sprayed for a short time before evaporating and may cause de-fatting and blistering.

 The unit cost used by the Prison Service is net current expenditure per uncrowded prisoner place--the total certified normal accommodation of all prisons. To ensure comparability between years, adjustments are made to exclude payments to local authorities under section 53 of the Young Persons and Children's Act 1933, and to allow for transfers of work to or from the Service. Payments for prisons designed, constructed, managed and financed by the private sector are also excluded, as are the places so provided.
<P>

<a name="70731w43.html_para6">On this basis, the percentage change in unit costs in real terms between 1995-96 and 1996-97 is minus 3 per cent. This is based on forecast outturn for 1996-97.

 The Law Commission's report No. 218, published in November 1993, is a major contribution to the development of the criminal law. It was warmly welcomed by many involved with the criminal justice system as creating a clearer and more coherent statement of the law of violence against the person. The Government have considered the Law Commission's recommendations with great care, and accept the principle of its proposals for reform of those offences contained mainly in the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.
<P>

<a name="70731w44.html_para2">This is a complex and difficult area of the law, and case law has evolved since the Law Commission's report was first published. It is important that any proposals to reform offences that come before the courts so frequently, and have been in existence for 136 years, are robust, well thought through and well supported. Following a detailed consideration of their report, done in close collaboration with the Law Commission, we have decided to publish a draft Bill in a consultation paper later this year. This will set out our initial proposals for reforming the law in this area, based on the Law Commission's report, and seek views on some of the difficult issues around the technical legal changes proposed by the Law Commission, such as definitions of intent, recklessness and intoxication or whether the intentional transmission of disease should be included in the Bill. The proposals will apply to England and Wales.

We recognise the importance of these proposals, which are not directly related to the reform of the 1861 Act, but they raise some very difficult questions which should be considered separately and over a longer time scale.

 It is the statutory duty of each electoral registration officer to include on the register for the area in which he acts the names of all those who appear to him to be eligible. Any eligible elector who may have been missed off the register can make a claim to be added to it after publication. District and London borough councils are statutorily required to designate as polling places, so far as is reasonable and practicable, only places which are accessible to the disabled. Acting returning officers may also apply to the Home Office or the Scottish Office for grants towards the cost of providing temporary ramps and polling screens adapted for use by the disabled which may be used at elections and referendums.

Appropriate regulation provides security for members, minimises the scope for abuse and does not impose an undue burden on providers.
<P>

<a name="70731w46.html_para0">As part of the review, we are taking stock of the way the recent pension reforms are being implemented, and we have already begun consultation with interested parties, including employers, employees, the pensions industry, the regulatory authorities and others.

The cost excludes the cost of families, in receipt of family credit, with a partner working between 16 and 24 hours who would become better off on income support, as it has been assumed that they would claim income-related jobseeker's allowance.<P>

 The changes to the backdating rules in April removed the administratively onerous good cause provision and replaced it with special reasons set out in regulations. These special reasons apply to income related benefits which are meant to meet immediate needs. It is, therefore, reasonable to limit the range of situations which count as a special reason for a late claim and it underlines the importance of claimants making their claims promptly.

 Funding for the cost of preventive and remedial action on year 2000 in this Department is being met from existing budgets by making economies and by reprioritising existing work programmes. The initial broad estimate of the total cost is &#163;30 million. Work is well advanced to refine this estimate and detailed and costed action plans will be available by the end of October 1997.

<P>
<a name="70731w48.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Harman: </B> 
 I can today announce how we intend to proceed on a number of projects designed to involve the private sector in the delivery of social security. The decisions we have taken on these projects, which were inherited from the previous Administration, are in support of our commitment to modernise the delivery of social security to make it simpler, better and more efficient.
<P>

<a name="70731w48.html_para1">The manifesto made it clear that:

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>this would be a government of ideas and ideals but not of outdated ideology, what counts is what works;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>it would reject the dogmatic view that services must be privatised to be of high quality, but equally we see no reason why a service should be delivered directly if more efficient means are available;</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="70731w48.html_para2">We have reviewed the projects inherited against:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>our objectives for modernising the social security system;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>our commitment to work within the announced spending totals for the first two years of Government;

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Insufficient attention to the concerns of staff. We have made clear our commitment to take account of the needs of staff in considering the involvement of the private sector.

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="70731w48.html_para4">The conclusions we have reached on the individual projects are as follows:
<P>

<a name="70731w48.html_para5"><i>Estates and accommodation services (PRIME)</i>
<P>

<a name="70731w48.html_para6">We propose to proceed with PRIME--private sector resource initiative for management of the estate--which will transfer the ownership and management of the DSS estate to the private sector. The project will bring specialist private sector expertise to the management of the estate, delivering reduced operating costs, increased flexibility to respond to the changing patterns of service delivery, and scope for additional investment in property improvements. The property transfer will enable us to secure full value for the large DSS estate and to share in gains from further property development, while retaining departmental control on the location of outlets.
<P>

<a name="70731w48.html_para7">As well as the PRIME project, we also propose to explore whether further private sector involvement could improve the delivery of associated office support services, mainly in the Benefits Agency. High-quality service to customers requires effective support to staff in services such as typing and reprographics. These services are currently delivered through a patchwork of public and private sector teams as a result of previous market tests. The current approach does not guarantee quality or efficiency and has not been flexible to changes in service delivery. The PRIME contract requires some reorganisation of office service arrangements and provides an opportunity to reorganise on more efficient lines. We now propose to start the process of testing what the in-house teams could do, under a more effective contracts regime, and what the private sector could offer. Before taking final decisions, we will ensure that any transfer to the private sector meets our new strengthened criteria on quality of service, evaluation of performance and concern for the staff issues.
<P>

<a name="70731w48.html_para8"><i>Child benefit centre (PROSPECT)</i><i></i>
<P>

<a name="70731w48.html_para9">PROSPECT was established by the previous Government to outsource child benefit and guardian allowance operations in Washington. The previous Government's proposals were driven by dogma and we will not proceed with them. We wish instead to see a proper examination of options other than full scale outsourcing.
<P>

<a name="70731w48.html_para10">There is a need to improve the quality of service at the child benefit centre, and we have asked officials to prepare an alternative approach based on our principles for a modern service. Options for involving the private sector will be considered in this context.

<P>

<a name="70731w48.html_para11"><i>Benefits agency medical services</i>
<P>

<a name="70731w48.html_para12">The IMPACT 97 project was established to transfer the delivery of Benefits Agency medical services--BAMS--to the private sector. The bulk of doctors who provide the medical advice and conduct medical examinations in support of benefit claims are independent contractors, not employed by the Department. The future of BAMS has been under discussion for several years now; the majority of non-medical support staff involved have chosen to transfer to an external company if the project goes ahead, and staff want an end to the uncertainty. There have also been extensive negotiations with contractors who are aware that a final announcement is imminent.
<P>

<a name="70731w48.html_para13">We have decided to proceed with this project, involving the private sector to bring enhanced management expertise to BAMS, with investment in new technology, delivering reduced running costs and service improvements. As a result of the outsourcing, we expect to see an improved quality of service to customers, covering areas such as the arrangements for making appointments for examinations, the process for delivering medical advice on benefit claims and the quality of the accommodation in medical examination centres.
<P>

<a name="70731w48.html_para14">We will now proceed to invite final bids from the contractors shortlisted. The final decision on award of contracts will feature further qualitative evaluation of potential suppliers' management capability for provision of the service and an evaluation of the arrangements for the transfer of staff affected.
<P>

<a name="70731w48.html_para15"><i>BA area director partnerships (ADAPT)</i>
<P>

<a name="70731w48.html_para16">The ADAPT project was established to deliver a two-phase approach to involvement of the private sector. The first phase entails a period of partnership between three private sector consortia and three BA area directorates which will explore, without payment from the taxpayer, whether external input can help our objectives to modernise the delivery of social security. The approach fits well with this Government's approach to public-private partnerships. It enables us to bring in external expertise to identify new ways of working and to test what the partners have to offer without commitment to any particular outcome. We have decided that the project should continue and the three partners will be announced shortly. If the first phase produces effective proposals for improving service delivery, we may proceed to a second stage and award contracts for delivery of services.
<P>

<a name="70731w48.html_para17"><i>Contributions Agency competitive benchmarking</i>
<P>

<a name="70731w48.html_para18">In addition to the series of outsourcing projects, we have also reviewed the project within the Contributions Agency to benchmark services against the private sector. The CA benchmarking programme assesses the scope to apply private sector expertise, discipline and economies of scale in procuring public services. The ongoing programme has so far tested the quality and scope for improvement of three areas of the Contributions Agency operations--international services, deferment of national insurance contributions, and insolvency services.
<P>

<a name="70731w48.html_para19">This benchmarking programme meets our criteria, adopting a non-dogmatic approach of judging things by what works; avoiding a single presumption that the 



<P>
<P><I>31 Jul 1997 : Column: 594</I><P>
private or the public sector is always the solution and assessing the best way forward against the scope for improvement by existing staff.
<P>

<a name="70731w48.html_para20">We have decided that Contributions Agency staff should continue to manage international services and deferment, bringing in improvements in service through in-house efficiency measures. On insolvency services, which handle national insurance debts of insolvent companies and bankrupt individuals, we have concluded that we should begin the testing of offers from external suppliers, applying our strengthened principles for involvement of the private sector. The early indications from the benchmarking programme confirm that there may be gains to be made from testing our service against the best in the private sector. We have decided that the competitive benchmarking process in the Contributions Agency should continue, extending to other areas of service.
<P>

<a name="70731w48.html_para21"><i>Stand-alone support IT applications (SASA)</i>
<P>

<a name="70731w48.html_para22">The Department has a major programme of IT change and we have decided that it should concentrate its expertise on the development and maintenance of key strategic mainframe systems. The development and management of stand-alone systems will be more effectively supported in the private sector, which has greater expertise in this area and will be able to deliver a better quality service at reduced costs. We have therefore decided to proceed with the transfer to the private sector of the development, support and maintenance of the Department's non-strategic, stand-alone, business support computer systems--SASA. The contract will cover around 740 systems ranging from those on a single PC to networked applications running up to 200 PCs, using a diverse range of software packages.
<P>

<a name="70731w48.html_para23"><i>Conclusion</i>
<P>

<a name="70731w48.html_para24">These decisions on the involvement of the private sector will help to deliver a modernised social security service. Where our modernisation strategy entails involvement of the private sector in the future, we will apply the criteria we have set out for the review of outsourcing, asking of every project, "Does it work? Is it fair--to customers, taxpayers and staff?".
<P>

<a name="70731w48.html_para25">A separate announcement will be made in respect of services in Northern Ireland. Further details on the individual projects will be announced in the very near future.

 This Government take fraud against our social security system very seriously and are determined to reduce the level of fraud and abuse. Fraud is anti-social behaviour; assisting in the fight against fraud is an expression of responsible citizenship.

<P>

<a name="70731w49.html_para3">In order to establish the size of the problem on an ongoing basis the Benefits Agency is undertaking a five-year programme of reviews. This programme covers all the major social security benefits to measure in a statistically valid way the level of incorrectness, including fraud within the benefit stream.
<P>

<a name="70731w49.html_para4">A review of income support was carried out through visits and interviews with a random sample of 4,350 customers in autumn 1996 when a review of their benefit entitlement was completed.
<P>

<a name="70731w49.html_para5">The results of this review show that the majority of customers--79 per cent.--are entitled to the benefit at the rate they are receiving.
<P>

<a name="70731w49.html_para6">However, fraud or a high suspicion of fraud was found in just over 11 per cent. of cases representing estimated annual potential expenditure losses of &#163;1.77 billion on income support.
<P>

<a name="70731w49.html_para7">We will be hosting a fraud seminar in September. This will involve high-level representatives from both inside and outside of Government. Private sector expertise will be brought alongside those already involved to exchange and develop ideas and experience to ensure that we are tackling the problem in the most effective manner.

<P>
<a name="70731w49.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 Clause 70 of the Social Security Bill provides for the alignment of the time limits for the backdating of claims to benefit with the one month currently allowed for reviews. This provision is an integral part of modernising and streamlining the social security system. It will make the system easier to operate and simpler for people to understand. It will also underline the importance of people making their claims promptly.
<P>

<a name="70731w49.html_para10">The Social Security Bill also provides for regulations to prescribe exceptions to the one-month time limit. We are currently giving careful consideration to what, if any, circumstances there might be in which exceptions ought to apply.
<P>

<a name="70731w49.html_para11">People who qualify for industrial injuries benefits already receive a substantial preference in that their benefits are non-contributory and tax-free and are payable on top of any mainstream incapacity and disablement benefits to which they may also be entitled.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what progress has been made by the Scottish Law Commission in its review of the feudal system.[12474]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w49.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 The Government gave a manifesto commitment to initiate a study into land ownership and management in Scotland, including the options for removing the rights of feudal superiors.
<P>

<a name="70731w49.html_para12">The feudal system is anachronistic and makes conveyancing more expensive than it need be. It also allows unscrupulous superiors to charge excessive amounts for granting consent to alterations or changes of use of property.
<P>

<a name="70731w49.html_para13">I am therefore delighted that the Scottish Law Commission will be able to submit a report on the abolition of feudal tenure, with draft legislation in 1998--one year earlier than expected. At the same time, the commission will issue a discussion paper on related questions of real burdens. It will report on those questions by the end of 1999.
<P>

<a name="70731w49.html_para14">The effect of the two reports will be to sweep away superiorities, replace the feudal system with a system based on absolute ownership, and reform the law on real burdens.
<P>

<a name="70731w49.html_para15">The Government are committed to the introduction of legislation to abolish the feudal system as soon as we can after the commission reports. It may be necessary to carry out further consultations following publication of the reports, but I very much hope that the legislation will be one of the first reforms to be enacted by the Scottish Parliament. It would be most fitting if Scotland entered the new millennium not only with a new Parliament but with a completely modernised system of land tenure.

<P>
<a name="70731w52.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 The current basic unit for measuring hospital activity is the finished consultant episode. FCEs are not the same as the number of patients treated because a hospital spell can consist of more than one FCE, and patients discharged too early who are subsequently readmitted as emergencies count as another FCE. Furthermore, an FCE count cannot by itself serve as a valid measure of productivity since it is not standardised over time for any changes in the quality of treatment.
<P>

<a name="70731w52.html_para0">In 1993-94, the last year of the Chorley and South Ribble DHA, there were 5,667 such episodes for children aged up to 16 recorded for the acute unit of the former Preston health authority. The total for people of all ages was 28,236.

 Health authorities contract for maximum, not average, waiting times for elective treatment. In most cases, they do not specify maximum waiting times for non-urgent, as opposed to urgent, elective treatment. Nor do they specify maximum waiting times for surgery as distinct from other in-patient treatment. Contracted maximum waiting times for admission to hospital for 1996-97 and 1997-98 are shown in the table. Where a range of times is shown, this indicates different maximum waiting times for different providers or specialties.

 Higher doses of vitamin B6 have not been banned. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food's independent food advisory committee recommended, on the basis of advice from the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment--COT--that the level of vitamin B6 in dietary supplements sold under food law should be limited to 10 mg per daily dose. In addition, on the basis of the COT's advice, the Medicines Control Agency's Committee on Safety of Medicines reviewed vitamin B6 medicinal products and recommended that those vitamin B6 preparations sold on the general sales list--that is, those freely available to the public--should be limited to 10 mg, while those above 10 mg but below 50 mg should be available under the supervision of a pharmacist. Those of 50 mg and above should be available under the supervision of a doctor as prescription-only medicines.

 The Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment has considered the toxicity of vitamin B6 on two occasions.

 The Department of Health has no information on either the numbers of women who experience debilitation as a result of pre-menstrual tension or the total number of women supplementing their diet with high-dose vitamin B6 preparations. Figures for prescribed medicines may be obtained, but the number of women using vitamin B6 products without a prescription is unknown.
<P>

<a name="70731w54.html_para4">In the years 1987 to 1996 the United Kingdom yellow card adverse drug reaction reporting scheme administered by the Medicines Control Agency has received a total of 42 reactions associated with products containing only vitamin B6. Of these, for five women the indication for vitamin B6 was pre-menstrual tension, none of whom received more than 100 mg per day. With the exception of one case of congenital malformation, all recovered.
<P>

<a name="70731w54.html_para5">Adverse reaction data from the UK's yellow card adverse drug reaction reporting scheme are provided voluntarily by doctors, dentists and pharmacists and indirectly by pharmaceutical companies. Adverse drug reaction reports relate to suspected adverse reactions associated with medicinal products. We have no information on the use of vitamin B6 as a food supplement.

Other factors such as the temporal relationship between medicine and reaction, any concomitant medication and the possibility of underlying disease should also be considered.

 Procedures are already in place. The National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 states that private practice must not interfere with the performance by a trust of any of its obligations under NHS contracts. Health authorities and general practitioner fundholders, backed up by regional offices of the Department, monitor the performance of trusts against contracts. Trusts are required to recover the costs of their private patient activity including an appropriate return on capital employed. Memorandum trading accounts are prepared and audited. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State retains powers to give directions to a trust about the exercise of their powers to provide accommodation or services to private patients and the trust has a duty to comply.

 In line with generally accepted accounting practice, a National Health Service trust makes a charge against its income and expenditure account for the depreciation of its assets.
<P>

<a name="70731w55.html_para0">The prices a trust charges to its purchasers includes the depreciation charge, but changes in the value of a trust's assets may occur too late for the resulting change in depreciation to be reflected in the prices charged to purchasers.
<P>

<a name="70731w55.html_para1">Increases in depreciation will result in an increase in expenditure which is not matched by an increase in income from the trust's purchasers. In these circumstances, the trust may show a deficit in the income and expenditure account. This is not within the control of the trust's management; nor is it an indicator of financial problems. The operating variance is used to calculate the underlying financial position of the trust by adjusting its income and expenditure account for changes in depreciation caused by late changes in the trust's assets.

 <i>[holding answer 28 July 1997]:</i> The information in the table shows numbers of finished consultant episodes. FCEs are not the same as the number of patients treated because a hospital spell can consist of more than one FCE, and patients discharged too early who are subsequently readmitted as emergencies count as another FCE. Furthermore, an FCE count cannot by itself serve as a valid measure of productivity since it is not standardised over time for any changes in the quality of treatment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what work has been carried out by the Public Health Laboratory Service since 1990 to evaluate the health effects of the organism E. coli MRE 162; for what reasons and on whose behalf this work was conducted; when this work was conducted; what was the conclusion of the work; and in which publications, and when, this work was published.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w57.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Public Health Laboratory Service's laboratory of enteric pathogens received E. coli MRE 162 from the chemical and biological defence establishment at Porton Down in March 1997. There was a request from CBDE to evaluate the organism with respect to the risk posed to human health.
<P>

<a name="70731w57.html_para2">The organism was fully identified as E. coli serotype 08:H9 and tested for a wide range of enteric virulence factors. All tests were negative and it was concluded that the strain was unlikely to cause diarrhoeal disease. A report was sent to CBDE on 22 April 1997. The work carried out has not been published in scientific journals.

 <i>[pursuant to her reply, 12 June 1997, c. 528-29]:</i> I am now able to provide additional information. The full reply is as follows:
<P>

<a name="70731w57.html_para3">We are of course concerned about the damage to babies caused by Erb's palsy and brachial plexus injuries during birth. The safety of the mother and her unborn child are of paramount importance and childbirth is safer now than at any other time. Most cases of Erb's palsy and brachial plexus injuries arise spontaneously, but are also considered to be influenced by misplacement of the shoulders in the birth canal. In recognition of this problem, a working group under the auspices of the confidential inquiry into stillbirths and deaths in infancy, is currently preparing guidance on the management of shoulder dystocia--difficulty in delivering the shoulders during the birth. The guidance will provide advice on the early identification of cases where there may be a risk on coping with cases where shoulders dystocia occurs. The guidance is expected to be available later this year.
<P>

<a name="70731w57.html_para4">Information on the number of finished consultant episodes of those patients admitted to hospital with primary diagnosis Erb's palsy and brachial plexus injuries in NHS hospitals in England up to 1994-95 is available through hospital episode statistics data and is shown in the table. The definition of a consultant episode is the period that a patient spends under the continuous care of a specific consultant in a specific health care provider. A hospital provider spell can comprise one or more consultant episodes. However, episode statistics will therefore pick up cases where the diagnosis was not made at birth and the baby was subsequently readmitted. Information before 1989-90 recorded discharges and deaths and is therefore not directly comparable to hospital episode statistics data.

 The changes to ACT tax credit are part of a package of measures designed to create a better environment for growth and high-quality, long-term investment. Taking account of the cut in the small companies' corporation tax rate, and of increased first-year plant and machinery allowances for small and medium businesses, the small firms sector as a whole will receive a significant boost from the Chancellor's Budget.

 Small businesses play a fundamental part in the economy of the UK. The Government are concerned therefore by any actions that unnecessarily hinder their competitiveness. The late payment of commercial debt is acknowledged by many in the business community to be a serious problem, particularly for small businesses which are least able to bear the additional costs resulting from payment delays. The Government are determined therefore to improve the payment culture in the UK.

In addition, the study compares attitudes and levels of awareness, and analyses drivers and barriers to change. This builds on a pilot benchmarking study undertaken for DTI in 1996, the publication of which was announced on 25 October 1996 in a written answer to the hon. Member for Bournmouth, East (Mr. Atkinson) <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>16.</i>

 The report of the 1996 quinquennial review panel of TCS, under the chairmanship of Sir Robin Nicholson, chairman of Pilkington Optronics and former chief scientific adviser to the Government, was submitted in October 1996. Since then, the five Departments of State and four research councils which funded TCS at that time have been actively considering the findings of the review panel and its many recommendations.
<P>

<a name="70731w63.html_para2">This review has shown that with a Government investment of &#163;1 million TCS produces net benefits of 58 jobs, &#163;3.6 million worth of value added, &#163;3 million worth of exports, and &#163;13.3 million of additional turnover, as well as increases in research and development expenditure, in participating companies. These are substantial achievements by any standards.
<P>

<a name="70731w63.html_para3">Following the recommendations of the review panel, the Government have decided to extend the scope of TCS to enable organisations in the science, engineering and technology base as well as universities to participate with effect from 1 September 1997. This will allow our firms to make full use of the technological skills and experience that are available throughout the country.

<P>
<a name="70731w63.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The Government have no plans to change the qualifying period for unfair dismissal. The House of Lords has referred to the European Court of Justice questions relating to whether the qualifying period for unfair dismissal is indirectly discriminatory against women. However, the Government are committed to providing fair minimum standards for people at work and expects to consult on proposals for fairness at work later this year.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade what assessment her Department has made of the impact of the multilateral agreement on investment on Her Majesty's Government's ability <i>(a)</i> to restrict foreign investment in sensitive sectors and <i>(b)</i> to discriminate in favour of high value-added investments.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70731w63.html_spnew10"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The multilateral agreement on investment will provide for sectoral restrictions on foreign investment. These restrictions must be notified in advance. The UK's list is short, reflecting the liberal approach we take to foreign investment. We would not expect the multilateral agreement on investment to impair the UK's ability to attract high value-added investments.

<a name="70731w63.html_spnew11"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The multilateral agreement on investment is essentially about the non-discriminatory application of regulations as between foreign and domestic investors. Since the UK regulations are generally applied in a non-discriminatory way, they will not be undermined by the agreement.

<P>

Ministers will continue to exercise their own responsibilities, although a duty Minister will also cover each day for his or her colleagues as necessary. It follows, therefore, that the ministerial responsibilities of the DTI will be adequately covered during this period.
