<a name="10322w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Fitzsimons: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to facilitate the reporting by the public of invalid road vehicle excise duty discs.  [154445]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10322w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Members of the public may report apparently unlicensed vehicles seen on the public road by providing details of the vehicle concerned, together with the location and details of the keeper, if known, to the nearest Local Office of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). This information is used as a starting point for further investigation.
<P>

<a name="10322w01.html_para0">Alternatively, members of the public may complete specially designed witness statements which are available from the Agency's network of Local Offices. The statement form may also be downloaded from the DVLA website. If prosecution action follows, a copy of the statement containing the witness's name is made available to the alleged offender.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10322w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how much revenue was raised from motorcycle and moped vehicle excise duty in the last 12 month period for which figures are available, indicating the amount raised for each vehicle excise duty band; if he will estimate the rate of evasion, indicating the estimated number of untaxed motorcycles and mopeds used on public highways for each category; and if he will make a statement.  [154721]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10322w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 March 2001]:</i> &#163;40.3 million was raised in vehicle excise duty (VED) from motorcycles and mopeds in 1999-2000 in Great Britain.

<P><I>22 Mar 2001 : Column: 282W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10322w01.html_para1">Following a full roadside survey in 1999, it is estimated that there are around 265,000 unlicensed motorcycles and mopeds in GB. This represents a drop in the evasion level from 35 per cent. in 1994 to 25 per cent.
<P>

<a name="10322w01.html_para2">The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency has a number of initiatives in hand to tackle the problem of unlicensed motorcycles. The Agency is working closely with the police in targeting unlicensed motorcycles at events and rallies and conducting specific motorcycle enforcement campaigns. The introduction of automatic number plate readers later this year will make it easier to detect unlicensed motorcycles. A consultation document will be issued shortly which will seek views on the introduction of a licence disc for motorcycles which cannot be removed intact once fixed to the number plate. As well as making it easier to detect unlicensed motorcycles this proposal should also resolve the problem of the theft of motorcycle licence discs.

<P>
<a name="10322w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Brake: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 2 February 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 315W, on London Underground, what proportion of the maximum capacity of London Underground train carriages was reached at peak periods during January and February on a line by line basis.  [154397]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10322w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 This is an operational matter for London Underground Ltd. (LUL) who inform me that they regularly monitor train crowding which enables them to assess the level of crowding on the busiest sections of each line. The complexity of this survey means that it is not cost-effective for it to be carried out on a monthly basis. It is therefore not possible to provide the information specifically requested in the question for January and February this year as to do so would incur disproportionate costs.
<P>

<a name="10322w01.html_para3">The table shows the most recent information as measured by London Underground at various times during 1999-2000. For each line it provides a snapshot of the busiest quarter-hour period on the busiest section The table shows in columns F and G the theoretical design capacity of trains as set out in the earlier answer on 2 February 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 315W, and in columns H and I the average number of people recorded by LUL in 1999-2000 as using those lines at the busiest period. However, it should be noted that in practice some trains may have a higher and some a lower crowding. This could be caused by either any unevenness in the time between consecutive trains or in the uneven distribution of customers along platforms.

<a name="10322w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Brake: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 2 February 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 315W, on London Underground, what evidence his Department has obtained to show that the figures for the maximum capacity of London Underground train carriages are compatible with the health and safety of passengers.  [154399]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10322w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The health and safety of passengers is the responsibility of London Underground and it is the Underground's top priority. I understand that the capacity of London Underground carriages is not itself considered to be a health and safety issue. However, London Underground recognises the possible safety implications of overcrowding. Access to platforms, and therefore trains, is restricted whenever necessary on safety grounds.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10322w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Cox: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how much money has been provided by the Government since May 1997 to London Underground; and if he will make a statement.  [154450]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10322w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 We have provided &#163;1.9 billion of funding to London Underground since May 1997. Government funding has supported total investment in the Underground between 1997-98 and 2000-01 of some &#163;3.4 billion.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10322w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he will announce a conclusion to his negotiations with Transport for London concerning the PPP for the London Underground.  [154990]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10322w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister announced last month that he had agreed to work together with the Commissioner of Transport for London, Bob Kiley, and with London Underground, on developing mutually acceptable modifications to the Public Private Partnership. Mr. Kiley has said in discussions with the Government that he seeks the unified management control of key underground operations, mainly through keeping the maintenance of track and signalling within London Underground. The 55-point plan that he is now discussing with us provides for that control within the overall structure of the PPP.
<P>

<a name="10322w01.html_para4">There are inevitably some technical issues still to be worked out but I believe that there is now a real basis for an agreement to allow the PPP competitions to proceed to a satisfactory conclusion. Discussions are being taken forward as quickly as possible so that we can get on with the PPP competitions and the massive investment which the Underground so urgently needs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10322w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Redwood: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what the reason was for the time taken by <i>(a)</i> the Environment Agency to respond to the accident and spill on the A329M on 12 March and <i>(b)</i> the police to clear the road; and for what reason the police closed the road for most of that day;  [154278]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will make a statement on <i>(a)</i> the traffic delays caused by the closure of the A329M on 12 March and <i>(b)</i> the Environment Agency's role in the closure.  [154277]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10322w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I understand that due to the spillage of diesel fuel and a subsequent six-vehicle accident the Thames Valley police closed the A329M at 23.54 pm on 11 March and re-opened it approximately three hours later. During the intervening period, the Thames Valley police, assisted by the Environment Agency, were involved in mopping up the diesel fuel and removing the six vehicles involved in the accident, which was made more difficult at the time by severe weather conditions. At the scene of such an accident the police have a duty to ensure that the safety of the public, the preservation of life, the rescue of the injured and the gathering of evidence to support the prosecution of serious traffic offences take precedence over any problems caused by traffic delay or congestion. The police are of course conscious of delays that can ensue from such accidents and they work with the Highways Agency and local radio stations to minimise disruption to traffic. Once the Thames Valley police were satisfied that it was safe to re-open the road, they did so at approximately 3.00 am on 12 March.
<P>

<a name="10322w02.html_para1">Following an initial telephone call from the Thames Valley police, Environmental Protection Officers from the Environment Agency arrived at the scene approximately 50 minutes from first notification of the incident, to find that diesel fuel was flowing from the road into the roadside drains. The Agency's officers isolated the 



<P>
<P><I>22 Mar 2001 : Column: 286W</I><P>
surface drains using sawdust and soil from the verges and made a request to the local authority for gulley suckers to empty the roadside drains as soon as possible. The Agency's officers checked ditches on both sides of the M4, identifying areas where these drained to the Emm Brook. After a thorough examination, the Agency officers could find no evidence to suggest that any diesel fuel had entered either the ditches or the Emm Brook.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10322w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hill </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 March 2001]:</i> In March 2000 the Government announced that legislation would be introduced to allow motorists to display the GB national identifier and the European circle of stars on car number plates on a voluntary non-mandatory basis. This would enable citizens to dispense with the requirement to display a separate GB sticker when travelling in Europe. The option of a separate GB sticker remains. There are no plans to permit the display of any other symbols or flags on number plates.

<P>
<P>

<BR>
A six-year scheme from the Dudley Partnership Board. Developed from a Community Vision Conference, this scheme reflects the priorities of residents, local businesses, community organisations and public bodies. The Wren's Nest estate of almost 12,000 people is in one of the most deprived wards in Dudley. The scheme is intended to complement and extend the positive impact of Estate Action in the area. It will add value to that investment by raising skills levels, increasing the confidence and management ability of local people and promoting community safety.
<BR>
<i>Key Outputs:</i>
<BR>
90 jobs created/safeguarded plus 17,385 construction jobs, 820 people obtaining qualifications, 950 people obtaining jobs, 540 dwellings improved an 170 completed.

<P>
<a name="10322w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 In my answer of 9 June 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 424-25W, to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell), I explained our conclusion that it would be wrong to take a view on potentially fundamental changes to the organisation of transport safety until the outcome of Lord Cullen's inquiry into the Ladbroke Grove rail crash was known. I understand that the relevant part of the inquiry is expected to report later this year. A report of the consultation and analysis undertaken by the transport safety review group was placed in the Libraries of the House last year.

<P>
<a name="10322w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Ten-year Plan provides for a significant increase in transport infrastructure investment, including in enhanced rail capacity in London. Specific London rail schemes, priorities, and the resources to be allocated to them, will be decided after discussion between Government, the Strategic Rail Authority and the Mayor of London. To this end, we have set up a high-level group to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the development and taking forward of rail schemes in London.

<a name="10322w03.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 All the RDA's, including Advantage West Midlands, have made good progress. Advantage West Midlands (AWM) has engaged with all sectors of the local economy to produce a strategy for the region and has agreed with key partners the 60 main actions required to take it forward.
<P>

<a name="10322w03.html_para0">AWM has achieved significant successes. So far this financial year (to February), some 28 companies from abroad have invested in the west midlands, creating 2,100 jobs and safeguarding a further 745. Marconi is moving to a site at Ansty near Coventry and jobs are beginning to emerge at BMW at Hams Hall near Birmingham. AWM has introduced a Regional Venture Capital Fund, the first RDA to do so. It is progressing innovation issues with a very good team of regional partners. It has very clearly defined the region's priority business sectors and is increasingly dovetailing all its activities to support them: the food and drink sector is an excellent example.




<P>
<P><I>22 Mar 2001 : Column: 290W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10322w03.html_para1">In addition, AWM has led the creation of six Regeneration Zones which will focus resources on the areas of greatest need and opportunity--including for the first time, a Rural Regeneration Zone encompassing the Marches.
<P>

<a name="10322w03.html_para2">It has successfully led two emergency Task Forces set up at the behest of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to address crises which have arisen in the region's automotive and ceramics industries. Key recommendations involve the creation of three high- technology corridors along the region's main feeder routes.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he expects to announce the pilot projects to test choice-based lettings approaches; and if he will make a statement.  [155394]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10322w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce that 27 local authority-led pilot projects have today been selected to test different lettings approaches.
<P>

<a name="10322w03.html_para3">The pilots are designed to give new and existing social tenants in England greater choice over their housing and to give local authorities and Registered Social Landlords the opportunity to test new ways of doing that, while continuing to meet housing need.
<P>

<a name="10322w03.html_para4">This is the best way to meet the long-term housing requirements of those who need social housing. The challenge for pilot authorities is to find better ways of responding to need while offering choice, in different housing markets, and across different authorities. We will draw on the pilots to develop a body of good practice for all social landlords.
<P>

<a name="10322w03.html_para5">I am delighted that we received over 90 bids for pilot status. I was particularly encouraged by the readiness of local authorities and RSLs to work together to deliver a choice-based approach. Many bids involved a partnership approach, bringing together some or all of the RSLs operating in the area, and in some cases private landlords as well, to offer as wide a choice as possible to new and existing tenants.
<P>

<a name="10322w03.html_para6">I have been very impressed by the quality of the bids submitted. I have therefore decided to make available a further &#163;2 million, in addition to the &#163;11 million announced at the time of the Spending Review to fund the pilot scheme, in order to support as many good quality projects as possible.

This additional money will be used to fund Information Technology development to support choice-based lettings approaches and to promote mobility across the social housing sector.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10322w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 On 18 December last year we published draft revised Regional Planning Guidance for the south-east. This put the urban renaissance and protection of the countryside at the heart of the revised regional strategy. It put forward a housing strategy that took no more land than assumed by the regional planning body. We re-consulted on the proposed housing distribution and after careful consideration of all the representations we are today issuing Regional Planning Guidance for the South East (RPG9).
<P>

<a name="10322w03.html_para9">In the light of the divergent views expressed on the individual county figures and in the absence of any consistent regional rationale to justify a new distribution, the proposed distribution has not been changed. We acknowledge the concerns expressed during the public consultation but would emphasise that in line with our 



<P>
<P><I>22 Mar 2001 : Column: 292W</I><P>
new 'plan, monitor and manage' approach, the scale and distribution of housing will be subject to review within the next five years in response to monitoring and other information. We do not believe in fixed 20-year housing targets.
<P>

<a name="10322w03.html_para10">The RPG9 document is being distributed to local authorities, Regional Planning Bodies, Regional Development Agencies and others who participated at the Public Examination held in 1999. Copies have also been placed in the Libraries of the House and made available to MPs from the Region. Further copies can be obtained from the Stationery Office at a cost of &#163;18.

 Last month, I appointed Tony Holland as the first chair of the Standards Board for England.

I am in the process of making two further appointments from representatives of local authority elected members and hope to be able to announce these in the near future.
<P>

<a name="10322w03.html_para11">The appointments will provide the Standards Board with a range of expertise and skills from around the country, which will be crucial to the success of its future work. The members will bring wide experience of local government and the public and private sectors to the work of the Board. They will equip the Standards Board with the lay, legal, academic and audit expertise it will need as it faces up to the challenge of the new ethical framework and ensuring the highest standards of conduct in local government.

<a name="10322w04.html_para2">The overall objective of our assistance will be to support the Government of Ethiopia's Poverty Reduction Strategy. In food security, we will work for long-term sustainable improvements and reduced vulnerability to cyclical drought. We will support the provision of financial assistance through the World Bank, IMF and European Commission. We will also provide technical assistance to strengthen the World Bank's work with the Government on the 2001 Public Expenditure Review and on Food Security, and plan to do so on the Poverty Reduction Strategy process. We are also considering technical support in food security and education to the European Commission.
<P>

<a name="10322w04.html_para3">We also envisage providing support for Food Security (including rural roads). In the private sector we will explore options for facilitating Ethiopia's effective engagement in international markets and ways in which the enabling environment for private investment can be improved. We plan to help strengthen district level road maintenance capacity. We are investigating how to support the Government's poverty monitoring capacity. Other possible areas of intervention include improved governance and support for a more effective civil society.
<P>

<a name="10322w04.html_para4">The implications of HIV/AIDS for Ethiopia's development will be considered throughout the programme. We plan to support the International Partnership Against AIDS in Africa, which is sponsored by UNAIDS.
<P>

<a name="10322w04.html_para5">We will continue to provide direct humanitarian relief and food aid where there is a clear need and where we are well placed to help.
<P>

<a name="10322w04.html_para6">On current plans we expect to spend up to &#163;30 million over the next three years: these figures are indicative and subject to adjustment in the light of developments.

<a name="10322w04.html_para7">A revision of the Army's recruitment management structure has brought together the field Army, the Territorial Army and the Army Training and Recruiting Agency's resources and expertise to run coherent recruiting campaigns in each of the UK regions, including Scotland. This co-ordinates local and national recruiting activities to best effect. Specifically in Scotland, the Army has recently awarded a trial one-year contract to a commercial consultancy company who will undertake on the ground recruiting activities, in partnership with the existing recruiting organisation, bringing commercial expertise into this area and utilising the company's wide-ranging contacts and database. The company intends to introduce an innovative programme of promotional and marketing activity, highlighting the wide range of career opportunities that the Army provides. Final selection of recruits will, however, remain firmly with the Army.
<P>

<a name="10322w04.html_para8">Army retention is being tackled as a high priority. Our aim is to maintain good levels of retention through policies that genuinely reflect the priorities of our people and their families, both generally and those on deployment. A raft of measures has already been introduced, including acceptance of the latest pay award, and these appear to be having an impact on retention. These measures are not confined to Scotland, but apply throughout the Army in the UK and overseas.

[154067]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10322w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Army has no record of any claim of racial harassment from Ian Bannister. The Royal Military Police are, however, currently undertaking an investigation to examine the circumstances behind the incident with the photograph.

<P>
<a name="10322w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Army is committed, through the Chief of the General Staff's Equal Opportunities Directive, to eradicating all forms of discrimination by developing policies, practices, and procedures within the framework of the law which do not tolerate harassment or discrimination of any kind. This policy is reiterated in Commanding Officer's Equal Opportunities Policy Statements and Action Plans.

<P>
<P><I>22 Mar 2001 : Column: 296W</I><P>
mainly because of knock-on effects from delays to the Joint MOD/DSS Compensation Review which proved more complicated than anticipated. Consistent with the long-standing public sector pension policy, there are no plans to introduce changes to the Armed Forces Pension Scheme retrospectively.

<a name="10322w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The police investigation announced in my answer of 17 February 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 648W, has established that, of the rifles required by the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, 19 were sold to private companies. These companies were Alvis Logistics, A. F. Budge and Co. Ltd. and R. E. Trem and Co. Ltd.

<a name="10322w05.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Ben Chapman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made on the likely effects of siting wind turbines in tactical training areas.  [155605]

<a name="10322w05.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 In principle the Ministry of Defence has no objection to wind farms. The UK has three specially designated Tactical Training Areas (TTA) that are available for authorised military Operational Low Flying (OLF) training. The three TTAs are located in central Wales (LFA7T), north Scotland (LFA14T) and the border region of northern England/southern Scotland (LFA20T). Within these areas military fast jet and Hercules aircraft may operate at heights between 250 ft and 100 ft. In addition, Units make use of these specifically surveyed areas to conduct specialised night training.
<P>

<a name="10322w05.html_para0">Flying down to 100 ft is also authorised over the Electronic Warfare Tactics Range (EWTR), LFA13. The EWTR is a RAF facility made available to other NATO countries on a repayment basis, or under other special arrangements. It is located in the north of England, at Spadeadam, and partially overlays LFA20T, the northern England/southern Scotland TTA. In addition to tactical radar avoidance training, the airspace associated with use of the EWTR is made available for test and evaluation flying, specialised night training and some operational low flying training. Low flying within LFA13 is associated almost entirely with operation of the EWTR.
<P>

<a name="10322w05.html_para1">Conclusions of a study conducted by the RAF Signals Engineering Establishment into the Effects of Wind Generators on Radar Performance were that wind turbines cause interference to primary surveillance radar and harm the ability to detect and track aircraft flying over wind farms. Moreover, the presence of unlit constructions of significant size would be highly dangerous to aircraft flying down to 100 ft.
<P>

<a name="10322w05.html_para2">In the interests of flight safety, the safety of aircrew and members of the public, it is vital that any hazards to low flying aircraft are minimised. Any extraneous distractions or possible reduction in external support capabilities, such as that provided by ground radar, can have a deleterious effect upon aircraft safety, and thus the safety of aircrew as well as those on the ground.
<P>

<a name="10322w05.html_para3">It is, therefore, MOD opinion that obstacles in excess of 100 ft in height, unlit by night and with the ability to cause interference to radar, have the potential to create an acute safety hazard to aircraft engaged in operational low flying training, tactical radar avoidance training, specialised night flying and test and evaluation flying, however, each case has to be considered on its merit.

<P>
<a name="10322w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 March 2001]:</i> The Ministry of Defence Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985, came into operation on 20 February 1986 following an agreement between the Defence Council and the Police Complaints Authority of the same date. Following the coming into force of the Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987 a further agreement between the Secretary of State for Defence and the Police Complaints Authority was signed on 23 June 1988, which resulted in the Ministry of Defence Police (Discipline) (Amendment) Regulations 1988. These agreements, made in accordance with section 96(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, introduced force discipline regulations corresponding to those established by Part IX of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 for Home Department police forces. They also build on the provisions of section 1(4) and section 4 of the MOD Police Act 1987, and the Ministry of Defence Police (Representation at Disciplinary Proceedings) Regulations 1988 (SI 1099/1988) made under it.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence on what grounds the Armed Forces Bill Committee was told on 7 March that a complaint against a Ministry of Defence police officer would be processed by the Police Complaints Authority through exactly the same complaints procedure as with the Metropolitan police and that the arrangements would be absolutely identical.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10322w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 March 2001]:</i> The Ministry of Defence Police complaints regulations are comparable to those of the Home Department police forces.

<P>
<a name="10322w06.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The test rig housing the depleted uranium samples was damaged during winter storms. The most likely cause of this damage were the chains securing the buoys marking the rig which impacted repeatedly with the main body of the rig during unexpectedly high sea states. In all some 20.76kg of depleted uranium, the equivalent of four projectiles, were lost and, if not recovered, it is expected that the material will oxidise and disperse in exactly the same way as rounds fired into the Solway Firth from the Kirkcudbright range. The ongoing comprehensive environmental monitoring programme continues to confirm no uranium above naturally occurring background levels.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10322w07.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government place great importance on the quality of British science. A strong science base is essential to the knowledge economy. We will increase the 



<P>
<P><I>22 Mar 2001 : Column: 303W</I><P>
level of funding through the Science Budget by an average of 7 per cent. per year, in real terms, over the next three years. We have taken significant steps to reverse the underfunding of university scientific research infrastructure: and we will increase postgraduate student stipends by 23 per cent. in real terms. We have also, and for the first time, allocated funds for an 'e-science' initiative which will enable the development of very high speed computing for the next wave of science. The UK is a good place to do science and many international companies have R&D centres here.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10322w07.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 In compliance with metrication legislation made in 1994, four out of five trade weighing machines are now operating in metric units. We fully expect the remaining weighing machines to convert to metric.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10322w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The chemicals industry has consistently outpaced the growth in the economy overall. Forecasts suggest that this pattern will continue for the foreseeable future. The industry does, however, face significant pressures on restructuring, performance and innovation to meet rapidly changing global challenges. The Government will continue to do what they can to help the industry meet those challenges.

 By accepting all 24 recommendations of the Performance and Innovation Unit's (PIU) report on the future of the post office network, the Government have demonstrated their continuing commitment to maintenance of a nationwide network. We are working closely with the Post Office, the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters and other stakeholders to implement the PIU recommendations. These measures are designed to modernise and improve Post Office services and to strengthen confidence in the future of the network.

 We estimate that the increase in the national minimum wage to &#163;4.10 from 1 October 2001 will be of direct benefit to around 120,000 workers in Scotland--6.1 per cent. of all workers in Scotland.

 Earlier this month the independent Low Pay Commission produced volume 1 of their third report evaluating the impact of the national minimum wage. The Commission undertook an extensive consultation exercise as part of their work. They received 150 written submissions and took oral evidence from the CBI, the TUC and a number of other organisations to supplement their written evidence. Volume 2 of the third report, which will cover issues of implementation and enforcement, is due in May.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10322w07.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government recognise the importance of clusters and networks and are working closely with the RDAs to identify and remove barriers to their growth and development. In the White Paper "Opportunity for All in a World of Change", published on 13 February, the Government set out their proposals to promote the growth of successful clusters by asking the RDAs to develop strategies for success for their regions, building on their existing strengths. They will do so with the assistance of a report, "Business Clusters in the UK: A First Assessment", which was also published on 13 February.
<P>

<a name="10322w07.html_para2">Key aspects of clusters policy were discussed at a conference in Nottingham involving Government, RDAs and other stakeholders on 8 and 9 March.

 The UK companies that produce engineering steels have had to adapt to difficult trading conditions in recent years and have undertaken restructuring in order to remain competitive.

 Substantial progress has been made but we still need to do more.
<P>

<a name="10322w07.html_para4">In the last few weeks, we have agreed with miners' solicitors how compensation for loss of pension will be handled. This element of compensation amounts to around &#163;400 million. This is the last piece in the jigsaw. This now means that, over the next few months, we will see many full and final offers of compensation made.
<P>

<a name="10322w07.html_para5">And as I said in my earlier reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Mr. Michie), in the last eight weeks alone we have announced a package of measures which will see &#163;million's of additional compensation being brought forward and offered quickly to a whole raft of claimants.
<P>

<a name="10322w07.html_para6">Many of these will not previously have been made an offer. We are also clearing a large backlog of medical reports, which will enable 1,000 claims a week to go forward to have compensation assessed over the next three months. I am also pleased to see the number of respiratory consultants employed on this scheme steadily increasing. We now have 228 in place an increase of almost 25 per cent. from a few months ago. The number of medical assessments carried out per week is now well over 600--an increase of 50 per cent.
<P>

<a name="10322w07.html_para7">All of this is progress on top of the &#163;360 million already paid on miners compensation. We are paying out over &#163;1 million a day on coal compensation.

We are also running one further round of University Challenge and Science Enterprise Challenge to further assist the commercialisation of research and help bring business skills into the science curriculum, and will be supporting 20 Business Fellows to lead their academic colleagues in working with business. Collectively, this represents a significant public investment in knowledge transfer.

Under these criteria we will not issue an export licence where there is a clearly identifiable risk that the equipment could be used for internal repression or external aggression. Applications are also refused if we assess that an unacceptable risk of diversion exists.
<P>

<a name="10322w08.html_para3">We have taken a number of steps to strengthen the process of risk assessment at the export licensing stage. Such improvements have not required a change in the law and there no plans to include specific measures on end-use monitoring in the draft Export Control Bill.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when the second stage of the quinquennial review of the Patent Office will be completed; and if he will make a statement.  [155542]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10322w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The second stage of the five-yearly review of the Patent Office has now been completed. The Patent Office has a key role to play as a driver in the knowledge economy.
<P>

<a name="10322w08.html_para5">I am pleased to say that the review found the Patent Office has achieved a remarkable transformation over the last decade and is now extremely customer focused and responsive. The Office's patent granting and other registration functions are well regarded and compare favourably with those of other IPR Offices. Indeed on trade marks, the review found that the Office was thought to be one of the best in the world.
<P>

<a name="10322w08.html_para6">The Patent Office's role has to be seen in an international context, which is evolving. Trade is becoming increasingly international and intellectual property protection has to reflect this. The Patent Office is in the forefront in initiating and promoting development of the international systems. The European Community and the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) have both embarked on substantial programmes to achieve harmonisation and there is significant work in progress in the EU in areas such as the proposed Community Patent. The review concludes that the Office should work to make the international routes for patent granting--which SMEs as well as larger companies need--cheaper, faster and more accessible and to reduce duplication of work. There is also a growing need to ensure that copyright can be protected and enforced on an international basis.
<P>

<a name="10322w08.html_para7">The Patent Office has an important part to play in fostering innovation and encouraging technological transfer. The review finds that more could be done to help ensure that inventions achieve successful commercial exploitation. It suggests that the Patent Office should work with the Small Business Service to help small businesses in this respect, such as by helping to match inventors with business partners. This would complement the wider activities of my Department in support of innovation and the knowledge economy.
<P>

<a name="10322w08.html_para8">IT has great strategic and financial importance for the Office. The Office has made good progress in introducing electronic services and a significant further programme is in train.
<P>

<a name="10322w08.html_para9">The Office needs objectives and targets appropriate to this agenda of internationalisation and effective help for small business, allowing delivery through e-communication channels wherever possible.
<P>

<a name="10322w08.html_para10">The demand for patents is outstripping the ability of Patent Offices to deliver, both internationally and in the UK. Reducing duplication of work between offices is thus all the more important. The Patent Office has a wide programme to try to ensure that scarce examiner resource is used to best effect. The report makes recommendations about recruitment strategies for patent examiners, flexible working schemes, training and use of examiners as well as pay.




<P>
<P><I>22 Mar 2001 : Column: 310W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10322w08.html_para11">Obtaining IP rights is only part of the story: small business made clear that effective enforcement of rights is crucial to their value and they found that effective enforcement could be both difficult and costly. The report recommends that the Patent Office should work with others to develop alternative dispute resolution procedures and to help facilitate the greater use of insurance in this field. It could also usefully extend its work to improve awareness of the range of intellectual property rights and how to enforce them. On trade marks and copyright significant action to assist enforcement is already in hand. The report recommends that the Office should consider further streamlining its procedure for handling trade mark oppositions.
<P>

<a name="10322w08.html_para12">The report looks at the Office's use of contractors. It finds that in the case of the London Front Office, there have been gains in terms of cost and efficiency, but the option of bringing the function back in-house should be appraised before a decision is taken whether to continue with contracting out. In the case of accommodation services, the report finds that it is not clear-cut whether these should remain contracted out or be brought back in-house. The Office should undertake an internal benchmark costing, taking into account all the relevant factors, before deciding how to achieve best value.
<P>

<a name="10322w08.html_para13">The report suggests new procedures for the handling of appeals for entry to the patent and trade mark agent profession and on cases of misconduct. It suggests that the Office should encourage multi-disciplinary partnerships, which can offer a "one-stop shop" on a range of issues.
<P>

<a name="10322w08.html_para14">Overall, the review shows what a success story the UK Patent Office has become. The Office is found to set a high example in its responsiveness to customers and open communications with staff, its new IP Portal and its successful involvement in the "New Deal" initiative. Other agencies, and other parts of government, could particularly learn from its example in these respects.
<P>

<a name="10322w08.html_para15">I would like to place on record my appreciation for the efforts the staff and management of the Patent Office have made to bring about these achievements.

<a name="10322w09.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Further to my reply of 9 November 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 327-28W, I have now reviewed the way that the Agency handles the investigation of domestic television and radio reception problems. With effect from 1 April the Agency will accept complaints about TV and radio reception (subject to certain basic conditions, such as the installation of a satisfactory aerial) and a charge will only be payable if, following an investigation by the Agency, the problem is found to be within the complainant's own installation. That charge will be &#163;50 including VAT. This procedure will allow domestic consumers to report possible interference arising from new broadband telecommunications systems.

 I have today granted consent under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 to Conoco Global Power Developments UK Ltd. for the construction of a 700 megawatt gas-fired combined heat and power station at the Conoco Humber Refinery at South Killingholme in North Lincolnshire. The station has also today been given clearance as a gas-fired station under section 14 of the Energy Act 1976 and planning permission for the station has been deemed to be granted subject to 47 planning conditions agreed with the North Lincolnshire borough council. This consent is an extension to the proposal which was granted consent on 13 November 2000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10322w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Government welcome the European Union's recent agreement to the everything But arms proposal which has now led to the EU's removal of tariffs from all remaining imports from the 48 Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in the world, subject to transitional arrangements for bananas, rice and sugar only. This resulted from ongoing discussions held by the Government with other EU member states and the European Commission, an important part of which was consideration of the implications of these proposals both for ACP sugar exporters and UK sugar producers.
<P>

<a name="10322w09.html_para11">It is the Government's view that LDCs, because of their low level of economic development and poor infrastructure, are not in a position to export large amounts of sugar in the short term. This, coupled with the arrangements for tariff quotas for sugar through until 1 July 2009, means that the short term implications for UK sugar producers are negligible.

 Figures on ministerial overturns on visa cases were not kept centrally until I became Minister responsible for entry clearance in October 1999. Statistics were then kept at my request. I have overturned 49 decisions to date. In this period there have been over 2 million visa applications of which approximately 140,000 have been refused. I have therefore overturned decisions in 0.0025 per cent. of cases. I have done so on the basis that I am satisfied that the applicants qualified for entry clearance under the immigration rules. It would be inappropriate for me to divulge the names of applicants or details on individual cases on confidentiality grounds.

Recorded crime statistics do not generally include the location of offences, and so details of those involving village shops and village post offices are not available. It should be noted that, owing to the change in counting rules on 1 April 1998, figures for recorded crime before and after that date are not directly comparable. For example, from that date, figures for offences of violence against the person additionally include figures for common assault and assault on a constable, among other offences.

 The local child curfew scheme for children of nine and under was introduced by section 14 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, and has been in force since September of that year. The scheme allows a local authority, after consultation with the police and other appropriate local bodies and following confirmation from my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, to set up a scheme which bans children up to the age of nine from being out late at night (for a specified period between 9 pm and 6 am) otherwise than under the control of a responsible adult.

<a name="10322w11.html_para16">No local authority has applied to my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary to set up a local child curfew scheme. We have consulted widely on why this provision has not been used and many useful suggestions are being taken forward. In particular consultations indicated that the age range was too narrow given that children out on the streets late at night are often aged 10 or over.
<P>

<a name="10322w11.html_para17">We are seeking to remedy this by raising the age at which children can be covered to 15. This change is being introduced in the Criminal Justice and Police Bill. We are also giving the police the power to initiate and set up a scheme following consultation with the local authority and after confirmation from my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. We believe these changes will make the scheme more likely to be used, and play a useful part in local crime and disorder reduction strategies.

<a name="10322w11.html_para18">The antisocial behaviour order was a new civil order created under section 1 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, which has been in force since April 1999. This community based order can be applied for by the police, a local authority or in consultation with each other, against one or several individuals (perhaps a family) whose behaviour is anti-social (ie it causes alarm, distress or harassment to one or more people not in the same household as him/herself).
<P>

<a name="10322w11.html_para19">We understand that at least five antisocial behaviour orders were issued in Lancashire between 1 April 1999 and 31 May 2000. Figures, by local authority area, for the numbers of orders applied for during that period are not held centrally. However from 1 June 2000 the number of such orders applied for and issued is being collected centrally. Provisional data up to 30 September 2000 show two antisocial behaviour orders being applied for in Lancashire, both of which were granted.

<a name="10322w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 This has been under consideration for some time as a means of ensuring the efficient and effective implementation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, which provides for the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes. I am pleased to announce that the existing complement of 21 inspectors will be increased to 33 over the next three financial years.
<P>

<a name="10322w12.html_para0">The extra 12 inspectors will result in a substantial and unprecedented level of Inspectorate staffing. This will lead to more inspections to ensure compliance with licence conditions, and will enable applications for authorities under the 1986 Act to be dealt with more efficiently, without compromising the quality of advice offered by the Inspectorate. Furthermore, the Home Office will be able to become more proactive in raising standards of animal care and welfare, and to play a greater role in developing and promoting strategies of "replacement, reduction and refinement".
<P>

<a name="10322w12.html_para1">The cost of the additional inspectors will in due course have to be reflected in licence fees paid by those conducting animal research.
<P>

<a name="10322w12.html_para2">I hope that the scientific community and animal welfare organisations--and the general public--will welcome this important announcement. It is a practical demonstration of the Government's commitment to ensure that, for as long as there is a need to use animals in scientific research, the legislation to protect them is applied to maximum effect.

<P>

<a name="10322w12.html_para6">The substantial investment provided to the police service through the Crime Fighting Fund, announced in September 1999, and which started operation in April 2000, is now delivering the positive results promised. Police numbers rose by 377 between 1 April and 30 September 2000 and by a further 990 between 1 October 2000 and 31 January 2001, a total increase in 10 months of 1,367. This rise in 10 months is the largest single increase in police numbers during one whole financial year since 1988-89.
<P>

<a name="10322w12.html_para7">On the basis of forces' projections, we expect that police numbers should reach 126,000 by March 2001, 128,000 by March 2002 and record numbers by March 2003.

 This information is not held centrally. All meat imported from third countries into the UK must enter at designated UK Border Inspection Posts (BIP) where it is subject to veterinary inspections. The inspection services at the BIP are the responsibility of the local authority. Central Government have no powers to instruct the local authority over the number of inspectors. However, the BIP has to be approved by the Commission, whose inspectors conduct periodic inspections and who have to be satisfied that the inspection services are adequate. If they are not, the approval of the BIP may be suspended.
<P>

<a name="10322w13.html_para0">Meat produced within the EU may circulate freely in the single market, and is not subject to border checks. It is subject to checks at the point of destination within the UK. The Meat Hygiene Service has been instructed to step up levels of inspection at cutting plants and cold stores, to ensure that any increased volumes of imports (which could arise from the effects of the foot and mouth crisis) can be checked for the necessary health marks and correct documentation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10322w13.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The latest year for which figures are available is the year ended February 2000. The average net farm income for cereal farms in England for that year was &#163;11,700 and the average total direct subsidy payment was &#163;37,000. The average net farm income for general cropping farms was &#163;8,000 and the average total direct subsidy payment was &#163;31,500. The total direct subsidy excludes the additional support farmers receive from the consumer, through maintenance of EU agricultural prices above world levels by the CAP.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, pursuant to his answer of 26 February 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 501W, on hill farmers, what elements combine to give a subsidy of &#163;24,400 per farm.  [153536]<P>

<P>
<a name="10322w13.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 I am sorry that there was an error in my answer of 26 February 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 501W, giving the total of &#163;24,400 as the subsidy. The correct average total subsidy paid to full-time LFA cattle and sheep farms in England in 1999-2000 was 



<P>
<P><I>22 Mar 2001 : Column: 330W</I><P>
&#163;29,400. This is made up of &#163;25,400 per farm in livestock subsidies, &#163;3,500 per farm in environmental subsidies and &#163;500 per farm in crop and other subsidies. The rest of the answer remains correct.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, pursuant to his answer of 26 February 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 501W, on hill farmers, what the subsidy is for a typical hill farm in England arising from the EU.  [153537]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10322w13.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Less than half per cent. of direct subsidies paid to full-time LFA cattle and sheep farms in England in 1999-2000 did not arise from EU legislation. Although some subsidies such as BSE payments and hill farm compensatory allowances are part funded nationally, they are still part of the CAP.

To ask the Solicitor-General if he will set out, including statistical information relating as directly as possible to the Truro and St. Austell constituency, the effects on Truro and St. Austell of his Department's policies and actions since 2 May 1997.  [154538]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10322w13.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Truro and St. Austell constituency falls within the geographical area covered by the Devon and Cornwall Area of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). In November 1999, in line with national policy, this area of the CPS, in liaison with the police and the East and West Cornwall Magistrates courts which cover that constituency, introduced procedures based on the Narey proposals. This means that all adult defendants charged with a criminal offence in Cornwall should make their first appearance before either Truro or Bodmin Magistrates court within eight days. This is in line with the Government's policy of speeding up and modernising the criminal justice system.
<P>

<a name="10322w13.html_para1">On 18 December 2000, the Cornwall office of CPS Devon and Cornwall finalised its structure in line with proposals in the Glidewell Review. This represents a policy of more effective working between the police and prosecutors. A CPS Crown Court Unit based in Truro deals with serious crime at Truro Crown court. The CPS has set as a goal the better handling of serious cases in the interests of justice and the victims. A fast-track procedure began on 15 January 2001 throughout England and Wales. It ensures that offences which can only be tried in the Crown court normally come before a judge within eight clear days of their first hearing in the Magistrates court.
<P>

<a name="10322w13.html_para2">The CPS together with other agencies has been working to speed up youth justice, particularly persistent youth offenders. The time taken for persistent youth cases has fallen in the CPS Devon and Cornwall area from 141 days in 1997 to 65 days in the third quarter of 2000. All these changes illustrate the Government's successful policy of speeding up the criminal justice system.

<a name="10322w13.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 Modern Apprenticeships (MAs) are an important part of the new vocational framework for young people in England. Many more young people will benefit from MAs as a result of an entitlement we are introducing to a place for those who have the necessary aptitude, ability and enthusiasm for work-based training. As an aid to this, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor recently announced plans for an expansion of MA places in England, from 220,000 this year, to 320,000 by March 2004. In addition, both my Department and the Learning and Skills Council will continue to promote MAs, to ensure that Careers Companies and the new Connexions Service are able to provide accurate and up-to-date information about the opportunities MAs offer.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment (1) how many local education authorities provide <i>(a)</i> hot and <i>(b)</i> cold meals;  [154919]
<P>
<UL>(2) what consultation he has initiated with schoolchildren about their preferences in respect of school meals and if meals should be hot or cold;  [154920]

(3) what guidelines he issues to local education authorities about the nutritional value of hot school meals;  [154921]

 Information on hot and cold school meal provision is not collected centrally. Under current education legislation, it is entirely up to local education authorities and schools in England to decide on the presentation and content of school meals. However, from 1 April this year, the Government are introducing compulsory minimum nutritional standards for school lunches--the first for over 20 years--along with a new duty to provide paid meals on request. Although there is no requirement that lunches should be hot, all school lunches, whether hot or cold, will have to meet the new standards.




<P>
<P><I>22 Mar 2001 : Column: 337W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10322w15.html_para0">I accept that hot food may be comforting, particularly in cold weather. In our guidance for caterers on the new standards, there is a strong recommendation that some hot food should be available on the school meal menu.
<P>

<a name="10322w15.html_para1">We consulted widely on the new standards, including a sample of schools. My officials have also visited schools and spoken to children to ask their views on school lunches.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make a statement on the Government's policy on tackling bullying in schools.  [154998]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10322w15.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 We attach a high priority to helping schools prevent and combat bullying. We want all schools to treat bullying seriously and deal with it promptly and firmly whenever and wherever it occurs. That is why since September 1999 we have required heads by law to draw up measures to prevent all forms of bullying among pupils. To help them do this, last December my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State launched our new anti-bullying strategy. This includes a revised pack for schools, an accompanying video aimed at pupils, a new anti-bullying website and a new public information film to raise awareness. The key message is that pupils should report bullying to someone they trust and not suffer in silence. The Department is also funding an expansion of the Parentline Plus free helpline for parents of victims.
<P>

<a name="10322w15.html_para2">We have, however, made it clear that when necessary Heads can permanently exclude pupils responsible for serious or persistent bullying.

<a name="10322w15.html_wqn2"><B> Joan Ruddock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how many pupils were recorded as the subjects of bullying at school <i>(a)</i> nationally and <i>(b)</i> in each of the London education authorities over the past 12 months, broken down by ethnic origin.  [154999]<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="10322w15.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 I believe my hon. Friend is referring to funds allocated by the Victims Liaison Unit in the Northern Ireland Office which provides support to victims of the Troubles.
<P>

<a name="10322w15.html_para3">In the past year, the Victims Liaison Unit allocated &#163;1 million to the Northern Ireland Memorial Fund, bringing the total paid to the fund to date to &#163;2 million. The fund will receive a further &#163;3 million over the next three years.
<P>

<a name="10322w15.html_para4">&#163;3 million was also provided for the scheme to core fund victims and survivors groups over a two-year period from 2000-02. To date &#163;2,987,938 has been allocated from this scheme. The allocation of grants to individual groups is shown in the table.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will review the therapeutic work rules that apply to incapacity benefits; and if he will make a statement.  [155577]

<a name="10322w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 From April 2002 we propose to introduce new rules for people who receive Incapacity Benefit, Severe Disablement Allowance and Income Support based on incapacity who want to undertake some form of paid work which may ease their way back into full-time employment. We are aware of concerns that the current therapeutic work rules may be of limited use where it is difficult to demonstrate that a particular job would be beneficial to a person's medical condition. The current rules also do not help someone who wants to work on a limited basis in order to have social contact if they do not satisfy the therapeutic requirement. This is why we have reviewed the current position and are introducing some improvements.
<P>

<a name="10322w16.html_para0">Under the proposed changes, the therapeutic work rules will cease to exist. Instead we intend to introduce rules which will allow any person receiving incapacity benefits to:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) work for less than 16 hours a week and up to &#163;60.50 for up to six months; with a six month extension for those working with a Personal Adviser, Job Broker or Disability Employment Adviser;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) work for maximum earnings of &#163;20 a week with no time limit and no hours limit.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="10322w16.html_para1">Claimants who undertake sheltered work or are undergoing a hospital treatment programme which includes work, will, as now, be able to earn up to &#163;60.50 a week (April 2001 rates) with no limit on the number of hours they work.
<P>

<a name="10322w16.html_para2">We believe that these rules are much fairer than those that currently exist. Because we are opening up the rules to anyone on incapacity benefits we are giving more people the opportunity of trying paid work. This, together with our other measures to help people find suitable work, will enable people to move off benefits and into work. Also, by allowing all claimants to do some paid work without time limit, we will be encouraging those who are otherwise excluded to take part in activities which will help them feel part of, and play a more active role in, their local community. Additionally, of course, there are the rules which we already have in place to allow claimants to try full-time work or training and return to benefit at the same rate if they have to give up that work or training.
<P>

<a name="10322w16.html_para3">These changes do not affect the position whereby people receiving Incapacity Benefit or Severe Disablement Allowance may do unpaid voluntary work for an unlimited period.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions asking how many representations he has received concerning delays in payment of Winter Fuel Payment since May 1997; how many people received their Winter Fuel Payment on time in (a) 2000 and (b) 1999; and how many people have experienced delays in payment of Winter Fuel Payment lasting over (a) one month, (b) three months (c) six months, and (d) 12 months.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The information is not available in the format requested, but I hope the following explanation of when payments were made might be helpful.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Winter Fuel Payment scheme was introduced in the winter of 1997/1998 as one of the Government's initiatives to tackle fuel poverty in Great Britain.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In the first three winters of the scheme (1997/1998, 1998/1999 and 1999/2000) around 10 million people were eligible in each winter and paid automatically, where entitlement was established. These payments were made within the expected timetable.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In response to a European Court of Justice ruling in December 1999 the Government decided to equalise the age from which the Winter Fuel Payment is payable. The majority of people from age 60 could now benefit from the payments.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Following the court ruling, people who were newly eligible for a payment last winter, and were not in receipt of a social security benefit during the relevant qualifying week, apart from Housing Benefit, Council Tax Benefit or Child Benefit, should have made a claim for their payment.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Last winter around 11 million payments, where entitlement was established, were made automatically before Christmas, as was the intention. So far we have also made payments in respect of successful claims determined by 12 January 2001. It is up to the individual to decide when and whether to make a claim. We are still receiving and processing claims for winter 1999/2000 payments. Claims for winter 2000/01 must be received before 31 March 2001.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Although the ruling was given in December 1999 it applied from the beginning of the scheme and payments in respect of past winters are being paid to those who are now entitled. People who think they are eligible for a payment for past winters must make a claim for their payments. There is no time limit for making claims for past winters.</FONT></UL>

 In response to the recommendations of the Social Security Select Committee (SSSC) in its report on Medical Services, the Department of Social Security's Chief Medical Adviser and the President of the Appeals Service are establishing a formal process for feedback on the quality standards of medical reports in appeal cases. Interim arrangements for feedback have been in place since July 2000 and five cases have so far been referred.
<P>

<a name="10322w16.html_para6">All cases referred to the Chief Medical Adviser are forwarded to Sema for information, further investigation and remedial action with the doctor concerned, if appropriate.
<P>

<a name="10322w16.html_para7">Sema Medical Services monitor the quality standards of medical reports of all their doctors on a rolling programme, to volumes which are statistically significant over a three-month rolling period. The outcome of monitoring is recorded, and feedback given to each individual doctor on his or her performance. Where this has fallen below the standard expected, the doctor is given appropriate advice by an experienced full-time colleague; if necessary, arrangements are made for remedial training.

Additionally any policy changes arising from Cabinet Office units, such as the Social Exclusion Unit and the United Kingdom Anti- Drugs Co-ordination Unit, reports are implemented by the appropriate Government Department, rather than by the unit itself.

 <i>[holding answer 14 March 2001]:</i> In seeking to recognise the charitable status of the Hinduja Foundation, the New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) sought the advice of its tax consultants, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). NMEC passed on to Mr. S. P. Hinduja's office advice it received from PwC in December 1998 on the normal basis in such circumstances that neither NMEC nor PwC were liable or responsible for any reliance the Hindujas placed on that advice. In essence the advice indicated that if the terms of the Hinduja Foundation's contribution mirrored that of the sponsorship agreements drawn-up for commercial sponsors of the Dome then VAT would apply. In early February 1999 NMEC submitted to the Hinduja Foundation a donor agreement that mirrored agreements drawn-up for the other charitable trusts contributing to the faith zone. At that time the donation was not liable for VAT.

 Through their commitment to public service broadcasting, the Government have helped to foster an environment in which a creative, commercially successful broadcasting industry provides a wide range of UK-made, high-quality, original programmes catering for all viewers and listeners.

We have made it clear in the Communications White Paper that public service broadcasting will continue to have a key role to play in the digital future.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

There are three main factors to consider in reviewing these figures:<P>

Unlike the actual figures shown, planned expenditure collected at the beginning of the year does not include expenditure on services that are treated as non-cash limited;<P>

Secondly, significant allocations are received during the year, after plans are submitted. These allocations comprise new money to the NHS, and also changes to the way in which funding to NHS trusts is provided; and<P>

One-off items of expenditure can effect comparisons with related plans and previous years. <P>

 <i>[holding answer 14 March 2001]:</i> Information about ambulance response times for each National Health Service ambulance trust and nationally for 1991-92 is contained in the Department's statistical bulletin "Patient Transport Services 1981 to 1991-92, Summary Information from Forms KA32 and KA34". Information for 1994-95 is contained in the Department's statistical bulletin "Ambulance Services, England 1994-95".

<P>

<a name="10322w19.html_para0">Our policy is to save more lives by providing faster, more responsive and effective emergency ambulance services. In July 1996, we announced revised standards for ambulance service responses to immediately life- threatening incidents where more rapid intervention would have a significant impact on saving lives.
<P>

<a name="10322w19.html_para1">Clinical evidence indicates that 1,800 lives could be saved each year in people under 75 years of age suffering heart attacks through the achievement of the standard that immediately life-threatening emergency calls (Category A calls) should be responded to 75 per cent. of the time within eight minutes irrespective of location. We are determined that every NHS ambulance trust must achieve the 75 per cent. milestone as quickly as possible.

 Five people were invited for interview for the post of chair at the new North Cheshire Hospitals National Health Service Trust, two of whom lived in the Runcorn and Widnes areas. The names of the candidates involved are held in confidence. The Department always attempts to ensure that the non-executives appointed to NHS boards represent the communities they serve. This will remain a prime consideration in the appointments made to the board of the newly merged North Cheshire Hospitals NHS Trust.

 At January 2001 there were 1.039 million people waiting for admission to hospital, 119,000 fewer than at March 1997. The published waiting list only includes those who are ready for treatment. Patients who are planned admissions will initially be admitted from the waiting list, but will also require subsequent planned episodes of care. Patients are only "suspended" if they are unfit for treatment. The number of patients suspended at end December was 76,660 <sup>1</sup> .

<a name="10322w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Eligibility for National Health Service sight tests was extended to all those aged 60 and over from 1 April 1999. Figures for the number of over-60s who have received free eye tests in particular areas are not collected centrally.
<P>

<a name="10322w20.html_para0">However, there was an increase of around 40,000 in the total number of sight tests paid for by Shropshire health authority in the 18 months following April 1999 compared to the 18 months before April 1999. It is fair to assume that the majority of this increase was due to newly eligible people aged over 60 obtaining NHS sight tests.

 <i>[holding answer 21 March 2001]:</i> Each hospital development is unique, reflecting local requirements and circumstances. We are therefore unable to give an overall average cost. The capital value would be dependent on many factors, such as location, with the land and construction costs varying considerably, with inner London prices at over 25 per cent. higher than in many other parts of the country. Other factors include the geography and nature of the site chosen, and whether it is new build on an existing hospital site, a greenfield site or a major refurbishment project.

<a name="10322w20.html_spnew7"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Contributions to, and the investment build up of, pension funds benefit from deferred taxation to encourage people to save for a secure retirement income that will last for life. Where, following the death of a personal pension scheme member during income drawdown, the remaining pension fund capital is paid to a beneficiary, it is subject to a tax charge of 35 per cent. This charge broadly recovers the pension scheme tax reliefs given earlier on fund contributions and investment growth.

 Chichester, along with the rest of the United Kingdom, is benefiting from the long-term action we have taken to build economic stability and secure high and stable levels of growth and employment. Since the general election, claimant unemployment in the constituency has fallen by 504, or 41 per cent., youth unemployment is down by 77 per cent., and long-term unemployment has fallen by 63 per cent.
<P>

<a name="10322w21.html_para2">Macro-economic stability is being complemented at the micro-economic level by the Government's policies to ease the transition from welfare into work and to make work pay. To the end of December 2000, the new deal for 18 to 24-year-olds had helped 251 young people in Chichester constituency gain valuable skills and experience--138 (55 per cent.) of whom had moved into employment. The Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC), introduced in October 1999, is helping to make work pay for low and middle-income families. In August 2000, 1,400 families in the constituency were benefiting from WFTC.

<a name="10322w21.html_para3">The Government are also committed to developing policies which enable pensioners to share in the country's rising prosperity. All pensioners, including 25,500 in Chichester, will receive an above-inflation increase in the basic state pension from April 2001.
