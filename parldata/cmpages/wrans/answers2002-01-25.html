<a name="20125w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Joyce: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what plans he has to amend the Road Traffic Act 1984.  [27461]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 None. There is no such Act of Parliament.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. May: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 8 January 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 584W, on departmental consultants, if he will set out the criteria for determining that contracts let to <i>(a)</i> Arthur Andersen, <i>(b)</i> Ernst and Young, <i>(c)</i> Mercers Management Consulting and <i>(d)</i> Schroder Salamon Smith Barney, on matters relating to Railtrack should not be subject to open competition.  [27206]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 The issues involved were highly sensitive, involving discussions being conducted with Railtrack and their advisers on the basis of strict confidentiality.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Lazarowicz: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 15 January 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 208W, on piracy, what assessment he has made of the adequacy of <i>(a)</i> shipping and <i>(b)</i> port security measures in the United Kingdom.  [29279]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The United Kingdom has a comprehensive security regime in place for maritime passenger operations.
<P>

<a name="20125w01.html_para0">The basis of this security regime is the Aviation and Maritime Security Act (AMSA) 1990, which enabled mandatory measures to be introduced for the maritime industry. These measures are formally required by Directions served on the industry covering a range of security issues, including searching of passengers and vehicles, the establishment of Restricted Zones (in which only passengers and other authorised persons are allowed) and pass wearing.
<P>

<a name="20125w01.html_para1">These Directions establish the security standards that the Government expect the industry to comply with, by ensuring that appropriate procedures are in place.
<P>

<a name="20125w01.html_para2">Inspectors from my Department undertake a continuous and comprehensive system of compliance visits to passenger ports and also undertake ship inspections, to ensure that effective security regimes, in accordance with the Directions, are maintained. They are empowered to take enforcement action against harbour/ship operators if the required standards are not being met.




<P>
<P><I>25 Jan 2002 : Column 1104W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20125w01.html_para3">Following the events of 11 September 2001, the UK's maritime passenger industry was required to operate in accordance with increased levels of security requirements. These increased measures are kept under constant review.
<P>

<a name="20125w01.html_para4">Consideration has also been given to additional initiatives. This work has been undertaken within Whitehall and has included, for the first time, offering general security advice to non-passenger ships and non-AMSA ports.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will make a statement on the condition of railway lines leading to nuclear power stations.  [29497]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Maintenance of railway track leading to nuclear power stations which forms part of the Railtrack controlled infrastructure is the responsibility of Railtrack. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE), through its HM Railways Inspectorate (HMRI), regulates health and safety on the railways. HMRI currently has a focus on track maintenance issues as one of its mandatory inspection programmes. HSE has advised me that HMRI is not aware of any specific problems at present with the condition of track leading to nuclear power stations.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what the requirements are for local authorities to prepare emergency plans for incidents involving trains carrying nuclear materials.  [29498]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The responsibility to prepare emergency plans for transport of nuclear material by rail rests principally with the train operator, facility owner and infrastructure controller. They have a duty under The Packaging, Labelling and Carriage of Radioactive Material by Rail Regulations 1996 (RAMRail) to have emergency arrangements and to co-operate with each other so as to ensure effective co-ordination of their respective safety systems and procedures. Also under the Radiation (Emergency Preparedness and Public Information) Regulations 2001 (REPPIR), carriers are required to prepare emergency plans and to consult with appropriate local authorities. Some types of consignment are exempt from these regulations, however, including material in packages which are designed and tested to meet severe accident conditions, and small quantities of material which present a very limited risk.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions how many incidents there have been where flasks carrying radioactive material on trains have been found to be over the permitted radiation level, broken down by location and level of radiation.  [29488]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Such incidents are included in the annual reports to which I referred the hon. Member in my reply of 21 January 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 576W.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will list the incidents in which trains carrying <i>(a)</i> radioactive material and <i>(b)</i> other nuclear materials have been involved which resulted in release of their materials in the north-west of England in the last six months.  [30635]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 There have been no such incidents.




<P>
<P><I>25 Jan 2002 : Column 1105W</I><P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what the Department's definition is of 'no significant radiological safety implication', as used in the report, Radiological Consequences Resulting from Accidents and Incidents involving the Transport of Radioactive Materials in the UK-200 Review, published in October 2001.  [30555]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 There is no formal definition of "significant" in the context of this report. A significant radiological consequence would be if radiation exposures approach or exceed the statutory limits. The radiological consequences listed in the report are much lower than this and are therefore not considered significant.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what percentage of trains using Paddington station have <i>(a)</i> ATP and <i>(b)</i> TPWS in place.  [30309]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Train protection systems are operational on all train services using Paddington station. First Great Western and Heathrow Express services are fitted with Automatic Train Protection (ATP) and Virgin Cross Country and Thames Trains services are fitted with the Train Protection and Warning Systems (TPWS).

<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w01.html_wqn9"><B> Andy King: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions how many officials responsible for the policy for council tax enforcement in his Department have, as part of their training and information gathering, <i>(a)</i> visited a money advice centre, a magistrates court and the High Court when they are hearing cases for committal for council tax arrears and <i>(b)</i> discussed the difficulties with council tax application forms with the applicants.  [29533]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w01.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 No such visits have been made. However, officials are in regular contact with the Lord Chancellor's Department, the Local Government Association and local authorities about enforcement matters. Last November, officials also met with representatives of the Zacchaeus 2000 Trust to discuss committal for local tax debts and are happy to meet other organisations and advice centres to discuss such matters.

<a name="20125w01.html_sbhd6"><H4><center>Local Tax Arrears</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w01.html_wqn10"><B> Andy King: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions how many warrants for committal to prison owing to local tax arrears were issued in 1999.  [29535]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w01.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 Statistics on committal orders are published in The Institute of Public Finance Accountancy (CIPFA) Revenue Collection Statistics.
<P>

<a name="20125w01.html_para5">For 1999&#150;2000, their estimated total number of orders obtained but postponed on payment terms was 22,119, based on grossed up actual figures provided by 253 of 376 local authorities.




<P>
<P><I>25 Jan 2002 : Column 1106W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20125w01.html_para6">For the 253 responding authorities, the actual number of people committed to prison was 117.

<a name="20125w01.html_sbhd7"><H4><center>Local Authority Statutory Notices</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mrs. May: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what recent guidance his Department has issued on the publication of statutory notices by local authorities in the local press.  [30217]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 None. We issued general guidance about planning notices in Circular 15/92, "Publicity for Planning Applications". This includes advice on the categories of planning application that must be advertised in local newspapers. Separate requirements to advertise planning appeals and called-in planning applications are set out in secondary legislation. The Government's recently published planning Green Paper "Planning: Delivering a Fundamental Change" indicates our intention to retain the requirement on planning authorities to advertise certain applications in the local press. However, we will review the requirement to publicise planning appeals and called- in planning applications with the aim of encouraging greater community participation.

<a name="20125w02.html_sbhd0"><H4><center>Allotments</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. May: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (1) what recent guidance his Department has issued on consultation on <i>(a)</i> supplementary planning guidance and <i>(b)</i> the change of use of allotments;  [30218]
<P>
<UL>(2) what recent guidance his Department has issued to local authorities on the change of use of allotments.  [30219]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 In March 1998, my Department issued guidance to local authorities to ensure that the availability of statutory allotments are actively promoted before applications for consent to their disposal are submitted. We have since consulted on draft Planning Policy Guidance note: (PPG) 17, which sets out revised criteria against which applications for consent to dispose of statutory allotments are to be determined. We will shortly be issuing the revised guidance to the Government offices and local authorities.
<P>

<a name="20125w02.html_para0">My Department, in conjunction with the Local Government Association, published: "Growing in the community: A good practice guide for the management of allotments" in June 2001. This guide provides comprehensive advice and good practice for local authorities on all aspects of allotment management. My Department has also recently published "Allotments: a plot holders guide", which provides advice to current and potential allotment plot holders.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. May: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what plans he has to improve the inter-changeability of bus tickets on routes served by different bus companies.  [30220]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 We wish to encourage joint ticketing schemes between bus operators, aimed at making life easier for bus users.




<P>
<P><I>25 Jan 2002 : Column 1107W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20125w02.html_para1">Last year my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, on the advice of the Director General of Fair Trading, made an Order to exempt multi-operator ticketing schemes from having to be notified individually to the Office of Fair Trading. Any such scheme that meets the terms of the Order is therefore automatically exempted.
<P>

<a name="20125w02.html_para2">I am, however, aware of the concern expressed both by bus operators and local authorities about the terms of the ticketing schemes block exemption. It would be highly undesirable if operators felt compelled to abandon existing worthwhile initiatives, or were deterred from developing new ones. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Transport has written to the Director General of Fair Trading, emphasising the importance that we place upon 



<P>
<P><I>25 Jan 2002 : Column 1108W</I><P>
the continuation of sensible, multi-operator ticketing schemes that have proved popular with the travelling public.

<P>

<a name="20125w03.html_para2">The Government have placed extensive legislation for tackling football hooliganism at the disposal of the police and the courts. The scenes witnessed in Cardiff and other grounds should be placed in a proper context. Our stadia remain among the safest and most secure in the world and there is no evidence of a return to the mass hooliganism that marred our national game in previous decades. The Government are not complacent. My right hon.

<a name="20125w03.html_para3">The measures introduced by the Football (Disorder) Act 2000 empower the courts to impose banning orders on individuals who have previously caused or contributed to violence or disorder at football matches, where there are reasonable grounds to believe that making an order would help to prevent violence or disorder at future matches.

 The decision on whether or not to launch a UK bid to host the Olympic Games is a matter principally for the British Olympic Association which has yet to decide whether to bid for the 2012 Olympic Games. It is current BOA policy that any UK bid should be based on London. The BOA's eventual decision will inevitably be influenced by public opinion both in London and across the UK, together with the views of London and central Governments.

<a name="20125w04.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence's Gulf Veterans' Medical Assessment Programme (GVMAP) was established in 1993. As at 17 January 2002, 3,276 patients had been seen by GVMAP physicians. The GVMAP is located at St. Thomas's Hospital, London, and is open to all present and former service men and women or MOD civilians who believe that their health has suffered as a direct result of the 1990&#150;91 Gulf conflict. Its two main purposes are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to investigate patients' medical complaints, make a diagnosis as far as is possible, and recommend appropriate management, or provide reassurance if no illness is found;
<P>
<BR>
to collate statistical information in an anonymised form as a resource for researchers.

</FONT></UL>
<a name="20125w04.html_para1">Patients are referred to the GVMAP by their doctors. There is no pre-determined medical criterion they need to satisfy before being seen. Patients are given a full medical examination by GVMAP physicians and a range of physical tests; investigations routinely conducted for all patients include urinalysis, haematological, biochemical, biological and serological tests, ultrasound scan of the abdomen and electrocardiography. These tests are carried out on the day of the appointment and take approximately four hours. Additional investigations and/or referrals to other consultants/specialists may be required. This is decided either during the initial appointment or in follow-up consultations if deemed necessary. Since May 2001, a small number of patients have been seen at a clinic held every two months and run by the head of the GVMAP in Northallerton, North Yorkshire. Patients are given the same assessment as they would have received had they come to London.
<P>

<a name="20125w04.html_para2">The clinical findings from the first 1,000 service and ex-service patients seen by GVMAP physicians were published in the British Medical Journal on 30 January 1999. A paper on the clinical findings from the second 1,000 service and ex-service patients seen was published in the Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps on 29 June 2001. Copies of both papers&#151;as too is a great deal more information of interest to Gulf veterans&#151;are readily available from the Ministry of Defence's Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Unit (Freephone 0800 169 4495) and on my Department's website at: www.mod.uk/issues/ gulfwar/index.html. A clinical analysis of the first 3,000 service and ex-service veterans who have attended the GVMAP is being prepared for peer-review and publication in a scientific journal.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w04.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Over the last three financial years we have spent &#163;283 million on upgrading single living accommodation, and &#163;167 million on service family accommodation (SFA). A new modernisation programme for single living accommodation was announced in March 2001 by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence. Worth some &#163;1 billion, its aim is the upgrading of over 30,000 bed spaces within five years of the appointment of a prime contractor. The Defence Housing Executive has a continuing programme to upgrade the core of stock of service families accommodation by the end of 2005.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w04.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 There are no surviving records which detail the origin of equipment and materials used at the Chemical Defence Establishment, Nancekuke.
<P>

<a name="20125w04.html_para4">However, records summarising the technical programme undertaken at Nancekuke indicate that in 1959, CN (chloroacetophenone) of both Belgian and Italian origin was transferred to Nancekuke. Some of the CN of Belgian origin was returned to Belgium during 1962 to 1967.
<P>

<a name="20125w04.html_para5">Additional anecdotal evidence also implies that some of the nerve agent production plant built at Nancekuke contained equipment originating from Germany.

 Purchases of vehicles for the Ministry of Defence Police are made on the basis of obtaining best value for money.

Where no competition takes place, we would still expect to secure discounted

 All emergency contraception supplied to under-16s is a prescription only medicine (POM). This is provided under medical supervision which includes other health professionals supplying the POM product under patient group directions. Information collected centrally of the number or prescriptions for emergency hormonal contraception dispensed in family planning clinics and prescriptions dispensed in the community by community pharmacists and dispensing doctors in England is included in my reply to the hon. Member on 23 January 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 965W.
<P>

<a name="20125w05.html_para2">Health professionals providing contraception to under-16s do so within a legal framework established in 1986. This involves assessing the young person's competence to understand the choices they are making and whether the treatment is in their best interests. Health professionals, like any other professional whose work brings them into contact with children and families, should follow the Government's "Working Together to Safeguard Children" child protection guidance. This guidance sets out how all agencies and professionals should work together to promote children's welfare and protect them from abuse and neglect. It is intended to provide a national framework within which agencies and professionals at a local level&#151;individually and jointly&#151;draw up and agree upon their own more detailed ways of working together.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. In many health authorities there are factors which distort the expenditure per head. These include:<P>

(i) the health authority acting in a lead capacity to commission health care or fund training on behalf of other health bodies;<P>

(ii) asset revaluations in NHS trusts being funded through health authorities; and<P>

(iii) some double counting of expenditure between health authorities and primary care trusts within the health authority area.<P>

2. Expenditure per head cannot therefore be reliably compared between health authorities.<P>

3. Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of health authorities.<P>

4. Expenditure is taken from health authority and primary care trust summarisation forms which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total spent by the health authority and by the primary care trusts within each health authority area. The majority of General 



Dental Services expenditure is not included in the health authority or primary care trust accounts and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board.<P>

5. Health authorities and primary care trusts should account for their expenditure on a gross basis. This results in an element of double counting where one body acts as the main commissioner and is then reimbursed by other bodies. The effect of this double counting within the answer cannot be identified.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w06.html_spmin0"><B>The Advocate-General:</B> 
 The vast majority of cases to date have involved human rights issues. The reasons for intervention will vary according to the circumstances and the criteria are not rigid. In considering intervention I always have very much in mind the need to avoid unnecessary delay in criminal proceedings and the cost of intervention to the public purse. I have taken the view that intervention should not be a routine matter. I might for instance intervene where the case raises human rights issues of serious concern to the Government and I am satisfied that these are more likely to be resolved satisfactorily with my intervention. Experience has shown that the vast majority of devolution issues are disposed of satisfactorily by the courts, without any need for my intervention and consequent public expense. Where cases reach the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, intervention is particularly apt because that is the final authority. But even in these cases my intervention may not be necessary. My role as Advocate-General is not to

My office was created by Parliament less than three years ago and I have had to establish and develop it, determining what is required to be done and how to do it. In my advisory role, I have worked closely with the other UK Law Officers to ensure the Government get high quality legal advice, essential to their work. I have developed my role under the Scotland Act, in close co-operation with UK Departments, to seek to ensure that the Government have early warning of issues of competence of Bills of the Scottish Parliament or actings of the Scottish Executive, and can engage in constructive dialogue with the Scottish Executive to address them. Establishing and developing a new office of State is an exciting challenge. The creation of my office has also resulted in a Law Officer with Scottish responsibilities being available in the House of Commons for the first time since 1987.

 I give Law officers' advice frequently and it is a major part of my work. I am precluded from providing further information because it is a long standing convention, adhered to by successive Governments and enshrined in the Ministerial Code, that neither the fact that the Law Officers have advised on a matter, nor the content of any advice which they may have given, is disclosed outside Government other than in exceptional circumstances. This is to protect the confidentiality of the legal advice given to the Government. I have explained this convention to Parliament on a number of occasions. In addition, my officials in the Office of the Solicitor to the Advocate-General frequently advise Government Departments on Scots Law.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w07.html_spmin2"><B>The Advocate-General:</B> 
 Since devolution in July 1999 my officials and I have examined 30 Bills in conjunction with relevant Government Departments at various stages during their progress through the Scottish Parliament in order to ensure that any problem of legislative competence is identified and resolved if possible, in order to try to avoid the need to refer a Bill to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The Bill may be outwith legal competence in a variety of ways, for example, if it relates to reserved matters, or relates to enactments protected from modification by the Scottish Parliament, or is incompatible with any of the rights of the European Convention on Human Rights or with European Community law. Thus far I am pleased to advise that any problems have been resolved, following legal advice when necessary, and after co-operation and dialogue. As a result I have not referred any Bill so far to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The existence of the power of referral and the work which is done in connection with that power is an essential part of the devolution settlement.

 The office of the Advocate- General for Scotland was established on 20 May 1999 and since 1 July 1999 forms part of the Scotland Office with the office of the Secretary of State for Scotland. Not all the costs of the Scotland Office can be separately allocated to each of these two Offices.
<P>

<a name="20125w07.html_para0">Between 20 May and 1 July 1999, the costs of the office of the Advocate-General were paid by the former Scottish Office. From 1 July 1999 to 31 March 2000 the identifiable costs of staff and related administration was &#163;883,326; and in 2000&#150;01 it was &#163;1,265,215. Approximately half of the costs of the office relates to work on litigation and advisory work including the preparation of Bills carried out by lawyers from the Office of the Solicitor to the Advocate-General on behalf of Government Departments other than the Advocate- General.

1. The figures reflect Education SSA (primary and secondary sub-blocks respectively) plus all school related revenue grants in the DfES's DEL relevant aged 5&#150;10 (primary) and 11&#150;15 (secondary).<P>

2. The primary and secondary grant figures include notional allocations for those grants in support of more than one sector.<P>

3. Pupil numbers underlying the &#163; per pupil figures are those underlying the SSA settlement calculations (primary and secondary sub-blocks respectively.<P>

4. Real terms figures are calculated using GDP deflators published by the Treasury 20 December 2001.<P>

5. 2001&#150;02 figures are provisional as decisions on some funding allocations have yet to be finalised. The figures are thus liable to be revised later in the year.<P>

6. Figures rounded to nearest &#163;10. Difference figures may not sum due to rounding. <P>

 In both the Benefits Agency and the Employment Service, throughout Great Britain, we will provide an interpreter for customers who do not speak English and who either cannot or do not wish to provide their own interpreter. This service is provided through either a multilingual member of staff; local services, for example, community interpreters, local authority services or colleges; or the telephone interpreting service provided by Language Line.

<a name="20125w10.html_para0">We also have an internal translation service for translating documents both into English and into foreign languages. This is supplemented by a rapid translation service on a text-to-speech basis when a quick translation of a document in a foreign language is needed. Local offices also have the freedom to use community based translation services if they are available and convenient.

 &#163;122 million has been invested in the current financial year to establish the Jobcentre Plus Pathfinder offices. Because much of this investment, for example on IT and communications, has been spent on the Pathfinder offices collectively it is not possible to identify the total investment separately in respect of the offices in Inverclyde. However, a total of around &#163;3.6 million has been spent on improving the physical environment of the Greenock and Port Glasgow Pathfinder offices.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on the arrangements for transfer to incapacity benefit of unemployed persons of working age who are involved in one or more sickness incidents during a year.  [29069]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 January 2002]:</i> A person who has been awarded jobseeker's allowance and is unable to work because of sickness may choose to remain on jobseeker's allowance for up to two weeks. This easement means that people who are incapable of work for short periods of time do not have to change the benefit they are claiming. It can normally be used on two occasions in each year of a job-seeking period. Where the easement does not apply an unemployed person who becomes incapable of work can claim incapacity benefit supported by medical evidence.
<P>

<a name="20125w10.html_para3">We are now delivering a new business, Jobcentre Plus, to help all people of working age make the most of their opportunities. In the past, many people were moved on to incapacity benefit with little or no help to make sure they got the right level of support to enable them to get back into work, where they are ready and able to do so.
<P>

<a name="20125w10.html_para4">All people making new and repeat claims to incapacity benefit in Jobcentre Plus pathfinder offices are offered a work-focused meeting as a condition of receiving benefit. These meetings provide the opportunity for people to discuss their work options, as well as their benefit claim, and to investigate with their personal adviser the practical and financial support that is available to help them return to work.

 The potential role of World bank grant finance is one of the issues being discussed in the context of the replenishment of the funds of the International Development Association (IDA, the concessional lending arm of the World bank), on which the Secretary of State for International Development leads. The Chancellor and Treasury officials have held discussions with the US Treasury and other countries to seek support for the UK position in these negotiations, which is that we should maintain and enhance the role of IDA as the largest source of concessional finance for low-income countries, and to encourage a substantial contribution by donors to the IDA replenishment.

<P>
<P><I>25 Jan 2002 : Column 1151W</I><P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I will respond generally while covering the issues raised in each of the questions.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Following a recent ONS Review of the measures to protect the confidentiality of personal information provided in the 2001 Census, I have announced some additional measures. These include a decision that standard statistical output (amounting to some 10,000 counts) will not be released for small areas below a certain population threshold, this being 100 resident persons and 40 resident households.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The design of output areas from the 2001 Census will, however, recognise the need to identify parishes separately in the 2001 Census, but the number of parishes that fall below this threshold will not be known until the processing of data is completed later this year. From information from the 1991 Census, however, it is estimated that some 1,230 parishes in England would have fallen below the 2001 Census threshold.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Nevertheless, the average size of output areas in the 2001 Census will be significantly smaller than in the 1991 Census, facilitating greater geographical flexibility overall in using Census output. The resulting increased amount of detail to be made available from the 2001 Census will assist in the better planning of local services.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I have listened carefully to the views expressed throughout extensive consultation on output requirements from the Census. The Review was fully aware of, and considered carefully, all the requirements for output, including those for parishes, that users had articulated during the course of wide and extensive consultation with all local authorities and other users.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Following the initial announcement last November of my decision to introduce these additional disclosure control measures, I received a number of representations including six from local government bodies expressing particular concerns about the impact of the raised threshold on the availability of 2001 Census data for parishes. In addition, I have recently answered two Parliamentary Questions from the right hon. David Curry MP (nos. 28863 and 28862) on the subject.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am, of course, keen to ensure that users will obtain the maximum benefit from the use of 2001 Census data. To this end, I invited representatives from the census-user community to a meeting on 13 December 2001 at which we were able to discuss further the specific issues that users had raised including the particular issue about sub-threshold parishes. At that meeting I explained that as Registrar General and National Statistician, I have an obligation not to reveal information collected in confidence in the Census about individual people and households. Indeed, I have given public assurances that I will not do so. In presenting increasingly detailed results from the Census, protecting personal information is of paramount importance.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Maintaining the confidentiality of individual data underpins the trust that exists between data suppliers and any agency that acts as custodian of information about them. At ONS we are fortunate that businesses and the public have confidence that their information is securely held and that we do not release any data that could identify an individual. It is essential that this trust be maintained. The 2001 Census Discussion Paper on Standard Area Statistics (September 2001) noted that the confidentiality threshold being proposed at that time was 50 persons and 20 resident households, but that disclosure control measures were under review as part of an ONS-wide programme of methods and quality. The recent Review was conducted to explore whether or not the measures that were in place would maintain this trust.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Review considered whether or not the measures initially proposed protected against both real and perceived disclosure. In particular it considered:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the level of statistical detail in the proposed tables;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) the level of geography for which the tables would be produced;</FONT></UL>




<P>
<P><I>25 Jan 2002 : Column 1152W</I><P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) the increased availability of the data; and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) the proliferation of other datasets against which Census data could be matched.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>On the basis of this Review I decided that an additional measure of rounding all cells to either zero or a multiple of 3, should be introduced for all tables to be produced for England and Wales, and that the population threshold for Output Areas be raised to 100 resident persons and 40 resident households for the release of Census Area Statistics.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>These measures, together with a data modification measure ('record swapping') already announced, will protect against not only the real risk of disclosure but also, and equally as important, the risk perceived, by the very public about whom the information refers, of disclosure that may arise in output table cells containing counts of '1'. Without these additional measures the risk of perceived disclosure would have been substantially higher. Once formed, any such public perceptions would be difficult to dislodge and would, I believe, damage the integrity of all census output.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In the circumstances I do not propose reverting to the threshold adopted for the release of small area statistics in the 1991 Census of 50 persons and 16 resident households.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We agreed at the meeting on 13 December, however, that the ONS and those present representing the user community would work closely together to minimise the impact that the rounding and increased threshold will have on the data and its uses. In particular, the ONS will consider further what summary output for 'sub-threshold parishes'&#151;in the form of simple statistical profiles, for example&#151;may be safely produced from the 2001 Census, in addition to some basic headcounts that have already been agreed.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A note on that meeting has been posted on the ONS website, and a paper giving further background into the decision and the method, and addressing the consequences and issues raised at the meeting and elsewhere, will be produced shortly.</FONT></UL>

On top of this the sheer volume of correspondence received since the creation of DEFRA has had a major impact on the Department's performance. I accept this is not an adequate excuse for not giving hon. Members timely responses, and now that normality is returning to the Department one of our key priorities is to rectify weaknesses in our service delivery. The size of our correspondence section has increased threefold and the line management strengthened; our IT systems have been updated and are in the process of being further improved and new guidance has been circulated throughout the Department. These actions are already beginning to bear fruit and it is hoped that the last of the backlog cases will be dispatched over the next few weeks.

<a name="20125w14.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Todd: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, pursuant to her answer of 21 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 315W, if she will adopt a policy on fly tipping similar to that adopted by the National Assembly for Wales.  [18022]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w14.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Fly tipping is a blight on our countryside and towns and is an antisocial activity wherever it takes place and whoever is responsible for it. The stringent controls in place to ensure that waste is dealt with properly apply both in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="20125w14.html_para1">The National Assembly for Wales (NAW) initiated a special drive against fly tipping. As part of this, the NAW voted &#163;400,000 for a two year project, (running in the financial years 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02) to support targeted waste enforcement. Three targeted enforcement teams were established. These teams work closely with other agency staff and other enforcement agencies such as the police, local authorities and the benefits agency. This has involved an intelligence led approach to enforcement, selectively targeting those activities that are of greatest impact to the environment.
<P>

<a name="20125w14.html_para2">This campaign was in part a response to concerns that fly tipping was becoming a particular problem in Wales and as a result, the number of successful prosecutions has increased from 24 in 1999 at the start of the project to 48 in 2000. Similar improvements are expected for the year 2001 to 2002.
<P>

<a name="20125w14.html_para3">The Environment Agency continues also to give the need to combat fly tipping a high priority in England. The agency is currently working to establish a central unit to co-ordinate the agency's approach to environmental crime.
<P>

<a name="20125w14.html_para4">This unit will work with other key enforcement bodies such as the local authorities, police and HM Customs and Excise and will particularly bear down on fly tipping.
<P>

<a name="20125w14.html_para5">Furthermore, the Fly Tipping Stakeholders' Forum, which comprises local authorities, business and landowners representatives, and is chaired by the Environment Agency, has produced a fly tipping guidance document, which provides information and guidance for all those who are affected and/or concerned by fly tipping. The document is available on the web at: http:// www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/wasteman/ flytip/

 <i>[holding answer 18 January 2002]:</i> The European Commission have been kept fully informed of the position in the United Kingdom through monthly meetings of its Standing Veterinary Committee.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the contribution farm subsidies make in reducing the cost of food in the UK.  [26021]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w15.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The only farm subsidies directly aimed at reducing the cost of food are consumer subsidies. However these constitute a very small element of the support mechanism and they do not significantly offset the higher prices consumers face from the CAP. The recent reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy, which have reduced the level of support to the market and increased direct payments to producers, have had the effect of substantially reducing the cost of agricultural support to consumers. However I estimate that in 2000 the overall cost of the CAP to food consumers and taxpayers was equivalent to &#163;8 to &#163;9 per week for a family of four.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w15.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) has studied the impacts of beam trawling on different sea bed habitats in the North and Irish seas since 1993 and compared these impacts with other sources of disturbance in the marine environment.
<P>

<a name="20125w15.html_para4">Beam trawling effort is patchily distributed. Most beam trawling takes place in relatively shallow areas with relatively high levels of natural disturbance, and where the sea bed is, to a certain extent, resilient to the effects of the gear. For example, the sandy sea beds of the southern North sea are continually disturbed by tides and wave action, and most of the animals living there are already adapted to cope with disturbance. In these areas the effects of beam trawling on the sea bed are hard to detect, and recovery of areas that are trawled will usually occur in less than one year.
<P>

<a name="20125w15.html_para5">In deeper water, where there is usually less wave and tidal action, beam trawling could have a proportionally greater effect, and recovery of the sea bed will take much longer. However, beam trawls are not widely used in these areas.

<a name="20125w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 This Department provides grants for flood and coastal defence capital works, and associated studies, which meet essential technical, economic and environmental criteria and achieve an appropriate priority score. Further to increases in spending plans in the last two spending reviews, additional funding of &#163;51 million over the four years from 2000&#150;01 was announced in November 2000 following the severe flooding that year. An increased priority was given to urban flood defences and the grant rates for all river flood defences were increased by 20 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20125w16.html_para8">Operational responsibility for flood management measures rests with the local operation authorities, normally the Environment Agency (EA) and local councils, who decide which projects to promote and their timing. The operational authorities are invited to submit applications for DEFRA funding.

 The Farm Waste Grant Scheme is available now to assist farmers in existing nitrate vulnerable zones with the cost of improving or constructing farm waste storage facilities. Grant is available at a rate of 40 per cent. on eligible expenditure up to an investment ceiling of &#163;85,000. The Government intend to extend this scheme to the new NVZ areas, from the date of their designation. We are currently considering whether additional funds will be needed from 2003 onwards, and we are considering also the option to raise the grant rate to 50 per cent. in less favoured areas, as is permitted under the EU rules on state aids.

 The Government support the establishment of the proposed Community register. However, the proposal implies that the information included on the register will be limited to a summary of applications for authorisation and authorisations granted. The current register maintained by my Department in relation to the release and marketing of genetically modified organisms contains more information, including all details of non-confidential information included in applications for authorisation. The Food Standards Agency operate procedures that give a similar level of information in relation to GM foods. The Government will press in negotiations on the proposal for more information to be placed on the Community register.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, pursuant to her answer of 8 January 2002 to the hon. Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth), <i>Official Report</i>, column 756W, on animal slaughter (Jedburgh), how many premises outwith the 3km zone were slaughtered out; how many sheep were slaughtered at each of these individual farm premises outwith the 3km zone; how many of these premises were tested for evidence of foot and mouth disease; and what was the result of the tests.  [29505]<P>

<P>

 In the Scottish Borders local authority area there were 11 premises outwith the 3km area on which animals were slaughtered as part of the foot and mouth disease eradication strategy. Animals on six farms were slaughtered as the disease was suspected but not clinically proven and animals on a further five farms were slaughtered due to their contacts with Longtown market. This involved a total of 11,917 sheep as detailed in the following table.

 Payments for suckler cow premium scheme are made between 16 October 2001 to 30 June annually. Claims are received up to 6 December. Payments are made in two parts, an advance payment to be paid by the 6 March 2002, and a balance payment due by 30 June 2002.
<P>

<a name="20125w17.html_para0">This year, scheme payments have not been made as early in the window as we would have liked because computer systems have had to be upgraded to reflect regulation changes to the bovine schemes. Processing has also been affected by the diversion of staff to FMD and by industrial action. Advance payments started in January and are expected to be completed by 31 March. As the end of the advance payment window has still not been reached, the matter of the payment of interest to farmers does not arise.

 The payment window for IACS arable area payments scheme (AAPS) 2001 runs from 16 November 2001 until 31 January 2002.
<P>

<a name="20125w17.html_para1">The diversion of staff to FMD and industrial action within the Rural Payments Agency has delayed the processing of AAPS claims and meant that fewer claims than normal were paid during the early part of the payment window. The industrial action was suspended on 11 January and good progress is now being made in dealing with unpaid claims. RPA expects to pay over 90 per cent. of AAPS claims by 31 January and to complete the payment process by around mid-February.

 The hon. Member has confirmed that he is specifically interested in the National Scrapie Plan for Great Britain. The plan was launched on 19 July 2001 with the opening of a genotyping scheme for breeding rams in pedigree pure-bred flocks registered with a breed society. From an estimated 15,000 flocks in this sector we have thus far received expressions of interest from over

one third. Of those expressing an interest over 2,800 have so far joined the plan. On 16 January I announced an extension of the plan to all pure-bred breeding flocks, irrespective of whether they are registered with a breed society. It is estimated that this will open eligibility to an extra 25,000 flocks. Eligibility has also been extended to all scrapie-affected flocks, irrespective of whether such flocks are pure-bred. We will be considering possible future extensions to the plan in consultation with stakeholders. Measures to eradicate scrapie are also included in the Animal Health Bill.

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 22 January 2002]:</i> This information is not held centrally. Local authorities are not required to monitor levels of each of these pollutants unless it appears from their modelling results that they are unlikely to achieve the nationally prescribed air quality objectives by the relevant deadlines. Our national monitoring network indicates that between 1997 and 2001 levels of most of these pollutants have fallen across England and Wales, and most local authorities are on course to meet the prescribed objectives for each of the pollutants. However, a number of authorities have identified possible difficulties with the objectives for nitrogen dioxide, particles and, to a lesser extent, sulphur dioxide. The table lists each of the authorities which has to date designated an air quality management area (AQMA), and highlights the pollutants in respect of which the AQMA has been designated.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent investigations have been undertaken by her Department on the impact of air pollution on health.  [29320]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w17.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 January 2002]:</i> The Department of Health's Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (COMEAP) advises the Government, through the Chief Medical Officer, on the effects of air pollution on health.




<P>

<P>

<a name="20125w17.html_para3">Also published on the website are details of a recent call for research proposals on air pollution and health. This new research is aiming to cover projects to be carried out over a three-year period as well as some smaller projects lasting for about one year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when she last reviewed the air quality strategy; and what the main findings of the review were.  [29319]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w17.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 January 2002]:</i> The Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland was published in January 2000. The strategy is not expected to need a comprehensive review for a few years. Instead, the Government and devolved Administrations have decided to review the strategy on a pollutant by pollutant basis to allow reviews of individual pollutants to be carried out relatively quickly, and to allow the outcomes of these reviews to be published was addenda to the strategy. The first of these reviews as published for consultation on 17 September 2001. It considered the possibility of tightening the existing policy objectives for three pollutants (carbon monoxide, benzene and particles) and of introducing for the first time a policy objective for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. A large number of responses to the consultation document were received, and we will take account of these in finalising our proposals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 January 2002]:</i> Reed beds form part of the portfolio for sustainable drainage systems. DEFRA, the Environment Agency and other stakeholders are looking at how future drainage systems ensure that water quality can be better protected, although no specific evaluation has yet been made of this potential role for reed beds.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w18.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 January 2002]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has stated that our policy for the mid-term review is to see a switch from production support under the first pillar of the CAP

[27740]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 January 2002]:</i> The Department launched a public consultation on the implementation of key provisions of the Animal Health Bill on 11 January 2002.
<P>

<a name="20125w18.html_para0">Included in this package are proposals for the matters to be covered by the disease risk assessment that will help to determine the amount of adjusted compensation paid for animals slaughtered on infected premises. We are seeking key stakeholders' views by 15 March.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has to apply for agrimonetary compensation for the livestock sector in April; and if she will make a statement.  [29994]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 January 2002]:</i> The European Commission have yet to confirm whether there is any agrimonetary compensation available for the livestock sector. Although this aid relates to the second and third stages of compensation paid last year, the EU rules provide for these later payments to be reduced or cancelled if the market prices and exchange rates have since moved in a direction which ameliorates the situation which leads to the compensation. We will not know for some months what the Commission assessment will be. When we do the Government will have carefully to consider the case for payment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w18.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 January 2002]:</i> We are supporting a number of initiatives to improve the competitiveness of both agricultural co-operatives and collaborative marketing groups.
<P>

<a name="20125w18.html_para2">With the NFU, we have been running a collaborative marketing initiative since 1998. This is aimed at helping farmers to recognise the many advantages of working together, particularly in relation to economies of scale and access to professional expertise. We have used joint representation at agricultural shows across a range of sectors to generate interest in this initiative.

<P>

<a name="20125w18.html_para3">Under the Agriculture Development Scheme, aimed at helping farmers and growers improve their competitiveness through better marketing, collaborative activities were given priority under bidding rounds held in 1999, 2000 and 2001. Successful bids in 1999 and 2000 included a project to benchmark best practice in farmer controlled businesses (Plunkett Foundation) and several projects from collaborative producer groups or co-operatives.
<P>

<a name="20125w18.html_para4">Opportunities for improving the competitiveness of co-operatives and collaborative marketing groups are also provided under the England Rural Development Programme through awards under the Processing and Marketing Grant and the measure on the marketing of quality agricultural products under the Rural Enterprise Scheme.

research projects associated with bovine TB, indicating for each <i>(a)</i> the cost in 2001&#150;02 and <i>(b)</i> the total cost of the project.  [29833]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 January 2002]:</i> The Krebs badger field trial, TB99 epidemiological survey of risk factors which may dispose some farms to TB breakdowns and road traffic accident survey of badger carcases are projects associated with bovine TB. These were suspended for most of 2001&#150;02, because of the foot and mouth disease emergency and little expenditure in respect of them has, therefore, been incurred in the present financial year. With the present resumption of work on these projects, revised costings are being drawn up but the total cost of the trial is expected to remain at &#163;35 million over five years.

 <i>[holding answer 24 January 2002]:</i> The need to control bovine TB in herds remains a top priority for the Department. Before the restart of routine testing, and restart of the badger culling trial, veterinary risk assessments were made. The restart of the programme has been dependent on when counties were declared free of foot and mouth disease.

 <i>[holding answer 24 January 2002]:</i> Many tenant farmers are already successfully taking part in rural development and agri-environment scheme. Further, over the last few years roughly the same proportion of tenant farmers and owner occupier farmers have joined the agri-environment schemes. However we are aware that some tenant farmers are concerned about their ability to take part in these schemes. This is something we will consider in the light of the ongoing review of the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995 and the recommendations made by the Policy Commission on Food and Farming.

 <i>[holding answer 21 January 2002]:</i> The enforcement of zoo licensing, and of health and safety standards in zoos, are matters for the relevant local authorities, taking account of advice issued by the Department and the Health and Safety Executive.
<P>

<a name="20125w19.html_para0">In terms of zoo licensing, local authorities must ensure that the zoos in their area have a licence to operate or are exempt from the provisions of the Zoo Licensing Act 1981. All licensed zoos are also subject to regular inspection to ensure that the Secretary of State's Standards on Modern Zoo Practice, which include provisions relating to animal welfare and public safety are being met. The Department has issued guidance to local authorities on the implementation of the 1981 Act and a new circular will be issued shortly to take account of the changes introduced by Council Directive 1999/22/EC on the keeping of wild animals in zoos, which is due to come into force in April.
<P>

<a name="20125w19.html_para1">Guidance on the management of public interaction with zoo animals is also set out in the Secretary of State's Standards of Modern Zoo Practice.

For example, hand-washing facilities must be provided, together with signage reminding the public of hygiene requirements.

 The reform of the sheepmeat regime agreed by the Agriculture Council in December will simplify the regime and make it more flexible. The ewe premium will in future be paid on a flat rate basis, and the introduction of national envelopes provides a valuable mechanism for targeting extra support for the sheep sector and for encouraging environmentally beneficial farming practices.

<P>
<P>

<i>[holding answer 11 January 2001]</i>: The OECD produces annual estimates of agricultural producer support in OECD countries, called producer support estimate (PSE). This includes estimates of the value of support to producers through market support mechanisms as well as through national and EU budgets. Their most recent provisional estimate of PSE for the EU is 98 billion euro for 2000. The OECD does not provide estimates of agricultural producer support for individual countries within the EU, however the following table shows the payments from the EU budget under the Common Agricultural Policy to each member state. These payments include costs that are not directly received by farmers (eg costs of intervention storage), but they do not include payments by national Governments or the value of market price support.

 We are not yet aware of any charges but are in regular contact with the US regarding next steps.

At this stage we do not know whether detainees would be subject to the death penalty if convicted but HMG regularly makes their views plain to the US on this issue.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what action he is taking to reduce the fear of crime in <i>(a)</i> London and <i>(b)</i> the London borough of Havering; and if he will make a statement.  [29472]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20125w22.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 It is a key priority of the Government to reduce crime and the fear of crime through effective law enforcement and partnership working. The British Crime Survey shows that fear of crime generally has been declining since 1998. There are a large number of different programmes operating throughout London and in specific boroughs of London aimed at reducing crime, and it is the Government's policy wherever possible to ensure that they also effectively reduce the fear of crime to include programmes aimed at reducing street robbery, violence at licensed premises and on public transport, and racist attacks and harassment; it would not be practicable to list all relevant programmes currently operating in London.
<P>

<a name="20125w22.html_para4">There are a number of relevant initiatives being carried out in Havering under the Home Office's Crime Reduction Programme. Among them is the targeted Policing Initiative Project aimed at understanding and responding to hate crime; this initiative is still at an early stage of development and has an allocated funding of &#163;287,000 for a 22-month period. Funds have also been 



<P>
<P><I>25 Jan 2002 : Column 1184W</I><P>
allocated for Neighbourhood Wardens; one of the objectives of this scheme is to reduce fear of crime by five per cent. by March 2003. &#163;466,583 has been provided to facilitate new and replacement Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras in the borough, as a result of which over 1,000 crimes are expected to be prevented in the first three years of operation. Funds have also been allocated to tackle drugs problems in the borough, including allowing for higher visibility policing. In addition to these schemes and initiatives 3,000 local people are to be surveyed for their views on fear of crime and their personal priorities for crime reduction. This information will be used to inform decisions on priorities for the Crime Reduction Strategy for Havering.

<a name="20125w22.html_para7">The Government are committed to achieving improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of the Criminal Justice System and is considering Sir Robin Auld's recommendations contained in his "Review of the Criminal Courts" which include removal of the right to elect jury trial and the introduction of an intermediate tribunal.
