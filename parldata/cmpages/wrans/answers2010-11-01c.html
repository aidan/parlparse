 The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) came into existence in 1986. Limited information on the volume of prosecutions for specific offences is captured on the Compass Management Information System. Compass was fully implemented in April 2005 and there are no central records prior to that date. The records show that in the five years ending March 2010 there were 13,282 offences charged under the sections of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which relate to sexual assaults or activity with a child or young person under the age of 16. This figure relates to the age of the victim and not that of the, defendant. Charges for other sexual offences, for example rape, may also involve victims aged 15 years or under but it is not possible to ascertain the age of the victim.</p>

 The Government's expectation that the prison population will be 3,000 fewer by 2014 is based on (a) prison population projections and recent population trends and (b) our new approach to sentencing and rehabilitation which we will outline in a Green Paper later this year, with an accompanying impact assessment.</p>

 The probation budget for 2010-11 is £864 million compared to £894 million 2009-10. Before the new Probation Trust arrangements came into general operation in April 2010, all trusts and potential trusts were required to demonstrate how they would drive down costs and improve performance. There is no evidence that the savings that have been achieved have had any adverse impact on performance, and as such these savings are not expected to adversely impact on the prison population. Internal resource allocations for the spending review 2010 period have not yet been decided, but we have already been clear that a large part of our savings will be achieved through improvements in efficiency and cutting administration.</p>

internal budgets have been set. Preliminary estimates suggest that the Department will lose around 14,000-15,000 posts, including a significant reduction in our headquarters and administrative areas. Preliminary modelling assumptions split the posts between 10,000 in the National Offender Management Service, 3,000 in courts and tribunals services and 1,000-2,000 elsewhere in the Department over the four-year period. Where possible, staff reduction will be through natural turnover and voluntary redundancy, avoiding compulsory redundancies if possible.</p>

considered robust. The National Offender Management Service is currently introducing a new costing system for probation trusts which will collect reliable information on both budgeted and actual expenditure on unpaid work. Budgets for unpaid work are set locally by providers and commissioners and will be determined in the light of the Spending Review settlement. Allocations within the Ministry of Justice to business groups, including the National Offender Management Service, are yet to be decided but will reflect the impact of the forthcoming Green Paper on Sentencing Reform and need to deliver services as efficiently as possible including through the use of the new competition framework for unpaid work.</p>

 We have no targets for the number of community sentences to be imposed over the next four years.

 No. The Coalition Government's spending review provides a fair though challenging settlement for local government. It reflects the clear priorities for the spending review as a whole: to bring down the massive budget deficit and drive economic growth, while protecting the interests of hardworking families and the most vulnerable in society.</p>

 The UK's National Renewable Energy Action Plan, published in July 2010, estimated that onshore wind would contribute 34 TWh and offshore wind would contribute 44 TWh in 2020 towards a projected overall target of 238 TWh. Wind is therefore expected to contribute around a third of the target of 15% of final energy consumption.</p>

 Warm Front continues to provide a range of heating and insulation measures for vulnerable households. The new Energy Company Obligation, starting in late 2012, will run in parallel with the Green Deal programme. It is intended to focus particularly on households who cannot achieve financial savings without additional support, including the poorest and most vulnerable and those in hard to treat homes. We expect energy companies to play a greater role than they do through the current obligations in ensuring the poorest and most vulnerable can afford to heat their homes adequately. This includes offering a wider range of measures which improve energy performance, such as heating systems.</p>

<i> [holding answer 26 October 2010]:</i> The National Lottery Commission has advised that in order to be eligible to play the National Lottery, players must be resident at a United Kingdom or Isle of Man address, irrespective of their tax status. Residency in this instance is determined by checks carried out by Camelot, the National Lottery operator and, in practice, this means members of the armed forces can open an online interactive account and purchase games on the national lottery website, as long as they are in a country where it is legal to do so, and/or set up a direct debit account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="101101w0003.htm_para11"><a name="1011022000362">However, the National Lottery Commission understands that in the majority of overseas jurisdictions, local laws forbid the purchase of other foreign lotteries, including the UK National Lottery. If tickets are purchased from a country where it illegal to do so, the tickets are invalid and Camelot is not able to pay any associated prizes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="101101w0003.htm_para12"><a name="1011022000363">The NLC have therefore required Camelot to amend the rules for National Lottery games so that players will only be able to set up or amend their direct debit, or purchase games online when they are physically located in the UK and the Isle of Man. These new rules will apply from 18 December 2010. I welcome the NLC's intention to prevent people buying invalid tickets and inadvertently putting themselves at risk of prosecution in foreign jurisdictions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="101101w0003.htm_para13"><a name="1011022000364">I shall be writing to the NLC to thank them for their action so far, but I shall also ask them to consider what can be done in countries where the purchase of UK lottery tickets is lawful to allow armed forces personnel (and others) to participate.</p>

 The Overseas Pricing Movements (OPM) Mechanism was abolished by the previous Government as part of the 2007 comprehensive spending review. OPM was originally put in place in order to ensure that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's (FCO) overseas budget was maintained in real terms after foreign exchange rate and differential inflationary pressures overseas. The decision to remove OPM became effective in April 2008. As a result the FCO implemented a foreign currency forward purchase programme to help manage its foreign exchange needs.</p>

In 2009-10 the exchange and inflation rate pressures on our posts' budgets was £80 million and is estimated to be over £100 million in 2010-11.

 The decision to discontinue the medical element of the British Hajj Delegation was taken by Ministers following a Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) review in March 2010. The review did not include consultations with community leaders but, rather, took an objective view of the situation on the ground. The review noted significant improvements to the medical facilities provided for Pilgrims by the Saudi authorities since the British Hajj Delegation first began 11 years ago. It also noted the declining demand for medical assistance for minor ailments from British Hajjis.</p>

The National Standard was developed by cycling organisations, safety bodies (including the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents and Road Safety UK), and the Administrations of the United Kingdom. It represents years of combined experience in providing high-quality, safe, cycle training.

<i> [holding answer 25 October 2010]:</i> The system's in orbit validation (IOV) phase was initially funded through contributions to the European Space Agency (ESA). The UK has provided €240.3 million to Galileo through its contributions to ESA. Funding to ESA is provided on a <i> juste retour</i> basis, meaning that contracts equivalent to a member state's contribution less administration costs should be awarded to companies from within the member state.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="101101w0004.htm_para15"><a name="1011022001247">The subsequent work required to complete the Galileo system is funded from the core EU budget to which all member states contribute. The UK contributes to the EU budget as a whole, not to individual programmes within it. The level of UK contribution depends on a number of factors, and varies from year to year. As a rough indication, the UK's pre-abatement contribution to the 2010 budget is currently estimated at 14%. The UK's contribution to the EU budget from 2014 onwards will be decided during the forthcoming negotiations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="101101w0004.htm_para16"><a name="1011022001248">The EU budget allocation to complete the system was set at €3.405 billion in 2007. Four of the six work package contracts necessary to complete the system have been let and orders placed for items such as satellites, and the remaining contracts should be signed in the near future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="101101w0004.htm_para17"><a name="1011022001249">The European Commission has not yet set out its proposal for the exploitation phase covering the operation, maintenance, marketing, improvement and renewal of the system from 2014 onwards. The Commission is required to undertake a feasibility study of the advantages and disadvantages of the use of contracts with private sector entities as part of this process since that may save public funds. The Commission's proposal may be made with the programme's mid-term review which the Commission is legally required to undertake in 2010.</p>

 The interests of the students, part time and full time, are always the main concern for the Government and the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) when an institution is in difficulty. HEFCE operates a support strategy and has a track record of managed transition that has successfully protected the interests of students over a long period. The Government are considering the report of the Browne review at present and agrees that students will need to be protected as the HE system moves towards a different funding model.</p>

 We have no reliable basis to make such estimates. HEFCE-funded student places are allocated in full-time equivalent terms with the mix of students between full-time and part-time courses being an institutional decision. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) will receive its annual grant letter for 2011-12 by January 2011. It will set out the number of funded places for that year. Plans for the longer term will be set out in the Higher Education White Paper this winter. We share Lord Browne's conclusion that we should extend the exemption from upfront fees to part-time students who have been unfairly discriminated against hitherto.</p>

They sign to say that they have read and understood the booklet, "Student Loans; a guide to Terms and Conditions". This booklet clearly states that it provides information about the current terms of the loan and repayment and the regulations may change from time to time and this means the terms of the loan may also change.</p>

1. Finished Consultant Episode (FCE)<br>
A finished consultant episode (FCE) is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.<br>
2. Method of Admission<br>
We have defined non-elective admissions by the following admission method codes:<br>
21: Emergency-via A and E services, including casualty department of provider<br>
22: Emergency-via General Practitioner (GP)<br>
23: Emergency-via Bed Bureau, including Central Bureau<br>
24: Emergency-via consultant out-patient clinic<br>
28: Emergency-other means, including patients who arrive via A and E department of another HC provider<br>
31: Maternity-where baby was delivered after mother's admission<br>
32: Maternity-where baby was delivered before mother's admission<br>
81: Transfer of any admitted patient from another hospital provider<br>
82: Other-babies born in HC provider<br>
83: Other-babies born outside HC provider, except when born at home as intended<br>
98: Not applicable (e.g. other maternity event)<br>
99: Not known<br>
3. Main procedure<br>
The first recorded procedure or intervention in each episode, usually the most resource intensive procedure or intervention performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main procedure when looking at admission details, (e.g. time waited), but a more complete count of episodes with a particular procedure is obtained by looking at the main and the secondary procedures.<br>
4. Consultant Main Specialty<br>
The specialty under which the consultant responsible for the care of the patient at that time is registered. Take care when analysing HES data by specialty, or by groups of specialties (such as "acute"). Trusts have different ways of managing specialties and attributing codes so it is better to analyse by specific diagnoses, operations or other patient or service information.<br>
Main speciality of obstetrics<br>
501-Obstetrics for patients using a hospital bed or delivery facilities<br>
5. Hospital Provider<br>
A provider code is a unique code that identifies an organisation acting as a health care provider (e.g. NHS trust or PCT). Hospital providers can also include treatment centres (TC). Normally, if data are tabulated by health care provider, the figure for an NHS trust gives the activity of all the sites as one aggregated figure. However, in the case of those with embedded treatment centres, this data is quoted separately. In these cases, '-X' is appended to the code for the rest of the trust, to remind users that the figures are for all sites of the trust excluding the treatment centres. The quality of TC returns are such that data may not be complete. Some NHS trusts have not registered their TC as a separate site, and it is therefore not possible to identify their activity separately. Data from some independent sector providers, where the onus for arrangement of dataflows is on the commissioner, may be missing. Care must be taken when using these data as the counts Small numbers<br>
To protect patient confidentiality, figures between one and five have been replaced with "*" (an asterisk). Where it was still possible to identify numbers from the total an additional number (the next smallest) has been replaced.<br>
Data quality<br>
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>

 In order to support the implementation of the National Stroke Strategy, the Department provided funding over the last three years to train more stroke specialist physicians. Central funding has been provided for the training of 26 junior doctors and a further tranche will undergo training this year. It is for local national health service organisations to plan and deliver a workforce appropriate to the needs of their local population based on clinical need and sound evidence.</p>

 The Accelerating Stroke Improvement Programme, which is supported by the Department, the Stroke Improvement Programme and the stroke networks, is aimed at making further improvements across the stroke care pathway including concentrating effort on the introduction of high quality, early supported discharge across the country so that all stroke survivors who can benefit have access to it. The Accelerating Stroke Improvement Programme was developed in response to Committee of Public Accounts report, "Progress In Improving Stroke Care", which concluded, among other things, that not enough hospitals arrange early supported discharge for stroke patients, even though it provides better outcomes for many patients and can save money.</p>

Each episode is only counted once, even if the diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.  <sup>(3)</sup> Activity in English national health service hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.  <sup>(4)</sup> Counts for the different diagnoses shown are not necessarily mutually exclusive and therefore summing the different diagnoses is not possible (e.g. a patient may have a DVT and a PE in a single episode, and would be counted once in each relevant column-double counting would occur if the values were summed).  <sup>(5 )</sup>Diagnosis is recorded in HES using ICD-10 codes. ICD-10 code I80.2 is used for a diagnosis of DVT where there is no further information on the site of the thrombosis. However DVT may also be recorded under a number of different codes, although these codes may also include cases which are not considered deep. The full list of relevant ICD-10 codes is as follows: I80.0 Phlebitis and thrombophlebitis of superficial vessels of lower extremities I80.1 Phlebitis and thrombophlebitis of femoral vein I80.2 Phlebitis and thrombophlebitis of other deep vessels of lower extremities I80.3 Phlebitis and thrombophlebitis of lower extremities, unspecified I80.8 Phlebitis and thrombophlebitis of other sites I80.9 Phlebitis and thrombophlebitis of unspecified site O22.2 Superficial thrombophlebitis in pregnancy O22.3 Deep phlebothrombosis in pregnancy O87.0 Superficial thrombophlebitis in the puerperium O87.1 Deep phlebothrombosis in the puerperium.  <sup>(6)</sup> Pulmonary embolisms are coded as I26.0 (Pulmonary embolism with mention of acute cor pulmonale) and I26.9 (Pulmonary embolism without mention of acute cor pulmonale).  <sup>(7)</sup> Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and so no longer included in admitted patient HES data.  <i> Source:</i>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care.<br>

 It is for Departments to decide how to best prioritise resources within their departmental expenditure limits. The regional consequences will only become apparent once these decisions have been made. Government spending is determined by criteria that includes spatial aspects, but is dominated by deprivation and demand. Therefore the impact of the spending review is best measured by income distribution. This was included for the first time in the SR document, and can be found in Annex B of the document or online at</p>

For example HMRC have already this October stopped issuing replacement national insurance cards and have said that from 2011 they will be issuing all national insurance numbers to people by letter rather than providing a plastic card, saving the Government up to £1 million a year in upfront costs.</p>
