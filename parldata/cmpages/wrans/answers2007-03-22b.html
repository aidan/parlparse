 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the average time was between final refusal and deportation for asylum seekers who exhausted all avenues of appeal in the latest period for which figures are available. [110846]</p>

 Since the abolition of embarkation controls in 1994 we can not assess with any certainty the numbers of people who remain in the UK. In this context it is very difficult to provide an accurate average time it may take to remove those who have no right to remain here.</p>

 The answer is as follows:</p>

Over a 10 year period, enforcement costs were estimated at &#163;34 million.

To assist the customer in these instances, Jobcentre Plus can offer special interview arrangements at a more suitable Jobcentre Plus site. Customers have the option, and some do choose, to travel for longer than one hour to attend an interview. Travelling time rather than distance is the measure under which the suitability of the appointment is determined as this takes into account local transport arrangements.

 The Department aims to answer parliamentary questions within the timescales set by Parliament. For the early part of the 2006-07 session, the Department trialled an informal system of colour coding parliamentary questions to help improve internal processes for answering parliamentary questions. No formal guidance was issued on the operation of the system, nor was any information systematically collected on the number of questions colour coded as a result. The Department has subsequently decided to discontinue the trial.</p>

 Evidence from the pathfinder local housing allowance evaluation to date, suggests those claimants who are paid their benefit directly are more likely to report that they are looking for work and the proportion of claimants paid directly has increased from 50 per cent. to 84 per cent. Increased financial inclusion can improve work readiness and 91 per cent. of tenants have a bank or building society account, with around a quarter of claimants saying they opened an account because of the local housing allowance. Additionally, the transparency of the local housing allowance is reported to make discussions about work between advisers and claimants easier. Some of these effects of the local housing allowance, such as increased financial inclusion, will take time to impact on claimant behaviour.</p>

 The latest quarterly progress report issued by the Government of Afghanistan (GoA)states that the Ministry of Energy and Water, in partnership with various donors and governments, has made considerable strides since 2003 to rehabilitate the provision of electricity throughout Afghanistan. It is estimated that 15 per cent. of the population now has access to some electrical power. This includes approximately 378,700 urban and rural households, 33,500 commercial establishments and 5,300 government institutions. However, access remains poor and is often unreliable. Furthermore, figures should be treated with caution as there are serious limitations in ability to measure some of the statistics. DFID is not directly engaged in this sector. Lead donors are the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.</p>

The programme is focused on the rehabilitation of the south east power system (SEPS), a 100 MW power generation and transmission network. It aims to provide low cost and reliable power to 1.7 million residents in Helmand and Kandahar provinces by the end of 2009. Central to this initiative is a commitment to rehabilitate the Kajaki multi-purpose dam, built by USAID in 1953 on the Helmand river.</p>

 I met President Moreno of the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) twice in the last year, in April 2006 at the IADB annual meetings held in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, and in June 2006 in London.

On each occasion I confirmed our support for the President's reorganisation of the Bank, which DFID has been supporting, his work to help borrowing member countries in the Latin American and Caribbean region tackle poverty, inequality and respond to climate change, and work to improve the Bank's performance in making lending available to small enterprises.

The UK has strongly supported the IADB providing additional debt relief to these HIPCs, but we are concerned about the way the deal is structured and the lack of additional financing for MDGs.</p>

 DFID does not have a bilateral programme in Lebanon. However the UK responded to the humanitarian crisis last year by contributing &#163;22.3 million at the international donors&#146; conference in Stockholm in August 2006. This money was allocated to humanitarian relief (logistics, food, water, sanitation) delivered through aid agencies (e.g. Red Cross, United Nations (UN)); munitions clearance; bridging (providing and transporting temporary bridges to Lebanon) and funding that is channelled through multilateral funds, e.g. the UN&#146;s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and the European Commission (EC).</p>

On top of the &#163;1.5 million we had already committed to clearance of unexploded mines, we made available a further &#163;1.2 million to the UN Mines Action Service (UNMAS) and the Mines Advisory Group (MAG) for further munitions clearance work in Lebanon. This means DFID&#146;s total contribution to munitions clearance is now close to &#163;2.8 million.

 The Local Government Act 2000 provides that all decisions in the authority are the responsibility of the executive unless otherwise provided for in regulations made under that Act.

<i> [holding answer 7 February 2007]:</i> There are currently over 3,800 extended schools in England. This includes 18 extended schools in the Coventry local authority area (15 primary and three secondary).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_407"><a name="70322w0017.htm_para10"><a name="0703237000153">All these schools are providing a core offer of extended services. This is comprised of a varied menu of study support activities and high quality child care 8 am to 6 pm all year round in primary schools. These services will be provided on the school site or in partnership with local private, voluntary and independent providers. They will also offer parenting support; swift and easy referral to a wide range of specialist support services such as health and social care; and wider community access to ICT, sports and arts facilities, on the school site including adult learning.</p>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
Finished in-year admissions.<br>
A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the data year. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<i> PCT and SHA data quality</i><br>
PCT and SHA data was added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>
<i> All diagnoses count of episodes</i><br>
These figures represent a count of all finished in year admission episodes where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in a HES record.<br>
<i> Diagnosis (primary diagnosis)</i><br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>
<i> Secondary diagnoses</i><br>
As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (6 prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>
Alcohol related diagnoses: ICD-10 codes<br>
F10 Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol;<br>
K70 Alcoholic liver disease;<br>
T51 Toxic effect of alcohol<br>
<i> Data quality</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS PCTs in England. The Information Centre for Health and Social Care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>

1. Finished in-year admissions<br>
A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the data-year. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
PCT and SHA data were added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment are poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of GP practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 are also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>
2. All diagnoses count of episodes<br>
These figures represent a count of all finished in year admission episodes where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in a HES record.<br>
3. Data quality<br>
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS Trusts and Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
4. Ungrossed data<br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment she has made of the effectiveness of information and communication technologies infrastructure in the prison medical service with regard to the clinical information and support available; and what assessment she has made of the effectiveness of such infrastructure as compared to that available to doctors working in <i> (a)</i> general practice and <i> (b)</i> elsewhere within the NHS.

 Our overall aim is to ensure that national health service professionals working with offenders have access to similar clinical information systems and services as those in the rest of the NHS in order to improve the quality of patient care and support system reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_462"><a name="70322w0023.htm_para3"><a name="0703237001587">The great majority of health professionals working in prisons have no specialist information management and technology support, and the task of developing and providing prison establishments with appropriate clinical information technology (IT) hardware and software has always been recognised as an integral corollary of the transfer of health care responsibility from the Home Office to this Department from April 2006. Within the Department, the provision of strategic IT systems is undertaken by the NHS Connecting for Health (NHS CfH) agency as a part of the wider national programme for IT in the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_463"><a name="70322w0023.htm_para4"><a name="0703237001588">Planning is under way to extend compliant primary care systems to support prison healthcare. Mental health and limited secondary care functionality will be added at a later date as applications become available. The first practical step to achieving this goal is in the form of providing the necessary connectivity to the N3 network in the prison estate. This has two aspects: providing broadband connections to prison establishments, and developing a network infrastructure within establishments. In December 2006, &#163;3 million was specifically allocated through strategic health authorities to enhance prison health care IT infrastructure, with the majority of work due to complete this month. NHS CfH is liaising with the prison service and primary care trusts to oversee implementation of this phase of the programme, based on local costed plans.</p>
