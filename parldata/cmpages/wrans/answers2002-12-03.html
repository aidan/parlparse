<P>
<P>
<a name="21203w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 We remain extremely concerned about these sentences. During her visit to Nigeria in September the Minister responsible for Africa, my noble Friend the Baroness Amos, raised with President Obasanjo HMG's concerns about the harsh sentences imposed under the Sharia penal codes, including that of stoning for adultery. She emphasised the strength of feeling against them in the UK and reiterated HMG's opposition to the death penalty in all circumstances.
<P>

<a name="21203w01.html_para4">The British High Commission in Abuja, together with EU partners, follows all such cases closely and keeps in close contact with local human rights organisations. The High Commission regularly raises our concerns about the sentences with the appropriate authorities.
<P>

<a name="21203w01.html_para5">The Federal Government has made clear its opposition to the extreme Sharia penalties. It has declared them discriminatory and unconstitutional. Exercise of the Sharia penal code is, however, entirely under the control of the relevant States. The Federal justice system only comes into play if the defendant appeals to the Federal Appeal Courts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21203w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 We take all human rights violations seriously and regularly raise our concerns with the Pakistani authorities. We are working with our EU partners on a comprehensive demarche to the new Pakistani administration on the human rights situation in Pakistan. Experience suggests that concerted action is the most effective way of putting pressure on the Pakistani authorities. We have meanwhile been working with our partners to collate the facts on this and other cases with a view to their inclusion in the demarche. As a result, no formal representations about Ms Siddique have yet been made.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21203w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The FCO has a long-standing commitment in promoting international sustainable development based on the outcome of the earth summit held in Rio in 1992. The FCO has been very actively involved in the WSSD process and is now working intensively with our international partners to ensure that the impressive range of commitments agreed at the summit are effectively implemented. WSSD outcomes and first views on follow-up will be reflected in the annual report on UK progress on sustainable development for 2002.
<P>

<a name="21203w01.html_para6">The FCO is focused on achieving high levels of sustainability in its own operations. It has had a programme in place for some time that is designed to respond to the sustainable development challenges confirmed at WSSD. The FCO is therefore committed to meeting the targets being set out in the XFramework for Sustainable Development on the Government Estate". This framework is designed to ensure Government operations contribute positively to the UK's sustainable development headline indicators. These targets are being applied to the whole of the FCO's UK estate, although timescales may vary depending upon the location and nature of the site. We have a specific SDA target of achieving efficiencies from the existing energy target of reducing carbon emissions by an ongoing 1 per cent. per annum.

<i>[holding answer 2 December 2002]:</i> We are concerned at Turkmen Government actions aimed at restricting the activities of religious groups. We regularly monitor reports from Turkmenistan and meet representatives of religious groups, such as Jehovah's Witnesses and Christian Solidarity Worldwide, to discuss the situation in the country.
<P>

<a name="21203w01.html_para9">Senior UK officials have discussed the repression of human rights in central Asia with representatives from other countries (including Russia and Turkey). Together with EU and US colleagues, we use every opportunity to raise cases of religious persecution with the Turkmen Government, and we believe our representations helped to secure the release of the Baptist, Atakov. Most recently, our Ambassador wrote to the Turkmen Foreign Minister on 1 November requesting the release of religious and other prisoners.

 Targets in respect of the Government's support for biomass are generally linked to the potential to contribute to climate change savings and the implications for the rural economy. In the energy crops scheme, part of the England Rural Development Programme, we have funding of &pound;29 million which could see around 20,000 hectares of crops planted. Each hectare of biomass crops yielding the equivalent of 8 tonnes per annum will save 2 tonnes of carbon per annum.

<i>[holdilng answer 2 December 20002]:</i> Developing a bovine TB vaccine is a long-term aim. The Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISO) has cautioned that such a vaccine is a potential policy option only in the longer term and has set up, this year, a Vaccine Scoping Study. A report is expected to be submitted to Ministers early in 2003 on the feasibility of pursuing a vaccination strategy.
<P>

<a name="21203w02.html_para5">A test which is able to distinguish vaccinated from infected cattle would be a great asset in the development of a vaccination strategy. Development of such a test is part of our wide-ranging research programme. Once a test has been developed we would need to approach the European Union to seek its acceptance of the new test as showing cattle to be free from the disease. This would require a change to European law.

The 2001&#150;02 figure includes around &pound;0.4 million in development grants from the new Community Energy programme, most of which benefits CHP. In the current financial year, &pound;3.3 million of capital grants from the programme have been approved to date.<P>

<a name="21203w02.html_para9">In addition, the Carbon Trust receives around &pound;50 million per annum in total from which it provides direct support for CHP through its ActionEnergy Scheme and for research, development and demonstration of CHP through the Low Carbon Innovation Programme.
<P>

<a name="21203w02.html_para10">Several indirect measures of support for the CHP industry were also introduced in 2001&#150;02. Of those that can be enumerated, climate change levy exemption on fuel inputs to Good Quality CHP and Good Quality CHP electricity outputs were valued at up to &pound;90 million, while eligibility for Enhanced Capital Allowances is worth in the region of &pound;10 million per annum to the industry. In addition, CHP is one of the measures that operators who are participants in Climate Change Agreements are encouraged to use to meet their targets and therefore qualify for the 80 per cent. reduction in Climate Change Levy.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether the EU decision to abstain in respect of the vote at the CITES meeting in Santiago, relating to whether to allow elephant ivory stockpile sales by Namibia, Botswana and South Africa, reflected the position the UK Government advocated in its discussions with EU partners prior to the vote.  [83382]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21203w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr Morley </B> 
<i> [holding answer 27 November 2002]: </i>At the meeting of the Environment Council on 17 October member states agreed that the Community was unwilling to agree to a resumption in commercial ivory trade unless it was satisfied, following consultation with all range states, that there would be no resulting increase in illegal killing of elephants and no unfavourable impact on the conservation of elephant populations. The Community would continue to support the cooperation of range states to this effect.
<P>

<a name="21203w03.html_para0">In Santiago the UK supported the EU view that the initial set of proposals put forward by the range states did not meet these criteria for a resumption in commercial ivory trade. Following a meeting between representatives of range states and the EU, a revised set of proposals was prepared which sought only a one-off sale, subject to strict conditions which must be fulfilled before the sale could go ahead.
<P>

<a name="21203w03.html_para1">On these, the EU agreed to abstain because it was clear that there was no prospect of achieving an agreed view, even on qualified majority voting, to support or oppose the revised proposal. The UK does not believe that the necessary conditions are currently in place, even for a one-off sale. However, if the strict requirements of the agreement (which include a minimum 18-month delay, strict control of the market, stringent monitoring requirements and a condition that the proceeds of any sale are used solely for the benefit of elephant conservation) are met in full and verified, we believe that this agreement strikes the right balance between meeting the legitimate expectations of the southern African states that they should be able to engage in sustainable utilisation of their natural resources, whilst establishing strict controls to secure the conservation of wider elephant populations, as envisaged in the Environment Council decision.

<a name="21203w04.html_para4">The results of analysis for veterinary medicine residues are presented in Table 2. The Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) of DEFRA runs two surveillance schemes that look for residues of authorised veterinary medicines and banned substances in UK produced and imported foods. Samples of organic produce are included in the surveillance, but the results have not been kept separately. The Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) for residues of veterinary medicines are set on an EU-wide basis. Substances not authorised for use will not have an MRL. For such compounds and also for approved substances without an MRL for a particular tissue, an 'Action Level' is applied; this is normally that any confirmed residue is reported.
<P>

<a name="21203w04.html_para5">All of the results, highlighting any exceedances of MRLs and Action Levels, are published quarterly in the VMD's newsletter. They have been published annually 



<P>
<P><I>3 Dec 2002 : Column 658W</I><P>
in the VMD's annual report and accounts up to 1994, in a dedicated VMD report on surveillance for veterinary residues between 1995 and 2000, and in the veterinary residues committee's annual report on surveillance for veterinary residues in 2001.

</FONT>

<P>

<a name="21203w04.html_para8">For pesticide residues, MRLs are maximum residue levels. These are intended primarily as a check that pesticides are being used correctly and to assist international trade in treated produce. Maximum residue levels for pesticide residues are not safety limits, and exposure to pesticide residues in excess of a maximum residue level does not necessarily imply a risk to health.
<P>

<a name="21203w04.html_para9">For veterinary residues, MRLs are maximum residue limits. For veterinary medicines, they are statutory limits&#151;if any tissue from an animal presented for slaughter is found to contain a residue above the maximum residue limit, an offence may have been committed. In Europe, the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products (CVMP), part of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency, sets MRLs. Because of the way veterinary MRLs are set, exposure to a residue over the MRL is in itself not necessarily a cause for concern. The VMD take toxicological advice from the Food Standards Agency where residues over the relevant MRL or actions levels are detected.

 The Bermuda II agreement allows the UK to designate only two airlines to operate from Heathrow to the US, and British Airways and Virgin Atlantic are the designated UK airlines. We have put proposals to the US for the full liberalisation of the UK-US aviation market, but these have not been accepted. More recently, we put proposals to the US Government for a partial liberalisation of the market, which would have allowed bmi British Midland to operate a limited number of Heathrow-US services, but the US felt unable to accept them either. We are currently considering whether a further proposal should be made.

 An applicant for a heavy goods vehicle operating licence must advertise the details of the application in a local newspaper circulating in the locality of a proposed operating centre and send a copy of the advertisement to the Traffic Commissioner. A Traffic Commissioner must satisfy himself that this meets the requirements. If not, he must refuse the application.

A number of initiatives are being pursued. These include the Traffic Control Centre project that will provide advice to motorists about travel conditions on the trunk road network, allowing them to plan their journeys more effectively to avoid congestion.

<a name="21203w07.html_para6">The Department for Transport has monitored trunk road and motorway speeds in 1995, 1998 and 2001. Surveys show that while, in general, overall speeds have fallen since 1995, average speeds on motorways were 2.5 mph faster in 2001 in the morning peak period when compared to the equivalent speeds in the 1998 survey. In the evening peak, they were 3.3 mph faster.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21203w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The recent amendment to the MARPOL Convention agreed in the International Maritime Organization, and implemented within the EU by regulation No. 417/2002, has just come into effect. Single hull tankers having no additional protection, such as the Prestige, must be phased out in order of age between 2003 and 2007. Single hull tankers fitted with partial protection must be phased out in order of age between 2003 and 2015. Each category of single hull tanker will have to satisfy an additional requirement for a rigorous condition assessment survey to be able to operate after 2005 and 2010 respectively. The use of waters of EU member states is regulated in accordance with compliance with the United Conventions on the Law of the Sea.

<P>

 There is no evidence that reducing the size of oil tankers would lead to an overall improvement in safety. The implication of using smaller tankers is that more voyages would be needed to carry the same volume of oil and related cargoes.

 We are not aware of a particular problem (e.g. of abandonment) in respect of the very small number of unregistered vehicles in the UK. However, we are aware of the considerable problem of unlicensed vehicles.
<P>

<a name="21203w09.html_para6">Local authorities have various powers to deal with abandoned vehicles. Among these will be a number that are also unlicensed and in determining whether a vehicle is abandoned, the absence of a tax disc may be a significant, but not the only factor. Section 4 of the Refuse Disposal (Amenity) Act 1978 Act provides that a local authority may destroy a vehicle immediately which is in their custody and on which no current vehicle excise licence (tax disc) was displayed at the time of its removal.
<P>

<a name="21203w09.html_para7">Although local authorities have however, no general power to deal with unlicensed vehicles as such, powers now exist for the Driver Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA) to devolve its powers of enforcement in dealing with unlicensed vehicles to local authorities wishing to use them. To date six local authorities have been given devolved powers to clamp and impound unlicensed vehicles on behalf of the Secretary of State. These are the London Boroughs of Croydon, Lewisham, Newham and Wandsworth, together with Hastings and Southend-on-Sea borough councils.
<P>

<a name="21203w09.html_para8">These councils seek authorisation from DVLA to clamp any unlicensed vehicles. If the vehicle is not claimed after 24 hours it is removed to a secure vehicle compound. The vehicles are kept in the compound for a minimum of 7 days to allow DVLA to write to the registered keeper informing them of the whereabouts of the vehicle and what steps they will need to take to reclaim the vehicle. If the vehicle still remains unclaimed, DVLA will give authorisation for the vehicle to be disposed of, this is usually by crushing.

 The amount lost to the exchequer as a result of a failure by individuals correctly to declare their business profits can only be estimated. Lord Grabiner in his report XThe Informal Economy" concluded that it was impractical to arrive at a precise figure but assumed that 'billions of pounds' of income was a realistic figure.

<a name="21203w11.html_para0">No specific figures are available as to the amounts lost in respect of either tax or national insurance contributions. However, the Inland Revenue annual report for the year ended 31 March 2001 showed that compliance activity by the Inland Revenue had identified additional tax and National Insurance liability of just under &pound;4.5 billion.

<a name="21203w11.html_para3">The Department for Education and Skills will be running pilots to test possible approaches in 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 at a cost of 5 million and &pound;10 million respectively. This initiative will provide young people in all areas of England, including deprived areas, with experience of enterprise, and encourage them to consider starting their own businesses in the future. Young people wishing to start their own businesses in deprived areas will also benefit from our measures to support enterprise and tackle market failures in these areas more generally. These measures include designating 2,000 Enterprise Areas in the most deprived areas in the UK, where policies to support businesses are now being concentrated. Businesses in these areas already benefit from an exemption from stamp duty on property transfers between 60,000 and 150,000. We have announced that we will remove stamp duty on all commercial transactions in those areas, introduce a more flexible planning regime and a tax credit to encourage community investment, and offer greater support from the Small Business Service and the Inland Revenue.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21203w11.html_spnew6"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 At the award stage, the proposed new directive makes it clear that contracting authorities are able to use environmental criteria where these are justified by the subject of the contract and provide a benefit to the contracting authority. Such criteria can include whole life cost factors, such as energy usage, disposal costs, and recyclability, as well as those related to qualitative aspects of the product. However, it will often be more appropriate and sensible to take environmental issues into account earlier on in the procurement process, in defining the subject of the contract and the specification. There is much scope to do this, provided that such specifications do not discriminate against suppliers across the Community, and that buyers respect the rules in the directives on technical specifications. Contracting authorities can, for example, specify green production processes (eg timber from sustainable sources, recycled paper, green electricity etc) and can refer to relevant eco-label criteria. Contracting authorities can also define one or more variants to the standard specification to allow, for example, bids to be submitted which offer a higher environmental performance.

<a name="21203w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The UK with eight other countries signed the Charter of the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) in July 2001. The initiative foresaw a need for advanced nuclear energy systems in the future to help meet growing international demands for carbon free energy; and that to meet public concerns, future systems must meet exceptionally high standards of safety, sustainability and proliferation resistance, while operating economically in liberalised markets. The aim is to develop a framework for collaborative R&D to facilitate the deployment of such advanced reactor systems from 2030 and beyond. The GIF meeting in Tokyo in September 2002 agreed a XRoadmap" for R&D development based on six systems selected as best satisfying these goals. Further information is available from the following website -http://energY.gov/HOPress/releases02/scppr/GIFupdate.pdf

 All United Kingdom service personnel are trained to decontaminate themselves, their personal equipment and in some cases the equipment they operate. In addition, on Royal Navy ships and at Royal Air Force bases, teams can be formed to undertake decontamination as required to sustain operations. The Joint Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Regiment maintains three decontamination troops whose primary role is to decontaminate the regiment's equipment but who could also provide a capability for other units. Two of these troops are drawn from the Royal Yeomanry, a Territorial Army unit.

 The Defence Export Services Organisation is an integral part of the Ministry of Defence. Support to United Kingdom defence exports is an Additional Target in the Public Service Agreement 2000 and MOD's performance is formally monitored via the performance reporting system. The Head of Defence Export Services and his staff report frequently to Defence Ministers, who are often involved personally in supporting UK defence exporters in their overseas markets.

This ensures the degree of operational flexibility necessary for local services to respond to such emergencies, taking account of specific local needs. These organisations act within a framework of well established guidelines produced by central Government and professional bodies such as the Association of Chief Police Officers, in order to ensure effective co-ordination and consistency of approach.

 Each medical syndrome comprises a set of physical signs and/or symptoms that distinguishes it from other medical conditions. As a group, Gulf veterans have reported more ill-health than other comparable groups. The pattern of their ill- health is not unique but they have reported symptoms with greater frequency and of more severity than those in comparable groups. Some Gulf veterans have recognised medical conditions, but a large number of non-specific, multi-system, medically unexplained symptoms have also been reported. The consensus of the 



<P>
<P><I>3 Dec 2002 : Column 694W</I><P>
international scientific and medical community is that this diversity of symptoms means that ill-health among Gulf veterans cannot be characterised as a unique Gulf related illness or syndrome. The Ministry of Defence's approach must be guided by medical science and so does not recognise XGulf War Syndrome" as a medical condition and has no working definition of such a syndrome.

In England and Wales there were 38 prosecutions for refusal to complete and return a census form. There were no prosecutions in the Derby North constituency. Scotland and Northern Ireland conducted their own Censuses and the prosecution for refusal to complete and return a census form was the responsibility of the respective Registrars General.
<BR>
The Office for National Statistics followed a policy of only prosecuting in cases where it had obtained clear and sufficient documentary evidence of a refusal to return a completed Census form. Particular attention was given to those reported cases where refusals were accompanied by acts of intimidation towards field staff.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister (1) what effect the abolition of section 24(3) of the Housing Act 1985 as it relates to England will have on the level of public sector and regulated rents; what the Government's rent restructuring policy is; and what the effect will be on the landlord's ability to repair property subject to regulated rent where rent increases are held below the rate of inflation;  [84431]
<P>
<UL>(2) whether the Government plans to set up a rent restructuring authority; [84429]
<P>
(3) what assessment he has made of the impact that the changes proposed to the Social Security Administration Act 1992, relating to the rent rebate subsidy limitation on those local authorities where housing rents are above a certain level as described on page 41 of the explanatory memorandum of the Local Government Bill; and based on the present criteria, how many more affordable houses could potentially be built if all rents were allowed to rise to market levels;  [84430]
<P>
(4) what reason the Government is seeking to repeal subsection 7 of section 140B of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 to give him additional powers to determine the level of rent rebate subsidy, rent allowance subsidy and council tax benefit subsidy; and whether local authorities will be required to provide information on these subsidies to the <i>(a)</i> ODPM and <i>(b)</i> Department of Work and Pensions.  [84432]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21203w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Government's rent restructuring policy aims to achieve a more coherent and fairer structure of social rents, while keeping rents affordable and well below market levels. Over the next ten years, social landlords are being encouraged to move their rents towards a common rents formula, which links rents to relative property values, local manual earnings levels, and property sizes.
<P>

<a name="21203w17.html_para0">We believe that the arrangements are fair both to landlords and tenants. We shall be reviewing the implementation of rent restructuring after three years. We have no proposals for a rent restructuring authority. The level of social sector rents is a matter for local authorities and registered social landlords, taking account of rent restructuring policies.
<P>

<a name="21203w17.html_para1">The effective repeal of Section 24(3) of the Housing Act 1985 in England is not expected to have any significant effect on the level of public sector rents. Section 24(3) applies only to local authorities and requires them to have regard, when setting their rents, to the pattern of private sector rents. This might, towards the end of the ten year rent restructuring period, have impacted marginally on an authority's ability to set rents in line with the rents formula.
<P>

<a name="21203w17.html_para2">The changes proposed in the Local Government Bill to the Social Security Administration Act 1992 will not affect the policy of rent rebate subsidy limitation, which will continue to operate in line with our rent restructuring policy as now.
<P>

<a name="21203w17.html_para3">The repeal to subsection 7 of section 1406 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 would not confer any additional powers on my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister. This subsection made unclear the true extent of my rt. hon Friend the Deputy Prime Minister's powers in relation to determining subsidies and we believe it should be repealed. Authorities will be required to provide information to the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) in relation to rent allowance subsidy and council tax subsidy. In relation to rent rebate subsidy, and in particular rent rebate subsidy limitation, authorities may be required to submit information to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in England (ODPM), or the National Assembly in Wales (NAW), who could pass this information to the DWP along with representations as to the form of rent rebate subsidy limitation formulae. This would be possible as an alternative to requiring authorities to send that information directly to the DWP. It is not intended that authorities should have to provide the same information to both the DWP and the ODPM/ NAW.

[84412]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21203w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Local housing authorities have produced housing strategies for a number of years although they are currently non-statutory.
<P>

<a name="21203w18.html_para0">Existing guidance emphasises the need for authorities to demonstrate robust links with relevant strategies such as Homelessness Strategies. The new framework for housing-related plans will give councils the flexibility to combine their housing and homelessness strategies and other related strategies in a single document, where this suits local circumstances. The Local Government Bill does not change the provisions in the 2002 Act which relate to the objectives which may be included in an authority's homelessness strategy.
<P>

<a name="21203w18.html_para1">Existing guidance also stresses the importance of involving stakeholders in the development of the strategy, including residents, partner organisations and members. However it is up to local authorities to decide the appropriate arrangements according to their local circumstances. Of course, if the authority chooses to incorporate the homelessness strategy in the broader housing strategy the duties under the Homelessness Act relating to consultation and involvement of other bodies would still apply.

 Clause 75 of the Bill will allow billing authorities in England to reduce or end council tax discounts for classes of dwellings prescribed in regulations. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister hopes to produce a draft of regulations defining such a class of long term empty homes in time for the Commons' Committee consideration of this clause. The precise wording has still to be decided. We intend, however, to define empty homes as vacant dwellings which are not exempt from council tax. A dwelling is vacant if no-one lives in it and it is substantially unfurnished.
<P>

<a name="21203w18.html_para3">The provisions contained in the Local Government Bill will not impose any additional checks to those which local authorities already have to undertake to establish whether a domestic property is empty or not for the purposes of the existing 50 per cent. council tax discount for long term empty homes, or for the council tax exemptions for empty homes. Just as billing authorities will have to act compatibly with the Convention rights in investigating whether a dwelling is vacant for the purposes of the council tax, they will have to act compatibly with Convention rights in making any further use of the data as will be permitted by clause 85.

 To date, seven one-off payments have been made. In 1999&#150;2000 &pound;20.99 million was paid to Burnley. In 2000&#150;01 payments were made to Coventry (&pound;111.68 million) Calderdale (&pound;64.59 million) and Blackburn with Darwen (&pound;78.9 million). In 2002&#150;03 payments have been made to St. Helens (&pound;87.2 million), Redcar and Cleveland (&pound;25.4 million) and Knowsley (&pound;126.13 million).
<P>

<a name="21203w18.html_para4">Resources required by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to meet commitments arising under clause 40 and 41 of the draft Local Government Bill will depend on the local authorities seeking to transfer their housing in any particular year. The resources are classified as Annually Managed Expenditure and as such are drawn down on an annual basis. Provision for 2003&#150;04 is currently &pound;616 million, and all payments would go to the Public Works Loans Commissioners. Provision for future years will relate to the 2003 transfer programme onward, for which applications from local authorities have yet to be invited. A local authority will be eligible where it has been accepted onto the housing transfer programme and where on disposal of its stock the receipt it will receive will be less than its housing attributable debt.

surplus housing revenue accounts to those authorities in deficit under the proposals in the Local Government Bill; what proportion of that surplus will be affected; whether it will be varied on an annual basis; and what effect this transfer will have on the ability of those surplus authorities to deliver their own housing strategies;  [84419]
<P>
<UL>(2) what criteria will be contained in the new formula for calculating housing revenue account subsidies under the Local Government Bill; how much his Department has allocated over the next three years for this; and whether authorities receiving central Government subsidy will be debarred from receiving subsidies from those authorities that have surplus housing revenue accounts;  [84411]
<P>
(3) what assessment he has made of the effect that the combined policies of pooling capital receipts, transferring surplus housing revenue accounts and resource equalisation will have on the ability of those authorities affected to deliver the existing range of services to the public; and how much will be redistributed in any one year under each of these three mechanisms.  [84420]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21203w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Under the arrangements proposed in the Local Government Bill, authorities with an assumed surplus on their Housing Revenue Account (HRA) will be asked to pay the whole of that assumed surplus to central Government. The surpluses, together with a contribution from the Exchequer, will be redistributed to those authorities whose assumed expenditure on their housing stock exceeds their rental income. This will not involve direct transfer between authorities.
<P>

<a name="21203w18.html_para5">This redistributive mechanism operates already at present, as an authority's assumed HRA surplus is netted off against the rent rebate subsidy due to them in the HRA subsidy calculation, thus providing the national resources to pay subsidy to deficit authorities. However, that will not be possible once rent rebates are removed from the HRA and subsidised separately; hence the need for the new mechanism in the Bill. As surpluses are effectively captured at present, this proposal will not, therefore, have any effect on the financial position of most councils, or their ability to deliver their housing strategies.
<P>

<a name="21203w18.html_para6">The assumed surpluses and deficits will continue to be determined annually as now. Authorities will be consulted on the formulae proposed each year in the normal way.
<P>

<a name="21203w18.html_para7">The pooling of a proportion of housing capital receipts will also ensure that resources are targeted to those areas where housing need is greatest so that all authorities can meet national housing priorities.
<P>

<a name="21203w18.html_para8">As with HRA surpluses, it is proposed that pooled receipts should be redistributed in full. The amount of pooled receipts will depend on levels of Right to Buy sales at the time.

 We will announce the new system for distributing Formula Grant, including detailed grant allocations for individual authorities, at the time of the provisional local government finance settlement which will be on the 5 December, subject to parliamentary business. Once the Government has allocated its grant, decisions about budgets and services are primarily for local councils to make. However, we have already guaranteed that we will use grant Xfloors" to ensure that no authority will face a cut in grant next year on a like for like basis, and we hope to do better than that when we announce the actual floors and ceilings scheme as part of the provisional settlement.

<a name="21203w19.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The draft Bill proposed the merger of Revenue Support Grant (RSG) and redistributed national non-domestic rates (NNDR) into a single grant stream. The intended purpose was to simplify the grant distribution mechanism by paying the combined total of central government unhypothecated grant support for local authorities and the amount of support raised via business rates using a single basis of distribution. The Government believed that this change would make the grant system more transparent and easier for stakeholders to understand.
<P>

<a name="21203w19.html_para3">A number of local authority responses to the consultation on the draft Bill agreed that the proposed changes would simplify the grant distribution system. However the overwhelming majority of consultation responses argued that the two funding streams should not be merged. The Select Committee also recommend against the proposed merger.
<P>

<a name="21203w19.html_para4">Having considered carefully all the consultation responses and the views of the Select Committee, the Government decided to not to proceed with the merger because it evidently did not achieve the desired objective of improving the clarity of the grant distribution system.

 The Government are committed to the modernisation of public services. Advance Passenger Processing is the framework for a modernised immigration control. It will comprise a range of operational and analytical initiatives which will provide a balance between expediting clearance of genuine passengers and targeting those passengers who present an immigration or security threat. Over the last few years, we have been building a platform of legislation to support this strategy: the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999; the Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) Order 2000; the Immigration (Passenger Information) Order 2000; and the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

<a name="21203w20.html_para0">The Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND), with .private sector partners, have recently completed a three month feasibility study to examine whether a system of advance passenger processing, akin to the electronic travel authority which operates in Australia, might be applicable to the United Kingdom. The initial conclusions are positive and IND are currently engaged in an evaluation of the study, which is being conducted in consultation with key stakeholders. It is expected that the evaluation will be completed by Spring 2003 and we will then consider the best way forward.

 A four tier screening process is in place for all new asylum applicants. Those holding documentation establishing their identity and nationality undergo the first level of screening, which is photographing, fingerprinting and taking personal details. In all other cases, more in-depth screening is undertaken to ascertain nationality and identity along with the route taken to the United Kingdom. The highest level of screening is used in cases where prosecution is a possibility and these interviews are conducted under caution by specially trained officers.

 Drug courts are not presently being piloted in England and Wales, but the STEP Project, a court based treatment initiative, ran in Wakefield and Pontefract from summer 1998 to autumn 2000.

 The Home Office is working to develop an action plan on a National Rehabilitation Strategy. The plan will respond .to issues highlighted in the recent Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) and Sentencing Enforcement Unit (SEU) reports and will draw on the experience and skills of a range of Departments and agencies working with vulnerable and excluded groups. Partnership between the prison service and national probation service will be important in the joint delivery of support to offenders both during and after custody and helping them to reintegrate successfully into the community on release.
<P>

<a name="21203w20.html_para8">The National Probation Directorate (NPD) provides funding to several voluntary sector organisations, including the Society of Voluntary Associates (SOVA) and the National Association for Care and Resettlement of Offenders (NACRO). Both NPD and the Prison Service work closely with partner agencies in the voluntary and not for profit sector to address offenders resettlement needs. Partnerships typically deliver services supporting offenders to access housing, prepare for and obtain employment and enter basic skills learning.

 Section 76 of the FHE Act 1992 allows the Privy Council to specify any institution offering higher education as competent to grant degrees. Institutions are required to meet specific criteria, as set out by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education, before degree awarding powers are granted. Any institution which believes it fulfils the relevant criteria is eligible to apply to the Privy Council, including private organisations. There are currently two private institutions that have secured degree-awarding powers: University of Buckingham and Henley Management College.

 <i>[holding answer 20 November 2002]</i>: The merger of the Department for Education and the Employment Department Group to form the Department for Education and Employment in 1995 led to substantial savings in support service jobs as the new departmental structure rolled out over the following two years. Between April 1996 and March 1997 the Department managed the voluntary early release of 542 staff.
<P>

<a name="21203w23.html_para2">Machinery of Government changes following the General Election in 2001 transferred responsibility for the employment portfolio away from the newly created Department for Education and Skills. As a result some 700 staff moved to one of the four Departments which now share that responsibility: the Department for Work and Pensions, Home Office, the Department for Trade and Industry and Cabinet Office.

<P>

<a name="21203w23.html_para7">Numerous academic studies have attempted to estimate the average percentage increase in hourly or weekly earnings attributable to having various higher education qualifications. These studies control for a range of factors that affect earnings, other than having a HE qualification&#151;such as age, gender, prior educational attainment&#151;although they do vary in the extent to which other influential factors are taken into account. The studies do not tell us exactly what a particular graduate would have earned had they not have obtained a higher education qualification. We can only observe one reality for any individual&#151;i.e. their actual earnings given that they did get a HE qualification. However, they do provide the closest estimates that we can get of the earnings they could have had.
<P>

<a name="21203w23.html_para8">There is, unsurprisingly, some variation in the results of these studies, indicating that the increase in earnings from having a first degree compared to two or more A-levels is in the range of around 20&#150;30 per cent.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will publish the results of cost-benefit studies undertaken by his Department in the last five years which show the value of its graduate labour force.  [83894]<P>

<P>
<a name="21203w24.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Hodge  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 2 December 2002]:</i> The cost-benefit studies we have undertaken relate to the private and social rates of return to a degree. Private rates of return compare the costs and benefits of higher education to individuals, including their contribution towards course costs and post-tax earnings benefits. Social rates of return include these private costs and benefits, but also take into account the costs and benefits to society as a whole. Social rates of return estimate the value to the economy of investment in higher education by, broadly, expressing the net increase in national output relative to the resource cost of the higher education courses. The increase in national output is proxied by the difference in graduates' pre-tax earnings compared to those with only two or more A levels, after taking into account non-wage labour costs, which also reflect the value associated with employing a graduate.
<P>

<a name="21203w24.html_para0">The table provides the results of the studies undertaken in the last five or so years. They show that social rates of return have held up, with current estimates around 8&#150;10 per cent.
<P>

<a name="21203w24.html_para1">Private rates of return to a first degree are higher than social rates. This is primarily because individuals contribute only partially to the costs, but also because social rates are likely to be under-estimates because they exclude social benefits that are difficult to quantify in financial terms, such as health benefits, longer life expectancy, lower infant mortality and reduced crime.

 I regularly meet with colleagues in the National Assembly for Wales and discuss a range of issues including new business start-ups.
<P>

<a name="21203w25.html_para0">Figures from the Welsh Development Agency show that initiatives launched by the National Assembly for Wales are already producing increases in business start ups in Wales. In the first half of the year more than 2,000 new businesses have been created in Wales with WDA assistance, an increase of over 60 per cent. compared with the same period last year. The new lending body XFinance Wales" has already injected &pound;17.8 million into 72 new or expanding companies, and 2002&#150;03 is a record year for RSA offers in Wales. It should bring in &pound;623 million investment from 270 projects and create or safeguard 13,100 jobs.

 We are committed to providing a payment for a respectful funeral to people receiving income-related benefits or tax credits who have good reason for organising the funeral.
<P>

<a name="21203w25.html_para3">Social Fund funeral payments cover in full the cost of certain necessary, specified charges including fees levied by burial authorities and crematoria. Not everyone wishes to use, or is required to pay for, the services of a minister of religion or other religious fees. However, up to &pound;600 is allowed for other funeral expenses, which gives the person arranging the funeral the freedom to select the items or services they consider appropriate. On 27 November, we announced that from next April this amount will rise to &pound;700.
<P>

<a name="21203w25.html_para4">The Department does not hold information on the range of parochial fees charged for funerals and we have no plans to include fees for a religious service among the charges specified in regulations.

<P>
<a name="21203w26.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 The Department for Work and Pensions will be converting people to direct payment over a two-year period, with the first payments going into accounts in April 2003. An information campaign will support the conversion.
<P>

<a name="21203w26.html_para0">Informing people about the availability of the Post Office card account is part of this campaign rather than a separate advertising initiative. We need to ensure that people are aware of the range of options open to them, and in a position to choose what is appropriate and convenient for them. Our information campaign will take customers through the changes, including getting their money from their account at the Post Office and the availability of the Post Office card account.
<P>

<a name="21203w26.html_para1">There will be two main elements to our campaign. Customers will be supplied directly with information, which clearly sets out their Xaccount options" and enables them to decide which account is right for them. Customers do not need to take any action until they receive a letter about the change. Until then they can keep their order book or giro.
<P>

<a name="21203w26.html_para2">In addition, we plan to make more general information available and also undertake some advertising. This activity will be timed to coincide with the build up of the number of people transferring to direct payment into accounts. Again, this activity will include reference to all of the Xaccount options" including the Post Office card account.
<P>

<a name="21203w26.html_para3">The Government and Post Office Limited are working together to ensure that front-line Post Office staff have all the information they need to answer any questions from customers about banking facilities in Post Office branches.

<P>

<a name="21203w26.html_para7">In line with good practice, and in order to minimise risk, the intention is gradually to build up (starting from April 2003) the number of benefit customers and pensioners that we pay through the Post Office card account. As the system proves itself in live running, we will increase the number of people paid through the card account. And, at an appropriate time, those new tax credit customers who have asked for a Post Office card account will start to have their payment made in this way. In the intervening period, Tax Credit customers opting for a card account will be paid by giro and DWP customers by order book or giro as appropriate.

<a name="21203w26.html_para9">Building on this partnership approach, our new Green Paper XPathways to Work&#151;Helping people into employment", published on 18 November, proposes the establishment of groundbreaking rehabilitation programmes. These will be piloted in six areas across the country starting from late 2003, combining support to find jobs with health-focused rehabilitation.
<P>

<a name="21203w26.html_para10">The programmes will be complementary to any clinical care already being provided by primary care and community services in pilot areas. Their key focus will be to help those with conditions such as depression, back pain and heart disease understand the impact that their condition has and increase their confidence to work or train and lead as normal a life as possible.
<P>

<a name="21203w26.html_para11">In addition, the Job Retention and Rehabilitation Pilot Project, a joint initiative with the Department of Health, is currently exploring ways in which we can support people faced with losing their employment through prolonged sickness or disability. The pilot will run from early 2003 to 2005, and will aim to provide robust evidence about the relative impact of three intervention strategies (boosting healthp are, boosting workplace support and a combined approach) in helping people to return to work.

These events will complement local church services, the laying of wreaths at sea by the Donaghadee and Campbeltown lifeboats and a commemorative event planned by Larne borough council, Larne being the port to which the MV Princess Victoria was steaming when she sank.

 I am concerned at the number of suicides in North and West Belfast.

The Trust has appointed a suicide awareness co-ordinator who is working with a wide range of community and statutory agencies to provide information, training and support. In addition the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety will be issuing a mental health promotion strategy and action plan early in the New Year which will include a separate section on suicide prevention.

<P>
<a name="21203w28.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 The existence of empty property can be symptomatic of an underlying and complex interaction of wider social problems, including urban and rural decay, unemployment, crime and vandalism, anti-social behaviour etc. Solutions, therefore, are not just about good housing management, but require more complex strategies and inter-agency initiatives. The Northern Ireland Housing Executive, as the comprehensive regional housing authority for Northern Ireland, has put in place a number of measures to address the problem of empty homes in the public and private sectors throughout the province.
<P>

<a name="21203w28.html_para0">Local strategies have already been implemented to address the range of problems occurring in difficult to let areas. The Housing Executive's existing action plan has been progressed as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Estate strategies involving improvement, sale and/or selective demolition have been put in place for numerous estates (currently 1,500 public sector properties are scheduled for demolition).

<P>
<BR>

<P>
<BR>
Urban renewal programmes in private areas involving improvement, replacement or a combination.
<P>

 My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Health has made available an extra &pound;10 million from central budgets for specialist palliative care for 2002&#150;2003. This money has been allocated for primary care trusts (PCTs). It has been allocated to PCTs with clear instructions that it must be spent on specialist palliative care and that its use should be in line with local strategic plans and agreed by all relevant local partners.
<P>

<a name="21203w29.html_para1">To make sure this extra money is deployed appropriately, strategic health authorities have been asked to ensure joint National Health service and voluntary sector agreement to its use and to provide investment and out-turn reports showing how it has been spent.

<i> [holding answer 28 November 2002]:</i> We are aware that there is not a very strong National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) infrastructure within the care sector at present. This is why part of the &pound;15 million in the training strategy implementation fund for 2002&#150;03 is being used to support 11,500 line managers who are undertaking training to become NVQ assessors, verifiers and mentors. The fund is administered by Topss England, the former national training organisation for social care.

[84404]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21203w32.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 A 12-month guarantee of continued employment was given until 31 March 2003, for all staff, including Community Health Council staff, affected by Shifting the Balance of Power (StBOP) who were transferring to strategic health authorites (StHAs) on 1 April 2002. Over 20,000 staff were involved in StBOP reorganisation. Because of the numbers involved, a one years employment guarantee was given to enable a smooth transition. The 'CHC Transition Issues: Human Resource Framework was issued to cover only the transfer to the StHAs. It was not intended for any other purpose. We are currently working with the trade unions and other interested parties on a new human resources document to support CHC staff and managers affected by the abolition of CHCs.
<P>

<a name="21203w32.html_para0">The commission for patient and public involvement in health is a non-departmental public body and is not part of the National Health Service.

 The Social Exclusion Unit Teenage Pregnancy Report was published in June 1999. This set out the Government's teenage pregnancy strategy with the goal of reducing the under 18 conception rate by 50 per cent., by 2010. An interim reduction target of 15 per cent., by 2004 is set out in the Government Manifesto and NHS Plan. A second goal of the strategy is to increase to 60 per cent., by 2010 the participation of teenage parents in education, training or employment to reduce their long term risk of social exclusion.
<P>

<a name="21203w32.html_para1">The strategy has a 30 point action plan. 26 of the action points have been completed with two action points, 11 and 20, due to be completed by the end of the financial year.
<P>

<a name="21203w32.html_para2">Action point 13 is to deliver guidance on the circumstances in which different health professionals may prescribe, supply and administer contraceptives to under 16s. Further work is being undertaken to identify the extent and nature of confusion among health professionals to inform the need and content of further guidance.
<P>

<a name="21203w32.html_para3">The target completion date for Action point 29 is 2003.
<P>

<a name="21203w32.html_para4">There are encouraging early signs that the strategy is working. There has been a 6 per cent., reduction in the under 18 and under 16 conception rate from the baseline year of 1998 with latest data showing a reduction in the under 18 conception rate for the 12th successive quarter.
<P>

<a name="21203w32.html_para5">However, considerable further work is needed to ensure that activity is sustained and monitored. Our response to the first annual report of the independent advisory group on teenage pregnancy was published in June 2002 and sets out a further programme of work to deliver our headline goals. Our commitment is further underlined by the inclusion of the under 18 reduction target in the public service agreements for both the Department and local government.

 Councils have had the power to charge for non-residential social services since the 1948 National Assistance Act. Councils have wide discretion on how to set their charges, although it is stipulated that if they choose to charge for services, the charges generally should be 'reasonable'.

This guidance does not seek to change councils' power to charge, or not, but seeks to ensure that, where councils do charge, this will be based on fairer, well designed charging policies. An important principle of the guidance is that charges should not reduce a person's income below basic levels of income support plus a 25 per cent. buffer.

4. Three month vacancies are vacancies which trusts are actively trying to fill, which had lasted for three months or more (whole time equivalents).<P>

5. Three month vacancy rates are three month vacancies expressed as a percentage of three month vacancies plus staff in post.<P>

6. Three month vacancy rates are calculated using staff in post from the Vacancy Survey and the Consultant Census, March 2002.<P>

7. Staff in post data are from the Non-Medical Workforce Census, September 2001 and the Mini Consultant Census, March 2002.<P>

8. Staff in post data exclude staff employed by health authorities, as vacancy information was only collected from trusts, PCTs and special health authorities.<P>

9. Medical and dental figures exclude staff in training.<P>

10. Vacancy and staff in post numbers are rounded to the nearest 10.<P>

 The national service framework for long-term conditions (NSF) will focus on neurological conditions and some of the generic issues relevant to a wide range of people with disabilities and long term conditions. We have appointed an external reference group to take forward the detailed development of the NSF and to consider the range of issues it should tackle which could include vocational rehabilitation. We recognise the importance of supporting people with long-term conditions to remain in or return to work wherever possible. We plan to publish the NSF in 2004. Implementation will cover a 10-year period starting in 2005. We will consider the resource and funding implications of implementing the NSF during its development.

 Ritalin is indicated as a part of a comprehensive treatment programme for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children over six years of age where remedial measures alone prove insufficient. In October 2000, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) published an appraisal of the use of the drug methlphenidate (main brand name Ritalin) in the treatment of childhood ADHD, and issued clinical guidelines for its use, including the need for regular monitoring of children receiving this therapy. NICE recommended long-term follow-up of adverse effects and the potential for misuse of the drug in assessing long-term benefits and health gain into adulthood.
<P>

<a name="21203w36.html_para4">As with all medicines, the safety of methylphenidate is continually monitored by the Medicines Control Agency and the independent advisory body, the Committee on the Safety of Medicines. Comprehensive information on the use of methylphenidate, including possible side effects, contraindications and precautions is contained in the summary of product characteristics produced by the manufacturer and approved by the licensing authority. Review by NICE of its guidance on the use of methylphenidate is scheduled for August 2003.

 Following a three month consultation exercise, my right hon.

These Regulations will ban the use of such terms, which suggest that a particular tobacco product is less harmful than others. The Directive requires this ban to be in effect by 30 September 2003. Article 7 is subject to a challenge in the European Court of Justice and judgement is expected shortly. If necessary, the Regulations will be amended to reflect the judgement.

 Neither the BBC nor TV Licensing are subject to the powers of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration and there are therefore no formal findings of maladministration against the BBC or TV Licensing. However, TV Licensing operates its own complaints procedures and if a member of the public remains unsatisfied with the outcome the BBC will also consider the complaint. Goodwill payments in relation to the administration of the television licensing system are made by TV Licensing rather than the BBC. Information on the number of such payments is available only for the period since Capita took over the TV Licensing contract in July this year. From July to October 2002, TV Licensing made a total of 825 goodwill payments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21203w37.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 My Department continues to encourage the competitiveness of the UK broadcast-related industries through its wide-ranging support for the creative industries, working in partnership with all stakeholders within Government and the industry to examine ways of enhancing performance at home and overseas. As part of this work, in November 1999 DCMS published the report of the UK Television Exports Inquiry which specifically looked at how Government and the industry could work together to enhance export performance, to lower barriers to investment and to increase the international attractiveness of UK television programmes. DCMS continues to work with the industry and with Skillset in taking forward the recommendations of the Audio Visual Industries Training Group to meet future skills needs.
<P>

<a name="21203w37.html_para6">We are also promoting competitiveness through targets set for BBC commercial income and through the promotion of digital broadcasting, where the UK has maintained world leadership, with 40 per cent. of households having access to digital television across the platforms. We have approved new digital BBC services which enhance the digital proposition. With the Department of Trade and Industry, and in consultation with broadcasters, manufacturers and consumer representatives, we have published the Digital Television Action Plan. This sets out what needs to be done by whom and by when in order to meet the criteria for full switchover. We have also taken steps to encourage digital radio development by aligning the licence period for digital and analogue licences. The Communications Bill provides the framework for enhancing competitiveness further and extending the take-up of digital television.

<a name="21203w37.html_spnew13"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 On 19 November, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State introduced the Communications Bill, which will establish the new regulatory framework for broadcasting and the communications industries. This framework recognises, both within Ofcom's general duties and the detail of the regulatory provisions, the importance of competition, of investment and of innovation in delivering the dynamic market for communications services which we want to see in the United Kingdom. A dynamic, competitive market will encourage the development and take-up of new technologies, to the benefit of business, consumers and the UK economy. The proposals in the Bill also address the challenges of technological convergence, in providing for regulation by a single body and for a flexible regime capable of accommodating further change.

[83753]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21203w37.html_spnew14"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 It is the responsibility of the broadcasters and the broadcasting regulatory bodies, that is the BBC Governors, Independent Television Commission, Radio Authority and Broadcasting Standards Commission, to ensure that broadcasters meet their obligations for quality, diversity, social inclusion and accessibility, in accordance with the regulatory requirements agreed by Parliament. They report on these in their Annual Reports and, in establishing new regulatory requirements as set out in the Communications Bill, we have also had the benefit of wide-ranging consultation.

 This Department and the Department for Trade and Industry work together closely on the fight against music piracy and the protection of copyright, and are in regular contact with the industry on these issues. Among other things, the Government supported the Private Member's Bill introduced by the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), which was enacted on 20 November as the Copyright, etc. Trade Marks (Offences and Enforcement) Act 2002; this increased the maximum sentence for copyright offences from two to 10 years' imprisonment and an unlimited fine. Furthermore, the role of this Department's new music industry adviser, Stephen Navin, includes the provision of advice on combatting piracy. The British Phonographic Industry estimates that the total value of commercially pirated singles and albums in 2001 totalled &pound;27.6 million; information on the number of illegally produced records in 2002 is not yet available.

 The day-to-day operation of Government-funded museums and galleries, including the staging of exhibitions, is a matter for the Boards of Trustees and management of such bodies. In October 2002, my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, announced the provision of increased grant-in-aid to the national museums and galleries to enable them to continue the Government's highly successful policy of free admission.

<a name="21203w39.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Government appreciates that the present uncertainty about the completion of the National Football Centre has created some concern, both locally and among those with a general interest in the future success of the England team. However, this is entirely a matter for the Football Association. Neither I nor my right hon .Friend the Secretary of State have discussed the matter with the FA, and Ministers have no plans to visit the site. The Government's priority is the continued development of grass roots football, which my Department funds through the Football Foundation. The arrangements made for the coaching of elite players must remain the responsibility of football itself.

 During the course of the 2002 Spending Review, the Department has looked at the performance of its sponsored bodies and at the effectiveness of funding agreements as a means of performance management. The conclusions from our assessment are positive, but we have plans for further improvements: the introduction of more streamlined funding agreements that will focus on delivery of our four strategic priorities; and the earmarking of resources in the 2003&#150;06 period, specifically to help non-departmental public bodies improve efficiency and effectiveness.

 there are no regulations specifically to protect hand-painted street advertising. It is possible that such advertising can be protected by the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, which requires the Secretary of State to compile lists of buildings of special architectural or historic interest. An advertisement that has been painted on to a building would be protected if the building itself was listed.

<a name="21203w39.html_para1">At the launch of the State of the Historic Environment Report on 25 November, we announced plans&#151;in partnership with English Heritage&#151;to improve and refocus the way the UK's built environment receives statutory protection. These will include a review of the current designation system, with a view to changing it to one that sustains the historic environment as a whole rather than relating in a piecemeal way to its constituent parts. This review will take around a year to report.

 <i>[holding answer 2 December 2002]:</i> My officials have been in contact with a number of organisations, primarily the Film Council and British Video Association, the BBC, ITV and the ITC and, via the Broadcasters Disability Network, ITFC Ltd, a company which produces sub-titling for both broadcasters and DVD production houses. We have been looking at the current availability of equipment and videos, and emphasising the importance which we attach to access for the hard of hearing. DVDs normally include sub-titles.

<a name="21203w39.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 I have made no estimates of the costs that will be specifically incurred by Worcester Cathedral under the proposals in the Licensing Bill. Any costs would depend on the licensable activities, if any, which are undertaken at the Cathedral and their frequency.
