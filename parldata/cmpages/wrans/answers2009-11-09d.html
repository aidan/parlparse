 To ask the hon. Member for North Devon, representing the House of Commons Commission what assessment the House of Commons Commission has made of the potential contribution of use of <i> (a)</i> micro-generation and <i> (b)</i> combined heat and power to improving the energy efficiency of the House of Commons part of the parliamentary estate; and if he will make a statement.

 Studies have been undertaken to assess the potential for micro-generation and combined heat and power to improve energy efficiency across the estate. These include assessments of the potential for solar, wind and tidal power generation, borehole water cooling and combined heat, power and cooling for the Palace of Westminster. Solar, wind and tidal power generation for the Palace have, at this stage, been discounted due mainly to heritage restrictions and unfavourable local conditions. Combined heat, power and cooling is now being subjected to an in-depth feasibility study the outcome of which will determine a way forward.</p>

 At the 7 September EU Agriculture Council meeting, the Secretary of State expressed concern at the unnecessarily long journeys some animals undertake within Europe, particularly to slaughter. He urged the European Commission to give due consideration to shorter journey times and improved enforcement of welfare in transport rules when putting forward proposals to review the legislation. Commission proposals for an early review have not come forward this year as expected. It is not now known when new proposals may be drawn up although the Commission is obliged to review the Regulation by 2011.</p>

 Gassing of badgers in setts with hydrogen cyanide gas was carried out between 1975-1982, when it was discontinued due to studies which showed it to be inhumane. Trapping and shooting has been the culling method used since, during the clean ring (1982-1986) and interim (1986-1997) control strategies and the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (1998-2005). Both tuberculosis-infected and uninfected badgers were removed in all of these operations. It was also the manner of culling used during the live test trial (1994-1996), which initially aimed to remove individual infected badgers that tested positive to a diagnostic test (known as the Brock Elisa test). However, due to the poor performance of the test in detecting infected badgers, the trial was suspended in 1996.</p>

 No assessment has been made of the effect of the measures in the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 on the prevalence of pit bull terriers and similar breeds and trends in the number of attacks on humans by dogs in the last 10 years. However, following a spate of high profile dog attacks in 2007, DEFRA consulted police forces for their views on the current dangerous dog legislation. Responses indicated that more guidance should be made available to the police. In April of this year, DEFRA made available additional guidance on the law. We also provided the Association of Chief of Police Officers £20,000 towards the training of specialist dog legislation officers.</p>

Although local authorities still pay levies to the Environment Agency, this form of funding has largely been replaced by direct funding to the Environment Agency from DEFRA, through grant in aid which has increased from £358,600,00 in 2004-05 to £435,900,000 in 2007-08.</p>

<i> [holding answer 2 November 2009]:</i> The primary role of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment is to support the defence and security of Gibraltar. Deployments in support of other tasks have been undertaken by individual volunteers; 15 personnel from the Royal Gibraltar Regiment have deployed on operations in Afghanistan between August 2004 and February 2009. Since then there has been a temporary suspension in volunteers being deployed while we investigated a potential issue with compensation arrangements covering such deployments. The Royal Gibraltar Regiment are entitled to compensation benefits under their own terms and conditions of service including when deployed to Afghanistan. Work has commenced to bring these compensation arrangements in line with the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme through legislation. The temporary suspension has now been lifted.</p>

 It is estimated that the number of such cases in the UK in recent years is very small, but definitive information is not held centrally. To provide the information requested would require the identification and examination of the individual medical records of service patients who contracted hepatitis C and had received in-patient treatment in any hospital worldwide during the last 30 years. Such records should only be viewed for non-clinical reasons with the express consent of each individual concerned in order to protect patient confidentiality, and the information could therefore be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>

 The Government have repeatedly made clear that no one in the armed forces will deploy on operations without being trained for the role they are being asked to perform. Training for Territorial Army (TA) personnel preparing for mobilisation was specifically exempted from the decision to reduce TA activity for the remainder of the current financial year. Neither this decision, nor the subsequent decision to restore training for all TA personnel this year, has therefore affected the preparations of those in the TA who are currently earmarked for operations.</p>

 As of 1 September 2009 the strength of the Territorial Army was 34,380. Of these approximately 19,000 had completed phase 2 training, were not bound by limitations of the Reserve Forces Act 1996 and were therefore available for mobilisation, subject to their being releasable from their civilian commitments and completing additional pre deployment training. The figure of 19,000 does not include the 1,200 TA personnel currently mobilised in support of operations.

 The Highways Agency is currently investigating a number of different surface preservation treatment processes for existing road pavements on the trunk road network. The treatments are intended to increase the service life of the pavement before the existing surface requires replacement due to surface disintegration or unacceptable reduction in skidding resistance. Investigations on the overall performance of these treatments is ongoing, to examine all aspects of their effectiveness. Initial assessment suggests that the treatments are likely to be either neutral or result in slight reductions in traffic noise levels over the lifetime of the treatment when compared with the current surfacing.</p>

The report provides an indication to interested local authorities on where it might be worthwhile to explore further the potential of a re-opened rail line as a means of improving links to places currently without a rail service.</p>

 The contribution of any ancillary activities to the effective use of a property as measured by the rental market is used as the reference point for the rating assessment.

 Planning policy guidance note 17, Planning for Open Space, Sport and Recreation, states that local planning authorities should undertake rigorous assessments of the needs of their communities for open space. This enables them to set their own open space standards which take into account local circumstances, including the extent of development. It is for local authorities to determine how much open space should be provided as part of a new development, whether in the green belt or elsewhere.</p>

This is explained in planning policy guidance note 2, "Green Belts". Only where the harm that inappropriate development may cause to the green belt would be clearly outweighed by other considerations, and where there are very special circumstances to justify the development, should permission be granted by the planning authority.</p>

<i> [holding answer 21 July 2009]:</i><i> </i>Since 1997, my Department has identified a number of significant areas of improvement made in information security policy across government. The Office of the e-Envoy was established in 1999 within the Cabinet Office and produced security policy guidance on e-government development. Sir Edmund Burton's 2001 review into information security policy provision across government recommended a central policy unit be established at the centre to lead on information security policy for government. The Central Sponsor for Information Assurance (CSIA) was duly established in 2003. CSIA published the refreshed National Information Assurance Strategy in 2007 outlining the Government's strategic approach to improve professionalism, capability, awareness and education in information security and assurance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="91109w0019.htm_para1"><a name="09110957000482">In June 2008 the Cabinet Secretary published the Data Handling Report (DHR) on the security of cross-government data handling procedures which identified key areas for improvement in data security and outlined specific measures that Departments must take. In addition, the Security Policy Framework (SPF) was introduced in December 2008 to replace and update the Manual of Protective Security which had been in place since 1995 and is now the sole source upon which all departmental security policy should be based. These recent measures further reinforce the Government's strong commitment to review and address information assurance concerns and to the securing of personal data held by public authorities.</p>

 The Department identifies unfilled places in local authority maintained schools and academies through an annual surplus places survey. In 2008 the survey established that there were 2,673 or 8 per cent. of unfilled 16 to 19-year-old places in academies with all year groups present. However, each year academy 16 to 19-year-old funding is normally allocated on the basis of estimates by the academy of the number of pupils aged over 16 that are on roll for the next September (except for that small minority of academies where these are based on actual census numbers). Each academy's estimate is considered in the light of its actual recruitment against funded numbers, with a view to ensuring that unfilled funded places for 16 to 19-year-olds are kept to an absolute minimum. This process takes account of local Learning and Skills Council information on provision in the relevant area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="91109w0024.htm_para4"><a name="09110957001210">For those academies where funded places are based on estimates, a clause in their funding agreement stipulates that an adjustment will be made to the following year's formulaic grant allocation if the actual numbers recruited across all year groups are more than either 10 per cent. or 2.5 per cent. (depending on the funding agreement) below the total estimated numbers on roll, 16 to 19-year-old pupils are included in this calculation.</p>

 The DCSF has made it clear to schools that all forms of bullying, including those motivated by prejudice, should not be tolerated. Schools have the legal duty to put measures in place to promote good behaviour, respect for others and to prevent all forms of bullying among pupils. Schools' legal duties also include promoting community cohesion which is about building an appreciation of diversity, developing shared values and fostering good relations between different groups of pupils.

It is for each PCT to ensure that it contracts with sufficient practices at sufficient levels of service to meet local need for national health service dental care.

1. A finished consultant episode (FCE) is defined as a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. It should be noted that the figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.<br>
2. 'Consultant main speciality' is defined as the specialty under which the consultant responsible for the care of the patient at that time is registered. Care is needed when analysing hospital episode statistics (HES) data by specialty, or by groups of specialties (such as "acute"). Trusts have different ways of managing specialties and attributing codes so it is better to analyse by specific diagnoses, operations or other patient or service information.<br>
3. A provider code is a unique code that identifies an organisation acting as a health care provider (e.g. NHS trust or primary care trust). Hospital providers can also include Treatment Centres (TC). TCs (also known as Diagnostic Centres) provide elective (planned) surgery for a range of conditions, mainly for day surgery or short-term hospital stay patients. Some Treatment Centres are attached to hospital trusts and HES enables data for these to be separately identified from the rest of the health care provider's data. It does this by adding TC to the trust code; if there is more than one per trust T1, T2, T3 etc. are suggested unless already in use by the trust. Activity performed in the remainder of the trust is identified by the health care provider code being followed by an 'X'. Hospital providers beginning with an 'N' indicates an independent sector health care provider.<br>
4. To protect patient confidentiality, figures between one and 5 have been suppressed and replaced with "*" (an asterisk). Where it was possible to identify numbers from the total due to a single suppressed number in a row or column, an additional number (the next smallest) has been suppressed.<br>
5. HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the national health service have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
6. HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
7. Activity in English NHS Hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.<br>

 I have today issued a written ministerial statement to clarify details around the roll-out of the BOSS chairs. NOMS has now purchased and delivered at least one BOSS chair to every prison that did not already have one (five extra BOSS chairs were purchased for prisons with split sites)-128 in total. This includes the female, open and contracted estate, and nine prisons which have a main function as a young offenders' institution. Immigration removal centres were not included, as the use of mobile phones is not prohibited in those sites.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_374"><a name="91109w0031.htm_para4"><a name="09111017000234">NOMS headquarters have not mandated how BOSS chairs must be used. As is the case for many searching technologies and techniques, the decision on how to use the BOSS chairs is for individual Governors to make, and will depend on their local circumstances, including their existing local searching strategies. The relevant Prison Service Instruction (PSI) states: "The frequency of searches using the BOSS and policies for its use are for local discretion".</p>

According to a recent survey of BOSS chair usage, 115 prisons reported that the BOSS chair was in use. Reasons for non-operation include chairs awaiting repair or return from repairs and awaiting building work to accommodate the chair. Steps have been taken to improve the .provision of maintenance services. Prisons deploy hand-held detection wands as an effective alternative.</p>

In order to provide the information requested, we would need to contact all Prison Service establishments, ask them to check their local records and to submit this information to headquarters. This would incur disproportionate cost. BOSS chairs are not designed to detect illegal drugs.</p>

In September, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) confirmed a 22 per cent. decrease in opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan in 2008-including a 33 per cent. reduction in Helmand. This builds on last year's success, when UNODC recorded a 19 per cent. fall in cultivation. Growing Afghan law enforcement capacity is increasingly having an impact on corruption and on the insurgency, with steady increases in the number of significant drug traffickers convicted and the amount of drugs seized.</p>

 The US coroner/authorities were unable to perform autopsies as in the majority of the cases very little or none of the victim's remains were recovered. Where identifiable remains were recovered, the cause of death was recorded on the death certificate as blunt trauma.

 The Government recognise the importance of the Construction Industry to the economy. In 2007 the construction industry, including contracting, products and services, accounted for 9 per cent. of GVA. Construction contracting by itself contributed 6 per cent. of GVA. These figures are based on the Annual Business inquiry published by ONS in June 2009, which are the latest data source the Department has at hand. The public sector is especially important to the construction industry. Some 30 per cent. of all construction work is procured by the public sector, rising to 40 per cent. if PFI projects are included.</p>
