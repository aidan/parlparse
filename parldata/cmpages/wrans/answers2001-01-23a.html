<P>
31. <a name="10123w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Ben Chapman: </B> 
 To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, if he will make a statement on pay and conditions of the clergy.  [144810]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10123w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 Pay and conditions vary slightly from diocese to diocese but the national average stipend for clergy of incumbent status as at July 2000 was &#163;16,480. In addition, clergy receive free accommodation or a housing allowance, membership of a non-contributory pension scheme and should receive full reimbursement of all working expenses.

<P>
33. <a name="10123w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Corbyn: </B> 
 To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, what restrictions are placed on the sale of church property in inner urban areas.  [144812]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10123w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 The Church Commissioners normally impose covenants on the new owner of a redundant church restricting its use to that approved and prohibiting unauthorised architectural changes, the disturbance of any human remains or memorials, and demolition. When a parsonage is sold there would normally be covenants to protect any adjacent church land.

<P>
35. <a name="10123w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. David Heath: </B> 
 To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, what the Commissioners' policy is in respect of agricultural rents on church-owned land.  [144814]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10123w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 As a charity, the Commissioners are required to seek the best returns on their assets for the benefit of the Church of England clergy, serving and retired. They also seek to act as responsible landlords. In the case of agricultural tenants, the Commissioners fully recognise the crisis in farming and where there is hardship will consider how best to help. This is done on a case by case basis and tenants are free to discuss their difficulties with agents or staff.

<a name="10123w01.html_sbhd3"><H4><center>Vicarages and Rectories</center></H4>


<P>
36. <a name="10123w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Swayne: </B> 
 To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, if he will make a statement about the sale of vicarages and rectories.  [144815]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10123w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 There are some 7,800 parsonages in England. During the last five years for which figures are available, a yearly average of 97 parsonages were sold, 42 purchased and 18 built.

<P>
37. <a name="10123w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Leigh: </B> 
 To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, if he will make a statement on the number of redundant churches.  [144816]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10123w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 1,623 Church of England churches have been declared redundant since 1 April 1969. However, the rate of closure has been falling and only 16 churches were declared redundant in 2000. Some 16,000 parish churches remain in use throughout England.

<P>
38. <a name="10123w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
 To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, if he will make a statement on the pension entitlement of dismissed clergy.  [144817]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10123w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 Anyone who ceases to be in service which is pensionable under the clergy scheme, for whatever reason other than retirement, is entitled to deferred benefits payable at age 65. The pension and retirement lump sum are calculated by reference to the period of pensionable service actually completed and pensionable stipend at the date of leaving. The benefits are revalued to age 65 in line with increases in the pensionable stipend. Once in payment, the pension is increased annually on the same basis as all other pensions in payment under the scheme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10123w01.html_wqn6"><B> Dr. Tonge: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on progress made by the Accelerating Access Initiative facilitated by UNAIDS.  [146248]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10123w01.html_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The United Nations programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) is making good progress on Accelerating Access to HIV/AIDS-related care and treatment. Over 20 countries have expressed interest in participating. Senegal and Uganda have negotiated significantly lower prices for antiretroviral medicines for their national HIV treatment programmes.
<P>

<a name="10123w01.html_para0">There has been greater transparency of both the acceleration process in general, and of indicative prices in particular. Although progress is being made, much more needs to be done, both in terms of transparency in prices from suppliers, but also in respect of further discounts on prices. The Cabinet Office Performance and Innovation Unit (PIU) study will further contribute to increasing access to HIV/AIDS care and treatment.
<P>

<a name="10123w01.html_para1">However, we must all remain clear that the complexity and toxicity of treatment and the weakness of health systems in many developing countries mean that such initiatives will have a limited impact.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development how many projects whose principal focus was disability were funded by her Department in the last 12 months; what was the total sum thus expended; and what percentage of her Department's project finance that total represented.  [146387]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10123w01.html_spnew7"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Forty-two such projects were being funded by my Department in the last 12 months, calendar year 2000. The total sum spent through these activities was &#163;58,078,800.
<P>

<a name="10123w01.html_para2">Figures for total DFID programmes for the same period are not available. However, the figure for the last complete financial year (1999-2000) is &#163;2,513,812,000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if the Small Business Service has met its operational targets for <i>(a)</i> establishing an Index of Regulation on small business and <i>(b)</i> reviewing business support services and publishing the results.  [146502]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10123w01.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 The Small Business Service has studied the issue of the Index of Regulation and carried out preliminary consultations internally and externally. These highlighted a number of issues that need to be resolved before a decision can be taken on how to create an index. The SBS review of business support was issued as a consultative document on 2 October 2000. A revised document, taking account of comments received, was published on the internet www.businessadviceonline.org on 22 December 2000.

 We aim to ensure that all our anti-fraud initiatives are effective in combating fraud and error. It is not always possible to quantify the precise savings of some measures as they are often designed to prevent fraud occurring in the first place rather than detecting fraud after the event.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10123w03.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 About 6,000 children are estimated to gain from the extension of the higher rate Motability component to three and four-year-olds at annual cost of &#163;15 million. They will be able to take the cash benefit or use it to pay for a standard vehicle through the Motability main scheme. Those that require an adapted vehicle will be able to make application to the Motability Equipment Fund (MEF), administered on behalf of the Government by Motability.
<P>

<a name="10123w03.html_para1">From a base of &#163;2 million per annum, an additional &#163;2.4 million was made available to the MEF from 2000-01, and from 2001-02 an extra &#163;1 million per annum is being provided which, with additional contributions from Motability's Tenth Anniversary Trust, is expected to meet overall demand over the next three years.

<P>
<a name="10123w04.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 A key component of the Electronic Record Development and Implementation Programme, which was launched in November 1999, was the inclusion of patient representatives in the selection of the sites. The National Health Service Information Authority (NHSIA) has encouraged the sites to involve their own patient communities through appropriate local mechanisms. In some instances this has involved condition-specific patient groups or patient representatives on project boards.

<P>

<a name="10123w04.html_para0">To support this process the NHSIA has appointed Marlene Winfield as Head of Stakeholder Relationships: Patients and Citizens, to consult national patient groups in order to ensure an appropriate level of patient involvement in the programme at both national and local levels.
<P>

<a name="10123w04.html_para1">Some sites have specific objectives in relation to involving patients, and have conducted patient surveys of attitudes to sharing information, confidentiality, the electronic health record, patient access and patient-held records and these results will be shared.
<P>

<a name="10123w04.html_para2">In addition, a project involving two general practices is also being supported by the NHSIA in the development and implementation of the electronic health record. The general practitioner's practices involved in the project are Hadfield Health Centre in Derbyshire and Bury Knowles Health Centre in Oxford, and are exemplars in their involvement of patients within the practice. The practices are exploring issues around patient self-monitoring and access to the electronic record at the time of consultation; use of electronic records and their migration to electronic and hand-held patient information integrated into the record.

 <i>[holding answer 15 January 2001]:</i> Yes, providing any volunteer in a first responder scheme is equipped with a defibrillator, trained in basic life support and acting as part of an ambulance service's response system. A fully staffed and equipped ambulance must also arrive within 14 minutes in urban areas or 19 minutes in rural areas. What matters is that patients with life- threatening conditions or injuries get an emergency response as quickly as possible. Clinical evidence proves conclusively that early defibrillation and resuscitation saves more lives. Achievement of the eight minute target could save 1,800 lives each year in people under 75 years suffering acute heart attacks.

 It is for clinicians to make a clinical judgment as to the best course of treatment for a patient, taking into account clinical and cost-effectiveness as well as patient preference.

 <i>[holding answer 15 January 2001]:</i> Agricultural premises have been exempt from rates since 1929 and are not valued for rating purposes. There is therefore no reliable basis on which to make an estimate because a number of factors come into play but, very approximately, it is likely that rates would yield less than &#163;140 million for England.

It does not undertake monitoring for depleted uranium contamination specifically but does monitor levels of total uranium contamination arising from discharges from Sellafield and other sources. This monitoring indicates that levels of uranium in fish and shellfish are only slightly enhanced above that expected from natural background. Detailed results of such monitoring are given in the annual Radioactivity in Food and the Environment report published jointly by the Food Standards Agency and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.

<P>
<a name="10123w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hill </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 January 2001]:</i> The A22 at Whyteleafe is a local road for which Surrey county council is the highway authority. As the highway authority, the county council are responsible for the maintenance of the road, including dealing with any flooding problem. The Secretary of State does not have powers under the Highways Act 1980 to direct a local highway authority in the discharge of its maintenance duties under the Act.
<P>

<a name="10123w06.html_para6">The flooding of the A22 at Whyteleafe was caused by a periodic flow of the Bourne due to the rising groundwater levels in the chalk aquifer as a result of the heavy autumn rainfall. The Bourne is normally a dry watercourse and records show it has flowed on only three occasions in the past 20 years. On this occasion the water was prevented from draining away as a result of blockages downstream of the A22. The water backed up to form a lake that covered the road which was closed for safety reasons on police advice. Alternative diversion routes were set up by Surrey county council and the London borough of Croydon.
<P>

<a name="10123w06.html_para7">To deal with the A22 flooding the Surrey county council and Tandridge district council set up a pumping arrangement to bypass the blockages and take away the excess Bourne water. This was not a straightforward operation and factors such as the need to protect the Kenley water works had to be considered. The pumping operation was successful and the road re-opened to traffic on 8 January.
<P>

<a name="10123w06.html_para8">A hydrogeologist from the Environment Agency visited the site of the flooding on 20 December and has liaised with officials of Tandridge district council. The Bourne watercourse is not a "Main River" and is therefore the 



<P>
<P><I>23 Jan 2001 : Column: 520W</I><P>
responsibility of the riparian landowners. Tandridge district council and Surrey county council staff have been working to remove the blockages from the course of the Bourne and Tandridge district council have taken the lead in bringing together key organisations to minimise the risk of a repetition of the local flooding. The Environment Agency have provided advice to some individuals who contacted them about the flooding of their properties.
<P>

<a name="10123w06.html_para9">In response to the countrywide flooding problems experienced as a result of the heavy autumn rainfall the Government have established a Floods Task Force, chaired by the MAFF Minister for Fisheries and the Countryside, which draws together all relevant departments and aims to ensure effective co-ordination of central Government's support for communities recovering from the effects of flooding. The Task Force will share examples of good practice.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what action he <i>(a)</i> has taken and <i>(b)</i> plans to take to help ensure that trains are designed to provide better access for people with disabilities, with particular reference to wheelchair and power scooter users.  [145394]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10123w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 We are fully committed to providing a public transport system which is accessible to disabled people, providing them the same opportunities to travel as other members of society. We are introducing technical regulations under Part V of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA), to require new trains, as well as buses and coaches and taxis, to be accessible to disabled people, including wheelchair users.
<P>

<a name="10123w07.html_para0">The Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations have applied to all new rail vehicles entering service since 1 January 1999. These Regulations considerably improve access for disabled passengers to new rail vehicles and include, among other features, a requirement for a boarding aid, either a ramp or lift (where the gap exceeds prescribed dimensions), dedicated wheelchair spaces and on-board accessible toilets for those trains in which toilet facilities are provided.
<P>

<a name="10123w07.html_para1">The Regulations specify the maximum wheelchair dimensions that can be accommodated in regulated vehicles. The dimensions of the occupied "reference" wheelchair are set at an overall width of 700 mm, length of 1,200 mm and height of 1,350 mm. These dimensions are based on the international wheelchair standard. This is bigger than the majority of wheelchairs in this country and is able to meet the needs of almost all wheelchair users. There may be some scooters which exceed these dimensions, or in addition, there may be operational reasons why some scooters cannot safely be carried on trains. These dimensions were set after extensive consultation and with the agreement of our statutory advisers on the transport needs of disabled people, the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee. The dimensions also have to be technically achievable within the constraints of vehicle design and operation.
<P>

<a name="10123w07.html_para2">The DDA does not allow for an "end" date to be set by which all rail vehicles must comply with the Regulations. However, the Disability Rights Task Force, in their report to the Government, have recommended that this point 



<P>
<P><I>23 Jan 2001 : Column: 521W</I><P>
should be addressed in any future disability legislation. We are now in discussion with the industry about how that recommendation can be taken forward.
<P>

<a name="10123w07.html_para3">For existing trains, the Rail Regulator is currently revising his Code of Practice, "Meeting the needs of Disabled Passengers", which I understand will deal with refurbishment of existing vehicles.
<P>

<a name="10123w07.html_para4">Clearly, disabled people need to have reliable information about whether their mobility equipment can be accommodated. My Department is therefore working with the wheelchair manufacturing industry to ensure that disabled people are able to make their choice of a scooter or wheelchair based on their particular life style, including their transport needs.

 The Government's holding of Railtrack shares originates from the time of the Railtrack flotation in 1996 when some 4 million shares were held back in order to meet a contractual obligation to distribute bonus shares to shareholders who held their shares for three years. Some 3 million were distributed as bonus shares on 31 May 1999. The residual shareholding represents 0.2 per cent. of Railtrack's share capital of 500 million shares.

<a name="10123w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="10123w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 My Department does not make provision to meet the costs of oil pollution in ports. Compensation for oil pollution damage resulting from spills of persistent oil carried in bulk as cargo by tankers is available from the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, under the framework of the 1992 Protocols to the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1969 and the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage 1971. UK legislation applies strict liability for all oil pollution from shipping, and this therefore obliges non-tanker owners to meet the costs up to the limits according to the ships' tonnage under the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims 1976.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what impact the adoption of the accounting requirements of Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 15 had on London Underground Ltd.'s annual accounts for 1999-2000; and what impact they will have on its accounts for 2001-01.  [147206]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10123w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The accounts of London Underground Ltd. are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985, which requires compliance with all accounting standards. Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 15, issued by the Accounting Standards Board, became mandatory for accounting periods ending on or after 23 March 2000 and has consequently been adopted by London Underground in its accounts for the year ended 31 March 2000.
<P>

<a name="10123w08.html_para2">FRS15 sets out the principles of accounting for tangible fixed assets. As well as imposing stricter rules on the allocation of overheads to capital projects, the standard requires that expenditure previously treated as renewals must now either be charged to cost of operations, or capitalised as an addition to fixed assets.
<P>

<a name="10123w08.html_para3">The revised accounting policies have reduced London Underground Ltd.'s gross operating margin for 1999-2000 to &#163;153.6 million (from &#163;293.6 million <sup>1</sup> ), and increased its operating loss before grants to &#163;145.2 million (from &#163;101.2 million <sup>1</sup> ). These are, however, purely accounting changes. Neither affects the amount of cash available, or Government grant paid, to London Underground Ltd.
<P>

<a name="10123w08.html_para4">In 2000-01, the changes in allocation of cost will reduce London Underground Ltd.'s gross operating margin and the value of its investment programme from the budgeted values published in the LT Annual Business Plan to &#163;135.6 million (from &#163;260 million) and &#163;360.6 million (from &#163;400 million) respectively. However, as these are again purely accounting changes, neither the External Finance Limit for the year, nor physical delivery of the investment programme, will be affected.
<P>

<a name="10123w08.html_para5">The actual figures for 2000-01 will be published in due course.

<P>
<a name="10123w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 This is an operational matter for Railtrack. I understand from Railtrack that, since Hatfield, 17 speed restrictions were imposed on the lines between London Waterloo and Exeter. Three of these restrictions remain in place but are expected to be withdrawn by 28 February. Of the 17 restrictions, six were on the slow lines over which trains from Waterloo to Exeter do not normally run. The remaining restrictions are north of Basingstoke. The age of the rail affected varied.

 This is an operational matter for Railtrack. I understand from Railtrack that the rails along the route between London Waterloo and Exeter are tested at various frequencies depending on the speed and number of trains. Teams work continuously testing all routes, so the date that the rail was last tested could only be given for a specific location.

 All coaches and minibuses that carry groups of children on organised trips must have seat belts available. This applies whether or not they are being used for school transport. Guidance on this requirement was issued in 1996, and copies are available from my Department on request as well as being available on the DETR website.

We intend to prepare guidance for businesses on complying with this legislation.

 <i>[holding answer 22 January 2001]:</i> The Central Science Laboratory (CSL) has delegated functions under part VI of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to carry out inspection and enforcement with respect to the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms. The GM inspectorate at CSL carried out audits of 14 seed importing companies during 2000. The inspectors concentrated on auditing companies importing oilseed rape seeds for sowing in autumn 2000. All of the main rape seed importers (13 companies) were inspected. The inspectors have now turned their attention to the importers of beet seeds and spring sown oilseed rape. One beet seed importer had been audited before 31 December 2000. The inspections are continuing.
<P>

<a name="10123w09.html_para2">In all cases the GM inspectors checked the companies' records to confirm whether they were operating proper checks and procedures to ensure that no unauthorised GM material was being imported. No problems were identified.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he has received advice from the economic regulation group of the Civil Aviation Authority on the economic regulatory regime for the public/private partnership for National Air Traffic Services Ltd.; and if he will make a statement.

<a name="10123w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The monopoly services provided by the National Air Traffic Services Ltd. public/private partnership will be subject to price regulation by the RPI-X method, which is the standard model for monopoly regulation in the United Kingdom. The charge cap, or "X" factor, will be set for a period of five years and will, for the first five year period only, be set by the Government.
<P>

<a name="10123w10.html_para0">We received advice from the CAA in August which set out how they proposed to approach the economic regulation of NATS and recommended that the "X" factor for NATS' UK monopoly services be set at 5 per cent. per year for each of the first five years. We have considered this advice carefully, alongside representations from NATS and the projections of bidders as the sale process developed, and have decided to set charge capping at 2.2 per cent. for 2001, 3.0 per cent. for 2002, 4.0 per cent. for 2003, and 5.0 per cent. for each of 2004 and 2005. There will thus be a progressive tightening across the initial years following the introduction of the PPP.
<P>

<a name="10123w10.html_para1">Furthermore, since delays are a major concern to airlines, we have decided that the charge cap should include a delay term, so that the "X" factor will automatically tighten, thereby reducing NATS' revenues, if delays increase beyond their present level. We are setting the maximum delay term at &#163;2 million per year for 2001-02, and &#163;5.7 million per year for 2003-05.
<P>

<a name="10123w10.html_para2">The CAA's advice on the charge cap was based on a well-considered and comprehensive analysis of NATS' operational and investment plans and the potential for efficiency savings. And we are satisfied that the advice fully reflected the Government's, and the CAA's, commitment to giving the highest priority to safety.
<P>

<a name="10123w10.html_para3">In reaching our decision, we have been concerned to achieve a smooth transition to the PPP, which we believe will be encouraged by such price control in its first few years. This will better enable NATS' management to focus on getting the change and investment programmes right during the early years of the PPP, including the commissioning of the Swanwick Centre, the development of the New Scottish Centre, and further investment in the capacity wanted by airlines.
<P>

<a name="10123w10.html_para4">NATS' management accept that efficiency gains of the level required to meet the charge cap we are setting, while challenging, are achievable without detriment to NATS operations.

 The coalition goes to exceptional lengths to avoid hitting anything other than the intended target, including through the use of very strict target clearance procedures and precision guided munitions. We also routinely conduct painstaking battle damage assessment after every bomb is dropped.

Faced with these acts of aggression coalition aircraft, acting entirely in self-defence, only ever target Iraqi military facilities that pose an immediate and serious threat to their safety. It is deeply regrettable that they are forced to take this action, but they are only acting in self-defence. The risk of civilian casualties is always a major consideration during the very careful target selection process and only precision-guided weapons are used where there is any risk of civilian casualties.

It is in his interests to do so. We learnt long ago not to give too much credence to these allegations.

 The introduction into service of the Brimstone and Maverick weapon systems will give us an enhanced capability against single targets, particularly those which are heavily armoured. Cluster bombs will retain a utility against a concentration of lighter armoured vehicles and area targets such as surface-to-air missile sites and logistics storage depots. Brimstone, Maverick and cluster bombs are complementary systems and in any future conflict the weapon considered to be most appropriate to the circumstances would be employed.

 Last August, the Government announced and published revisions to the Joint Home Office and Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions guidance on managing unauthorised camping. The revised version removed the term "toleration" in relation to the decision as to whether to take action to evict travellers. It also clarified the guidance on eviction, setting out the statutory powers and taking into account court rulings on the use of those powers.

[144925]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10123w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 It is not possible to answer this question on the basis of routinely collected data. A special data collection exercise would involve disproportionate cost. Police and magistrates court records indicate that in 1999 just over 40 per cent. of those charged or referred to court on a rape charge were held or remanded in custody, although these data are of poor quality. Of those committed to the Crown court, more than half (53 per cent.) were held in custody. Due to the seriousness of the offence, those bailed would invariably be subject to conditions--36 per cent. in recent Home Office research. Home Office research also suggests that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) discontinues very few rape cases after charge on the basis of a withdrawal by the alleged victim. Where victims withdraw, this usually occurs while the case is still under investigation by the police, leading either to the categorisation of the case as a "no crime" or to no further police action.
<P>

<a name="10123w13.html_para0">No information is available about the number of convicted and jailed rape offenders who are released following a withdrawal by the alleged victim. In such cases, release would usually follow a reference of the case back to the Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission and the Commission does not maintain statistics on a basis which would enable the question to be answered.

 I refer the hon. Member to my answers of 8 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 661W and 30 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 213W. An investigation by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate was commissioned following allegations about Harlan which were made available to the Home Office by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) on 29 June 1999.
<P>

<a name="10123w13.html_para3">I received the Chief Inspector's report on 17 December after a thorough investigation into a complex series of allegations. Generally, the establishment was found to be well-run and the level of compliance good. One breach of a condition of certification was confirmed--two animal rooms were not identified in the documentation as having been checked as required on two dates during the last two years. The Certificate holder received an admonition, and reassurances from the management about staffing levels were sought and received.

 It is not currently National Asylum Support Service (NASS) policy to allow our partners in dispersal areas to issue vouchers directly to NASS- supported asylum seekers.

 <i>[holding answer 22 January 2001]:</i> The Lancashire constabulary have provided information on the numbers of recorded crimes for this area for the years ending March 1997 and March 2000, which is given in the table. It should be noted that there was a change in counting rules for recorded crime on 1 April 1998, which means that direct comparisons cannot be made between data for before and after this date. Nationally, the change in counting rules impacted most on violence against the person (which, for example, now includes common assault and assault on a constable), fraud and forgery, and drug and other offences, the latter two of which are combined here as "other" offences. The numbers of recorded crimes in these three categories were inflated nationally by the change in counting rules by 118 per cent., 61 per cent. and 215 per cent. respectively. The change in counting rules resulted in an increase in overall recorded crime figures of 14 per cent. for England and Wales as a whole.

It is run by the interdepartmental Children and Young People's Unit, based in DfEE. &#163;380 million is available over three years to fund services to prevent children and their families suffering the consequences of poverty. It will form part of a range of measures to ensure that vulnerable children get the best start in life, remain on track in their early years, flourish in secondary school and choose to stay on in education and training at 16.

By April 2004 all areas across England will have access to the fund.

<a name="10123w14.html_para12">The amount of funding each area will be able to apply for will reflect the numbers of children in poverty in each area, but will vary according to the content and quality of the proposals.

These show that levels of literacy and numeracy were, England (21 per cent. to 23 per cent.), respectively Wales (24 per cent. to 25 per cent.), Scotland (23 per cent. to 24 per cent.) and Northern Ireland (24 per cent. to 25 per cent.).

 The charter was proclaimed on 7 December at the Nice European Council.
<P>

<a name="10123w16.html_para2">Promotion of human rights is something to be proud of. The charter sets out for the first time, clearly and in a single document, a range of fundamental rights, freedoms and principles recognised within the EU. People need to know their rights, and the EU institutions need to respect them. The charter will help on both counts.

<a name="10123w16.html_para3">The charter is a political declaration; it is not legally binding. It was neither incorporated, nor attached nor referred to in the treaties, just as we said.

 Ministers and officials keep in regular contact with representatives of the Iraqi opposition on all aspects of our Iraq policy.

<a name="10123w17.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Ten years after the outbreak of the Gulf war, we remember the allied service-men who lost their lives in the successful operation to expel Iraq from Kuwait. Kuwait is now prospering free from Iraqi tyranny. However, we should not forget the Kuwaitis missing since the occupation. I urge Iraq to co-operate with the Tripartite Commission, which is tracing the Kuwaiti missing.
<P>

<a name="10123w17.html_para2">Since the Gulf war, our policy has contained the threat posed by the Iraqi regime. In the last 10 years, Iraq has not used chemical weapons against the Kurds or Iran or invaded its neighbours. Nor has it fired Scud missiles at Israel or Saudi Arabia. Before sanctions, Iraq did all of these. That is why Britain will continue to support sanctions and the no-fly zones until Iraq no longer represents a threat. This anniversary should be a reminder to us all of why it is necessary to contain the Iraqi threat now as it was 10 years ago.
<P>

<a name="10123w17.html_para3">United Nations Security Council resolution 1284 offers Iraq a way out of sanctions. It allows for the suspension of sanctions in return for Iraqi co-operation with UN weapons inspectors. Britain wants to see sanctions suspended. Critics of sanctions should unite with us in calling on the regime to take up this offer rather than playing into Saddam's hands by supporting his defiance of the UN and international law and prolonging sanctions. Sanctions could be suspended in a matter of months if UN weapons inspectors are allowed into Iraq to control Saddam's biological, chemical and nuclear weapons capabilities, which are threatening the region.

Staff also have powers to obtain information in support of an application where required and to check information provided by applicants against the relevant details already held. Risk assessments of applications based on accumulated Inland Revenue and DSS experience of fraudulent claims are also carried out, together with formal inquiries by specialist staff into applications identified as requiring further investigation.
