 The coalition Government are committed to safeguarding the UK's strong manufacturing base whilst reducing carbon emissions and increasing energy security. In recognition of this, and with the support of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, officials are working in the UK and in Europe to look at the impact of carbon reduction policies on energy intensive industries in the UK, including the ceramics sector. With the exception of ceramic bricks, all ceramic sectors were deemed at risk of carbon leakage in the European Commission's assessment under the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) Directive. However, on Thursday 18 May, with support from the UK delegation, the European Climate Change Committee voted to add ceramic bricks, roof tiles and clay pipes to the list of sectors at risk of carbon leakage. Ceramic bricks will now receive 100% of their allocated EU ETS allowances for free thereby reducing operational costs and supporting the sector to stay internationally competitive in the face of increased action on climate change.</p>

 The Government are keen to avoid a ‘one size fits all’ approach to setting distances between wind turbines and nearby properties and consider that impacts are best assessed on a case by case basis so that local factors can be taken fully into account, regardless of whether applications are dealt with at national or local level. Where applications are dealt with at local level (the large majority of applications in England), we believe that local councils should have the opportunity to assess these matters on behalf of their local community.</p>

 Implementation of the online copyright infringement measures in the Digital Economy Act requires a number of steps to be taken. Implementation of the initial measures cannot happen until Ofcom has approved a code of practice, incorporating provisions relating to the sharing of costs which must be approved by Parliament. The judgment from the recent judicial review will require changes to our original proposal on how costs are shared and we are currently considering the changes which will need to be made to the cost-sharing Statutory Instrument in light of this. Once we are clear on what changes need to be made both the Statutory Instrument and the draft code will need to be notified to the European Commission under the Technical Standards Directive. Separately, the Government commissioned a report by Ofcom into the workability of sections 17 and 18 of the Act. That report is due to be delivered shortly. I will set out what action we plan to take as soon as we have had an opportunity to consider the report and all other relevant factors.</p>

Prior to the creation of the Ministry of Justice on 9 May 2007, numbers of ASBOs issued were reported to Home Office by the Court Service.

<sup>(3)</sup> ASBOs may be breached more than once and in more than one year. This table presents instances when an ASBO was breached for the first time in the years shown. Many of these breaches will be as a result of an ASBO that was issued in an earlier year and many of these will also be as a result of an ASBO issued following conviction. For this reason breach rates cannot be computed from the figures presented in this table. Breaches are counted in this table by area of issue.
<i>Note</i>:
Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.

               <a name="11052480000210"> The increase over the previous 12-month period in weapons delivered by UK air assets is mainly a function of two factors: additional deployed UK reaper remotely piloted air systems; and intelligence-led targeting of military objectives as a result of enhanced coalition surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities. Use of force remains closely regulated and the avoidance of civilian casualties has been paramount; we carefully select the type of weapon in every engagement to ensure the most appropriate munition is used to deliver the required effect, while minimising the risk to civilians.</p>

 The Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) was reviewed under the independent chairmanship of the former Chief of Defence Staff, Admiral the Lord Boyce in February 2010. Lord Boyce was supported by an Independent Scrutiny Group (ISG) made up of independent professionals, the war widows association, ex-service organisations, and families' representatives who thoroughly examined every aspect of the scheme, including the method of paying compensation to those who have been injured. Lord Boyce and the ISG unanimously concluded that the scheme was fundamentally sound, but required significant improvement in some areas.</p>

Within this scheme supplementary allowances are available to cover additional costs that fall to war pensioners as a result of the condition for which they receive a pension, such as the clothing allowance. No claims for bed linen have met the required criteria under which supplementary allowances are given, and therefore, there are no plans to add such an allowance to the War Pension Scheme.</p>

 In signing the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) programme's Production, Sustainment and Follow-on Development (PSFD) Memorandum of Understanding in 2006 the UK secured a bi-lateral agreement with the US concerning our requirements for operational sovereignty on the UK Joint Combat Aircraft (JCA). This includes a requirement that all long-term support and maintenance for the JCA will be carried out in the UK, using the economies of scale of the JSF global supply chain to deliver an efficient support solution to the UK and its partners. We have yet to estimate what percentage of the annual support costs will be expended in the UK as the details of the JSF global support solution will not be finalised for several years.</p>

Currently there are 36 UK civilian personnel, 34 UK service personnel and 13 contractor personnel working on the JCA programme, at an expected total running cost, including salaries, of approximately £9 million in the current financial year. We expect these numbers to grow slightly over the next four financial years, however, numbers have not been finalised due to ongoing restrictions on departmental employment.</p>

Following the initial delivery of 595 linear metres of relief supplies, corrugated sheeting and logistics equipment, including fork lift trucks and four-wheel drive vehicles, Largs Bay remained on station delivering essential supplies on behalf of international aid agencies to stricken communities around Haiti. This task could only be undertaken by sea due to extensive road and airport infrastructure damage and Largs Bay was particularly suited to the task due to the unique beach landing capability. Largs Bay's effort was part of the wider UK £20 million contribution that helped to provide more than 380,000 people with food, clean water and medical care.</p>

 In 2009-10 the average farm business income on dairy farms in England, as measured by the Farm Business Survey, amounted to around £56,000. Within this, over £24,000 was contributed by agricultural activities on the farm. The remainder came from agri-environment schemes, farm-based diversified activities and the single payment. Forecasts for 2010-11 suggest that average farm business income on dairy farms in England will fall by around 24% to some £42,500. This is in line with other types of livestock farm and reflects principally higher costs, particularly those associated with purchased feed.</p>

 All pig producers in the European Union (EU) have to comply with EU pig welfare rules. UK legislation currently requires higher welfare standards for pigs, in a few respects, than in other EU countries. The most significant being that in the UK close-confinement sow stalls have been unilaterally banned since 1999. Similar requirements will not be introduced across the EU until 2013 which will help to provide a more level playing field for UK producers.</p>

 All pig producers in the EU have to comply with EU pig welfare rules. UK legislation currently requires higher welfare standards for pigs, in a few respects, than in other EU countries. The most significant being that in the UK close confinement sow stalls have been unilaterally banned since 1999. Similar requirements will not be introduced across the EU until 2013 which will help to provide a more level playing field for UK producers.</p>

 Set-aside was originally introduced as a means to control production. Its requirements also provided a range of environmental benefits that helped biodiversity by providing winter and summer nesting habitat and food sources for farmland birds, as well as supporting a range of more common plants, insects and mammals and improving the quality of soil and water. The set-aside mechanism was abolished from January 2009. Consequently, many of the recognised environmental benefits of set-aside land may have been lost.</p>

My priority is to ensure the campaign is a success. I do not believe that Government should regulate if the farming industry delivers enhanced benefits for wildlife in agricultural areas. A CFE working group has been set up to assess and measure the environmental outcomes the work being done by farmers is delivering.</p>

 The Research and Evidence division of the Department for International Development (DFID) is responsible for systematically collecting and synthesising evidence and data on international development. This is produced as a global public good available for all users including our own country offices and policy division to ensure our aid programmes are based on evidence of what works. This division has not initiated any substantial longitudinal research in the last 12 months. A number of projects, however, have been initiated (63), terminated (four), and amended (three) in the last 12 months, though the majority of our research and data collection (over 100 projects) have not been amended that period. I have placed a list of the 63 centrally-funded research projects that have been initiated by DFID in the last 12 months in the Library of the House. Research and data collection is also funded by the regional divisions in DFID to inform their own operations.</p>

 We are currently working to determine whether a reliable estimate of the number of people reached through multilaterals in these areas can be readily attributed. This is a complex calculation depending on variable factors including our share of the core funding to each multilateral, how they allocate their funds within sectors and the results they are planning to achieve in 2011-12.</p>

 Through our bilateral programmes, the Department for International Development (DFID) has allocated £23,000,000 to Bangladesh and £4,000,000 to Nepal for water and sanitation from 2011-12 to 2014-15. Among other gains, we estimate that an additional 110,000 people will benefit from safe latrines in Nepal by 2015 as a direct result of these UK funds. In Bangladesh, we estimate an additional 1.28 million people will benefit from increased access to safe drinking water; 613,000 will benefit from improved sanitation facilities and about 20 million will be reached through hygiene awareness.</p>

There are no records of parenting orders being issued in 1998. The full breakdown by year is provided in table 1.

The number of parenting orders granted following successful truancy prosecutions between September 2004 and August 2010 is 2,829. One parenting order was granted in cases of exclusion or serious misbehaviour at school during this same period. We believe that usage of those orders is low as parenting orders for behaviour are a last resort measure, intended only for those few cases where parents are unwilling to engage with voluntary measures. The Department does not collect parenting orders data based on gender basis.</p>

The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they have were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.  2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.  3.

 As a measure of safety and decency in prisons, the National Offender Management Service collects data on the average hours per weekday that prisoners are unlocked. By subtracting the average hours unlocked from the 24 hours in a day it is possible to estimate hours spent locked in cell. It should be noted that the latter will include hours when prisoners are asleep.</p>

To support the consultation, Atkins was commissioned to develop and review strategic alternatives to a national high speed rail network, which were published in its report of February 2011 entitled 'High Speed Rail Strategic Alternatives Study: Strategic Alternatives to the Proposed Y Network'.</p>

 As at December 2010, the latest point for which staffing levels have been published, there was a ratio of 19 claimant unemployed people for each member of total Jobcentre Plus staffing. However we are unable to provide a ratio of unemployed people to Jobcentre Plus staff for May 2012, as this information is currently not available in the format requested. The spending review 2010 announced that DWP would deliver 26% savings in real terms from its core budget over the four year period to 2015. Jobcentre Plus will contribute to these savings by driving up efficiency in the way it works through more use of its online services and implementing ideas that help improve processes and productivity.</p>

Managers will also be there to answer or deal with any questions or concerns that they may have. Where the manager does not have the information to answer the question, we have introduced an issues escalation process.

1. Figures are presented in £ billions and are rounded to the nearest £0.1 billion.
2. Forecasts assume rebate rates for contracted-out defined benefit scheme members of 1.4% on employee contributions and 3.4 per cent on employer contributions from 2012-13 onwards. These are the rates that have been set by the Government for the period 2012-13 to 2016-17. See The Social Security (Reduced Rates of Class 1 Contributions, Rebates and Minimum Contributions) Order 2011, available at:
http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/1036/contents/made
3. Contracting out on a defined contribution basis is to be abolished from 2012-13 onwards.
4. Forecasts are based on Government Actuary's Department assumptions about future contracted-out defined benefit scheme membership.
5. Options for reform of the state pension system are put forward in:

 Funding for the new enterprise allowance in Wales, as elsewhere, will be dependent upon the numbers of customers who take-up the new enterprise allowance including those referred to the mentoring service, claiming the weekly allowance and successfully applying for the loan. There is not therefore a fixed proportion of money allocated to the operation of the NEA, but we would expect expenditure to be broadly in line with the proportion of eligible JSA claimants in Wales.</p>

In addition, they may not have achieved a full contribution record for a UK retirement pension. However, the rights they have already acquired in the UK will be preserved, and in due course they are entitled to receive the proportion of the retirement pension they have accrued even if they are not resident in the UK. In those circumstances they can increase their UK contribution record, if they wish to do so, by purchasing additional years of contributions in order to receive the maximum state retirement pension.</p>

1. These statistics are based on households below average income (HBAI) data sourced from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). This uses disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD equivalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.
2. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.
3. The reference period for households below average income figures are single financial years. Three survey years have been combined as regional single year estimates are subject to volatility.
4. Numbers of children in low-income households have been rounded to the nearest 100,000, while proportions have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.
5. These statistics are based on incomes before housing costs.
6. Relative poverty is defined as children living in households with less than 60% of contemporary median household income.
7. These statistics are publicly available in the households below average income report on the DWP website:

 Maintaining a complete and accurate electoral register is the responsibility of electoral registration officers (EROs). More can be done to support completeness and accuracy. So we have announced plans to speed up the implementation of individual electoral registration in 2014, which will ensure that only those entitled to vote will get on the register. We are also trialling data matching, which will launch in June this year, to help identify people missing from the register. If successful, we will consider rolling this out across the country.</p>

Interviews were conducted annually from 2004 (when the respondents were academic age 13) to 2010 (when they were aged 19). This study was designed to enhance understanding of the transitions made by young people from the latter part of compulsory education into early adulthood. It collected a wide range of information pertaining to those issues, including data on outcomes and achievements, education, employment and benefits, relationships and behaviours, volunteering and life satisfaction.</p>

 Under the Agency Workers Regulations 2010 the definition of an agency worker excludes those who are in business on their own account where the status of the hirer is that of a client or customer of a “profession or business undertaking”—where there is a business to business relationship. Simply putting earnings through a limited company would not in itself put the individuals beyond the possible scope of the regulations.</p>

 A review of the agency workers directive will be carried out by the European Commission, in consultation with member states and social partners at Community level, by 5 December 2013. In addition BIS will be closely monitoring the impact of the agency workers regulations in the UK and will have conducted a post-implementation review by December 2013. The main source of information for the formal evaluation and ongoing monitoring is likely to be the Labour Force Survey/Annual Population Survey but other surveys and research may also be relevant carried out by Government or other bodies.</p>

 Manufacturing is vital to achieving strong, balanced and sustainable growth and we are committed to improving skills at all levels to support that growth. In schools we have introduced the English Baccalaureate which will help to drive up participation and attainment rates in mathematics and science, and we will also provide additional support to improve take up. At technician level we are expanding demand-led apprenticeships to address skill needs at intermediate and associate professional level, including manufacturing, and we are growing the number of higher apprenticeships with a focus on advanced manufacturing.</p>

In higher education we continue to provide additional funding for science, technology and engineering degrees and want universities to ensure that students are aware of the benefits of undertaking these subjects. We want businesses to engage more with universities in course design and work placements so that businesses such as manufacturing employers can help develop courses that will provide attractive employment to sustain and strengthen their competitiveness.</p>

            <p class="tabletext">The Intellectual Property Office (IPO) is an Executive Agency of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS). The IPO does not employ full time trade union officials, but four of its employees are entitled to work part time on trade union activities. Three of these have a full time equivalent annual salary over £25,900. In 2010/11 the cost to the IPO of employing these staff on trade union duties was approximately £13,785. IPO is a trading fund so does not rely on public funds.</p>

In 2009 the National Chemotherapy Advisory Group report, “Chemotherapy Services in England: Ensuring Quality and Safety”, recommended that chemotherapy services should be localised where clinically appropriate and that patients' views on the experience of receiving chemotherapy should be sought and acted upon.

For example, a patient may be prepared to travel further for surgery from a specialist provider with better outcomes, but may wish to receive treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy closer to their home. A copy of the strategy has already been placed in the Library.</p>

<sup>(2)</sup> Figures based on a sample and costed using standard price lists, either the drug tariff or, if the drug is not listed, the drug manufacturer’s price list. The figures therefore do not necessarily represent the actual amounts paid by the hospitals.
<sup>(3)</sup> Data includes all drugs dispensed in national health service hospitals regardless of patient, so will include drugs dispensed to private patients in private wards within NHS hospitals as long as they have been dispensed via the hospital pharmacy. The extent of this varies from hospital to hospital.
<sup>(4)</sup> National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidance recommended ranibizumab on the condition that the manufacturer offers a patient access scheme. Under the scheme, the cost of ranibizumab beyond 14 injections in the treated eye is met by the manufacturer. We do not have data on the number of injections provided by the manufacturer under the scheme and therefore the data does not reflect the impact of the scheme.

<sup>(2 )</sup>In December 2010, PCTs were informed of their total 2011-12 revenue allocations which include:
 2011-12 recurrent revenue allocations; and
 non-recurrent allocations for primary dental services, pharmaceutical services and general ophthalmic services.
 Allocations for support for joint working between health and social care were announced separately in 2010-11.
<sup>(3 )</sup>Total revenue allocations refer to the allocations listed above. This is the main funding source for PCTs.
<sup>(4 )</sup>Comparisons between allocation years cannot as a rule be made as allocations were not made on a like for like basis. The 2010-11 figures have been especially adjusted to make them more comparable with those  for 2011-12.

 This information is not collected centrally. Eligibility for national health service continuing health care does not depend on a specific health condition. It is the extent of the individual's assessed primary health care needs, and the care required to meet those needs, rather than diagnosis, that determine eligibility.

We will also embark on a round of formal and structured engagement with local authorities and other interested parties, once the consultation is published. Findings from this engagement and responses to the consultation document will be considered in the development of the necessary legislative framework to introduce the new system to replace council tax benefit.</p>

 Charitable giving is a personal matter for individuals, although it is encouraged by Government. All Government Ministers have pledged to undertake a “one day challenge” with a charity or community group of their choice. This is a clear and public commitment by Ministers to give their time to help others. The pledge aims to inspire others to consider how they might be able to support their communities to benefit themselves, as well as their chosen organisations.</p>
