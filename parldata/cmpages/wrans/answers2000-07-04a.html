<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General what the date was of publication of the last edition of "The Judge Over Your Shoulder"; what plans he has to update it; if he will place a copy of the most up to date edition in the Library; and if he will make a statement.  [128929]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 A third edition of "The Judge Over Your Shoulder" was published in March 2000. There are two versions: one essentially for administrators, and the other for lawyers.
<P>

<a name="00704w01.html_para0">I am arranging for a copy of each version to be placed in the Library. They are also on the Treasury Solicitor's internet website.

<a name="00704w01.html_sbhd1"><H4><center>Staff Secondments</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General which companies or partnerships have seconded staff to the Law Officers' Departments since May 1997; how many staff have been seconded; and who pays for seconded staff.  [128470]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w01.html_spmin1"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 Secondments and attachments are part of the Interchange initiative, which promotes the exchange of people and good practice between the civil service and other organisations. Before an Interchange can occur, all parties must be satisfied that no conflict of interest arises.
<P>

<a name="00704w01.html_para1">Since May 1997, there have been no secondments of staff from outside the civil service to either the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers or the Treasury Solicitor's Department.
<P>

<a name="00704w01.html_para2">Since May 1997, there have been four staff on secondment to the Serious Fraud Office. Two of the secondments had begun before May 1997. KPMG, Hacker Young, Pannell Kerr Foster (all accountancy firms) and Allen and Overy (a firm of solicitors) each sent one of their staff on secondment. The Serious Fraud Office bore all the cost of the staff member seconded from Allen and Overy and in the other cases made a major contribution to the cost.
<P>

<a name="00704w01.html_para3">One person has been seconded to the Crown Prosecution Service from the Royal Bank of Scotland for a period of three weeks. The Royal Bank of Scotland bore the cost of this secondment.

 The Social Exclusion Unit is staffed by a mixture of civil servants and external secondees. They come from a number of Government Departments and organisations with experience of tackling social exclusion. The members of the Unit range from New Dealers to an assistant Director of a local authority. Their previous earnings are not a factor in their appointment.
<P>

<a name="00704w01.html_para4">Advisers to the Unit are on secondment, and are not paid for by the Unit. They are appointed for their expertise and experience.

To ask the Prime Minister what recent estimate he has made of the number of war crime murders committed in Kosovo, broken down by ethnic origin of victims <i>(a)</i> before NATO intervention, <i>(b)</i> after NATO air strikes commenced and <i>(c)</i> after the insertion of KFOR.  [128108]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w01.html_spmin4"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia estimate that 10,000 Kosovar Albanians were killed in Kosovo between June 1998 and 12 June 1999. We broadly share this assessment. Of these we estimate 500 were killed before 20 March 1999. KFOR states 430 murders were committed in Kosovo between 12 June and 31 December 1999 across all ethnic communities. There are no official figures for this year, but estimates suggest six murders per week are committed in Kosovo.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w01.html_spmin6"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 We are following Mr. Gusinsky's case closely and have raised it with the Russian authorities on a number of occasions, to establish more details and to make them aware of the concerns the case has raised in the UK over media freedoms. We have also made it clear that if there is a case to answer it is important the due legal process is observed and that the judicial process is seen to be wholly independent.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make a statement on the decision by the European Commission to decrease the export refunds for hatching eggs.  [126821]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Nick Brown </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 June 2000]:</i> The small change to the export refund for hatching eggs introduced in May was in response to a reduction in the euro/dollar exchange rate. To ignore such currency movements when considering export subsidies would be a breach of WTO requirements and would not represent effective use of EU funds.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Nick Brown </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 June 2000]:</i> I am aware of possible analytical techniques which could be employed for detecting the presence of GM material in non-GM seeds, but have not received specific advice on the lowest level of GM contamination which can be reliably identified in non-GM seed. This question is being considered in the context of the on-going discussions taking place within the EC and the OECD on the methods of detection of GM seeds in non-GM seed.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what was the outcome of the Environment Council held in Luxembourg on 22 and 23 June; and if he will make a statement.  [128030]<P>

<P>
<a name="00704w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I represented the UK at the Environment Council in Luxembourg on 22 June 2000, accompanied by Sarah Boyack, Scottish Executive Minister for Environment and Transport. Political agreement was reached on two proposals, along with one set of Council Conclusions.
<P>

<a name="00704w03.html_para0">Agreement was reached on two important air quality measures which will deliver significant reductions in transboundary pollutants contributing to problems of acidification and ground level ozone (summer-time smog) throughout the European Union. The first, the National Emissions Ceilings Directive, sets national emission ceilings for 2010 on four air pollutants (sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, volatile organic compounds and ammonia). I agreed to ceilings of 585, 1,167, 1,200 and 297 thousand tonnes respectively for each of the pollutants. A second common position, on an amendment of the 1988 Large Combustion Plants Directive, sets stricter limit values for emissions of oxides of nitrogen, sulphur dioxide and dust from new plant. For existing (pre-1988) plant, limit values will need to be applied from 2008, or equivalent overall reductions achieved through a National Emissions Plan. However, plant with less than 20,000 hours operating life remaining on 1 January 2008 may be exempted. This agreement will see a reduction in acidifying emissions, while flexibility for industry, particularly the power sector, is safeguarded.

<a name="00704w03.html_para1">In advance of the Sixth Conference of Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change, due to take place at The Hague in November, Council Conclusions were agreed setting out the EU position on some of the key issues. Ministers agreed that eligibility for the Clean Development Mechanism should be on the basis of a positive list of safe environmentally sound projects, which excluded nuclear, and that the use of carbon sinks such as forests should not be extended, unless concerns about their scale, scientific and other uncertainties were addressed. The Conclusions also welcomed a Commission communication on a proposed European Climate Change Programme, and its Green Paper on Emissions Trading.

 Local housing authorities are expected to introduce tenant participation compacts from 1 April 2000. I have myself witnessed the signing of these compacts in recent months. We have recently commissioned a major policy evaluation programme of research to look at how best value in housing and compacts are being introduced and developed across the country. The project is expected to run for three to five years; the initial findings will feed into policy development on these issues and will be available next year.

 The method of revenue grant distribution in future years depends on the outcome of the review of revenue grant distribution now taking place.

This follows open and lengthy discussions between representatives of local and central government.
<P>

<a name="00704w03.html_para6">Grants for 2001-02 will be based on the existing standard spending assessment (SSA) system. We announced in the White Paper "Modern Local Government--In Touch With The People", that during the review we intended to keep up to date the data on which grants are based. This would mean that grants for 2001-02 would use the Registrar General's estimates of population at 30 June 1999. These data should be available by 3 October 2000, the deadline for most data for use in the 2000-01 SSA calculations.
<P>

<a name="00704w03.html_para7">The Registrar General continually looks for ways of improving his population estimates. I understand that his estimates for 30 June 1999, due to be published in August, will incorporate improvements to the internal migration component of the estimates that have been discussed with local government and other experts. The estimates will include new migration estimates for the previous year based on the new data source. This increases the population estimate for Lincoln for mid-1998 by over 200.

 <i>[holding answer 3 July 2000]:</i> A Raptor Working Group was set up in 1995 to consider issues arising from perceived conflicts between the recovery of some bird of prey populations and their impact on game birds and moorland management and on racing pigeons. Earlier this year, the group submitted its final report, which includes estimates of raptor population sizes. The figures are taken from the report and show the best estimates of sizes of breeding population for birds of prey in England using data and information, where possible, from published sources. The total number of birds of prey will be greater than these estimates in the post-breeding season owing to the number of fledged young and other non-breeding individuals.

 Following endorsement by the inter-departmental Project Review Group, progress on prospective schemes is monitored to ensure that the final contract conforms with the approved business case. Following contract signature, the Department will be notified of when service payments commence. Payments and grant paid to the local authority are then monitored and subsequently audited by the Audit Commission. It is important that lessons are learnt from existing contracts. All authorities are required to share non-commercial documentation with other local authorities procuring similar projects, and lessons are used in the production of standardised contract documentation and other best- practice guidance.

 As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister set out in answer to a similar question from the hon. Gentleman on 14 July 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 239-40W, we have no information on the seizure of an arms consignment in February 1999 in Antwerp. But we are aware that a shipment of goods originating in Germany, destined for Eritrea, was seized by Belgian Customs authorities in Antwerp in August 1998. The matter remains with the Belgian courts. No charges have been brought as yet.

 We understand that between 100 and 158 people were killed and over 200 injured in the raid on the village of Duma on 19 June. The media reported that large numbers of armed extremists attacked the village, shooting at random and burning over 300 homes. The Regional Military Commander subsequently ordered the security forces to secure the area. On 26 June, President Wahid declared a state of civil emergency in Maluku; since then the situation appears to be calmer.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make a statement on his policy towards European schools following UK teaching practices in respect of dyslexic pupils; which body is responsible for the establishment of curricula and teaching practice in European schools; and to which EU institution that body is responsible.  [128110]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w06.html_spnew3"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The European schools have their own policy and procedures for the integration of pupils with special educational needs, including dyslexic pupils. Decisions on policy and curricular matters are for the European Schools Board of Governors, a body established by international treaty, on which the Governments of all 15 EU member states are represented.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how many child care schemes have been started up using New Opportunities Funds; how many of these schemes continued to operate after the first 12 months; and if he will make a statement.  [128081]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w06.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 By June 2000, awards totalling some &#163;32 million were made to 1,017 individual schemes and to 172 consortia. Each consortium covers from three to more than 40 individual schemes.
<P>

<a name="00704w06.html_para5">The first schemes received their grant in July 1999, and did not begin to function for at least a further month. No scheme has therefore been running for 12 months. NOF has reserved funds for projects that need additional funding, provided they meet certain criteria.




<P>
<P><I>4 Jul 2000 : Column: 124W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00704w06.html_para6">Sustaining schemes in the long term is of paramount importance. Drawing on the experience of the early stages of the programme, I am soon to meet NOF's Chairman Baroness Pitkeathly to consider how the programme can be developed to ensure that schemes can be sustained over time.

 My Department currently provides an annual grant, through the Standards Fund programme, to all local education authorities in England specifically to support measures to improve security in maintained schools in their areas. The Government grant available is &#163;16.5 million, with local education authorities contributing an additional &#163;5.5 million, making a total of &#163;22 million per year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what assessment he has made of the impact of the New Deal for Young People on levels of long-term unemployment among young people in Morecambe and Lunesdale.  [128342]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w07.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The New Deal for Young people is aimed at people aged 18 to 24 who have been claiming unemployment benefits for six months or more.
<P>

<a name="00704w07.html_para1">Claimant unemployment among this group has fallen by 70 per cent. in the three years since April 1997 and by 56 per cent. since April 1998 when the New Deal was introduced. Part of this fall is due to the delivery of a strong and stable economy, but the New Deal for Young People has helped unemployment to fall even faster. The fall of 56 per cent. since the New Deal was introduced compares with a fall of 18 per cent. in total unemployment, 23 per cent. in total youth (18-24) unemployment and 26 per cent. in the total number unemployed for six months or more. The effect of the New Deal is confirmed by independent research from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.
<P>

<a name="00704w07.html_para2">In Morecambe and Lunesdale the falls in unemployment among the New Deal client group have also been substantially faster than for other groups. In the Morecambe and Lunesdale constituency in the two years since April 1998, claimant unemployment among those aged 18-24 unemployed for six months or more has fallen by 59 per cent. from 220 to 91. This compares with a fall of 16 per cent. in total unemployment, 25 per cent. in total youth (18-24) unemployment, and 32 per cent. in the total number unemployed for six months or more.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how many people who have been participants in <i>(a)</i> the New Deal for 18 to 24 year olds, <i>(b)</i> the New Deal for those aged 25 and over and <i>(c)</i> the New Deal for older workers have subsequently enrolled on the New Deal for a second time.

<a name="00704w07.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Jowell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 July 2000]:</i> Latest figures to the end of April 2000 show that 45,930 starts on the New Deal for Young People and 61,720 starts on the New Deal for long-term unemployed adults aged 25 or over were made by people who had previously been on the New Deal. The New Deal 50+ started nationally in April this year and therefore it is too soon for anyone to have re-entered the New Deal. We do not see New Deal as a short term investment and we welcome back those who need the further help that the New Deal offers.

 <i>[holding answer 3 July 2000]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced in April that nearly &#163;8 million will be spent this financial year on extending the Learning Support Unit initiative to cover the primary sector. The intention is that, by the end of the year, 60 pilot units will be running in first phase Excellence In Cities areas. The units will be school-based centres for pupils at risk of exclusion due to behavioural problems, providing them with separate teaching and support programmes tailored to their particular needs.
<P>

<a name="00704w07.html_para3">Additionally, &#163;140 million is available from the Social Inclusion: Pupil Support Standards Fund Grant to help schools and local education authorities tackle poor behaviour and truancy; and a further &#163;6 million has been allocated from the SEN Standards Fund to support projects in 46 local education authorities focusing on early identification and action for primary-age children with behavioural difficulties.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w07.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what discussions his Department has held with the Department of Culture, Media and Sport on extending the number of hours spent on sport in schools.  [128823]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w07.html_spnew5"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 We have set a very clear aspiration that all schools should provide two hours of physical activity a week, both within and outside lesson time. We are now working consistently with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to inspire schools and partners in the sport sector to deliver this through the Sports Strategy. The Implementation Group, which my hon. Friend the Minister for Sport and I have established to drive forward the strategy, is meeting regularly and will report in December 2000.

<P>
<a name="00704w07.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will estimate the cost of advisers to the public sector for private finance initiative projects in schools, as a proportion of the value of the contracts.  [128588]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w07.html_spnew6"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The Department is not directly responsible for the procurement of schools PFI contracts, and therefore does not hold comprehensive information about the costs of external advice. The Department provides financial assistance towards such costs, which is supplemented by project sponsors from their own resources. Experience to date shows that the cost of external advisers for schools PFI projects varies according to the size of scheme and the internal expertise available to project sponsors. External fee costs for large projects involving many schools are typically 1 per cent. or less of total contract costs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how many former Astra Training Services employees have obtained employment following the implementation of the preferential training arrangements.  [128871]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w07.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 No preferential training arrangements have been introduced for former Astra Training Services Ltd. employees. There is an ongoing commitment that former Astra staff will have a guaranteed interview for any externally advertised vacancies that arise within the Department for Education and Employment, including the Employment Service, for which they have the minimum competences being sought. In that regard, individuals who want to be considered for such vacancies have access to my Department's Learning and Development Centres to update their knowledge of the Department and its competence-based recruitment arrangements. However, 



<P>
<P><I>4 Jul 2000 : Column: 127W</I><P>
no central record is kept of their success in gaining employment either in the Department, the wider civil service, or elsewhere.

<a name="00704w07.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what appraisal he has made of the implications of universal hearing screening for neonates for the delivery of services by local education authorities to deaf children under the age of two years.  [128325]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w07.html_spnew8"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Following advice from the National Screening Committee, my hon. Friend the Minister for Public Health agreed that a pilot programme of neonatal hearing screening should be launched later this year. An announcement was made at the annual conference of the National Deaf Children's Society on Friday 23 June.
<P>

<a name="00704w07.html_para5">Pilot programmes will be set up in 20 areas around the country to assess the full implications of introducing a universal neonatal hearing screening programme, including any consequential requirements for education services. This Department will work closely with the Department of Health to ensure that the impact on education services is fully assessed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w08.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Hunter: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence against what criteria proposals for his Department's forthcoming Successor Identification Friend or Foe programme will be assessed; and when he expects to make a decision on this project.  [128256]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Successor Identification Friend or Foe (SIFF) is a complex programme, involving some 40 sea, land and air platform types with total equipment requirements likely to number in the order of 1,000 transponders and 600 interrogators; each set of equipment has to be functionally and physically integrated with the host platform.
<P>

<a name="00704w08.html_para0">Owing to the number and diversity of the platform types, it is not practical to adopt a single prime contractor strategy for management of the whole SIFF programme. As part of the deliverables from the Assessment Phase, "Demonstration and Manufacture" tenders have been submitted by two competing potential suppliers, BAE SYSTEMS and Raytheon Systems Ltd. for supply of equipment and integration with many of the platform types, and by individual platform design authorities for integration with the remainder of the platforms. Evaluation of these tenders is an extensive task, aimed at ensuring that the decision on the choice of equipment supplier and the phasing of the work to be undertaken by the platform design authorities is made on the best overall balance of operational and value-for-money grounds. All relevant assessment criteria, including commercial, technical, logistics, cost and programme management aspects, will be taken into account in this process and I hope that we will be in a position to announce a decision on the programme during the summer.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w08.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Streeter: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence for what reason and for what period the crew of HMS Tireless was accommodated in hotels overseas; what has been the cost per night per person; and if he will make a statement.  [128267]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 HMS Tireless arrived in Gibraltar on 19 May with a propulsion defect. 58 members of the 130-man crew were returned to the UK; the remaining crew are the minimum required for safe upkeep of the vessel. As facilities on board are extremely limited and not conducive to prolonged use alongside, it is normal practice to accommodate submarine personnel ashore if a submarine is alongside for more than three days. Hotel accommodation is being used on a short-term basis as there is currently no suitable service accommodation available. The cost per night including allowances is as follows: Officers &#163;117.60, Senior Rates &#163;92.60 and Junior Rates &#163;75.10/80.10. RFA Fort Rosalie will arrive in Gibraltar by 6 July and she will provide accommodation for all personnel from Tireless for the duration of the repair work.

<a name="00704w08.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Lait: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when he expects to publish the review of pensions for war widows.  [128472]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 My Department is carrying out a major review of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme. This review is looking at all aspects of pensions for members of the armed forces and their dependants, including widows' pensions, and the question of paying widows' pension for life. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State continues to hope to make an announcement about the review during the summer. War widows' pensions are the responsibility of the DSS War Pensions Agency.

<a name="00704w08.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Kidney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when he last agreed guidelines with HM Treasury for greater commercial utilisation of MOD property and assets; and what proportion of its commercial returns may be retained by the MOD under such guidelines.  [128270]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The commercial exploitation of Ministry of Defence assets is conducted in accordance with Treasury guidelines, which are circulated to Departments from time to time, most recently in a Policy and Guidance Note, "Selling Government Services Into Wider Markets", issued in July 1998. As a general rule, the guidelines give each Department generating receipts the right to retain these commercial returns in their entirety.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence for what reasons the Sea Eagle has been withdrawn from service.  [128767]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Work undertaken in the Strategic Defence Review showed that we needed less capability in the field of open ocean anti-surface ship warfare. To this end, it was decided to withdraw the Sea Eagle missile from both the Tornado GRIB and the Sea Harrier, as part of a coherent programme of reduced investment in this area of our maritime capability. Instead, our future investment will be in heavier weapons with larger ranges, such as Harpoon.

 <i>[holding answer 3 July 2000]:</i> No representations have been received from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. There have, however, been detailed negotiations with English Nature over the firing arrangements for the Royal Artillery Day at Larkhill in order to minimise disturbance to nesting sites for stone curlews. English Nature consider that the arrangements

In addition, we are processing claims from widows and dependants through the full medical assessment process as we receive the necessary claims forms from solicitors. This process has been agreed with the solicitors representing the miners and is designed to calculate the compensation that would have been due to the deceased miner, but is now due to the widow and dependants. So far we have completed nearly 300 such assessments for deceased claims, but we expect this number to increase significantly over the coming weeks as the relevant medical records are obtained.

 Nuclear output in 1999 is estimated to have been about 88TWh, forming some 28 per cent. of the total net supply from major power producers. In the DTI's recent Working Paper on energy projections, nuclear output was projected to fall to around 27TWh in 2020, representing a reduction of 61TWh from the 1999 level. If non-fossil sources were to substitute for the 61TWh of output entirely, this would require an increase in output from non-fossil sources of 500 per cent. from current levels or an increase of 67 per cent. from the projected level in 2020. To compensate for the 61TWh

 Multiple sclerosis can be very difficult to diagnose. The usual treatment path is for a patient to be referred to a consultant neurologist by their general practitioner. Once the relationship is established between the patient and the consultant, it would be normal for the patient, whenever it is clinically necessary, to continue seeing that consultant for the management of their condition.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the impact of the European Working Time Directive on junior doctors; and how many junior doctors are working in excess of the directive- recommended hours.  [128802]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We welcome the agreement reached between the Council and the European Parliament to extend the Working Time Directive to junior doctors. The transition period of up to twelve years for implementing the Directive will allow junior doctors' working hours to be reduced in a planned and sustained way while, at the same time, protecting patient services and safeguarding our ambitious and much-needed programme of modernisation for the National Health Service.




<P>
<P><I>4 Jul 2000 : Column: 146W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00704w13.html_para0">The transition period requires, in its initial phase, that no junior doctor should work more than 56 hours a week by 2007. NHS trusts' figures for March 2000 show that 64 per cent. of junior doctors in England meet the full range of hours and rest period targets set out in the juniors' New Deal, including the requirement that they do not work more than 56 hours a week. The 56 hour limit will be incorporated into all junior doctor contracts from August 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w13.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 The measurement exercise was designed so as to ensure that the variation in the results due to sampling should be no more than 1 per cent. (So that for an estimate of x per cent. the true value would have a 95 per cent. confidence interval of x plus 1 per cent. and x minus 1 per cent. or better). In fact the final estimate of the fraud/in error rate had 95 per cent. confidence limits of plus or minus 0.6 per cent.
<P>

<a name="00704w13.html_para1">A sample of forms dispensed by community pharmacists and appliance contractors to people claiming exemption from payment for prescription charges was selected using robust statistical techniques. The selected prescription forms were then subjected to a stringent investigative process to establish whether the patient who had made the claim had done so correctly, in error or fraudulently. Each case was investigated and examined individually and, where necessary, patients were contacted to establish the reasons for inconsistencies in the information given by them. The National Audit Office have examined the methodology used to arrive at the estimates and found that it was sound.

 The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) determines its own processes, within broad guidance from Ministers set out in a "Memorandum of Understanding" of August 1999. We have asked NICE to follow a transparent and well-structured process for its appraisals, giving appropriate interested parties the opportunity to submit evidence, to comment on draft conclusions, and to appeal to a panel independent of those involved in the original judgment. For their appraisal of beta interferon NICE have sought evidence from patient representative organisations and we anticipate that NICE will be well aware from this of the views of individual multiple sclerosis patients.

 The New Opportunities Fund is responsible for funding the healthy living centre initiative. Healthy living centre applicants need to demonstrate that their projects will support national and local health strategies. Healthy living centres will have a key role to play in reducing inequalities and supporting the work of other statutory and voluntary agencies locally.

 <i>[holding answer 8 June 2000]:</i> NMEC has already made it clear that the original business plan assumptions were over-optimistic and its revised business plan, on the basis of 6 million revenue- generating visitors, forecasts commercial income (tickets, merchandise, food, corporate hospitality and events) of &#163;86.1 million. Part of the difference between the original and current forecasts is mitigated by the revenue contingency factored into the original budget. The remaining difference formed part of the NMEC's applications for additional Lottery grant in January 2000 and May 2000. Despite the revision of the business assumptions the Dome is the most successful paying visitor attraction in the UK, achieving 3 million visitors in six months, and is the second most successful in Europe.

 The English Heritage grant will be available as long as it is needed to get this important project off the ground. English Heritage grants are normally time limited and conditional on works starting within six months, and being completed within two years, of the date of offer. However, in this case English Heritage have agreed to hold their grants offer open in the hope that their funding partners will be able to find their share of the funds needed to secure the future of this Grade I listed building at risk.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has encouraged the distributing bodies to continue and enhance the cross-distributor small grants programme, Awards for All, which distributes grants of &#163;500-&#163;5,000 to community-based groups for arts, sports, heritage, charitable and other community activities. The average size of a Lottery grant today is &#163;40,000, down from a peak of more than &#163;250,000 in 1995-96, which means that many more groups are able to benefit from Lottery funds.

<a name="00704w14.html_spnew11"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 In the 12 months to the end of May 2000, the National Lottery raised a total of &#163;1.789 billion for good causes (including money earned on the balance of the National Lottery distribution fund). This equates to an average of &#163;34 million per week.

<P>
<a name="00704w14.html_spnew12"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 The Government are committed to ensuring that Lottery funding is distributed fairly both geographically and across all groups of society. This is reflected in the changes made to Lottery distribution through the National Lottery Act, 1998, and through the revised Policy Directions which my right hon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w14.html_spnew15"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 The National Lottery funds numerous projects which bring widespread benefits to seaside towns. Research jointly commissioned by my Department and the Lottery distributors into Lottery funding in the coalfields and other areas does however suggest that resort and retirement towns have made relatively fewer applications and have received less per capita than the national average. We have set up an action team to take forward recommendations in this research and will explore ways of ensuring that all areas, including seaside towns, receive their fair share in future.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w14.html_spnew16"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 Each National Lottery distributor sets its own levels of expected partnership funding. In doing so they seek an element of partnership funding commensurate with the ability of different kinds of applicants, or applicants in particular areas, to obtain such support. In some instances this may result in 100 per cent. National Lottery funding. Volunteer time and other contributions in kind may be considered as providing partnership support.

 My Department has published and distributed leaflets drawing attention to the Lottery funding available. Similar information is available on the DCMS website www.culture.gov.uk.

<P>
<a name="00704w15.html_spnew9"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 "Safeguarding Social Security" published in March 1999 makes it clear that we want a benefit system which is secure from start to finish. We are committed to taking tough action against Housing Benefit fraud. We have already reformed the anti-fraud financial incentive scheme for local authorities to ensure they continue to be rewarded for detecting cases of genuine benefit fraud and non-residency, but also have the opportunity to earn rewards for successfully prosecuting fraud cases and for adopting the Department's Verification Framework. The Verification Framework helps to secure the administration of Housing Benefit through a series of additional checks, carried out throughout the life of a benefit claim, and 249 local authorities have been paid or accepted funds to implement the Verification Framework.
<P>

<a name="00704w15.html_para1">The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate is conducting inspections of local authorities; to date 58 reports have been published. Last month the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate issued new good practice guidance to improve service delivery and help tackle fraud and error. We have made it abundantly clear to all authorities that when inspections show persistent failings we will use our powers to direct authorities on the standards they are to meet and the timescales for achieving them.
<P>

<a name="00704w15.html_para2">272 local authorities are currently using the Royal Mail "do not redirect" scheme which prevents benefit claimants from using postal redirection arrangements to make false claims to benefit from multiple addresses. To reduce the scope for fraud and error and to streamline the administration of Housing Benefit we have installed Remote Access Terminals to give authorities direct 'on line' access to a range of relevant information on other DSS benefit systems. 388 authorities currently operate at least one terminal and we plan to install terminals in a further 16 authorities by the end of September 2000.
<P>

<a name="00704w15.html_para3">We are also introducing electronic transfer of data to speed up the transfer of information from the Benefits Agency to local authorities and further reduce the scope for fraud and error. So far 191 local authorities have the equipment installed; by this Autumn we expect nearly all local authorities to be using this technology.

<P>

 The information is not available in the form requested. Such information as is available is as follows.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. GDP per head is for the UK, taken from ONS series YBGS--Gross domestic product at market prices, shown in 1995 prices.<P>

2. The highest household income for those children living in poverty (as defined by UNICEF) is 50 per cent. of median equivalised household income before housing costs shown for Great Britain, using data from the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) Series. These figures are based on the Family Expenditure Survey (FES) from 1979 to 1993, and on the Family Resources Survey (FRS) from 1994-95 onwards. These are not consistent with the UK estimates contained in the UNICEF Innocent Report Card "A League Table of Child Poverty in Rich Nations", which are based on different data and methods of estimation.<P>

3. Estimates from the FES relate to the UK while those from the FRS relate to GB. In addition, the estimates derived from the two surveys use slightly different definitions of income: FRS results therefore are not precisely comparable with those from the FES but are considered to be broadly comparable. Self-employed households have been excluded from the analysis.<P>

4. Estimates from the Family Expenditure Survey from 1987 to 1993 are based on a two year rolling average method, and refer to combined years--for example, in the table 1987 is 1987 + 1998.<P>

5. Estimates from the Family Resources Survey are based on data for financial years from 1994-95 onwards. For example, 1994 refers to the financial year 1994-95.<P>

6. Estimates of 50 per cent. of median income before housing costs are based on survey data, and so will be subject to the normal problems associated with survey data including sampling variation and measurement error.<P>

7. Figures for GDP per head and median equivalised household income are not directly comparable, as GDP per head is not equivalised, and they are shown in different price bases.<P>

8. Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;1. <P>

<a name="00704w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Benefit Fraud Inspectorate reports have been published today in respect of Hart district council and Lancaster city council and copies of these reports have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="00704w16.html_para5">Both reports contain recommendations to address weaknesses and help the councils to improve their administration and counter fraud activity for Housing and Council Tax Benefits.
<P>

<a name="00704w16.html_para6">Inspectors report a commitment by Lancaster city council to tackling fraud but considered there was a need to support this commitment in operational terms. The BFI raises a number of concerns including a need for Lancaster city council to address urgently its inadequate management information systems and limited management checking regime.
<P>

<a name="00704w16.html_para7">In their report on Hart district council inspectors found some good working practices, but weaknesses were identified in a number of key areas. There were several areas where the council had failed to make sure benefit payments were free from fraud and error and where they failed to comply with the law.
<P>

<a name="00704w16.html_para8">The report on Hart district council notes a need for the council to tighten verification procedures so, as a minimum, they match the standards outlined in the Verification Framework. Inspectors found the council's counter-fraud activity to be ineffective and although high level counter-fraud policies had been developed, these had not been underpinned with detailed operational measures. The BFI also reports that these policies did not have the commitment of staff or management to implement them.
<P>

<a name="00704w16.html_para9">The Secretary of State is now considering both these reports and will be asking both councils for their proposals in response to the findings and recommendations of the BFI.

 There are no restrictions on asylum seekers participating in genuine voluntary work.

The numbers for 1996 to 1998 include those who support and manage the staff who make the decisions, as well as the decision makers. Comparisons between 1996 



to 1998 figures and those for 1999 and 2000 are difficult because of the reorganisation of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate in December 1998. Asylum applications were previously handled in a dedicated asylum directorate. In 1999 they were dealt with in integrated teams which also dealt with a variety of other immigration issues, and thus a separate figure is not available. Currently, asylum applications are dealt with in dedicated teams.<P>

 We are currently examining what changes will be needed to United Kingdom primary legislation in order to implement the United Kingdom's partial participation in the Schengen acquis. We anticipate a need for primary legislation relating to police co-operation in connection with cross-border surveillance and to areas of judicial co-operation. The latter aspect is linked to the legislative requirements for ratification of the European Union's Conventions on Mutual Legal Assistance and Extradition. Further discussion is taking place with our Schengen partners to clarify whether the application of certain provisions on data protection will require amendment to current data protection legislation.

<a name="00704w19.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The lack of a ticket is not in itself conclusive when an Immigration Officer reaches a decision about the admissibility of a passenger under the Immigration Rules. Immigration Officers often ask passengers to show their onward or return tickets as evidence of their intention to leave the United Kingdom, but where a passenger has booked a ticket using modern Information Technology methods--so called "ticketless travel"--he/she will normally be in possession of a printed itinerary giving full details of his/her travel plans. In the absence of such evidence Immigration Officers have the option of contacting the airline concerned to 



<P>
<P><I>4 Jul 2000 : Column: 168W</I><P>
verify that a booking exists. A passenger will not be unduly delayed for this purpose unless it is considered essential to the resolution of the case to verify that he/she has an onward or return booking, and this cannot be done easily.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w19.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Straw </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 July 2000]:</i> I am working closely with my noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor to improve the enforcement of fines.
<P>

<a name="00704w19.html_para1">Research is being carried out under the Government's Crime Reduction Programme to identify best practice in fine enforcement, to introduce a range of enforcement strategies in a number of pilot courts, and to evaluate the relative cost and effectiveness of those strategies. The project is due to be completed in autumn 2001.
<P>

<a name="00704w19.html_para2">In April 2001, responsibility for the execution of fines warrants will be transferred from the police to Magistrates Courts Committees. The fact that responsibility will rest with the courts will provide a sharper and clearer focus than the present arrangements, while the application and monitoring of administrative targets will ensure that the work receives a high priority within individual courts. As a result, more money--including compensation for the victims of crime--should be collected.
<P>

<a name="00704w19.html_para3">Measures in the Access to Justice Act 1999, which are also due to be implemented in April 2001, will allow the courts to check whether other Government agencies hold an up-to-date address for a 'missing' fine defaulter. This should prove helpful in reducing the currently high levels of financial penalties that have to be 'written off' because the offender cannot be traced.
<P>

<a name="00704w19.html_para4">A report on the pilot studies conducted on alternative means of dealing with fine defaulters introduced in the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 was published in February this year. A decision on the future of these measures will be made in due course.
<P>

<a name="00704w19.html_para5">Finally, following a relaxation in Treasury rules governing receipts, we are exploring the feasibility of developing a scheme which will allow a proportion of the income from fines to be retained ('netted-off') by the courts and used to make further improvements in enforcement rates.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the targets set by his Department for the reduction of crime, the date the targets were set and the timescale of the targets; what further targets he plans to introduce; and if he will make a statement.  [128525]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w20.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 In September 1998, the Government set a target for a 30 per cent. reduction in thefts of and from motor vehicles. This target covers the period 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2004.
<P>

<a name="00704w20.html_para0">In addition, by 31 March 2000, all police authorities in England and Wales were required to set for themselves five-year targets for reductions in domestic burglary and vehicle crime. The police authorities in Greater Manchester, Merseyside, the West Midlands and West Yorkshire and the Metropolitan Police Service were also required to set five-year targets for reductions in robbery. These targets cover the period 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2005 and have been published in each police authority's Best Value Performance Plan for 2000-01. The full list of these targets, as they appear in Best Value Performance Plans, is available on the website of the Association of Police Authorities--www.apa.police.uk.
<P>

<a name="00704w20.html_para1">In their Best Value Performance Plans, police authorities have also set a number of other crime reduction targets which reflect local priorities.
<P>

<a name="00704w20.html_para2">Local Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships will set targets for April 2001.
<P>

<a name="00704w20.html_para3">The Home Office Public Service Agreement, which will be published to coincide with the outcome of the Spending Review 2000, is also likely to contain targets reflecting key aspects of the Department's business.

[128926]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00704w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The net revenue cost and planned costs for the Home Office Executive and Advisory Non- Departmental Public Bodies (NDPBs) are set out in the following table. I have taken "net revenue costs" to mean the Grant in Aid for Executive NDPBs minus any receipts payable to the Exchequer offsetting costs.
<P>

<a name="00704w20.html_para4">Neither the Tote nor the Horserace Betting Levy Board (HBLB) have any revenue cost, as they are self-financing. The expenses payable to the Alcohol Education and Research Council are within the travel and subsistence budget of the Liquor Gambling and Data Protection Unit.
<P>

<a name="00704w20.html_para5">It is not possible to estimate the planned costs for some Advisory Bodies, as the members of those bodies only receive expenses when necessary.

In 1999, 40,900 principal applicants switched into a non-asylum category and 2,700 were refused. This excludes 41,700 (provisional) applications for asylum made by principal applicants after entry. I regret that the costs incurred dealing with applications to switch category cannot be separated from the overall costs of the Integrated Casework Directorate.
