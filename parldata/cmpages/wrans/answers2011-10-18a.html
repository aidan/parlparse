 The Royal Mint and the Treasury are working with banks, the Post Office, cash handling and sorting businesses, the police and the vending industry to remove counterfeit £1 coins from circulation before they reach the pockets of members of the public. Coin handling businesses, such as banks and the Post Office, handle over 3 billion £1 coins every year. They use high-speed, automated systems to process customer deposits and prepare coin for reissue. These automated systems are capable of detecting and withdrawing a significant number of counterfeit coins. All counterfeit coins detected from coin processing are sent to the Royal Mint for disposal.</p>

This will save a total of £2.8 billion a year from 2014-15, equivalent to an increase in contribution rates of 3.2 percentage points, phased in over three years from April 2012.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 17 October 2011]:</i> The Prime Minister pledged to make this the greenest Government ever and announced earlier this year that carbon emissions from Government HQs and offices have been cut by nearly 14% in just one year. Following this, he committed the Government to go further by reducing emissions by 25% by 2015. We are also supporting greater energy efficiency across the economy by introducing the Green Deal, revolutionising the way heat is generated and used through the Renewable Heat Incentive, and rolling-out smart meters and a smart grid will build on this progress. Moreover, on 12 July 2011 the Government published 'Planning our electric future: a White Paper for secure, affordable and low-carbon electricity'. The White Paper sets out key reforms to the electricity market to attract investment, reduce the impact on consumer bills, and create a secure mix of low-carbon electricity sources including renewables, new nuclear and carbon capture and storage.</p>

Emissions have already been reduced by over 26%, taking into account the effects of emissions trading.</p>

This autumn Government will be publishing a comprehensive strategy which will set out how the fourth carbon budget might be met, pathways to our 2050 target as well as a set of milestones which will set out shorter-term actions the Government commits to undertake to keep us on track to delivering our ambitious climate change goals.</p>

A very high level estimate performed by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority of the current cost equivalent of these sums is £0.9 billion which has been arrived at by using the retail prices index to escalate costs.</p>

Prior to February 2011 responses to requests for information relating to the “Home Department” included information for headquarters staff only—executive agencies were excluded from reported figures. Since February 2011 the Department has streamlined its reporting practices and departmental figures now include both headquarters and all executive agencies. This means that it is not possible to make a direct comparison between information provided in this response and any responses made before February 2011.

 Metal theft is not recorded separately in police recorded crime data and so there is no robust measure for the total number of metal theft offences in the last year. However, initial estimates based on data collected by British Transport Police, local police forces and centrally collected police recorded crime data indicate that there may have been between 80,000 and 100,000 metal theft offences in England and Wales in 2010-11. This estimate cannot be broken down by month or type of victim.</p>

 I am not aware of any evidence that the frequency of constituency redistributions has any impact on the means or outcomes of various systems of electoral registration. However, changes in the register arising from the movement of people over time do increase inequalities in the weight of a vote between constituencies. Holding reviews more frequently will reduce inequalities arising as a result of population movement, and will help ensure votes have more equal weight than at present.</p>

 The Department does not set eligibility criteria for cataract surgery. Primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible for commissioning services, taking into account the available evidence and the needs of the local population. PCTs are required to make decisions on the funding of drugs and treatments rationally, and following proper consideration of the evidence. If a PCT decides to prioritise funding for alternative drugs or treatments, it should be able to explain its decision and rationale. We have been clear that this should not lead to any blanket bans on procedures, and local processes should ensure eligibility criteria for procedures can take account of individuals' healthcare circumstances.</p>

                     <i>Notes:</i>
1. Data as at 30 September for each year.
2. All GP figures are GPs (excluding retainers and registrars).
3. The PCT relating to the Dartford constituency is West Kent PCT.
4. GP headcount figures are published as 'per 100,000 population'.
5. GPs per head of population have been calculated using ONS resident population estimates as at May 2010, adjusting previously published data.
6. The new headcount methodology for 2010 data is not fully comparable with previous years' data due to improvements that make it a more stringent count of absolute staff numbers. Further information on the headcount methodology is available in the Census publication. Headcount totals are unlikely to equal the sum of components.
7. Data Quality: The NHS Information Centre for health and social care seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data but responsibility for data accuracy lies with the organisations providing the data. Methods are continually being updated to improve data quality where changes impact on figures already published. This is assessed but unless it is significant at national level figures are not changed. Impact at detailed or local level is footnoted in relevant analyses.

Under legislation, all providers including national health service foundation trusts (NHSFTs), NHS trusts and independent sector providers, must register with the CQC and meet a set of essential requirements of safety and quality.

NHSFTs must comply with their terms of authorisation which are detailed requirements covering how they must operate, including the requirement to operate effectively, efficiently and economically. Regulation identifies actual and potential financial and governance issues. In cases where a NHSFT has breached or is at risk of breaching its terms of authorisation, Monitor will work with the trust leadership so that problems can be rectified. Where an NHSFT fails to do this, Monitor can exercise its formal powers of intervention.</p>

 The national health service is forecasting a healthy surplus for 2011-12. However, the last Government left a legacy of up to six hospital trusts whose private finance initiative payments are a risk to their financial sustainability and up to 24 trusts having such high levels of debt following years of bailouts that they may not meet the tests for their future financial sustainability.</p>

 The Government have protected the national health service in the spending review settlement in England, with cash funding growth of £12.5 billion by 2014-15. By comparison with other Departments, this is a generous settlement, though by NHS historical standards still extremely challenging. Over the next spending period (2011-12 to 2014-15) the NHS will face significant additional demand for services arising from the age and lifestyle of the population as well as the need to fund new technologies and drugs.</p>

1. Estimated England level expenditure figures are calculated using PCT and SHA programme budgeting returns and Department of Health resource account data. Figures will include an estimate of special health authority expenditure.
2. SHA level expenditure is calculated using the combined expenditure on own population figures of each PCT within the SHA area. It does not include expenditure by the SHA.
3. In order to improve data quality, continual refinements have been made to the programme budgeting data calculation methodology since the first collection in 2003-04. The underlying data which support programme budgeting data are also subject to yearly changes. Caution is therefore advised when using programme budgeting data to draw conclusions on changes in spending patterns between years.
4. From 2003-04 to 2005-06, expenditure on sexually transmitted infections was included within the Genito Urinary system problems category and was therefore not separately identified. Expenditure on HIV and AIDS is not included in expenditure on sexually transmitted infections but has been separately identified as a subcategory of Infectious diseases since 2006-07.
5. Disease specific expenditure do not include expenditure on prevention, or health promotion and programmes such as the National Chlamydia Screening Programme or general practitioner expenditure, but do include prescribing expenditure.
6. Figures are rounded to the nearest £0.1 million.

 I issued a written ministerial statement on 11 October 2011, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 23-24WS, setting out the Government's position. The Government believes that access to a lawyer is an essential right of accused persons at appropriate stages of any process of criminal investigation. However, the Government have not opted in to the European Union Directive on Access to a Lawyer in Criminal Proceedings and on the Right to Communicate upon Arrest at the initial stage of the negotiations on the directive because we are of the view that the directive as published by the Commission is not proportionate and could have an adverse effect on our ability to investigate and prosecute offences effectively. The Government intends to work together with other member states to improve the directive and if the concerns we have are taken into account during the process of negotiation, we will consider applying to opt in once the instrument has been adopted.</p>

 The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has a yearly IT security compliance review that includes an independent penetration test against its firewalls and associated policies. Assurance obtained through conducting such tests is used as evidence to demonstrate compliance when renewing the Government secure internet (GSI) code of connection. This is a yearly requirement that incorporates new measures regarding cyber security detailed in the Government's Communication Electronics Security Group (CESG) Good Practice Guides which must be satisfied in order for The Department to conduct business up to and including Impact Level 3 (Restricted). DCMS currently has full accreditation certified by CESG. In addition to the yearly audit, the Department receives regular threat assessments from the technical authority 'GovCertUK' that are addressed immediately by Atos, the Department's IT service provider.</p>

               <b>Mr Vaizey:</b>
 Community radio organisations in Liverpool are not excluded from applying for community radio licences in 2012-13. Applications for licences from the north-west will be invited in the first half of 2013. While there are some areas of the north-west where Ofcom will be unable to invite applications for FM licences, due to a lack of available frequencies, Ofcom will consider at the time applications are invited, whether capacity on MW might be available.</p>

 The Ministry of Defence (MOD)'s policy changed in April 2011 to recognise that use of pre-qualification questionnaires is generally unnecessary for low risk procurement valued below £100,000. For small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, this has provided easier access to Government contracts. Nevertheless, there will still be a small number of exceptional cases where the specific risks make pre-qualification questionnaires necessary, for instance where there is a need to ensure a minimum capability to protect highly classified information.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 17 October 2011]:</i> The Ministry of Defence does not routinely assess the current market value of all its estate because the estimated receipts will depend on market conditions and other factors at the time of sale. Where pre-sale valuations have been obtained, these are regarded as commercially confidential and are thus not released ahead of the sale in case they influence the market.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 17 October 2011]:</i> The table provides the distance and flying time from RAF Leuchars and RAF Lossiemouth to the most commonly used air-to-air, air-to-ground and electronic warfare ranges for the Scottish-based Typhoon fleet. Air-to-air range complexes can be very large, therefore the distance and flying time provided is to the approximate geographic centre of each range complex.</p>

 The Ministry of Defence police (MOD) Criminal Investigation Department (CID) is subject to scrutiny by a number of statutory bodies, who also comment upon the force's effectiveness. In 2010 an inspection of the force's major crime capability, and public order (focusing on protestor activity), was conducted by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. In 2011 the Office of Surveillance Commissioners undertook a review of aspects of the force's intelligence gathering. In addition the independent MOD police committee routinely receives a summary of fraud and significant crime inquiries investigated by the CID, and subsequent financial recoveries.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 13 October 2011]:</i> Temporary jamming is routinely practised in military exercises as an essential part of preparation for operations. Global positioning system jamming during exercise Joint Warrior 112 took place at various publicised time slots between 4 to 10 October 2011 and was limited to Faraid Head and Loch Ewe sites (which have been used historically to site this capability).</p>

Each event was closely co-ordinated with local Coastguard authorities who transmitted appropriate warning broadcasts on the mandatory VHF channels throughout the period. The jamming sites themselves also transmitted warnings on VHF before commencement and on completion of each serial. In addition, information booklets were provided on 7 September to local fishing associations, ferry operators and other interested parties making clear to all mariners the authorities to contact for further information.</p>

Offenders can be prosecuted in a magistrates court, and on conviction may be fined up to £2,500 and receive a criminal record. As an alternative to prosecution local authority enforcement officers can issue a fixed penalty notice for a sum between £50 and £80 set locally.</p>

 DEFRA and Environment Agency officials are currently undertaking a review regarding the requirement to register. The review includes engaging with key players such as, the CLA, NFU and water companies etc, to develop proposals on an alternative approach. Once the review has been completed we will propose the way forward, probably around the turn of the year. In the meantime, the Environment Agency has suspended the registration system in England and there is no need for householders to register.</p>

 The Prevent programme we inherited from the last Government was flawed. It confused the delivery of Government policy to promote integration with Government policy to prevent terrorism. The Secretary of State for the Home Department, my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May), launched a new Prevent strategy in June, following the independent review overseen by Lord Carlile of Berriew. This new strategy defines far more strongly than before the proper scope of Prevent as an integral part of counter-terrorism strategy. There is now a clear separation between Prevent—led by the Home Office, and broader integration work—led by the Department for Communities and Local Government. Of course, we continue to work closely with Home Office colleagues particularly in the area of extremism and intolerance.</p>

 The Academies Act 2010 financial impact assessment identified that conversion costs could be around £75-80,000, based on experience of the legal and associated costs of opening sponsored academies. Actual conversion costs fluctuate between schools depending on individual circumstances. Schools may apply to the Department to receive a one-off £25,000 conversion support grant to contribute towards these costs. Additional grants are also available for PFI schools.</p>

As set out in the recent DFE consultation on the basis for the decision on the appropriate amount of academies funding transfer for 2011-12 and 2012-13, current estimates of the number of academy converters for the financial year 2011/12 are for between 1550 and 2113 schools to convert to become academies.

 One of the requirements of the current history curriculum is to develop in pupils an understanding of the diverse experiences and ideas, beliefs and attitudes of men, women and children in past societies and how these have shaped the world. The current programmes for history are a broad framework, so although there are no specific references to history relating to women in the range and content, they provide ample opportunities for schools to cover this topic.</p>

We have updated statutory guidance to school governors, clarifying their legal powers to tackle bullying both in and outside school; and legislation currently before the House will strengthen the authority of teachers to enforce discipline and promote good behaviour. The new Ofsted inspections framework, which comes into force in January next year, will place a sharper focus on behaviour and bullying, increasing schools' accountability in this area.</p>

Proposals are under discussion and the question of mobility between the state and independent sectors will be considered as a key element in concluding how the recommendations will be implemented.</p>

 The Government takes awareness of carbon monoxide issues very seriously, and provides information for the public on websites and in publications. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) advice to consumers is to always use a Gas Safe registered engineer for all gas work in their home, and to ensure that any gas appliances are regularly serviced and maintained. Although not a substitute for the correct installation or maintenance of an appliance, HSE also strongly recommends the use of audible carbon monoxide alarms. Additionally, HSE provides a free gas safety advice line, which gas consumers, tenants and landlords can contact for advice and information.</p>

 Universal credit is a national benefit. It will be delivered largely through an online service, with its core administration most efficiently run by a centralised system. As DWP start to build the organisation to deliver universal credit, and we have yet to settle on the precise detail, and select the right people with the right capability it is likely some of those skills will exist within local authorities. We will therefore always look to include local authority staff in our thinking.</p>

Our aim is to work collaboratively to enable the decision making process and deliver optimal value. This includes the decision making around any redundancies, for which we have a small amount in our business case (whether they are in DWP, HMRC or local authorities). However, we do not expect there to be significant numbers of redundancies, if any at all, given the time available to us to plan and complete the transition to universal credit by 2017. I will be able to say more on the transition plan and the associated costs once we have collated and analysed the responses from the recent survey of local authorities. I expect to be able to do this by the end of the year.</p>

In line with this approach, DWP do not specify that Work programme providers have to support participants with costs for travelling to work. However, the provider could choose to support these costs if they think it is needed to sustain employment.

 The Government recognise the importance that education and skills can play in helping people find work. Jobseekers can undertake part-time education or training at any point in their claim and continue to receive jobseeker's allowance as long as they continue to meet the basic conditions of entitlement.</p>

               <a name="11101927000227"> Nevertheless, jobseeker's allowance is primarily intended as a safety net for people who are unemployed and searching for work. While certain social security entitlements continue to be available to students in vulnerable groups—such as disabled students and students who are responsible for a child of qualifying age—the vast majority of full-time students are not entitled to benefits as a means of supporting themselves while studying. Financial support for students who wish to study full-time is instead generally through the grants and loans available through the further education system.</p>

Skills provision also works best when it meets the needs of both employers and those seeking employment.</p>

 Payment of state pension starts from the first full benefit week that follows the date a person reaches state pension age. State pension is paid in full weeks and this means that for most people there will be a gap between their birthday (when they reach pension age) and the day they receive their first payment of pension. The gap could be anything between one and six days, depending on the person's birthday and their benefit payday.</p>

For most other people, there will be. However, because we make pension payments in complete weeks, there are no part-week payments at the end of a claim either, when a full week's benefit is also paid and thus the system balances itself out.</p>

 Universal credit is expected to be introduced in October 2013, and individuals will be migrated to universal credit over the subsequent four years.

Offsetting this it is estimated that there will be savings of around £2 billion due to reduced fraud, error and overpayments together with changes to the earnings disregards that currently exist in tax credits. In the longer term reduced complexity has the potential to lead to savings of more than £0.5 billion a year in administrative costs.</p>

 Currently, couples cannot claim independently as single people. They can decide for themselves which partner claims benefit but the partner must agree to the claimant claiming for them. If, exceptionally, the couple cannot agree who should claim, the Department's decision maker can make the decision for them. This also applies to JSA Joint Claimants.

 All healthcare professionals working for Atos Healthcare who carry out WCA assessments undertake a distance learning module on fibromyalgia within 12 months of joining the organisation. The distance learning module is approved by the chief medical adviser to the DWP. In addition, Atos healthcare professionals are required to undertake a programme of continuing medical education that is agreed with the Department. A module on chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia is included in the suite of CME topics available to the healthcare professionals.</p>

 We recognise that, for some individuals, attending a face-to-face assessment can be a stressful experience. Where there is sufficient evidence available, face-to-face assessments will not be carried out in order to determine benefit entitlement. In addition, you can be assured that health care professionals who carry out the face-to-face assessments are trained in dealing with customers with additional needs and that when people are asked to come for an assessment they are encouraged to bring a friend or relative with them.</p>

We recognise the importance of ensuring that the assessment process is appropriate to individual's circumstances, including individuals with autistic spectrum disorders. For this reason we have made clear that individuals who are asked to attend a face-to-face consultation will be able to bring with them a relation, friend, carer or advocate if they would find it helpful.</p>

 In 2009, HSE commissioned an independent review into workplace temperatures, which drew on the wide range of non-Government research available. Following this review, conducted a survey about temperatures in workplaces, to which 2,933 completed responses were submitted. Evaluation of this and other data provided little evidence of significant numbers of illnesses, long or short-term, physical or psychological, caused or exacerbated by exposure to high temperatures. Given this, the Government have no plans to set a maximum working temperature.</p>
