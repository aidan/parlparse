To ask the Solicitor-General how many prosecutions there have been for incitement to racial hatred in each of the past three years; and what proportion of those prosecutions have led to convictions.  [134530]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 In 1998 there was one prosecution for offences of incitement to racial hatred under Part III of the Public Order Act 1986--this resulted in a conviction. In 1999 there were five defendants charged--three of these were convicted. There are currently three existing prosecutions involving such offences.

<P>
<a name="01031w01.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 Research has shown, and patients have told me, that in some hospitals the quality of food is not up to the standard that patients expect. The NHS Plan sets out a programme of work to improve the standard of hospital food:

<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the estimated annual cost is to the NHS of treating people with drug-related illnesses.  [134746]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 In 1999-2000, the drug misuse special allocation to health authorities for the treatment of drug misuse was &#163;59 million. Local authorities received &#163;3 million through the drug and alcohol special grant for the same purpose. However, through the drug action team templates, health and local authorities report actual expenditure in excess of these levels. In 1998-99, the template indicated that &#163;150.7 million was spent on drugs misuse treatment, inclusive of the special allocation and grant.

<a name="01031w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The National Institute for Clinical Excellence has not yet published its final guidance on beta interferon for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and it would not be appropriate to pre-empt what the final guidance might say.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will estimate the savings in social security benefits and local authority care costs that would arise if beta interferon were prescribed to those patients who might benefit.  [134739]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 No. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence is conducting a thorough appraisal on beta interferon for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and has not yet completed its work.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="01031w02.html_para0">To date, 13 reports have been published by the Public Services Productivity Panel. They are available on the Panel's website: http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/pspp/
<P>

<a name="01031w02.html_para1">A brief description of the published reports follows:

<BR>
1. "Meeting the challenge: a joint report by the Public Services Productivity Panel"--brings together the main findings from the Productivity Panel's first 12 studies. High quality performance management is identified as an essential feature of any high-performing organisation. The report outlines a simple, integrated framework that managers can use to engineer a step-change in their organisation's productivity.
<BR>




<P>
<P><I>31 Oct 2000 : Column: 339W</I><P>
2. "Variations in outpatient performance"--sets out a comprehensive strategy for improving waiting times for consultant appointments through a combination of improved management, long-term planning and new booking systems.
<BR>
3. "Customers in the driving seat?"--reviews the quality of customer services in three of the large transport agencies. It sets out a number of practical recommendations that would be of interest to all public sector organisations that want to improve their front-line services to customers.
<BR>
4. "Incentives for change"--examines performance incentives for the 150,000 front-line staff who work in the Benefits Agency, HM Customs and Excise, the Employment Service and the Inland Revenue. The report contains a wealth of comparative data on how performance is rewarded and incentivised across both the public and private sectors.
<BR>
5. "Targeting improved performance"--reviews the performance management systems of the Defence Logistics Organisation against a model developed by the Productivity Panel. This model has since been adopted by the Civil Service Management Board for use throughout the civil service.
<BR>
6. "Improving police performance"--identifies a new way to measure the efficiency of the police using information that is already collected by the police service. The report outlines a means by which police forces can better understand their relative strengths and weaknesses and thus fits within the framework of the Best Value initiative.
<BR>
7. "Refocusing performance management"--reports on work with staff in the Energy Group of the DTI to refresh its performance management system by demonstrating how a model developed by the Productivity Panel can be applied in a complex public sector organisation.
<BR>
8. "Sold on health"--sets out a new national framework for the management of the NHS estate that is designed to root out surplus estate, accelerate sales and cut red tape. The approach can generate additional finance and free up resources to increase the focus on patient care.
<BR>
9. "Working in partnership"--tackles the issue of achieving joined-up working at a local level, particularly through developing joint IT systems, by highlighting the key issues that organisations need to address as they plan across organisational boundaries. The report includes a simple self-assessment tool which other public services can apply.
<BR>
10. "Out in the open"--proposes improvements to the commissioning of services for older people. It demonstrates how efficiency gains can be achieved by developing care services that move away from reliance on expensive, and often inappropriate, residential and nursing care.
<BR>
11. "Putting your house in order"--looks at how to get best value for tenants from the &#163;4 billion invested each year in improvements to social housing stock. It recommends engaging tenants in setting priorities, ensuring structural improvements are linked to social objectives and creating partnerships between tenants, landlords and contractors.
<BR>
12. "Maximising value for money"--examines the role of the Strategic Outline Case as an important element of planning for information systems and change management initiatives that involve a large number of stakeholders, are novel, risky and complex, or where the objectives and scope may be ill-defined.
<BR>
13. "Effective reporting in education"--looks at how performance reporting arrangements in schools and further education colleges could be further developed to support the Government's radical agenda for raising standards in education and training. It recommends focusing performance reporting on key targets, reporting on planned improvement in those key areas, and identifying patterns of good practice.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The United Kingdom has a successful defence relationship with Argentina. We conduct annual defence contact talks, at which we agree an extensive defence contacts programme. This year's programme consists of over 50 items, including places on each other's training courses; ship and aircraft visits; exchanges of defence personnel and several visits by senior military officers. I visited Buenos Aires in March this year, and the Argentine Defence Minister, Sir Ricardo Lopez-Murphy, visited the UK as a guest of the British Government in July.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 We look forward to engaging Russia in a meaningful defence relationship. We made good progress towards that objective in 1997 and 1998. But since 1999, the only significant activity that has continued unabated is a programme to re-train Russian servicemen who are about to retire.
<P>

<a name="01031w02.html_para2">Earlier this year, the Russians indicated that they are willing to re-commence a bilateral defence relationship with us. I welcome this and we have taken steps to re-establish the relationship. This must, clearly, be part and parcel of the UK's overall relationship with Russia and must therefore take account of the situation in Chechnya.

 The Commonwealth War Graves Commission is an autonomous body subject to Royal Charter and as such has responsibility for formulating its own pay and allowance system, which includes a package of allowances to help cover the additional costs (for UK-recruited staff) of living abroad.
<P>

<a name="01031w03.html_para0">The changes are not the result of any reduction in funding by the UK Government; the Ministry of Defence will continue to contribute to the Commission in proportion to its number of war graves and there are no plans to reduce the current contribution of &#163;23 million. The Government will ensure, in conjunction with the Commission, that the highest standards in tending war graves will be maintained and that our war dead will continue to be afforded the utmost respect.

There will be full consultation with the staff and their representatives. Any changes will be delayed until the review has been completed.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Overpayments Recovery Guide is an internally produced manual available to staff dealing with overpayments of benefit. It provides general advice to staff on how to proceed once an overpayment has been identified, dealing with issues such as the classification of the overpayment, for example, mistake by the customer, official error, and special age and welfare considerations.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It has always been our policy to recover overpayments as quickly and as effectively as possible, without causing undue financial hardship to our customers.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The decision whether an overpayment is recoverable is normally made by a decision-maker. In cases where an overpayment is caused by misrepresentation or failure to disclose a material fact Section 71 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 allows the recovery of that overpayment. Recovery is sought whenever it is appropriate to do so. The decision automatically provides a right of appeal on the grounds of whether there has been misrepresentation or failure to disclose and the amount determined. This legislation covers the vast majority of the overpayments we try to recover.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>However, in some cases we may seek to recover overpayments that fall outside the scope of Section 71. Typically, repayment may be requested where a person has been paid over and above the amount authorised; for example, where someone has been paid twice for the same period.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Chairman of the Accommodation and Works Committee if he will make a statement on recent media reports concerning Portcullis House.  [135913]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w06.html_spnew2"><B> Sir Sydney Chapman: </B> 
 I am pleased to have this opportunity to correct some of the misleading, or inaccurate, comments and articles made by the media about Portcullis House. During the summer, my Committee was encouraged to see in the technical press and elsewhere the positive response to the building from construction professionals and commentators. This was to be expected given the fine quality of the design and the technical achievements in the construction of the building. However, as I have said, a number of unfounded or inaccurate claims have been made or repeated from earlier reports. Hon. Members may find the following facts helpful to know.
<P>

<a name="01031w06.html_para0">The building has been constructed on time and within budget. The construction period agreed by the House of Commons Commission in 1993 was 30 months. Construction started on 5 January 1998 and the certificate of practical completion issued on 18 August 2000, including the additions to the brief. The budget approved by the Commission in 1993 was &#163;165 million plus building cost inflation between then and the start of construction works and &#163;9 million for the delay caused by the late handover of the site from London Underground. Against this total of &#163;237 million the forecast outturn cost is &#163;231 million.
<P>

<a name="01031w06.html_para1">The oft-quoted cost of "&#163;1 million per hon. Member" is simplistic. It totally ignores the fact that at least an equal number of staff will be employed in hon. Members' offices and that two of the floors (one third of the building) provide Select Committee, conference and other communal facilities for the benefit of all 659 hon. Members, particularly those 450 now with offices north of Bridge Street.
<P>

<a name="01031w06.html_para2">There are no plans to spend &#163;0.5 million on buffing up the roof and fenestration. Nor is &#163;200,000 being spent on further planting.
<P>

<a name="01031w06.html_para3">The reception desk in the main entrance did not cost &#163;75,000, nor the preposterous &#163;300,000 as reported more recently. The figure of &#163;75,000 is the cost of a "package", which includes the main reception desk, the security desk at the subway entrance and the security enclosure at the main entrance area.
<P>

<a name="01031w06.html_para4">Hiring trees such as those in the courtyard is a normal commercial arrangement. The cost includes their care and maintenance and requires the nurseryman to replace at no additional cost any that do not thrive. The trees are not purely decorative. The shading will reduce the amount of 



<P>
<P><I>31 Oct 2000 : Column: 353W</I><P>
cooling needed in the summer, contributing to the energy efficiency of the building. Despite reports to the contrary, the trees are not dying. The trees were distressed having been uprooted and a significant leaf fall was expected, particularly during the first few weeks. There will always be some loss of leaf, but we are advised they will fully recover.
<P>

<a name="01031w06.html_para5">The closure of the building after the basement flooded was a short-lived and precautionary measure lasting some four hours only. Torrential rain on 15 September coincided with a high tide. As a result, storm water backed up flooding a lightwell in an adjacent building, which overflowed through a ventilation duct into the basement, entering an electrical substation. Only four hon. Members had by then moved into the building, none of whom was inconvenienced, and the programme of moves continued on schedule without interruption.
<P>

<a name="01031w06.html_para6">At least three timekeeping devices have been provided in hon. Members' and their staff's rooms--on the annunciators, the telephones and personal computers.
<P>

<a name="01031w06.html_para7">Hon. Members require both storage and work surfaces. The most effective way to meet both requirements is to provide storage under the work surfaces using two or three-drawer pedestals. Filing and storage space is provided also in the joinery walls.
<P>

<a name="01031w06.html_para8">It is not the practice to comment on the implications of any alleged security lapses; suffice it to say that the reported four-inch gap near the main entrance door is due to a capping piece being awaited and, contrary to irresponsible reports, the appropriate authorities did not raise any matters of concern.
<P>

<a name="01031w06.html_para9">Neither feng-shui nor space utilisation experts have been used on the project.
<P>

<a name="01031w06.html_para10">Marble has not been used in the building. The wall and ceilings of the offices are plain concrete.
<P>

<a name="01031w06.html_para11">The easy chairs provided in some hon. Members' offices do not have a "snooze control" facility.
<P>

<a name="01031w06.html_para12">Over 150 hon. Members and their staff have now moved into the building. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. It is inevitable, however, that in a project of this size there will be some teething troubles. To date these have been minor and will be dealt with under the Parliamentary Works Directorate's normal defects and maintenance programme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in 1999 prices, what was the value of military equipment licensed for export to China in each year between 1985 and 1999.  [134435]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w08.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 October 2000]:</i> The information requested could be provided only at disproportionate cost. However, in response to a recommendation made by the Quadripartite Committee, the 1999 Annual Report on Strategic Export Controls sets out the total value in respect of which a Standard Individual Export Licence (SIEL) was issued for the export of military equipment and other goods subject to strategic export controls. However, this total is likely to be greater than the value of exports that are actually made under the SIELs concerned because some of these will not be used to make all of the exports authorised and others will not be used at all. In addition, some goods are exported only temporarily and later returned to the UK.
<P>

<a name="01031w08.html_para1">It should also be noted that this figure does not cover all types of licence. Open licences allow the exporters concerned to make multiple shipments of the specified goods to the specified destinations in accordance with the licence conditions. While such licences do not normally impose any limit on the volume of exports that may be made under the licence, exporters are required as a condition of the licence to maintain records of all controlled exports for a minimum of three or four years depending on the goods. While these records may be examined by compliance offices in the course of routine compliance visits, the Export Control Organisation does not compile any central record.
<P>

<a name="01031w08.html_para2">For the years prior to 1999, applicants for Standard Individual Export Licences were required to record on the application form the value of the goods for which a licence was sought; this information was then recorded on ECO's computer databases. However, where a licence was issued, the value of the goods covered by that licence may have been less than the value of the goods covered by the original application. Exporters sometimes mistakenly apply for a licence to export goods for which no licence is required. In addition, goods are sometimes withdrawn from the coverage of an application during the licensing process, for example at the exporter's request, or the value may change during the time taken to process the application because of changes in exchange rates. Moreover, the value of the goods licensed for export by each individual licence was not recorded on ECO's computer database until 1 January 1999, although it was shown on the licence itself.
<P>

<a name="01031w08.html_para3">Finally, HM Customs and Excise collect and record information on imports to and exports from the UK for trade statistics purposes. This information is set out in Part III of the Annual Reports on Strategic Export Controls.

 I have received a number of such representations and understand concerns about the continued rise in petrol prices. Most of this is caused by the current unsustainably high level of oil prices.

<a name="01031w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 On 24 February 2000, in line with the prioritisation procedure agreed with the solicitors representing the claimants, IRISC (the Department's claims handling agents) sent Maddocks Clarke, Mrs. Farrington's solicitor, the necessary Claims Questionnaire, Financial/Other Losses Questionnaire and Mandates which authorise access to the late Mr. Farrington's medical records.
<P>

<a name="01031w09.html_para1">Maddocks Clarke returned the completed forms to IRISC on 22 May. Unfortunately there was conflicting information entered on the Claims Questionnaire and the Financial/Other Losses Questionnaire and IRISC contacted Maddocks Clarke to clarify this. Clarification was received on 23 June and the forms were forwarded to Healthcall, provider of the medical assessments.

<a name="01031w09.html_para2">Healthcall had anticipated that they would complete the scanning of all the required medical records by the middle of September. However, due to staff sickness and the unavailability of Health Authority staff this was delayed and the remaining records will now be scanned on 21 November.
<P>

<a name="01031w09.html_para3">All the documentation will then be passed to a respiratory consultant who will assess the disability for which the Department is liable. IRISC will write to Mrs. Farrington's solicitor with an offer of compensation within two weeks of receiving the correctly completed medical report form.
<P>

<P>
<a name="01031w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The processing of COPD claims requires the involvement of many bodies--the Department, its contractors, the Compensation Recovery Unit of the Department of Social Security and the claimants' solicitors. Where IRISC, the Department's claims handling agents, are involved there are time scales at various stages of the process, set out in the Handling Agreement signed by the Department and the solicitors representing the claimants.
<P>

<a name="01031w09.html_para5">Some of the main deadlines include agreeing or contending an Employment History within 56 days of receipt of a completed Claims Questionnaire and making an offer on general damages within 28 days of receipt of a medical assessment process--MAP--report. It should be noted that there are not formal time scales for other parties, including solicitors.
<P>

<a name="01031w09.html_para6">For those claimants who have received a full and final settlement since 1 November 1999 IRISC advise that the targets set out in the Handling Agreement have been met in all cases.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has today re-appointed David Edmonds as Director General of Telecommunications for a further three years from 1 April 2001.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The British Council has reviewed its operations over the next five years, to ensure that it continues to make maximum impact in a world of rapid change and to exploit new opportunities to reach wider, younger target audiences.
<P>

<a name="01031w09.html_para9">As a result, and with the encouragement of the FCO, the Council will increase its work in countries in transition to full democracy. It will open up in Armenia, and increase resources for Central and Eastern Europe.
<P>

<a name="01031w09.html_para10">In recognition of the important work the Council does overseas, under this year's Spending Review of 2001-02 to 2003-04 the Council will receive an increase in its grant in aid of &#163;24.8 million. In addition to helping to fund the proposed expansion in the Council's overseas network, particularly in Russia and China, it will assist in the development of new knowledge and learning centres, for the benefit mainly of developing countries.
<P>

<a name="01031w09.html_para11">In Western Europe, where infrastructure costs are particularly high, and new forms of Information Technology widely used, the Council will make a significant shift in resources from fixed costs to activities. It will focus its physical presence in capital cities and use some of the savings to fund investment in new, IT-based programmes and services, exploiting the enormous potential of the new media. This will allow the Council to reach wider audiences, particularly young professional people, while maintaining core programmes.
<P>

<a name="01031w09.html_para12">To reflect changed priorities the Council will close country directorates in Belarus, Ecuador, Lesotho and Swaziland (citizens of some of these countries may still be able to participate in British Council programmes in their region). The Council will also close a small number of offices outside capital cities. Where appropriate, it plans to modify library and information services to match changing patterns of local demand.
<P>

<a name="01031w09.html_para13">The reduction in physical presence will allow overall program expenditure to increase. Arts, science, English language teaching and education training will remain core activities. The Council will expand work on governance and human rights; it will aim work in science, the

<P>

<a name="01031w09.html_para14">In summary, the Council's new strategy is designed to ensure that it remains in tune with the evolving needs of target audiences as we move into a new century.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of the impact on dealing in illegal diamonds by the RUF in Sierra Leone of his initiatives on conflict diamonds.  [135918]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 As part of HMG's initiative to tackle the problem of conflict diamonds, the UK played the lead role in promoting UN Security Council resolution 1306(2000) which was adopted on 5 July 2000 and imposed a ban on the direct or indirect import of all rough diamonds from Sierra Leone to the territory of UN member states. The resolution provided for an exemption from the ban for diamonds controlled by the Government of Sierra Leone through a Certificate of Origin regime. This exemption came into effect on 6 October when the UN Sanctions Committee Chairman reported to the President of the Security Council that an effective regime was fully in operation.
<P>

<a name="01031w09.html_para15">We anticipate that the new regime will enhance the capacity of the Government and people of Sierra Leone to benefit from their country's diamond wealth, while limiting the rebels' income from the illicit diamond trade.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 UN Security Council resolution 1306, adopted on 5 July 2000, prohibits the direct or indirect import of all rough diamonds from Sierra Leone to the territory of UN member states, unless accompanied by a Certificate of Origin issued by the Government of Sierra Leone.
<P>

<a name="01031w09.html_para16">It is for the UN Sanctions Committee to investigate any allegations that this prohibition may have been violated.

<a name="01031w11.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Yeo: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food which items of the Intervention Board departmental expenditure limit and annually managed expenditure on the Common Agricultural Policy are determined by the <i>(a)</i> European Union and <i>(b)</i> Government.  [134014]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Nick Brown </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 October 2000]:</i> The Intervention Board's Departmental Expenditure Limit consists of administration expenditure and BSE related programme expenditure. The latter includes compensation under the Over Thirty Months Scheme and all associated incidental/disposal costs. The Intervention Board's Annually Managed Expenditure is non-BSE related programme expenditure. This includes intervention buying, other internal market measures and EU refunds on export trade with non-member countries. All programme- related expenditure derives directly from EU legislation and is largely EU funded. The administration expenditure is Exchequer funded and in large measure is demand-led according to the levels of CAP market support activity.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what proportion of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Intervention Board and Forestry Commission departmental expenditure limits given for the years 1999-2000, 2000-01 and 2001-02 in the 2000 MAFF Department report have been re-allocated to other years as a result of the shift to resource budgeting.  [134015]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w11.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Nick Brown </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 October 2000]:</i> The departmental expenditure limits (DEL) quoted in the 2000 Department Report for the years 1999-2000, 2000-01 and 2001-02 are all in cash terms. There has been no re-allocation of Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Intervention Board DEL as a result of the shift to resource budgeting. As a result of accruals timing adjustments over the three years the Forestry Commission DEL is less than the respective cash provisions shown in the Departmental Report by 0.6 per cent., 2.2 per cent. and 1.7 per cent.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w11.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Nick Brown </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 October 2000]:</i> Only the Intervention Board has reclassified as annually managed expenditure certain items previously included in its departmental expenditure limit. These are beef intervention, beef export refunds and remnant payments on schemes that have ended, such as the Calf Processing Aid Scheme, Beef Stocks Transfer Scheme and Aid to the Rendering Industry. As part of the 2000 Spending Review settlement the compensation payments on the Over Thirty Months Scheme will transfer into annually managed expenditure with effect from 1 April 2001.

There is no reason to believe that the Commission will impose any conditions over and above what is laid down in its guidelines for state aids of this type.

 The Ministry funds a range of measures costing around &#163;1.3 million annually to assist the beekeeping sector to deal with bee health issues. The emphasis is on providing cost-free regional and national training in good husbandry and disease recognition and control for all beekeepers. In each of the last two years, the National Bee Unit has organised over 700 such events working closely with beekeeping associations. We consider this to be the best use of available resources.

 Inspection and treatment of bees for the notifiable diseases American foul brood, European foul brood and varroa are mandatory under the provisions of the Bees Act 1980 and the Bee Disease Control Order 1982. The National Bee Unit organises regular annual checks of bee colonies throughout England and Wales for these diseases, particularly in high risk areas. Approximately 26,000-27,000 colonies in 4,500 apiaries are inspected each year. In addition to this service, the National Bee Unit provides training and education to help beekeepers become more self-reliant in the identification of bee diseases through improved bee husbandry.

 <i>[holding answer 23 October 2000]:</i> Where the value of the pound increases in relation to the euro, this decreases support to farmers under the CAP, but it is impossible to isolate savings that may have been generated solely by currency fluctuations.

<a name="01031w13.html_para15">On the handling of inquiries, the BBC has anticipated that applicants are likely to contact TV Licensing with queries about the licences they have been sent, such as the method of calculating the refund, or the validity of the licence for other members of their household. The BBC has tried, as far as possible, to answer these questions in the letter accompanying the licence, but experience shows that many people will still contact TV Licensing with queries. In addition, the BBC says it will be hard to predict the volume of calls from people whose circumstances or their address have changed, and the new applications which might be prompted by the issue of the licence. The BBC, therefore, has in place:

<a name="01031w13.html_para20">Responses to the licence mailing are, however, hard to predict, and publicity or press activity could cause peaks of telephone calls that exceed the capacity of the call centres at any given time. The cost of this extra capacity would be &#163;250,000 a week. The BBC has chosen to balance cost versus demand and believes it has set it at a sensible level.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on policies relating to contacts between planning offices and applicants.  [135388]<P>

<a name="01031w16.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Planning functions must be seen to be carried out with transparency and openness in order to retain public confidence in the decision making process. Planning officers must abide by the local code of conduct prepared by their local authority. The Government endorse the Local Government Association's "Probity in Planning" which recommends the practices and procedures which codes of conduct should cover, including guidance on discussions between planning officials and applicants.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many cases of leakage in the water supply system there were, how much water was lost, and how much was spent to rectify these problems, in each of the last five years.  [135231]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 There has been almost a 30 per cent. reduction in water leakage since the Water Summit in May 1997. The total volume of potable water lost through leakage is published annually by the Director General of Water Services in his report on leakage and the efficient use of water. For each of the last five years in England and Wales, the total leakage rates were as follows:

<a name="01031w16.html_para0">Information on the number of cases of leakage and on the amount of money spent tackling leakage is not held centrally. Details of water companies' overall capital expenditure were last published by the Director General of Water Services in the "Report on the financial performance and expenditure of the water companies in England and Wales 1999-00". In the next five years water companies will invest &#163;15.6 billion in the water industry.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w16.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Llwyd: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions by what percentage carbon dioxide emissions have been reduced since 1997.  [135208]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 UK carbon dioxide emissions are provisionally estimated to have been about the same in 1999 as in 1997, and around 7.5 per cent. lower than in 1990. This follows a strong downward trend between 1990 and 1997. The levelling of emissions between 1997 and 1999 reflects a modest growth in overall energy demand, slightly lower output from nuclear power stations and lower imports of electricity from France, balanced by continued fuel switching towards gas.
<P>

<a name="01031w16.html_para1">The draft UK climate change programme, published in March, sets out a package of policies and measures to continue reducing carbon dioxide emissions over the next decade. It estimated that quantified policies and measures could reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 17.5 per cent. below 1990 levels in 2010 and that other elements of the programme would reduce emissions further and could achieve the Government's 20 per cent. goal.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he will be consulting local authorities on his proposals for the Housing Revenue Account and HRA Subsidy for 2001-02; and if he will make a statement.  [135940]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 We are issuing details of our proposals for the Housing Revenue Account (HRA) and HRA Subsidy for 2001-02 to all local housing authorities in England today. We are asking for comments by 30 November. Copies of the consultation documents are being placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="01031w17.html_para1">Next year will see the introduction of resource accounting within the HRA, including the new Major Repairs Allowance (MRA). Resource accounting is part of the new, more businesslike approach to local authority housing and the delivery of better quality services. The MRA will provide resources through the HRA subsidy system, of some &#163;1.6 billion next year, to enable all authorities to maintain the condition of their housing stock 



<P>
<P><I>31 Oct 2000 : Column: 407W</I><P>
over the longer term. The resources are being drawn from the significantly increased provision for capital expenditure by local authorities announced as part of the Government's spending plans for 2001-02 to 2003-04 by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 18 July.
<P>

<a name="01031w17.html_para2">Our proposals for 2001-02 also include an additional &#163;67 million to spend on day-to-day housing maintenance; the third year in which we have proposed increases. In addition, there will be further resources next year of &#163;15 million to help authorities introduce resource accounting, with another &#163;6 million to help tenants get involved in managing their homes through tenant participation compacts.
<P>

<a name="01031w17.html_para3">We are combating years of under-investment in the fabric of our council stock. We are determined to improve the quality of council housing and the services to tenants.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w17.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to phase out refrigerants with a high global warming potential.  [135775]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w17.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 A new EC Regulation (2037/2000) on the control of ozone depleting substances came into force on 1 October. Ozone depleting substances such as CFCs and HCFCs, most commonly used in refrigeration systems, also have a high global warming potential (GWP)--CFC 12 and HCFC 22 have GWPs of 8100 and 1500 respectively; for comparison the GWP of carbon dioxide is defined as 1. From 1 January 2001 there will be a ban on the use of CFCs to maintain existing refrigeration equipment. Also, the use of HCFCs as refrigerants will be banned in most new equipment from 1 January 2001.
<P>

<a name="01031w17.html_para4">Industry has replaced CFCs and HCFCs with a variety of alternative refrigerants--many with a low GWP. However, in some applications there are no suitable alternatives currently available other than HFC 134a, which has a high GWP (1300), but does not deplete the ozone layer. We announced in the draft Climate Change Programme how we intend to deal with the growth in use of HFCs. The policy gives industry and users a clear signal to look closely at all the alternatives and to use HFCs only where other safe, technically feasible, cost-effective and more environmentally acceptable alternatives do not exist. The final Programme is to be published shortly.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimates of the population in 2016 in each English region and London have been used in devising the projected level of household formations proposed for the current round of draft regional planning guidance.  [135738]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w17.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B>

population for each English region and London in 2016 are as shown. They have informed the Department's 1996-based household projections. However, household projections are only one of the factors to be taken into account in preparing the housing strategy in RPG (see Chapter 5 of PPG11 published on 17 October 2000).

 The estimates of administrative costs, first provided by the FSA to the Treasury Select Committee in early 1998, are &#163;500 million for phase 1 of the review and &#163;520 to &#163;750 million for phase 2.

 Following the well documented problems experienced with NIRS2 when it was first introduced, considerable progress has since been made and the Inland Revenue now regards the system as stable. Since April 1999, when the Inland Revenue took responsibility for the system, it has worked with the suppliers to ensure that full functionality is in place.

 Costs of administration were &#163;30.1 million for the year 1999-2000, or 1.5 pence per pound collected.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w18.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Working Families Tax Credit, as a tax credit rather than a welfare benefit, is paid through the wage packet. This reduces the stigma attached to receiving in work support and clearly demonstrates the reward of work compared to welfare.

<P>
<a name="01031w18.html_spnew4"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 October 2000]:</i> The forecast contained in the Treasury press release of 7 September 1999 was based on the best information available at that time.

 <i>[holding answer 26 October 2000]:</i> The Working Families Tax Credit is one of a number of reforms to make work pay for those on the lowest incomes in work. Treasury estimates of the possible impact on labour supply of the complete package of reforms--including changes to employee National Insurance and income tax rates--were published in "Tackling Poverty and Making Work Pay--Tax Credits for the 21st Century" (The Modernisation of Britain's Tax and Benefit System, 



<P>
<P><I>31 Oct 2000 : Column: 411W</I><P>
Number 6, March 2000, paragraph 2.13). These estimates took into account recent research and were based on methodology used by the Institute for Fiscal Studies in 1999 study: "Entering Work and the British Tax and Benefit System".

<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w18.html_spnew7"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Government's approach to EU tax issues is based on fair tax competition, not tax harmonisation. At the recent Feira European Council in June, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor persuaded the EU to accept exchange of information rather than a withholding tax on cross-border savings income as the way forward. This illustrated the success of the Government's policy of constructive engagement on EU issues.

<P>
<a name="01031w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 October 2000]:</i> It is not possible to estimate accurately the revenue impact of increasing the rate of duty applied to diesel fuel used by farmers because there are no estimates of the amount of fuel used in vehicles covered by paragraphs 2 to 5 of Schedule 1 to Hydrocarbon Oils Duties Act 1979.

<a name="01031w19.html_spnew4"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Many community amateur sports clubs are already exempt from corporation tax on the income they earn from their members, and the subscriptions of their playing members are exempt from VAT. On 29 September DETR published a Green Paper, "Modernising Local Government Finance", which included, at Annex E, a section inviting views on rate relief for non-profit-making sports clubs.

<a name="01031w19.html_sbhd4"><H4><center>Domestic Heating Fuel</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w19.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer by how much <i>(a)</i> the pre-tax cost of a litre of domestic heating fuel, <i>(b)</i> the fuel duty on a litre and <i>(c)</i> the VAT on a litre has increased by (i) percentage and (ii) actual terms since January 1999; and how much additional revenue the Treasury has received as a result.  [135124]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w19.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Information on the prices of different fuel products is available in "Energy Trends", published monthly by the DTI. There is no excise duty on standard grade heating oil. The rate of VAT applying to domestic heating oil has remained at 5 per cent. since it was reduced to that level from 8 per cent. in September 1997.
<P>

<a name="01031w19.html_para1">Estimating the additional revenues accrued by the Government as a result of the rise in the price of heating oil is difficult because we need to make assumptions about the way in which consumers fund the rise in the price of fuel. If expenditure is diverted predominantly from standard-rated goods towards expenditure on heating oil, VAT receipts may actually fall.

<P>

<a name="01031w19.html_para2">The Government's policy is that magistrates courts are best managed locally by magistrates courts committees under the provisions of the Justices of the Peace Act 1997. Decisions concerning the future of magistrates courts are for local magistrates courts committees to determine.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will make a statement on progress in installing new IT equipment and systems in the civil courts.  [135125]<P>

<a name="01031w19.html_spnew9"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The Court Service has a rolling programme of improving existing IT systems in the County Courts, together with a long-term business and IT strategy programme.
<P>

<a name="01031w19.html_para4">The most recent significant IT change in the civil courts was the implementation of the Civil Justice Reforms. In order to implement this change effectively within the required timescales without excessive risk, the Court Service (in partnership with its IT supplier) made wide ranging changes to pre-existing systems. Core IT and business changes were implemented to the defined timetable--subsequent refinements have been introduced to improve operational effectiveness.
<P>

<a name="01031w19.html_para5">However, it is recognised that there remains significant scope to exploit further the potential of modern technologies (as was highlighted by the <i>civil.justice.2000</i> report). This theme is at the centre of the Modernising the Civil Courts (MCC) programme which we are developing. We plan to issue a consultation paper on MCC later this year. That paper will highlight a wide range of business areas where the application of a diverse set of technologies could significantly enhance the administration of civil justice. In order to ensure that change to IT systems is delivered in the most effective way, a department-wide Information and Communications Technology strategy has been developed--this will ensure that the IT deployed is fully in line with the principle of the Modernising Government initiatives.
<P>

<a name="01031w19.html_para6">MCC will involve a long-term programme of change. Thus, in parallel with it, the Court Service has begun to, and will continue to, improve current IT facilities. For example:
<P>

<a name="01031w19.html_para7"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A series of upgrades to CaseMan (the main county court IT system) have been implemented to deliver operational changes. These have incorporated a range of changes proposed by end users. There are standing processes to continue with future releases (taking on board end user input);

On 12 October 2000, provisions relating to United Kingdom-wide and Northern Ireland specific codes of practice were brought into force, paving the way for consultation on those codes. Today further provisions, such as those setting out the procedure for the making of secondary legislation, including the orders to bring the codes of practice into force, have been commenced. The provisions brought into force today also include provision for rules of court dealing with certain procedures under the Act and for the establishment of the Proscribed Organisations Appeals Commission.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Draft framework decision on money laundering, the identification, tracing, freezing, seizing and confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds of crime:</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There was a broad political orientation, subject to certain parliamentary reserves and the European Parliament opinion to a common minimum maximum penalty of four years and that all member states should be obliged to lift reserves in respect of tax offences to the 1990 Council of Europe money laundering Convention's provisions on confiscation of assets. The Council also agreed a declaration to the effect that minimum maximum penalties would be considered on a case by case basis for future instruments.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There was broad agreement, on the basis of a Presidency discussion document, to the principle that legal assistance should not be refused solely on the grounds that an investigation concerned a tax offence or involved the lifting of bank secrecy. A number of member states considered that such measures should be subject to judicial control; others also raised the practical difficulties involved in supplying lists of bank accounts in the absence of a central register. The Commission acknowledged that member states would have flexibility in how they chose to abolish grounds of refusal founded in bank secrecy or tax matters; they should none the less aim to establish efficient systems for providing assistance in such matters. Work on the Convention would continue at expert level on the basis of the discussion document.</FONT></UL>

 At the Justice and Home Affairs Council held on the morning of 17 October formal agreement was given to the draft Framework Decision covering the exchange of information between the Financial Intelligence Units of member states. It is unlikely that compliance with this instrument will require any change in the organisation of the National Criminal Intelligence Service, which performs this function in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="01031w20.html_para5">In the afternoon of 17 October Justice and Interior Ministers came together with their Finance Minister colleagues to discuss the fight against financial crime. This joint Council invited the member states to have in place special multi-disciplinary units to fight money laundering. However such units could either be new or, where necessary, build upon existing arrangements. In the United Kingdom we are satisfied that the present anti-money-laundering role discharged by the National Criminal Intelligence Service fully meets the objectives identified by the joint Council.

<P>

<a name="01031w21.html_para7">Measures are already in place to try to improve consistency in sentencing. The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 places a statutory duty on the Court of Appeal to have regard to the need to promote consistency in sentencing when framing or revising sentencing guidelines.

 The European Parliamentary Election Regulations 1999 set out the arrangements for filling vacancies in the European Parliament.

Only if that list is exhausted can a by-election take place. We have no plans at this time to alter these arrangements.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w22.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 There have been no discussions on this specific issue.

<P>

<a name="01031w22.html_para0">The PAT 8 report on Anti-Social Behaviour was published in March and builds on the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 to take forward action to combat anti-social behaviour, including problems such as graffiti, vandalism, nuisance neighbours, and other problems on housing estates.

<a name="01031w22.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Guidance to the Crown Prosecution Service is not a matter for the Home Office. I have not identified any need for guidance to the police on this subject but I do attach great importance to the protection of communities from defacement of property and other forms of disorder. The Government's consultation paper "Reducing Public Disorder: the Role of Fixed Penalty Notices" canvassed views on proposals to use fixed penalties for a range of offences. Views were specifically sought on what offences, including criminal damage, might be suitably dealt with in this way.

 Replacement travel documents issued by United Kingdom authorities for those that have been stolen or misappropriated are easily distinguishable from the stolen documents. Accordingly, the United Kingdom does not intend adopting the procedure followed by other Schengen states which involves the recording of fingerprints and photographs of persons whose identity has been usurped.

Article 94 of the Schengen Convention sets out those items of information which may be stored in relation to any person whose details are entered on the Schengen Information System. The United Kingdom is not yet participating in the System and has, therefore, made no entries in relation to any suspect from the United Kingdom.

<a name="01031w23.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 It is undoubtedly the case that most users of Class A drugs, such as heroin and cocaine, started off by using so called soft drugs, normally cannabis. But establishing a causal link is extremely difficult because of a range of compounding factors such as socio-economic background; family functioning; adolescent risk taking behaviour and delinquency; and peer affiliations. But even allowing for these factors there is increasing evidence of a causal link. For example, research from New Zealand published last year concluded that, even allowing for a wide range of compounding factors, regular cannabis users (50 times a year) had a 59.2 times higher risk of using other illicit drugs than non cannabis users.

<P>

<a name="01031w23.html_para0">Where Dutch policy is markedly different is in relation to their attempts to separate the markets for so called soft drugs, and drugs such as heroin and cocaine. The most obvious example of this is the Dutch policy towards the sale and possession of cannabis for personal use through the system of "coffee shops". Such a policy, whereby use of cannabis remains illegal but the laws are not enforced, cannot be a model for the United Kingdom; nor have I seen any evidence that it would be desirable to follow this example.

 Statistical data are not collected on offences which may have been committed while an offender is under the influence of alcohol or drugs. However, both the British Crime Survey and the NEW-ADAM programme of interviewing and drug testing arrestees shed some light on the links between drugs, alcohol and crime.
<P>

<a name="01031w23.html_para1">The 2000 British Crime Survey reported that 40 per cent. of victims of violent crime believed their attacker was under the influence of alcohol, while 18 per cent. believed that the perpetrator was under the influence of drugs.

<a name="01031w23.html_para3">The research, which was undertaken at four sites (in London, Liverpool, Nottingham and Sunderland), found that over two thirds of arrestees (69 per cent.) tested positively for at least one drug (excluding alcohol) and 20 per cent. tested positive for alcohol.

<P>

<a name="01031w23.html_para4">It should be remembered that because an arrestee tested positive for alcohol or drugs or a victim believed that a perpetrator was under the influence of drugs or alcohol it does not necessarily mean that the consumption of alcohol or drugs caused the crime to be committed.

 It is the responsibility of local Drug Action Teams to assess the extent of drug misuse in their area and to plan and implement action to tackle the problem. I understand that the Worcestershire Drug Action Team commissioned a survey which reported on young people's perceptions of drug use in 1997-98. 73 per cent. of those sampled were between 14 and 16 years old. 53 per cent. of the sample said they had been offered drugs. 31 per cent. were offered drugs by a friend. 39 per cent. of those who were offered drugs accepted the offer.
<P>

<a name="01031w23.html_para5">Nationally, the extent of drug misuse among the population aged 16 to 59 is measured through the British Crime Survey (BCS), which includes a self-report element on drug misuse. The findings focus particularly on those aged 16 to 29. The BCS includes a regional, but not county-level, breakdown of statistics. In the 1998 survey--the latest available--21 per cent. of respondents aged 16 to 29 in the Midlands region had used any drug in the last year.
<P>

<a name="01031w23.html_para6">Drug misuse among young teenagers is measured by a schools survey among secondary school children aged 11 to 15.

It should also be noted that 29 per cent. of the available NEW-ADAM sample were not interviewed because they were thought to be intoxicated with alcohol.

 Within the major research programme that underpins our 10-year national Drugs Strategy, there are two current research projects that will give us a better understanding of the economics of drug dealing. One project is attempting to size the United Kingdom drug market and estimate total expenditure, based on a consumption analysis. Another is looking at the middle levels of the United Kingdom drug market (i.e. between importer and street dealer level), to improve our understanding of secondary drug distribution in the United Kingdom. The results of both pieces of research will be published next year.

As a consequence of this policy, there is no list of countries that permit better social reintegration.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w25.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The production of genetically modified animals, as well as their use in experiments or other scientific procedures, is controlled under the terms of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. The Government are satisfied that the 1986 Act adequately caters for transgenic animals used in scientific procedures, and that there is no need for separate controls.




<P>
<P><I>31 Oct 2000 : Column: 438W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="01031w25.html_para0">Since the genetic modification of animals was first achieved, the number of genetically modified animals produced and used under the terms of the Act has increased considerably, and is likely to continue to increase. The production and use of such animals allows new areas of medical and other scientific research to be explored; provides the potential for investigating a wide variety of conditions including cancer, cystic fibrosis and multiple sclerosis; and allows the quality of the science in many areas of research and testing to be improved.
<P>

<a name="01031w25.html_para1">The vast majority (over 95 per cent.) of GM animals produced and used are mice. Other genetically modified animals produced and used under the 1986 Act are: rats; rabbits; pigs (for xenotransplantation research); sheep (modified, for example, to produce human proteins in their milk which can be extracted and used to treat human medical conditions); domestic fowl and fish.

 Our policy is to ensure that all areas of the country, urban and rural, benefit from a modern, effective and responsive police service and we are increasing funding for rural forces to take account of the additional costs associated with policing rural areas. The police funding formula includes a sparsity element which directly benefits rural forces and an extra &#163;15 million from the Police Modernisation Fund has been allocated this year to 31 forces covering rural areas. This rises to &#163;30 million from 2001-02. The forces concerned will be required to demonstrate real improvements in the policing of rural areas in return for the extra money.

 The manufacture, sale and importation of 14 bladed, pointed and other offensive weapons have been banned under Section 141 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, in addition to flick knives and gravity knives, the sale of which was already banned under the Restrictions of Offensive Weapons Act 1959.

 The Government are determined to ensure that the United Kingdom is not used as a base for the planning and preparation of terrorism here or abroad. The Terrorism Act 2000, which is due to come into force early next year, further strengthens our response to international terrorism by the inclusion of powers to proscribe organisations concerned in international terrorism; to counter the financing in this country of terrorism anywhere overseas, and includes a new offence of incitement here to commit an act of terrorism, wholly or partly outside the United Kingdom, where that act, if committed in England and Wales, would constitute one of a number of specified offences, in particular murder.
<P>

<a name="01031w25.html_para5">It is a high priority for the police and the Security Service to counter the activities of those who may be seeking to support terrorism outside the United Kingdom.

<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment he has made of the effect of introducing an alternative vote system in UK parliamentary elections on the degree of proportionality between votes cast and hon. Members returned.  [135026]<P></UL>

<P>
<a name="01031w25.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Government have not made such an assessment of the alternative vote (AV) system. The Independent Commission on the Voting System proposed that its recommended system, AV plus, be put before the electorate in a referendum as an alternative to first-past-the-post. While no change will be made to the voting system without an endorsement by the general public in a referendum, a decision has yet to be made as to its timing and the question to be asked.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w26.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Paragraph 29 of the Representation of the People Regulations 1986 makes it an offence to withhold the information which an electoral registration officer (ERO) needs to compile the electoral register. The ERO can report to the Crown Prosecution Service for possible prosecution any cases of refusal to provide the information, or of giving false information. Figures for prosecutions are not separately collected, but indications from EROs are that they are relatively rare. We see no necessity to monitor such cases specially and have no plans to do so.

<a name="01031w26.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 When considering any application for a project licence under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 the Secretary of State is required to weigh the likely adverse effects on the animals concerned against the benefit likely to accrue as a result of the programme to be specified in the licence. Any application referred to the Animal Procedures Committee for its consideration will contain such an assessment.
<P>

<a name="01031w26.html_para1">One of the 20 members of the Animal Procedures Committee is medically qualified, and is in current practice.
<P>

<a name="01031w26.html_para2">The Act requires the Animal Procedures Committee to have regard both to the protection of animals against avoidable suffering and unnecessary use in scientific procedures and to the legitimate requirements of science and industry. The latter requirement would include a consideration of the interests of patients and patient groups. The Committee's deliberations may also encompass the scientific merit and scientific validity of the proposals, as well as the welfare costs to the animals used.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w26.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Section 5(4) of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 requires that any application to use protected animals in research must be subjected to a detailed cost/benefit assessment by Home Office inspectors. The likely adverse effects on the animals concerned must be weighed against the benefits likely to accrue as a result of the proposed programme of work. Clinical benefit, including more cost-effective health care, are factors which may be taken into account in this assessment. A number of sources of advice are available to me on the benefits of research. These include the Animal Procedures Committee and the relevant professional bodies. I also receive representations on issues relating to the use of animals in scientific procedures from a wide range of interest groups, including medical charities.

 The use of firearms by police officers is governed by section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967, which requires that the use of force in the prevention of crime or apprehension of offenders must be reasonable in all the circumstances, and by operational guidance provided by the Association of Chief Police Officers.
<P>

[135405]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w26.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The term community rehabilitation centre is not one which is in common use. However, there are currently 100 approved probation and bail hostels in England and Wales. The table shows the name of each approved hostel, the probation area it is in and the number of bedspaces it currently provides. Approved hostels provide an enhanced level of supervision in the community, as well as a supportive and structured environment, within which residents can be supervised effectively for as short a period as is necessary. They are intended as a base from which residents take full advantage of community facilities for work, education, training, treatment and recreation. They would therefore normally be based near to such facilities. Some approved hostels are near to prison establishments, but we do not have this information centrally. The number of staff employed in each approved hostel varies according to the number of bedspaces provided, but on average it would be between 18 and 24. Again, more detailed information is not centrally available.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a grant to the Crimestoppers Trust; and if he will make a statement.  [135098]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w27.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 For 2000-01 the Home Office made a grant of &#163;90,000 to Crimestoppers for their administration costs. I have also agreed to fund an evaluation of the effectiveness of Crimestoppers' work in London.

<P>
<a name="01031w27.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Simon Hughes: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on proposed changes to the funding of prison education; if it is his policy to devolve funding to the Department of Education and Employment; if it is his policy to ring-fence prison education funding <i>(a)</i> overall and <i>(b)</i> in each individual prison budget; and what the proposed time-scale is for the changes.  [134676]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w27.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 A joint Prison Service and Department for Education and Employment (DfEE) partnership will be established to build on the policy framework for prison education. The plan is for funding for prison education to be transferred to DfEE from April 2001. It will be ring-fenced but detailed arrangements have yet to be finalised.
<P>

<a name="01031w27.html_para0">Accountability for management control and responsibility for delivery will remain with the Director General of the Prison Service. It is envisaged that close working between the Prison Service and DfEE will be beneficial for prisoners.
<P>

<a name="01031w27.html_para1">There will be a joint Ministerial announcement early in 2001 which will set out the details of the partnership and funding arrangements.

<a name="01031w27.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to introduce restrictions upon practising freemasons in <i>(a)</i> the police, <i>(b)</i> the judiciary and <i>(c)</i> his Department.  [135916]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01031w27.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Government have introduced voluntary registration of freemasonry membership in the judiciary and magistracy, the Crown Prosecution Service, the police service, and the prison and probation services. As the response rate to the voluntary registration scheme in the police service was too low to meet the Government's aim of having reasonable public transparency in this area, I am consulting the police service about how a more acceptable response rate can be achieved.
