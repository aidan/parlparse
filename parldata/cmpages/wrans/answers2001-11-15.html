To ask the Secretary of State for Defence on what date his Department established a working group of officials to prepare his Department for the implementation of the Freedom of Information Act 2000; and on what dates this committee has met since it was set up.  [14769]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11115w01.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Following Royal Assent in November 2000, officials in the relevant Ministry of Defence policy branch began making initial preparations for implementation of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. This has involved an ad hoc programme of briefings, meetings and workshops to heighten awareness and improve understanding of the Act. As a result, the main defence management areas and policy branches were asked in August 2001 to nominate representatives to participate in the principal Freedom of Information (FOI) working group, which has responsibility for ensuring smooth implementation of the Act across the MOD. The FOI Working Group had its inaugural meeting on 17 October and it will meet again in mid-December.

<a name="11115w01.html_wqn11"><B> Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if cluster bomblets are defined as precision munitions in the conflict with the Taliban and Al-Qaeda network in Afghanistan.  [14263]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11115w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Cluster bombs rely on a ballistic delivery&#151;for example, on the skill of the crew to ensure accuracy&#151;and neither the bombs nor the bomblets that they release are laser guided. They are used with discretion and proportionality as international law requires, and against legitimate and appropriate terrorist and military targets that are selected with great care. Our targeting and weapons selection processes are rigorous with every effort made to avoid civilian casualties.

 The delivery of armed forces pay under the new arrangements introduced by Pay 2000 involved rebuilding the core of the three single service pay systems. Since 1 April 2001, 95 per cent. of our regular armed forces have been paid under these systems. The remainder will be transferred by April 2003. The Armed Forces Personnel Administration Agency (AFPAA) has a PFI partnering arrangement with Electronic Data Systems (EDS) for the delivery of information systems and information technology in support of the personnel administration and pay of service personnel.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what his estimate is of <i>(a)</i> the number of home inspectors who will be needed to enforce the proposals in the seller's pack and <i>(b)</i> the cost to the taxpayer of policing compliance with the seller's pack.  [13808]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11115w02.html_spnew15"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Home condition inspection should not be confused with enforcement. The home condition report will be a standard mid-level survey that we propose should be a mandatory part of the seller's pack. This survey will be carried out by accredited professionals who may be surveyors, buildings inspectors or any other professional who satisfies the accreditation body that they have the necessary skills and knowledge.
<P>

<a name="11115w02.html_para0">We anticipate that some 7,000 to 9,000 people will need to have been accredited through the certification regime in order to provide home condition reports. The vast majority of these will be currently practising professionals.
<P>

<a name="11115w02.html_para1">The cost of enforcement would depend on the regime agreed by Parliament. But the assessment provided by L.A.C.O.T.S. of the costs arising from the proposals in the 2000 Homes Bill suggested an average of around &#163;5,000 per annum for each local authority to meet the costs of enforcement work by trading standards officers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11115w03.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 All metropolitan fire authorities received an increase in grant in 2001&#150;02 and will receive an increase in grant, as a result of the floor and ceiling mechanism, in the 2002&#150;03 local government finance settlement.
<P>

 This Department makes no specific financial provision available for construction of swimming pools. However local authorities may use their non ring-fenced basic credit approvals, which are issued by this Department, to support borrowing for any capital projects. The majority of capital funding for sport is channelled through the sports councils. Sport England is the distributor for the Lottery Sports Fund, to which local authorities may apply, which provides funding for a range of community sports facilities, including swimming pools.

 None. South Norfolk district council are currently considering an outline planning application for residential development at Cringleford together with a new link road between the A11 and Colney Lane. The new link road would have the potential to provide an alternative route to the new Norfolk and Norwich hospital.

<a name="11115w03.html_para1">It is for Norfolk county council, as the local highway authority, to consider the question of a second access for the hospital. The Highways Agency looked at the acceptability of allowing direct access to the hospital from the A47 and concluded that an additional junction between the B1108 Watton road and the A11 would affect the safe and efficient operation of this section of the A47. Subsequently a technical assessment of a direct link between the A47 and the hospital was commissioned by Norfolk county council and the Highways Agency is currently examining proposals received from the county council on 1 November.

 The mechanism for reviewing trials without jury in Northern Ireland is already in place.

Friend the Prime Minister on 25 June is looking at the objectives of energy policy to develop a strategy that ensures current policy commitments are consistent with longer-term goals. To achieve its aim, the review is considering all sources of energy including nuclear. At this stage, there is no presumption of any change in nuclear industry policies. The review is due to report to my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister at the end of the year.

 Local authorities are responsible for the regulation of residential care homes provided by national health service trusts.

This responsibility will be taken over by the National Care Standards Commission (NCSC) from 1 April 2002. NHS care homes providing nursing come within the scope of the Commission for Health Improvement (CHI). We expect the NCSC and CHI to work together to ensure that consistent standards are applied across these services.

 The Government support a wide-ranging research programme to inform the development of their education and training policies, including those relating to participation in learning by older people. In addition to survey data and academic and action research, we consult with the providers of education and training, employers, trade unions and, of course, older learners themselves.

<a name="11115w10.html_para5">Following the launch of the Code of Practice on Age Diversity in Employment, the Government undertook a comprehensive evaluation programme. This involved an evaluation of the "employment cycle" including training and development within work; and a qualitative study into the effectiveness of three Government training programmes to help unemployed older people into work. The results from this research have been used to develop policy on combating age discrimination. For example, the evaluation of the Age Diversity Code led to an enhancement of the "Age Positive" campaign, which promotes the benefits of an age diverse workforce to employers; and it also helped to target the campaign effectively on small and medium sized employers.

 School buildings that are well maintained and are suitable for delivering the curriculum are a key element supporting improvement in educational standards in schools. In January this year the Department published findings from an initial evaluation study, which supported this view.
<P>

<a name="11115w10.html_para6">Since school buildings are key to raising standards, we believe that head teachers and their governing bodies should be able to play a decisive role in the management of their school buildings. To help schools do this, consistent delegation of all revenue funded repairs to school buildings was introduced for all schools from April 1999, and each school has been allocated a devolved capital budget since April 2000. Most capital funding, for major work to repair, improve or expand school buildings is still managed by local authorities. But we believe giving schools their own capital budgets as well means that decisions about smaller works are improved, since they are taken by those who best know where their impact can increase standards. They also enable schools to influence local authority decisions about major capital investment.

 Data on skills shortages are not collected on a constituency basis by the Department. However, the Employers Skill Survey 2001, which was funded by the Department, provides estimates within Local Learning and Skills Council boundaries. In this survey, skill shortage vacancies were reported by five per cent. of employers in the Oxfordshire, Milton Keynes and Buckinghamshire Local Learning and Skills Council area. This compares to a national average of four per cent. and a high of eight per cent.

 <i>[holding answer 14 November 2001]:</i> Lord Moser's 1999 Report, "A Fresh Start", notes that perhaps as many as 7 million people (roughly one in five adults) in England have difficulties with functional literacy and numeracy. We are commissioning a new survey next year to provide an up-to-date assessment of the scale of basic skills need in England.

<a name="11115w11.html_para2">The Government are fully committed to helping those who do not have adequate literacy skills. For adults, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minster launched Skills for Life, the national strategy for improving adult literacy and numeracy in England on 1 March 2001. New national standards, a core curriculum for literacy and numeracy, teacher training and national tests in literacy and numeracy are all now available nationally after a successful pilot. A national promotional campaign is currently boosting demand. We are working across Government and with key partner organisations to ensure that all those who can help adults with literacy and numeracy skills needs are able to do so. Our target is that 750,000 adults improve their literacy and numeracy by 2004. More than 70,000 adults have already gained literacy and numeracy qualifications since April 2001.
<P>

<a name="11115w11.html_para3">We are also committed to raising literacy standards for all children. The national literacy strategy, introduced in all primary schools in September 1998, is raising literacy standards for all primary aged pupils. This year 75 per cent. of 11 year olds achieved Level 4 or above in the Key Stage 2 English tests, a 10 per cent. point improvement since 1998. Literacy standards are also rising consistently at Key Stage 1.

 The standards fund for further education is &#163;160 million in 2001&#150;02&#151;twice the amount available in 2000&#150;01. Every beacon college, and there are now 18, is eligible for &#163;50,000 from the standards fund to help them promote and disseminate examples of their good practice.

<a name="11115w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Guidance was recently made available to local authorities and local education authorities relating to the events of September 11 and the subsequent conflict. It can be accessed from the home page of the DfES website and on Teachernet. The guidance does not specifically inform teachers how to address discussion of the global campaign and the use of military force in Afghanistan. Its purpose is to help teachers allay the fears of pupils and to offer examples of good practice to ensure the emotional and physical well being of both pupils and staff. It recognises that schools have done a great deal already and that heads and teachers have the professionalism and expertise to deal with issues as they arise. It reminds them of existing sources of help and encourages a local response and co-operation with local agencies. The guidance is work-in-progress and will be regularly updated in response to comments received and changing circumstances.

<a name="11115w12.html_para2">In the meantime, the Department has been active in preparing for implementation by developing and commencing a training and awareness programme, setting up a dedicated intranet site, alerting our non-departmental public bodies to their legal responsibilities, and holding discussions with key stakeholders on the development of the publication scheme.

 <i>[holding answer 13 October 2001]:</i> My Department has received no direct advice from the police on the extent of fraud in connection with ILAs. At the end of October, the police were carrying out formal investigations into four learning providers (although only three of these have claimed funds from the Department) and are making preliminary inquiries into a fifth learning provider.

 I appreciate the business concerns expressed by some learning providers. However, we have given more than six weeks' notice of the suspension of the ILA programme. Eligible learning from existing ILA holders booked in advance with the ILA Centre by 7 December will attract the discounts from the scheme and that learning can start within a period of up to six months later.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11115w13.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The law guards against biased or unbalanced teaching. Teachers must take "reasonably practicable steps" to ensure that, where political or controversial issues are brought to pupils' attention, they are offered a balanced presentation of opposing views (Section 407 of the Education Act 1996).
<P>

<a name="11115w13.html_para8">Practical advice on how to teach controversial issues has been sent to all schools (Citizenship at Key Stage 3 Teachers Guide). We trust the professionalism of teachers to work within the framework of the school's values in relation to their expressing political opinions in class.
<P>

<a name="11115w13.html_para9">There is no other legislation or guidance issued from the Department which covers the wearing of political badges by school staff. The head teacher of a school has day-to-day responsibility for the conduct of the school and of staff and we would expect them to take a common sense view when dealing with staff whose attire indicates a particular political view. Where it is the head teacher who is visibly demonstrating political allegiance, it would be for the governing body, which is ultimately responsible for the direction of the school, to intervene, again taking a common sense view and taking account of local circumstances.

 The Scotland Office's publicity campaign in February this year operated in tandem with the Home Office's campaign on new electoral arrangements. It included a number of initiatives which specifically targeted people from ethnic minority communities across the United Kingdom. In particular, notices and material were placed in UK-wide publications and other media specifically aimed at ethnic minority groups, and it was arranged for the organisation's Operation Black Vote to use its database of ethnic minority contact points throughout the country, including Scotland, to distribute information leaflets.

<P>
<a name="11115w14.html_spnew15"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 We are aware that a number of the refugees who come to the United Kingdom are highly skilled and many have professional experience in the medical sector. However, asylum applications are judged solely on the basis of whether the applicant is genuinely fleeing persecution. Information about professional skills which are not relevant to the asylum claim, are not therefore collected on arrival.
<P>

<a name="11115w14.html_para12">We have no current plans to fast-track refugees or those with exceptional leave to remain, with medical qualifications, through English language classes. But we want to be able to identify the types of intervention that will assist people to gain employment quickly in their field of expertise, if they are given the right to remain in the United Kingdom.

<P>

<a name="11115w14.html_para13">There is close co-operation between the Home Office and the Department of Health and other agencies to look at how we can do more to identify people with medical qualifications at an early stage. For example, over the last year, the Department of Health has worked with the Refugee Council to set up a voluntary refugee doctor database, which now contains the details of over 400 refugee doctors. In addition, the British Medical Association has been encouraged to prepare guidelines for clinical attachments for overseas and refugee doctors. This will help to provide valuable experience of the national health service and help preparations for language and clinical skill tests.

<P>
<a name="11115w14.html_spnew16"><B> Angela Eagle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 November 2001]:</i> The information requested is not available. The figures recorded by National Asylum Support Service (NASS) for the dispersal of asylum seekers do not show the number of asylum seekers who were previously treated as an Unaccompanied Asylum Seeking Child (UASC).
<P>

<a name="11115w14.html_para14">Under the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000, local authorities continue to have duties and powers in respect of UASCs who have been accommodated under section 20 of the Children Act 1989 until they are at least 18 and to assist them until they are at least 21. The Government's policy of dispersing asylum seekers would have made these duties difficult to implement. It has therefore been agreed that with effect from 1 October 2001, except in exceptional circumstances, NASS will not seek to disperse those young people who have been accommodated by the local authority under section 20 of the Children Act 1989 and who reach the age of 18 without a final decision being reached on their asylum claim.

Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara), 3 July 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 100W, on asylum seekers, what assessment he has made of the reasons for the increase between 1999 and 2000 of refusal of asylum applications on the basis of non-compliance.  [11974]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11115w14.html_spnew17"><B> Angela Eagle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 November 2001]:</i> A higher proportion of applications were refused on grounds of non-compliance in 1999 and 2000 than had previously been the case. The increase was due partly to the stricter enforcement of the 10 day deadline for return of the Statement of Evidence Form (SEF) and partly to administrative problems which led to a backlog of correspondence within the Immigration and Nationality Directorate and some flawed refusals as a consequence. We have made a number of changes over the past 12 months to improve our administrative processes and reduce flawed refusals. These include the introduction of a dedicated PO Box for the return of completed SEFs, and adjustments to internal procedures to ensure that the receipt of SEFs is registered on a database.
<P>

<a name="11115w14.html_para15">We have also taken steps to improve asylum applicants' understanding of the asylum process and of the importance of meeting the time limit. We have done this by simplifying the explanatory leaflet which is sent out

with the SEF, and by making it available in the 33 languages spoken by most asylum seekers in the United Kingdom. The SEF form has also been simplified. Non-governmental organisations were consulted about these improvements.

The Government are keeping under close review whether the activities of al-Muhajiroun bring that organisation within the requirements for proscription set out in section 3 and, if the conclusion is that this organisation is concerned in terrorism, I will give full consideration as to whether it is appropriate to recommend their proscription to Parliament.

<P>

<a name="11115w16.html_para0">British Telecom and Cable and Wireless carry all emergency 999&#150;112 calls. Following a successful trial with the Metropolitan police, ACPO have arranged for British Telecom and Cable and Wireless to route all silent 999 calls for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland through a switch that engages a recorded message. This message states that the emergency services have been called, but that no voice connection has been detected, and that the number "5" on the keypad should be pressed twice if the emergency services are required.

<a name="11115w16.html_para1">This service came into effect nationally on 1 October 2001 and will remove silent calls that were previously routed to police command and control rooms throughout the country.

These figures increase to around 75 per cent. and 65 per cent. respectively if more efficient use of energy in transport is included. Assessments made by my Department for the PIU Energy Review covering the period up to 2050 suggest that there is substantial scope for further cost-effective energy efficiency savings across the economy.

 The Rural Enterprise Scheme (RES), which is a part of the England Rural Development Programme, provides grants for all types of farmers, including hill farmers, seeking to pursue good diversification projects. The RES has a total budget of &#163;152 million between 2001 and 2006. Financial assistance is also available for planning consultancy advice for viable diversification projects under the RES. Other funding is available from Regional Development Agencies in the form of Redundant Building Grant. Additional measures, such as the Vocational Training Scheme and the Farm Business Advice Service, also offer relevant support.

 Operational responsibility for flood alleviation measures rests with local operating authorities, namely the Environment Agency, local authorities and Internal Drainage Boards. This Department provides funding on capital works and the provision available for flood and coastal defence has already been increased from last year's outturn of &#163;66 million to &#163;114 million in 2003&#150;04. The operating authorities' maintenance and operational programmes are funded largely through local government funding arrangements. Currently some &#163;264 million a year is provided through Standard Spending Assessments which are largely supported by central grant and non-domestic rate income. Further increase in both funding streams will be considered in the Spending Review 2002 process.

 The Department is developing, in close collaboration with other Departments, a draft CHP strategy, which will set out the measures needed to achieve the Government's target of at least 10,000 MW of installed CHP electrical capacity by 2010.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11115w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 As of 28 September, there were 84 signatories to the Kyoto Protocol. Nearly 40 of these are developed countries with emissions reduction or limitation targets. Carbon dioxide emissions in about two thirds of these countries increased between 1990 and 1999, which is the most recent year for which data are available, but total emissions from developed countries (including the US) were about the same as in 1990.
<P>

<a name="11115w18.html_para1">The Protocol gives developed countries considerable flexibility as to how they meet their Kyoto targets, including using international emissions trading and projects to reduce emissions in other countries to supplement domestic action. The Protocol also allows countries to count increased carbon uptake by forests and soils (so-called "sinks"), and to make reductions across a basket of six greenhouse gases, not just carbon dioxide.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11115w18.html_spnew6"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 provides for a cut-off date in 25 years time for the recording of certain rights of way on definitive maps and the extinguishment of those not so recorded by that date. In order to ensure that the definitive maps are as complete as possible by this date, we have asked the Countryside Agency to consider ways of co-ordinating the efforts of user groups in researching any, as yet, undiscovered rights of way.
<P>

<a name="11115w18.html_para5">The Countryside Agency is currently in phase 1 of this project, which will assess the scale of the task. The contractors (made up of a consortium led by Cheltenham and Gloucester College of Higher Education) will be consulting all interested parties on the best way of supporting the research and on providing information and training. The aim is that by spring 2002 the Agency will have sufficient information to put in place a mechanism for managing grant aid to provide support and training and for undertaking research.
<P>

<a name="11115w18.html_para6">The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 does not include a separate requirement to identify and map public rights of way. Definitive maps of public rights of way were first required to be produced under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act, 1949. They are the responsibility of the local highway authority who (under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981) have a duty to keep the definitive map and statement under continuous review and to make such modifications as they deem necessary.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11115w18.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 None. Within the EU the Netherlands was the only country that vaccinated against foot and mouth disease (FMD). However, the vaccinated animals were subsequently slaughtered and meat from them was not exported.
<P>

<a name="11115w18.html_para7">The importation into the UK of fresh meat derived from FMD susceptible animals originating in Argentina is currently prohibited. Prior to the prohibition, meat from vaccinated animals could be imported from Argentina, but had to be deboned and fully matured so as to remove any risk of the live FMD virus being present. Following outbreaks of FMD in South Africa, the UK prohibited imports of fresh meat with effect from January 2001. Following an improvement in the FMD situation in South Africa, and appropriate guarantees from the South African authorities, this prohibition was lifted in June 2001 in line with EC law. This meant that meat originating in certain areas of South Africa which are FMD free can be imported into the UK. Imports of meat from vaccinated animals in South Africa is not permitted; however, meat imports must still be deboned and matured.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11115w19.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 It has been estimated that up to 3 million domestic refrigeration units are disposed of in the UK each year. The number that will require storage prior to recycling depends on the construction of suitable facilities for the recovery of ozone depleting substances. Some of these could be operational as early as spring 2002. The Department estimates that up to 750,000 units will need to be stored in 2001&#150;02. Many of these will be stored by, or on behalf of, local authorities. It is more difficult to estimate storage requirements for 2002&#150;03, although the requirement for storage will decrease as recovery and recycling facilities become operational. It is estimated that of the 750,000 units stored, 540,000 would be fridges, 120,000 fridge-freezers and 90,000 freezers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills which categories of person having regard to age, marital status, duration of residence in the UK, immigration status, nationality and other characteristics, are eligible for <i>(a)</i> free statutory-age schooling, <i>(b)</i> free nursery education, <i>(c)</i> free education in colleges of further education and <i>(d)</i> education in higher education institutions, free other than through contributions to home students' tuition fees.

<P>
<a name="11115w20.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 October 2001]:</i> Any child of compulsory school age living in England is entitled to free education. All four-year-olds are entitled to three terms of free, good quality, part-time nursery education before they reach compulsory school age regardless of duration of residence in the UK, immigration status, nationality or any other characteristics.
<P>

<a name="11115w20.html_para1">Three-year-olds are entitled to a free, good quality, part-time nursery education place depending on their age and their local early years development and childcare partnership's allocation criteria. Early years development and childcare partnerships must allocate places based on social need.
<P>

<a name="11115w20.html_para2">The Learning and Skills Council is responsible for determining when tuition fees are to be charged for further education courses. Advice to institutions for the current academic year is that, subject to residency requirements, tuition fees should not be charged to any learner aged 16 to 18 on either a full-time or part-time course. Other groups not charged tuition fees include: those receiving jobseekers' allowance (JSA); those receiving a means- tested state benefit; unwaged dependants (as defined by the Benefits Agency) of those listed above; people on adult basic education or English for speakers of other languages programmes; asylum seekers in receipt of the equivalent of a means-tested benefit (assistance under the terms of the 1999 Immigration and Asylum Act), and their dependants; and, certain learners participating in Council funded projects (only where identified in the project specification).
<P>

<a name="11115w20.html_para3">Higher education institutions, as independent, self- governing bodies, decide whether to charge students tuition fees at the 'home' rate or the higher 'overseas' rate using the Education (Fees and Awards) Regulations 1997, (as amended). To be eligible for home fee status, students usually need to have 'settled status' in the UK and have been ordinarily resident here for three years before their course starts, except where this was solely or mainly to receive full-time education. Students meeting these requirements will be classed as "home" students for tuition fee purposes. Broadly speaking, these will include, in most cases, UK and other European Union students, students with recognised refugee status, other students granted the right to enter or remain and who meet the UK residence requirement, and migrant workers from the European Economic Area. Students not meeting these requirements may be charged fees at the 'overseas' rate.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The OECD asks for statutory salary scale points but, where these are not available, countries can use survey data on actual salary and use approximations to identify equivalents to bottom and top of the scale.<P>

2. Some countries pay different salaries to teachers in primary and secondary schools although there is no such distinction in England. 'Lower secondary' is, broadly the 11&#150;15 age range and upper secondary is 16&#150;19.<P>

3. These salary comparisons can be only broadly indicative. Thus, they exclude extra allowances and yet, in England, many teachers at the top of the scale would also get management allowances. The figures pre-date the introduction of performance related pay but the OECD definition would exclude that too. There are other differences, for example in the treatment of employer social security payments.<P>

4. The time taken to get to the top of the scale varies markedly between countries and so, for example, a country with a high top scale point might require many years service to reach this and so the top point is not representative of the pay of most teachers.<P>

5. 'Purchasing power parties' are different from currency exchange rates and aim to reflect differences in price levels between countries and are more appropriate for those comparisons. Teacher salaries will also reflect the overall levels of national incomes and wages in national economies which is one reason why the range of salaries is so wide. There will be other such factors such as the average age of entry to teaching of new qualifiers. Salary will also reflect non-pay elements of remuneration and features of the teaching job such as hours, workload, job security, status all of which might vary between countries.<P>

 <i>[holding answer 13 November 2001]:</i> Approximately 35,000 early years settings are registered to deliver Government funded nursery education. Of these, around 50 per cent. are local education authority maintained primary schools and nursery schools, all of which directly employ qualified teachers.
<P>

<a name="11115w23.html_para0">We have asked local early years development and child care partnerships (EYDCPs), in association with their local education authorities, to ensure that a ratio of one teacher with qualified teacher status to every 10 early education settings in the private, voluntary and independent (PVI) sector is achieved by 2004.
<P>

<a name="11115w23.html_para1">The approximate cost of placing a qualified teacher in every PVI sector setting would be &#163;435 million per annum. We have no present plans to do this.

Under the Mink (Keeping) Regulations 1975 (as amended), such movements must be carried out in closed cages or other containers which prevent mink from escaping. The movement of farmed mink in Wales is a matter for the National Assembly for Wales. However, I understand that there have been no licensed mink farms in Wales for some years.

 The Department does not have statistics which could accurately reflect any job losses in the agricultural sector resulting from foot and mouth disease.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11115w24.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Cleansing and disinfection and restocking are key stages in the FMD eradication process.

<P>

<a name="11115w24.html_para1">Our policy is to ensure that cleansing and disinfection is carried out thoroughly and efficiently while at the same time ensuring the best use of public funds. Preliminary cleansing and disinfection (C and D) is carried out during the slaughter and disposal stage on all premises known, or believed to be contaminated with foot and mouth disease in order to minimise the risk of the virus spreading to neighbouring farms. Twenty-four hours after this stage has been completed, secondary C and D can commence, the purpose of which is to reduce the risk of recrudescence and allow for restocking. Restocking can commence once the farmer has a certificate stating the C and D has been satisfactorily completed.
<P>

<a name="11115w24.html_para2">The Department will normally pay the costs of secondary C and D providing farms are (a) in a reasonable state of cleanliness and repair, (b) there are no health and safety implications for those involved in the cleansing operation and (c) that the costs incurred are proportionate to the individual farm situation. Since 5 August, contractual arrangements have been tightened and farmers encouraged to undertake secondary C and D themselves, wherever possible.
<P>

<a name="11115w24.html_para3">Restocking must be accomplished in such a way as to balance the needs of the livestock industry and the veterinary and scientific advice as to the disease control risks involved in this process. The key elements of our restocking policy are as follows:
<P>

<a name="11115w24.html_para4"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Secondary C and D must take place and a period of 21 days allowed to elapse prior to restocking.
<P>
<BR>
If secondary C and D does not take place, a period of 12 months must elapse prior to restocking.
<P>
<BR>
Movements of stock on to the farm must be licensed by DEFRA.
<P>
<BR>
The numbers of livestock permitted for initial restocking must be set out in the premises restocking plan, which must be approved by the divisional veterinary manager.
<P>
<BR>
Depending on the origin of sheep, testing of the flock of origin and all the sheep to be moved may be required. This will give valuable surveillance data on the prevalence of disease in the national flock.
<P>
<BR>
Animals are to be inspected regularly for four weeks. Sheep and goats will be blood tested after 28 days. If all clear, restrictions can be lifted.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) if she will make it her policy that no new farmscale GM crop trials will be licensed within cross-pollination distance of Ryton Organic Gardens;  [275]
<P>
<UL>(2) what powers the Government have to intervene in the licensing of the farmscale GM crop trials once they have been approved by SCIMAC and the Scientific Steering Committee.  [289]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11115w26.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 June 2001]:</i> The crops grown in the programme of farmscale evaluations (FSEs) are at two different stages in the authorisation process. The powers to intervene in the licensing of the FSEs depend on the authorisation status of the GM crop concerned.
<P>

<a name="11115w26.html_para1">The oil seed rape and beet are authorised by my Department for growing in the evaluations under UK legislation implementing Part B of European directive 90/220 on deliberate release of GMOs. The consent is underpinned by a risk assessment and permits the GM crops to be grown in the evaluations on any arable land where rape or beet would normally be grown. The consent holder has to notify the Department of the locations of proposed sites prior to sowing together with a statement indicating whether the risk assessment remains valid for the new site and, if not, provide further evaluation. The consent holder may proceed to sow the crop unless he receives written indication from the Department that the new site does not comply on safety or other grounds with the conditions of the consent and the risk assessment.
<P>

<a name="11115w26.html_para2">The GM maize has Europe-wide approval for cultivation under Part C of Directive 90/220 granted in August 1998 by the French competent authority on behalf of the EC. However, this approval imposes no restrictions or conditions on the locations where the maize can be grown. For this crop, therefore, the Department has no statutory powers to intervene over the location of trial sites. However, before the GM maize could be grown commercially individual varieties will require listing on the National List of Seeds or the European Common Catalogue. In addition, under our voluntary agreement with the industry body SCIMAC, this GM crop will not be grown commercially in the UK until the completion of the evaluations and only then if it is assessed as causing no unacceptable effects on the environment.
<P>

<a name="11115w26.html_para3">The evaluations are being undertaken by an independent research consortium and overseen by the independent Scientific Steering Committee. SCIMAC provide the fields of crops for study. The steering committee has set overall criteria for the conduct of the evaluations and requires a representative distribution of sites. SCIMAC find farmers who may be willing to host an evaluation and draw up a list of potential farms from which the researchers select sites to meet the SSC criteria. Ministers are not involved in this process.
<P>

<a name="11115w26.html_para4">Given the public reaction to the proposal to locate an evaluation close to Ryton Organic Gardens last spring, the Government will use their influence to seek to ensure that no FSE site is chosen in future within cross-pollution distance of Ryton Organic Gardens.
