 The UK climate impacts programme is conducting ongoing work to provide scenarios to show how our climate might change and co-ordinating research on dealing with our future climate. This includes work on climate change impacts on the agriculture sector.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">Research suggests that climate change impacts do not appear to threaten the viability of the agriculture industry as a whole in the UK due to the adaptability of UK systems., However, individual agricultural businesses and land managers will need to be alive to the need to adapt.

<a name="stpa_1">The UK national adaptation policy framework is currently being developed. It will help to provide a more strategic approach to adaptation, identifying key risks and opportunities common across a number of policy areas and to coordinate approaches where possible.

<p><a name="qn_1"><a name="60502w01.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Evennett: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent assessment she has made of air quality in the London borough of Bexley.  [65681]</p>




<p><a name="st_1"><a name="60502w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Local authorities have a duty under Part IV of the Environment Act 1995 to review and assess the current, and likely future, air quality in their areas. Where local authorities consider that one or more of the nationally prescribed air quality objectives for each of the seven pollutants is unlikely to be met by the relevant deadline, they must declare an air quality management area (AQMA), covering the area where the problem is expected. These local authorities must then take action, along with other agencies and organisations, to work towards meeting the air quality objectives. The Mayor has responsibility for ensuring the local air quality management regime is undertaken appropriately by London boroughs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w01.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">Following the first round of reviews and assessments, the London borough of Bexley declared an air quality management area in respect of Particulate (PM10), in the Manor road area, in August 2001. In fulfilment of its obligations under Part IV of the Environmental Protection Act, Bexley carried out a further assessment of existing, and likely future, air quality within the AQMA in the borough, and submitted a report to my Department in May 2003 and the Mayor of London in March 2003. The report concluded that the air quality management area as declared was still justified.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w01.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">The council consulted my Department on its draft plan in July 2003, and the Mayor of London in June 2003. The Greater London Authority has asked Bexley to provide an update on its action plan.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w01.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_7">The last round of reviews and assessments started in 2003 and London boroughs had to submit their updating and screening assessments (USA) by December 2003. They were expected to submit either a detailed assessment, where further investigation was required, or a progress report by December 2004. The London borough of Bexley submitted its USA to my Department in September 2004, and the Mayor of London in October 2004. The conclusion was that further investigation (detailed assessment) was needed at Manor road in respect of the likely exceedences of nitrogen dioxide and PM10 objectives. The Department is still awaiting a report on its detailed assessment of air quality.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w01.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_8">The next round of review and assessments has now started and local authorities are asked to submit a new updating and screening assessment by the end of April 2006, which will be considered by my officials. My Department will be assessing the London borough of Bexley&#039;s report as part of this exercise.

 The Department is currently undertaking an assessment of the humaneness, efficacy and non-target risks of a body snare specifically designed to restrain badgers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w01.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">The trials are initially being undertaken in captivity&#151;pen trials&#151;under Home Office licence with continuous observation by researchers. This ensures that if any animal is injured during capture immediate assessment and, if necessary, intervention can occur. In the absence of such signs the animals are restrained for a maximum of eight hours. At the end of the restraint period the badgers are examined for injuries by a veterinary surgeon. They are then held for a further four days and re-examined by a veterinary surgeon for signs of any sub-dermal damage&#151;necrosis&#151;before release back to the wild. The available evidence is reviewed after each trial to determine whether further studies should proceed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w01.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_12">The aim is to release all animals back to the wild unharmed within a maximum period of 10 days following initial capture. Advice from veterinary surgeons and badger experts is that removing the badger from its home territory for this length of time should not affect the social structure of the family group.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w01.html_para13">
<a name="stpa_13">If the humaneness of the body snare is found to be acceptable in these pen trials, then field trials will be conducted to confirm its humaneness and to assess effectiveness, utility and non-target risks. It is anticipated that body snares will be inspected approximately every four hours during such trials.

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="60502w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 An independent review of veterinary capacity and preparedness was carried out prior to the implementation of pre-movement testing in England. The review surveyed local veterinary inspectors&#039; (LVI) in high incidence areas in England. The review found that most LVIs had a good general awareness of the new requirements and felt they would be able to respond to and meet the expected demand for testing. The full report can be found on the DEFRA website at: www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/premovement/report.pdf

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="60502w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Based on 2005 monthly cattle movement data and assuming cattle are tested in groups of 20, the maximum cost to Government of paying for all pre-movement testing to the end of June is estimated at &#163;714,000.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w01.html_para14">
<a name="stpa_14">However, as Government support is limited to one test per herd owner, and as the figure does not take account of herd owners who use their routine herd test, the actual costs to Government will be lower. These transitional support arrangements end on 30 June 2006.

<a name="stpa_15">All slaughterhouse cases notified by the Meat Hygiene Service are subject to traceback investigations by the SVS, and have samples taken that are fast-tracked to the Veterinary Laboratories Agency for histology and culture. Where Mycobacterium bovis infection is confirmed, the molecular typing data derived from those tests are used by the SVS to identify the origin of the infection.
</p>


<p>

<p><a name="st_56"><a name="60502w07.html_spnew5"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 In April 2005, DFID funded the NGO Forest Trends, in co-operation with the World Agroforestry Centre (formerly ICRAF), to produce a report: &#039;Navigating the Border: An Analysis of the China-Myanmar Timber Trade&#039;. In addition, Her Majesty&#039;s Government officials were consulted on the October 2005 Global Witness Report: A Choice for China: Ending the destruction of Burma&#039;s frontier forests&quot;. We believe that the analysis of the trade and its impact contained in these reports is broadly accurate. They report that:
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w07.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_76">China imported 1.3 million m <sup>3</sup>  of timber from Burma in 2003, almost 60 per cent. of total world imports of Burmese timber. In financial terms this equates to illegal timber exports worth $250 million to $300 million annually across the border from northern Burma to China&#039;s Yunnan province. Global Witness estimate that two-thirds of Burma&#039;s total revenue from timber exports came from illegal trade, mostly with China, and that more than 100 Chinese timber companies and 20,000 Chinese loggers are involved in the trade inside Burma.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w07.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_77">In Burma, logging is having an adverse effect on both the local population and the environment. Deforestation has caused localised flooding, drought and resulting crop failure, the disappearance of wild animals and birdlife associated with the forests. Local people in Burma derive little direct financial benefit from the logging industry and are frequently worse off as a result of the presence of Chinese logging companies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w07.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_78">In China, the increased concentration of logging firms and workers along the Yunnan-Burma border has meant that the timber buyers on China&#039;s eastern seaboard largely bypass inland Yunnan and procure materials directly on the border. The recent wave of migration to the Yunnan-Burma border has, in some areas, led to a visible increase in gambling, drugs and commercial sex work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60502w07.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_79">In March 2006, in response to these reports, the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry took the unusual step of admitting that some of its companies and individual citizens are involved in illegal logging in Burma, and said the Government were paying high attention&quot; to the problem and requests the Chinese companies and individuals to abide by local laws and regulations.&quot;

 The UK recognises the severity of the current humanitarian situation in Somalia and the risks of further deterioration. The most pessimistic predictions, however, including famine, are only likely if the 2006 long rains fail. Fortunately these have now started and are continuing well. So far we see malnutrition and mortality rates that are high but not yet catastrophic, and some of the predicted drought enforced migrations that had been envisaged have not taken place. This is likely to be, at least in part, due to the efforts of the relief agencies.

 The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is making good progress in improving public awareness and public confidence in its work. A communication strategy has been developed to improve public awareness of the CPS&#039;s role in prosecuting crime. The strategy includes proactively engaging with the media; working with other criminal justice system agencies on communication initiatives; improving stakeholder engagement; and promoting the CPS&#039;s vision of becoming a world-class prosecution authority. Greater awareness is important in raising public confidence in the CPS. The latest British Crime Survey report on policing and confidence, published on 30 March 2006, suggests that public satisfaction with the CPS&#039;s work has increased.

A further 696 personnel were diagnosed with an adjustment disorder, which will include some who have post traumatic symptoms not amounting to full PTSD but with some symptoms of post traumatic stress. Other personnel were diagnosed with a range of other mental health conditions, including mood and neurotic disorders, and psychoactive substance misuse.

Nor is it possible, for example, to break down the medical evacuation figure given in my previous answer of 2 February 2006, <i>Official Report</i>, column 704&#150;05W, because the database which records the data does not contain information on treatment received after evacuation.

 UK Sport&#039;s total allocation of &#163;4.817 million to the sport of shooting between 2006&#150;9, announced in April, is based on its investment model which calculates how many athletes should be supported at each stage of the performance pathway in order to deliver a potential number of medals in that sport.

<a name="stpa_128">These costs have been averaged across all the sports, which means that each national governing body has some flexibility about how it allocates the funding to its athletes, while being required to deliver against a set of agreed milestones.

Such companies can take advantage of certain accounting and reporting exemptions in the accounts and reports they prepare for members and file with the Registrar of Companies. However, public (including public listed) companies are excluded from these special provisions, and, so, cannot qualify to file as medium-sized. Since no public companies can file medium-sized accounts with the Registrar, it is not possible to estimate the proportion of medium-sized companies that are public companies.

<i>[holding answer 27 April 2006]:</i> The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) assumed responsibility for the decommissioning and clean up of the UK&#039;s civil nuclear legacy on 1 April 2005. The cost of the decommissioning and clean up of the NDA&#039;s sites is calculated by means of Life Cycle Baselines&#151;which are long-term plans providing a detailed assessment of the scope, methodology, and time scale of proposed site activities, including the cost of its commercial operations. Based on the 2005&#150;06 Life Cycle Baselines the NDA has estimated the undiscounted cost of delivering its mission at &#163;62.7 billion at current prices. This is the figure given in its strategy. But the NDA has also identified a potential further &#163;7.5 billion of costs that will need to be included in future Life Cycle Baselines. Information on Life Cycle Baselines and the long-term funding of the NDA&#039;s mission is available on its website www.nda.gov.uk

The NDA is considering the scope for extending the life of Wylfa beyond 2010&#151;which is the planned closure date given in its approved strategy. The NDA has advised me that in light of factors such as the age of the plant, related safety concerns, and the closure of associated fuel processing facilities at Sellafield such an extension is highly unlikely.

 We continue to have serious concerns about the situation of religious minorities in Iran. The Iranian constitution recognises the Christian, Jewish and Zoroastrian communities, but not others such as the Baha&#039;is. We receive many reports of discrimination against those wishing to practise these faiths. The position of people who have converted from Islam appears to be especially difficult. We have made clear to the Iranian authorities that we believe that persecution of individuals on the grounds of their religious beliefs is unacceptable. We expect Iran to uphold freedom of religion and belief in accordance with its international obligations under Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil & Political Rights.

 Respect for democracy, freedom of expression and the rule of law are principles which form the foundation for UK and EU co-operation with Moldova. They are also principles to which Moldova is committed through its participation in the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and other international organisations. Moldova has made some progress towards becoming a functioning democracy, with active opposition parties represented in Parliament. However, the OSCE&#039;s Office for Democracy and Institution for Human Rights identified a number of shortcomings in the conduct of the 2005 parliamentary elections, including obstruction of the opposition&#039;s campaign. Recent reports have also raised concerns about interference by the Moldovan authorities in the work of opposition political parties. Through the EU troika, we have raised our concerns about these issues, most recently with the Moldovan Foreign Minister at the EU-Moldova Co-operation Council on 6 April. We will continue to monitor Moldova&#039;s progress towards meeting its democratic commitments, including through the European Neighbourhood Policy, which offers Moldova the opportunity to achieve its ambition of closer relations with the EU, subject to progress on internal reform.

 At major airports, Border Control has staff deployed to meet all services requiring immigration control. At smaller airports, resources are deployed on an intelligence led risk basis to deal with passengers who require leave to enter. The IAN Act 2006 provides additional powers to deal more effectively with people posing a threat to border security, including the capture of data on passengers and fingerprinting of those detained. The Border Management Programme ensures that the three border agencies (HMRC, UKIS and the Police) work more closely together to maximise border security while minimising the impact on legitimate traffic. MATRA groups (Multi Agency Threat and Risk Assessment Group) at airports bring together border agencies, operators and carriers to identify and assess risks to general security and put in place action plans in order to counter any potential threats. e-Borders is a multi agency programme to harness passenger information and use new technology to provide more effective border controls. Project Semaphore, as part of the e-Borders programme, is further strengthening the border through the use of an advance passenger information processing system and the adoption of a proactive intelligence led approach.

<p><a name="st_321"><a name="60502w35.html_spnew4"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 The global nature of the causes and effects of climate change means that international action is crucial. The measures in the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#039;s speech to the UN ambassadors highlight how co-ordinated international action can bring significant emissions reductions. These proposals aim to drive forward effective multilateral action. In particular, the Multilateral Development Banks&#039; Energy Investment Framework, and an extension of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and the Clean Development Mechanism will have significant impacts in reducing global emissions, encouraging the development of a deeper and more liquid global carbon market. However, details of these proposals have not yet been finalised with international partners and institutions, so an assessment of their impact would be premature. Action is also needed to tackle greenhouse gas emissions from consumers, and the 1 Watt initiative which the Chancellor proposed has significant potential to reduce global emissions and should be accelerated.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_80">It should be noted that the number of people eligible to vote is not the same as the resident population aged 18 and over. There are numerous reasons for this. For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible), some people do not register to vote and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place. Further, there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. These factors have a differential impact from area to area.</p>

Patient registers include people who are in the country for at least three months, whereas population estimates are based on a usual residence definition requiring a stay of 12 months or more. The patient registers exclude individuals who are ineligible to be registered with a GP. People may be on a patient register after having left the country and not deregistered with their GP; similarly people may have moved to another area and not re-registered. Some patients may have more than one NHS number e.g. they may have been issued a temporary number for a short period. Again, these factors have a differential impact from place to place.</p>

 The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were agreed at the United Nations Millennium summit in September 2000. The goals range from halving global income poverty and protecting the environment, to human development objectives like improving health and sanitation, achieving universal primary education and tackling discrimination against women. Achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has been placed at the centre of Britain&#039;s international development effort. DFID&#039;s key aims and objectives, as set out in its public service agreement, are the attainment of the MDGs by 2015.

The international community committed to raise an additional $50 billion of aid by 2010, to cancel 100 per cent. of the multilateral debts of the world&#039;s poorest countries, and to launch the international finance facility for immunisation. G8 leaders also agreed to achieve universal access to AIDS treatment for all those who need it by 2010, and work on advance market commitments for vaccines against malaria, HIV/AIDS and other priority diseases.
