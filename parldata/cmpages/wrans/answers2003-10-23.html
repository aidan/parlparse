13. <a name="31023w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Rendel: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the role of affordable housing in maintaining the viability of rural communities.  [133795]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w01.html_spnew0"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The Rural White Paper of November 2000 recognised the importance of affordable housing in maintaining the viability of rural communities, as did the Sustainable Communities White Paper this year. That is why we have more than doubled the target for the Housing Corporation's special programme for small rural settlements. Our Rural Housing Enablers are helping to increase the supply of affordable housing. And we are currently consulting on an update of the existing guidance on planning for affordable housing.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what improvements she plans to make to the forestry infrastructure to allow greater amounts of wood residue to reach power generators.  [133798]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Defra, in association with the Devolved Administrations and the Forestry Commission, is setting up a &#163;3.5 million UK-wide Bio-energy Infrastructure Scheme. This scheme will help develop the supply chain required to harvest, store, process and supply biomass, such as energy crops and forestry woodfuel, to energy end-users. The European Commission's approval of the Scheme is currently being sought. Subject to this, we hope to launch the Scheme in early 2004.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on her public consultation exercise regarding sewage odour pollution.  [133800]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w01.html_spnew2"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Before announcing their chosen way forward, the Government's immediate priority is to evaluate the impact of the recent High Court decision that odours from sewage treatment works can be controlled through the statutory nuisance regime of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. We also have to consider the results from the complementary consultation of the National Assembly of Wales before we can announce our chosen way forward.
<P>

<a name="31023w01.html_para0">I expect to be able to announce a clear way forward shortly after the House of Lords ruling regarding an appeal on this matter.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We received 166 responses to the public consultation on our agri-environment schemes held earlier this year, and last week we launched a final round of consultation on more detailed aspects of how the schemes should operate in future.

<P>
22. <a name="31023w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Kidney: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the impact of reform of the Common Agricultural Policy on the support available for growing energy crops.  [133805]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w01.html_spnew7"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy was positive in its support for energy crops. It will still be possible to grow energy crops on set-aside land and to receive payments under the new Single Payment Scheme. If energy crops are grown on non set-aside land payments under the new Single Payment Scheme and the new Euro45 per hectare energy crops payment will be available. The energy crops payment is limited to 1.5 million hectares for the EU as a whole and aid will be reduced if production exceeds that area.<P>

<P>
<a name="31023w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The European Commission issued an options paper on reform of the Sugar Regime in late September 2003. A Defra consultation exercise has just been launched to help inform the UK response, covering agricultural, development and trade issues.

<P>
<a name="31023w01.html_wqn9"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when she next plans to meet the National Chairman of the Tenant Farmers Association to discuss the CAP Reform package of 26 June.  [132264]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, has no plans at present to meet the National Chairman of the Tenant Farmers' Association. However, my noble Friend, the Lord Whitty, is currently considering a request from the Chief Executive of the Tenant Farmers' Association to meet him. The Chief Executive attended a meeting with Defra officials and representatives of other key stakeholders on 8 October which unfortunately my noble Friend was unable to chair due to last minute diary pressures. The Chief Executive has also been invited to a meeting with officials on 17 October.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w01.html_wqn10"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the impact of the CAP Reform package of 26 June on the nation's tenant farmers.  [132265]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 No specific assessment has been undertaken of the impact of the CAP reform proposals on tenant farmers. However, we have assessed the impacts of the proposals on farming and other businesses generally, including an analysis by farm activity, and a summary of these is included in the Regulatory Impact Assessments which have been lodged in the House Libraries. An additional analysis looking at the impact on distribution of payments of various options for operating the Single Payment Scheme has also been carried out and a copy has been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="31023w01.html_para2">For the first time, the bulk of farm subsidy will not be dependent on what or how much farmers produce. As with the previous system, subsidy would be paid to the farmer, whether owner or tenant, will continue to hold the subsidy entitlement. Tenant farmers, along with other farmers, will therefore be free to produce what they judge the market wants and so be better able to cut costs and increase profits. Farmers will also be freed from some of the bureaucracy associated with the subsidy schemes which are being replaced by the new decoupled subsidy.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w01.html_wqn11"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the possible impact on tenant farmers of the option available to EU member states to implement the CAP Reform package of 26 June by using regional average payments.  [132266]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 No such assessment has been done in relation to tenant farmers specifically. However, we have prepared an analysis of the impacts of regional average payments on farming and other businesses generally and a copy has been placed in the Library of the House.

<P>
<a name="31023w01.html_wqn12"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the extent of redistribution of payments between farmers if the CAP Reform package of 26 June is implemented using regional average payments as opposed to the historic payment basis.  [132267]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We are currently consulting stakeholders on whether the historic or area model of the new Single Payments Scheme should be operated in England. Responses to that exercise will help develop our understanding of the range of environmental, social and economic impacts of each of the models including the impact on the agriculture industry and its constituent parts. An assessment has been made of the redistributive effects of a number of CAP direct aid payments. A copy has been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w01.html_wqn13"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if it is her policy to ensure that as farm tenants progress to better agricultural holdings they will be free to move their single payment entitlements established under the CAP Reform package of 26 June to those holdings without penalty.  [132268]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w01.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme will be allocated to farmers rather than holdings. It follows that a tenant would be free to use the eligible land on any new holding to claim payment against the entitlements he or she owns. There is also provision to lease entitlements, but only with an equivalent number of hectares. Leased entitlements would, therefore, revert back to their owner at the same time that the accompanying land does.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the withdrawal by the European Commission of its application to the European Court of Justice for the imposition of a fine on France for its ban on the import of British beef; and what the total fine was for which the French Government was liable.  [133017]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradshaw </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 October 2003]:</i> The UK Government was gratified that France at last complied with EU law and lifted its ban on British beef on 25 October 2002.
<P>

<a name="31023w02.html_para0">The European Commission withdrew its case in the European Court of justice seeking a daily fine on France after France lifted its ban. Therefore, no fines were payable, but the Commission asked the Court to order that costs of the case be borne by France. The UK Government regretted the decision by the European Commission not to pursue the case for penalties against France. The UK supported the Commission throughout and believed that pressing this case would have sent a firm message to member states that no one country can avoid its obligations and responsibilities.

<P>

<a name="31023w02.html_para2">Under EU legislation 38 species are subject to minimum landing sizes. Some Sea Fisheries Committees have introduced minimum sizes for additional species. Fisheries scientists generally advise that a minimum landing size should correspond to the average size of first maturity of female fish. However, this is difficult to achieve in practice when fish of different species, which grow to, and mature at, different sizes, are taken together in a mixed fishery, where the mesh size is not ideal for all species. Some minimum landing sizes, therefore, represent a compromise caused by the mixed fishery problem, and a desire to reduce the need to discard undersized fish. The table as follows lists the current minimum landings size, and recommended minimum landing size based on maturity criteria for some commercial species:

 The UK government's concerns about the workability of REACH have been addressed in our response of 16 July 2003 to the European Commission's internet consultation on the draft legislative proposals for REACH which can be found on the Defra website at http:/www. defra.gov.uk/environment/chemicals/reach/ukresponse.pdf
<P>

<a name="31023w03.html_para0">More recently on 20 September 2003 the Prime Minister along with the President of France and the Chancellor of Germany sent a joint letter to the European Commission addressing these same concerns, details of which have been made available at http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/chemicals/pdf/trilateral.pdf
<P>

<a name="31023w03.html_para1">Our aim is to support the principles of REACH which are intended to protect public health and the environment while making sure that bureaucratic burdens on the chemical industry are kept to the minimum necessary for effectiveness.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what criteria are applied by the Legal Aid Board in considering whether to grant assistance to defendants in civil proceedings.  [133081]<P>

<P>
<a name="31023w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 In Northern Ireland the Legal Aid Committee of the Law Society of Northern Ireland has statutory responsibility for the administration of applications for civil legal aid. The Legal Aid, Advice and Assistance (NI) Order 1981 (the '1981 Order'), provides that legal aid will be available in specified proceedings to any person who meets the prescribed statutory tests. Before granting civil legal aid the Legal Aid Committee must be satisfied that the applicant's disposable income and disposable capital does not exceed the statutory maximum limits. The Legal Aid Committee must also be satisfied that the applicant meets the statutory test of having reasonable grounds for taking, defending or being a party to the proceedings and that it is not unreasonable that he should receive civil legal aid.
<P>

<a name="31023w03.html_para3">With effect from 1 November the Northern Ireland Legal Services Commission will assume statutory responsibility for the administration of legal aid. The Commission will be responsible for applying the same statutory tests as are currently applied by the Legal Aid Committee.

 The Legal Aid Department of the Law Society of Northern Ireland has indicated that during the year ended 31 March 2002 &#163;2,477,126 was paid in respect of defendants in civil legal aid cases. During the year ended 31 March 2003 &#163;3,025,397 was paid in respect of defendants in civil legal aid cases.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="31023w03.html_para5">The Department has no single definition of pensioner poverty. However, measures since 1997 to improve pensioners' incomes have been targeted largely on those in the lower part of the income distribution, many of whom are older women.
<P>

<a name="31023w03.html_para6">The main measures since 1997 include: above inflation increases in the basic state pension between April 2000 and April 2003, increases to the level of the minimum income guarantee and earnings uprating of the guarantee so that no single pensioner need live on less than &#163;102.10 a week and no couple on less than &#163;155.80 a week, the introduction of pension credit in October this year to provide extra support for those with modest savings, winter fuel payments of &#163;200 a year for the remainder of this Parliament, an extra &#163;100 a year within the winter fuel payments for those aged over 80 and free TV licences for someone aged 75 or over.
<P>

<a name="31023w03.html_para7">The Government are spending around &#163;8 billion a year extra on pensioners as a result of these measures. They have resulted in pensioner households gaining &#163;1,250 a year in real terms with the poorest third of pensioners gaining &#163;1,600 a year in real terms.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="31023w03.html_para8">The principle of appointment on merit is central to the judicial appointments process and those appointed should be those who are best qualified for the job.
<P>

<a name="31023w03.html_para9">Notwithstanding this, the Government believe it is desirable to have a judiciary which is more reflective of the society it serves. While our judges have a reputation for excellence that is second to none, the Government recognise that there is, among other things, a significant gender imbalance within the judiciary.
<P>

<a name="31023w03.html_para10">Specific measures to bring more applications (including from women) for appointment to the High Court include the abolition of the previous procedure of appointments to the High Court Bench by invitation only, and the removal of lower and upper age limits for appointment to the senior judiciary.
<P>

<a name="31023w03.html_para11">More generally, initiatives to encourage a greater and more diverse range of applicants for judicial office include:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the work shadowing scheme (which allows legal practitioners the opportunity to see what it is like to sit as a judge);
<P>
<BR>
the career statement scheme (which allows applicants for judicial office to explain any concerns they may have if they believe their career progress to date understates their judicial potential);




<P>

<P>
<BR>
the introduction of salaried part-time working for certain judicial posts (enabling individuals who cannot or choose not to commit to a full time post to nevertheless apply for judicial office);
<P>

the introduction of a system of "block sittings" (which allows those who sit part-time as recorders, and have taken a career break, to obtain the necessary experience by sitting in 'blocks' to enable them to apply for full-time appointments on an equal footing with those recorders who have not had a break from sitting).
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="31023w03.html_para12">The Government recognise that more needs to be done, and has announced the intention to create a Judicial Appointments Commission. While the precise role of the commission is subject to consultation, we envisage that it will be tasked with looking at ways both to attract a more diverse range of suitably qualified candidates to apply for judicial office, and to find ways of making judicial career progression a more realistic prospect for traditionally under-represented groups, including women. The consultation paper 'Constitutional Reform: a new way of appointing judges' is available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="31023w03.html_para13">In the interim, the Department will continue to look at other ways of increasing diversity in the judiciary.

Comparing the number of calls attempted each month with the number of callers, shows, particularly in April-June, a clear pattern of many callers making multiple calls, often using automatic redial equipment. During the same period, due to slow running of the IT system, there were times when calls took longer to handle, thus making it more difficult for other callers to get through.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w05.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Best: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) what implications the Money Laundering Regulations 2003 will have for client confidentiality between professional accountants and their clients;  [131853]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will introduce a minimum reporting level in the Money Laundering Regulations 2003 at which professional accountants must report their clients for errors and omissions in their financial affairs;  [131854]
<P>
(3) what assessment he has made of the impact that the Money Laundering Regulations 2003 will have upon the number of <i>(a)</i> persons and <i>(b)</i> businesses evading tax in the UK.  [131855]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w05.html_spnew0"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 I propose shortly to lay before the House the new Money Laundering Regulations, and amending orders to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and Terrorism Act 2000. They will bring those providing accountancy services, along with other specified activities and professions, into the regulated sector for the purposes of the money laundering legislation.
<P>

<a name="31023w05.html_para0">The Proceeds of Crime Act requires a person who has knowledge, suspicion or reasonable grounds for knowledge or suspicion, of money laundering as a result of information or other matter that came to him or her in the course of a business in the regulated sector to report this to a nominated person in that organisation, or to the National Criminal Intelligence Service. This obligation to report relates to the proceeds of any crime&#151;regardless of the sum of money involved and will override, in this case, the duty of confidentiality owed to that client.
<P>

<a name="31023w05.html_para1">The new Money Laundering Regulations will require regulated bodies to put in place the systems that will allow them to discharge their responsibilities under the Proceeds of Crime Act.
<P>

<a name="31023w05.html_para2">The subject of a minimum reporting threshold was debated extensively during the passage of the Proceeds of Crime Bill, and was rejected by Parliament (mainly 



<P>
<P><I>23 Oct 2003 : Column 656W</I><P>
because of the poor correlation between the sums laundered and the seriousness of the underlying offences). Given that the Act has no minimum reporting level, there can be no such de minimis provision in the Regulations.
<P>

<a name="31023w05.html_para3">The UK takes the view that tax evasion is a serious criminal offence. The strengthening of the whole anti-money laundering regime within the UK, and internationally, will aid in the detection and reduction of money laundering and underlying crime, including tax evasion. Ministerial assurances were given during Parliamentary debate on the Proceeds of Crime Bill that the civil settlement procedure known as "Hansard" by which the Inland Revenue deals with cases of suspected tax evasion, where the taxpayer is actively seeking to set their affairs straight, would be unaffected.

However, as at the beginning of October 2003, some 12,500 armed forces personnel and 300 Ministry of Defence civilians were deployed on operations (including United Nations operations) in Iraq, Kosovo, Bosnia, Afghanistan, Cyprus, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia/Eritrea, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia, and Georgia; all operations directly aimed at strengthening international peace and stability.

 The Ministry of Defence is required by law to release medical information during the course of certain legal proceedings and its policy is in compliance with the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence does not compile a register of Service veterans. At the first Veterans Forum held on the 24 July 2001 it was agreed with members of the Confederation of British Service and Ex-Service Organisations that the definition of a veteran should be as wide as possible and cover anyone who has ever served in HM forces, their widows/ers and dependants.

This found that although joining the armed forces is generally a positive experience, with the overwhelming majority of Service leavers appearing to do well in civilian life, there is a small minority of Service personnel who have difficulty making the transition back to civilian life.

 No decisions about ASSP will be made until the Consortia bids have been fully evaluated. We would need to be satisfied that a Private Finance Initiative/Public Private Partnership solution offered the most cost-effective solution for the provision of airfield support and wider fire services without compromising operational effectiveness or safety before we decided to outsource this activity. Should a PFI/PPP solution be adopted approximately 2,100 civilian staff would be affected, of which it is estimated that some 1,800 would be eligible for transfer (under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Act 1981). Of the latter some 1,500 are Defence Fire Service personnel.

 The Government welcome in principle the opening up of the Directory Inquiries Market to competition.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 No further measures are being taken to enforce the age restriction on the sale of fireworks under the Fireworks (Safety) Regulations 1997. Recent research undertaken indicates that trading standards departments generally give high-priority to firework matters during the firework season including enforcement of the age restriction. This often includes test purchasing by under 18s in many trading standards authority areas.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 The DTI's annual firework safety campaign aims to encourage the public to take care when using fireworks in order to help reduce the number of firework-related injuries. This year's campaign is focusing on the misuse of fireworks by young teenagers and the safe use of sparklers by young children.
<P>

<a name="31023w09.html_para0">Also the provisions of the Fireworks (Safety) Regulations 1997 governing the safety of fireworks used by the public and the fireworks industry's voluntary ban on air bomb type fireworks both help in preventing firework-related injuries.

Our economic long-term interest must be based on our ability to innovate to produce high value-added goods and services which need a highly skilled work force, high calibre managers, forward looking unions and knowledgeable consumers. A protectionist approach would damage the interests of the UK. Figures on the potential for outsourcing do not take account of the fact that the UK could gain jobs in some sectors as a result of increased competition for services. We are the world's second largest exporters of service products especially in financial services. Our service exports at &#163;82 billion are larger than our service imports at &#163;69 billion. Growing international competition in services could see us gain more jobs then we lose.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on trade levels to EU countries since UK membership in 1973; and what effect this has had on UK trade to non-EU countries.  [132937]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The UK's trade with the EU <sup>1</sup>  has grown steadily since UK membership in 1973. The value of the UK's total goods trade (exports and imports) with other EU countries has increased 20-fold since 1973 compared to a 12-fold increase in total goods trade with non-EU countries. Consequently, the EU's share of the UK's total trade in goods rose from 45 per cent. in 1973 to 57 per cent. in 2002.
<P>

<a name="31023w10.html_para3">Data for trade in services with all other current members of the EU before 1992 is not readily available, therefore it is not easy to calculate the exact increase in UK trade for goods and services since 1973. The UK's exports of goods and services to the EU are now worth &#163;142 billion and imports from the EU are worth &#163;166 billion, making the value of the UK's trade with the EU &#163;308 billion. The EU accounts for 53 per cent. of the UK's total trade, but for trade in services the proportion is 43 per cent.
<P>

<a name="31023w10.html_para4">The UK's membership and increasing economic integration with the EU, in particular following the Single Market Programme, has generated considerable opportunities for UK businesses. This has been behind the substantial growth in UK trade with the EU. But, as the 12-fold rise in UK trade in goods with non-EU members demonstrates, this has not been at the expense of overall trade with non-EU members, which has continued to grow rapidly.

 It is for local highway authorities to ensure that footways are suited to the surroundings and pedestrian numbers. The Department has published Local Transport Note 1/97 "Keeping Buses Moving", and "Inclusive Mobility&#151;A Guide to Best Practice on Access to Pedestrian and Transport Infrastructure". These give some advice on local build-outs of the footway at bus stops (sometimes called "bus stop boarders") and recommendations for footway widths at bus stops.

<P>
<a name="31023w10.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 There have been no measures to encourage local authorities and bus companies to offer free travel for under-16s on buses when accompanied by an adult. Free travel to and from school is provided by local education authorities under the education acts for school children up to the age of 16 living more than the statutory walking distances from school. Under the Transport Act 1985 local authorities have a discretionary power to provide concessionary travel for children of school age. That power applies to all journeys, not just those to or from school.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) what measures have been taken to encourage <i>(a)</i> local authorities and <i>(b)</i> bus companies to introduce low-floor buses; and if he will make a statement;  [134105]
<P>

[134114]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w10.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 In recent years, low-floor buses have been introduced in increasing numbers. This change was promoted both by the Department, through a series of research and demonstration projects, and by our statutory advisers, the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee, who produced a recommended specification for low-floor buses which they disseminated widely.
<P>

<a name="31023w10.html_para14">Since 31 December 2000, all new buses and coaches over 7.5 tonnes and with a carrying capacity of more than 22 passengers, which have been introduced on local and scheduled services, have had to meet the access requirements of the Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000. Those Regulations, which were made under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, set down minimum access requirements for vehicles to address the needs of disabled people, including wheelchair users. The Regulations do allow for high-floor vehicles, but in the case of full size single deck and double deck buses, production has now moved to low-floor designs.
<P>

<a name="31023w10.html_para15">About one-third of full size local buses are now low-floor.
<P>

<a name="31023w10.html_para16">There are no centrally held statistics about bus patronage before and after introduction of low-floor vehicles. However, from the research which the Department carried out it, was clear that people were able to board and alight from these vehicles more easily, and that with the elimination of steps in the entrance, many more elderly and disabled people would be able to use buses and to use them for longer.
<P>

<a name="31023w10.html_para17">Of course, having the right vehicle is only part of the solution. We have also made changes to the Public Service Vehicles (Conduct of Drivers, Inspectors, Conductors and Passengers) Regulations to introduce new duties on drivers to provide reasonable assistance to disabled passengers. The Department is also working with TransFed&#151;the training body for the bus industry&#151;to update their NVQ disability awareness training material for bus drivers.

 The extension this year of the minimum statutory requirement to men aged 60 to 65 cost &#163;50 million per year. The Government do not plan further extensions of concessionary fares. We estimate that free concessionary travel for pensioners in England (women aged 60 and over, men aged 65 and over) would cost in excess of an extra &#163;300 million a year.

 It is not possible to estimate the number of hits on average per registered heroin addict seized by the police because only broad ranging estimates of the number of heroin addicts are available. The quantity of drug used in a "hit" will also vary. We do have data on the number of seizures of heroin made by the police, and the quantities they seized: these appear in the table.

 The figures can be found in Table C of the annual publication "Civil Service Statistics" published by Her Majesty's Stationary Office for the Government Statistical Service annually, and which covers permanent staff numbers in each Department and Agency from 1995 to 2002. Information on the Civil Service is published annually in 'Civil Service Statistics', copies of which have been placed in the Library. The latest edition, based on April 2002 data, was published on 24 July 2003. These figures include statistics on press officers, but the term "advisers to civil servants" is not one that is recognised.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w13.html_spnew1"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 There are no reliable statistics relating to the number of imitation and deactivated firearms in circulation. Imitation weapons were involved in 1,201 recorded offences in 2001&#150;02. An examination of 217 real guns submitted to the Forensic Science Service between April-June 2003 showed that 59 had been converted from blank firing replicas, 19 from air weapons and two from de-activated guns.
<P>

<a name="31023w13.html_para0">Offences involving the use of guns are varied and need to be tackled on a number of different fronts. Tough laws and effective enforcement are important and the current Criminal Justice Bill includes proposals for a five-year minimum sentence for the illegal possession of prohibited firearms. We have also included provisions in the Anti-social Behaviour Bill which will ban the carrying of imitation firearms or air weapons in a public place without reasonable excuse. The sale, manufacture, transfer and import of air weapons which use the self-contained air cartridge system&#151;which is readily converted to fire conventional ammunition&#151;will also be banned. The law already regards any imitation which can be readily converted as a firearm which means that it is banned if it is a handgun.

 None. All Sport England Lottery support for football is channelled through the Football Foundation, a partnership between the Government, the Football Association and the FA Premier League. The Foundation receives income from the three funding partners in roughly equal proportions. It received approximately &#163;17 million from public sources in 2002&#150;03. Sport England's contribution to the Foundation was &#163;6 million in that year, the balance of the &#163;17 million coming from the New Opportunities Fund and the Reduction in Pool Betting Duty.

However, through Personal, Social and Health Education pupils learn about health and well-being, including making healthier, safer choices. They are taught to think about the alternatives and long and short term consequences when making decisions about personal health; and to seek professional advice confidently and find information about health. They also consider social and moral dilemmas, for example, how the choices they make affect others.

 A systematic study covering the one-year pilot of the Early Literacy Support (ELS) programme was taken forward during 2000&#150;01 by a team of primary HMI, who have evaluated the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies since 1998. Their detailed findings informed the development of the programme and were summarised in Ofsted's third Annual Report on the Literacy Strategy. Participating teachers, teaching assistants and literacy consultants also provided systematic feedback on the pilot which resulted in the materials and the programme being appropriately modified and refined before publication.

For 2002&#150;03, that amounts to an estimated &#163;21.36 million.

We have also been providing support through the European Union (EU) and the UN.

The UK also provides 19 per cent. of European Community (EC) funding for Iraq. The total EC commitment to Iraq currently stands at Euro100 million.

pipeline until mid 2004 from contracts already funded and signed. As these contracts begin to expire the CPA will take over responsibility for contracting the supply of food and basic goods. Handover preparations have been under way for some time. The Ministry of Trade within the CPA is assessing expected OFF imports, the so called "food pipeline", against total needs. Where there is a shortfall the CPA is contracting alternative suppliers to provide the food. The financing for this will come from the CPA budget.
<P>

<a name="31023w14.html_para5">In the South and Centre of Iraq the Ministry of Trade has always had responsibility for distributing food and basic goods purchased under the Oil For Food scheme. This will not change with the ending of the Oil for Food programme. In the three Northern Governorates the Oil for Food programme was run by the World Food Programme. On 21 November responsibility in the North for this system will pass to a new organisation, the "Program Co-ordination Office". This will work under the CPA and may be able to re-employ many of those currently employed on the distribution side. Work is progressing to ensure that this office has the capacity to carry out its new role. The UK has a food security advisor in the CPA Ministry of Trade, and stands ready to provide further assistance against identified needs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w14.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 Since 1999, DFID has invested &#163;161 million in the Union of Serbia and Montenegro, including Kosovo. Initially, we provided emergency humanitarian assistance covering such areas as food and drug supplies, emergency shelter, health care, mines clearance and funding for international relief agencies.
<P>

<a name="31023w14.html_para6">We have since focused on supporting key economic and social reforms and the poverty reduction agenda, through both technical and budgetary assistance. We have funded strategic interventions such as the reform of Serbia's crumbling banking sector and the development of a merit-based civil service in post-conflict Kosovo. We have also provided &#163;14 million as budgetary assistance to the Kosovo authorities to help meet the costs of administration and reconstruction during the post-conflict period.We also work through multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and the European Commission, contributing &#163;393 million since 1999 through our share of EC development assistance. The EC is the biggest donor in the region, financing large-scale reconstruction programmes in the energy and transport sectors, as well as supporting administrative, economic and social reforms that will help the region rejoin the European mainstream.
<P>

<a name="31023w14.html_para7">Recent reviews of our assistance strategies for the region have found that while international assistance has been successful so far in meeting humanitarian and reconstruction needs, the emerging challenge is to help the authorities to improve the environment for reforms and growth as levels of aid decline.

 DFID is strongly committed to meeting the Millennium Development Goal to halt and begin to reverse the incidence of malaria by 2015, recognising the importance of malaria, not just in terms of disease burden, but also the potential it has to undermine economic growth and human development.
<P>

<a name="31023w15.html_para1">Since 1998, DFID has provided in excess of &#163;110 million to support malaria control activities globally and at country-level. This includes support to Roll Back Malaria, an international partnership to reduce competition and duplication of effort, develop technical consensus, increase political commitment and raise the profile of malaria.
<P>

<a name="31023w15.html_para2">As DFID contributes to a broad based effort to tackle this complex disease, it is not possible to break down our spend to show amounts spent on medicines for malaria by year. Our support at international level is to initiatives which support general malaria control activities and at country level provides finance to governments, either as support to particular sectors or direct into governments' budgets. Our commitment to combating malaria was reaffirmed in May 2003 with our pledge to increase our commitment to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria to US$280 million. Successful implementation of existing Global Fund proposals will result in the number of treatments for resistant malaria in Africa increasing from 15,000 to four million annually and also result in the purchase of seven and a half million insecticide treated nets over the next two years. These nets offer substantial protection against malaria.
<P>

<a name="31023w15.html_para3">Despite the great complexity of malaria, it remains a disease that is preventable, treatable and curable. DFID is committed to supporting national governments and partners ensure that effective drugs and commodities are accessible to the poor.

<a name="31023w17.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is narrowing the justice gap by improving performance so that cases are better prepared, increasing early guilty pleas and ensuring more contested cases reach trial. They are taking a number of steps to achieve this, including increasingly giving early advice to the police so that the case is reviewed early and the appropriate charge laid; improving case preparation and communication with the police to reduce the number of committals discharged; providing greater support to victims and witnesses by providing more information about the progress of the case so that they continue to support the prosecution and reduce the number of ineffective trials, and helping them through the trial process by, where appropriate, using video

 There has been no decision yet as to whether the civil partnership registration scheme set out in the consultation paper issued by the Department of Trade and Industry should be extended to Northern Ireland. My officials are currently examining those proposals with a view to issuing a consultation paper in the autumn. Beyond that, no decision has yet been taken as to whether a parallel civil partnership registration scheme should be introduced in Northern Ireland. In examining the DTI proposals, my officials are considering the possible impact for Northern Ireland of the introduction of a civil partnership registration scheme across a wide range of areas, including those areas where Northern Ireland law and practice differ from England and Wales. This preliminary consideration also includes an examination of the likely impact on couples who register their partnership under the scheme in England and Wales and who subsequently move to Northern Ireland. There is little information on how many such couples there may be, but work is on-going between officials in Northern Ireland and their counterparts in the Department of Trade and Industry. No calculation of the estimated costs of processing and legislating a civil partnership law separately for Northern Ireland through an Order in Council has been carried out.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As Jobcentre Plus is an Executive Agency, the Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning the installation of Jobpoints in Burnt Oak Library, Hendon and Mill Hill Jobcentres.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I can confirm that a Jobpoint is scheduled to be installed in Burnt Oak Library on 28 October 2003. The availability of the Jobpoint in the Library will be publicised in local Jobcentres through posters and leaflets and leaflets will also be issued to customers using the library. To further publicise the new Jobpoint service an official launch is planned later this year in December.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Jobcentre Plus staff currently visit the Library every two weeks to provide face to face advice and jobsearch assistance. This will continue after the Jobpoint has been installed.</FONT></UL>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>During the past 12 months, there have been forteen represenations in the form of parliamentary questions or letters to the Secretary of State from MPs expressing concern about the delivery plans of Jobcentre Plus and specifically about the closure of offices. In addition to responding to these representations in writing, both the Minister of State for Work, Nick Brown, and the Project Director for Jobcentre Plus, Jeremy Groombridge, met with a number of MPs to give assurances about the level of service that will be provided.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>At the Jobcentre Plus District level, managers have and will continue to consult with the widest possible range of people about the service they are planning to provide. Local advice and welfare groups, local authorities and MPs are essential sources of guidance in this matter. Any representions resulting from this consultation process are collated by District Managers.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Jobcentre Plus is delivering a radical change in the way that benefits and employment services are provided to people of working age. By 2006, there will be around 1,000 newly integrated offices across the country which will provide customers with a 'one-stop' service for benefits, advice and jobs. Over 250 offices are offering this new service already and 8 out of 10 customers tell us they are satisfied with all elements of the new service.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>These new Jobcentre Plus services are customer focussed. The new offices enable customers to make enquiries about both their benefits and employment opportunities in the same place. Our new telephone contact centres mean that customers can make enquiries about both benefits and jobs without even having to come into one of our offices. The introduction of new technology is also enabling people to find the information they need about jobs and training via the Internet and our new Jobpoints. Jobpoints are not just being placed in Jobcentre Plus offices, they are also being placed in other public places such as libraries and supermarkets. All of these developments are making it easier for our customers to take advantage of the services we provide.</FONT></UL>

 We continue to be in discussion with the Office of Fair Trading on all aspects of Employers' Liability Compulsory Insurance. In relation to renewals the Government were pleased to see the introduction by the Association of British Insurers and the British Insurance Brokers' Association of new guidance to insurers and brokers on renewals. The guidance included a recommendation for providing policy holders with at least 21 days notice of their renewal terms. In the first instance the Government will look to see the response of the industry to this guidance.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will estimate the value of accrued entitlements to the child maintenance bonus among lone parents in receipt of income support; and if he will make it his policy to preserve accrued entitlements to the child maintenance bonus once the new child support rules are applied to all families.  [132487]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w19.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Pond: </B> 
 The information on the value of accrued entitlements to the child maintenance bonus among lone parents on income support is not available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="31023w19.html_para3">An extended period of one month, rather than the usual 14 days, to meet the work condition for the payment of child maintenance bonus has been put in place for cases transferring to the new child support scheme. To go further would require the maintenance of a substantial number of records for an indefinite period, thereby increasing administrative costs.
<P>

<a name="31023w19.html_para4">The child maintenance bonus was a feature of the old child support scheme, introduced in 1997 to give parents with care receiving income support or income-related Job Seeker's Allowance the benefit of up to &#163;5 a week of the maintenance paid, when they returned to work. In the new scheme, the bonus will be replaced by the child maintenance premium, which will ensure that up to &#163;10 a week of the maintenance that is paid will pass to the parent with care, while she is still on benefit. We estimate that the annual cost of child maintenance premium will be more than four times that which would have been spent in a year on a continued child maintenance bonus scheme.

<P>
<a name="31023w23.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Blizzard: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assessment he has made of the effects of global warming in drawing up the guidance issued for determining applications for the extraction of marine aggregates.  [133249]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w23.html_spnew3"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The effects of global warming were not assessed during the preparation of Marine Minerals Guidance Note 1 (MMG1) published in July 2002. The progressive effects of climate change due to global warming on the marine environment are still relatively uncertain. However, at present, these appear to include rising sea levels, increased storminess, changes to sea floor habitats and modified behavioural patterns of marine organisms. These are all matters that can be taken into account, as appropriate and as knowledge increases, in the Environmental Statements that accompany each marine minerals dredging licence application. Each Environmental Statement is examined carefully and widely consulted upon before 



<P>
<P><I>23 Oct 2003 : Column 724W</I><P>
that application is determined. Licences for dredging of marine minerals are both time-limited and subject to conditions that include monitoring of the marine environment to ensure that action can be taken if unforeseen effects take place. As regards general policy, MMG1, as with all Government guidance, is subject to periodical review and to revision when necessary. Where the impacts of climate change both become more certain and are sufficiently significant to influence the stance of policy in these areas, the guidance can be revised to take them into account.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w23.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Blizzard: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how much marine aggregate has been extracted from UK coasts in the last 10 years; and what his assessment is of the total amount that may be removed within safe environmental limits.  [133252]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w23.html_spnew4"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Most marine dredging for aggregate takes place over five kilometres away from the immediate vicinity of the coast. There is little extraction closer to the coast. The total amount of sand and gravel extracted for use as aggregate from all licensed areas in UK waters over the past 10 years is about 253.3 million tonnes. It is not possible to estimate with any certainty how much can be removed within safe environmental limits since the total size of the resource is not yet known. In addition, impacts on the sea-floor, marine currents and waves, habitats and uses of the sea all need to be assessed in detail, on a project-by-project basis, to establish whether any individual proposal is environmental acceptable. Each licence application is subject to an environmental impact assessment which includes a coastal impact study. This is the subject of careful analysis and wide consultation and, if necessary, additional investigations before a decision is taken. All licences that are issued by the Crown Estate are subject to conditions specified by Government to make sure that any environmental impacts are minimised. Licences are time-limited so that the position can be reconsidered if further dredging is proposed.

<P>
<a name="31023w23.html_spnew8"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 When travellers have bought and developed land without planning permission, this would be an unauthorised development, which is a breach of current planning laws. A range of powers already exists to deal with unauthorised development, which is a planning matter. When travellers have trespassed onto land they do not own, that is an unauthorised encampment.

Some of the reduction in recorded registration numbers is due to improvements in the methods of removing duplicate registration records which were first employed by the Dental Practice Board in 1993.

These target times will depend on the complexity of, and priority attached to, individual cases but the guidance suggests that the maximum target time for the entire process should in any event be no more than 260 working days and only 80 working days in high priority cases.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health which <i>(a)</i> countries of the present European Union and <i>(b)</i> applicant countries allow meat inspection by the meat industry.  [133119]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w26.html_spnew9"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 European Union legislation, that applies to all member states and will apply to applicant countries on their accession, requires meat inspection to be carried out by the official competent authorities. The legislation does not allow the meat industry to carry out meat inspection. However, the legislation does permit, in some circumstances, trained plant staff to assist with post-mortem inspection of poultry and rabbits, but only under the direct supervision of the official veterinarian. This system of inspection is currently in place in a number of United Kingdom poultry plants.

1. Figures are rounded to the nearest whole number.<P>

2. A new system of occupation coding for NHS non-medical staff was introduced in 1995. The new codes classify staff according to what they do rather than the terms and conditions under which they are employed ie national payscales. Figures based on new occupation codes are not directly comparable with those based on the old payscale classification.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="31023w27.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 National health service-funded student midwives are eligible for financial support under the terms of the NHS bursary scheme. The total value of bursary payments made to midwifery students for the academic year 2002&#150;03 was &#163;14.8 million, with 3,164 students being in receipt of a bursary. All NHS-funded students also have their liability for a tuition fee contribution (worth up to &#163;1,100 for the academic year 2002&#150;03) met on their behalf, without means testing.

In 2002&#150;03, 1,445 students started training for a first qualification to become a midwife, an increase of 42 per cent., since 1999&#150;2000. A further 677 started post-registration courses to become a midwife. Latest figures from workforce development confederations suggest a further overall increase of over 100 in the current financial year. Further increases in the future to improve midwifery services and to achieve the NHS Plan target.
