<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50223w01.html_spmin2"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 Our policy towards Iran is one of critical and conditional engagement. The UK, France and Germany (the E3&quot;), with European Union representatives, are engaged in a dialogue with Iran aimed at agreeing long-term arrangements for Iran&#039;s nuclear programme. These are intended to provide objective guarantees that Iran&#039;s nuclear programme is exclusively for peaceful purposes. Working groups on political/security issues and nuclear issues met in Geneva on 9 February and 10&#150;11 February respectively. A working group on technology/co-operation met on 8 February. Relations between Iran and the United States are a matter for those two countries.

<p><a name="st_6"><a name="50223w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Paul Murphy: </b> 
 The Belfast Agreement envisaged a Northern Ireland Assembly and a power-sharing Executive, both made up of locally-elected representatives. The Government continues to believe that this represents the best long-term guarantee of peace and stability in Northern Ireland and I regret that current circumstances make it impossible to restore those institutions at present.

 Between 1999&#150;2000 and 2005&#150;06 total spending on education has increased by 56 per cent. Total funding per pupil has increased by 64 per cent. In the budget for 2005&#150;06 I have increased the allocation to the ELB centre budgets by &#163;19 million over the previous year; that is almost 6 per cent.&#151;from &#163;333 to &#163;352 million at a time when inflation is running at 2.5 per cent. and pupil numbers are declining.

<p><a name="st_30"><a name="50223w03.html_spnew0"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), in its current form, impacts on agricultural markets in Africa by increasing world supply, thus lowering world prices; by artificially raising EU prices; by heavily subsidising exports; by undermining world price stability and by limiting access to our markets through the use of high import tariffs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50223w03.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_13">This imposes high costs on developing countries. Empirical research has shown that amongst rich countries, the EU is responsible for the biggest costs to developing country farmers. Reform of the CAP could increase developing countries&#039; food and farming income by $7.5 billion per year, which could significantly reduce poverty for those producers in Africa.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50223w03.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_14">DFID and the UK are committed to reform of the CAP in order to facilitate freer and fairer agricultural trade between developing countries, including in Africa, and the EU. This issue is being analysed in theCommission for Africa Report, expected in March2005.

<p>
<a name="50223w03.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_15">DFID will continue to press for reforms on the EU side including by weakening the link between EU farm support and domestic production to discourage over production (which lowers the world market price), and providing better market access by reducing tariffs andwill also continue to build supply-side capacity of agricultural producers including infrastructure and technological development to improve quality andcompetitiveness of African products.

Only around 5 per cent. have been classified as declining in management condition. In some cases improvements in management condition are secured by English Nature through management agreements under its Wildlife Enhancement Scheme and in others by the Rural Development Service through agri-environment schemes. On other sites improved management has been achieved with support from the Heritage Lottery fund, for example at Cannock Chase and Sutton Park under the Tomorrow&#039;s Heathland Heritage initiative.

<a name="stpa_26">One major outstanding issue which relates to the condition of river and other wetland SSSIs is diffuse pollution, invariably from agricultural sources. Under the Modernising Rural Delivery Programme a specific pilot scheme is now underway to tackle diffuse pollution issues on the river Teme through collaborative working among both relevant agencies including the Integrated Agency confederation and the Environment Agency together with local individuals and groups.

(ii) Biodiversity: The Government is supporting the co-ordination the of six Local Biodiversity Action Plan (LBAP) Partnerships operating in the West Midlands and the delivery of specific nature conservation actions for a selection of each area&#039;s most threatened habitats and species. This ranges from restoration of lowland heathland in Staffordshire and Worcestershire to the survival of water voles in Birmingham and Herefordshire. The region&#039;s Biodiversity Strategy (to be launched March 2005), and the associated regional biodiversity audit and regional habitats targets work, has derived from strong Government engagement with and facilitation of partnership outputs. The ODPM&#039;s Regional Planning Guidance (June 2004) incorporates policy intent to achieve effective protection and measurable gains in the conservation status of 23 priority habitats by 2010.

 Rehabilitation and support allowance will be for people with less severe impairments that can be well managed with the right support and so need not be a major long- term obstacle to getting back to work. Disability and sickness allowance will focus more on those with the most severe impairments where the health problem or disability will, for some time, form a very significant obstacle to getting back to work. However, we know many people with severe impairments still do work, and want to do so. Disability and sickness allowance recipients will still be able to access any appropriate programme or financial support.

Notes:<br>

1.Expenditure is taken from audited health authority accounts and summarisation forms which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total expenditure accounted for by the health authority. Figures are given in cash terms.<br>

2.Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of health.<br>

3.In many HAs, there are factors which distort the expenditure. These include:<br>

the HA acting in a lead capacity to commission healthcare or fund training on behalf of other health bodies; and<br>

asset revaluations in national health service trusts being funded through HAs.<br>

4.The majority of general dental services expenditure is not included in the individual health authority accounts or summarisation forms and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board (DPB). An element of pharmaceutical services expenditure is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority (PPA) and not by HAs. Total expenditure on these items by the DPB and the PPA cannot be allocated to individual health bodies and are therefore omitted from the answer.<br>

5.For these reasons expenditure per head cannot be compared reliably between HAs or between different years.<br>

 National Standards, Local Action: Health and Social Care Standards and Planning Framework 2005/06&#150;2007/08&quot; (2004) sets out the framework for all national health service organisations and social service authorities to use over the next three financial years to take forward the NHS improvement plan.

<a name="stpa_162">The national specialised services mental health definition subset provides guidance to commissioners on securing effective collective planning arrangements that take into account the needs of a planning population considerably larger than that of a single primary care trust (PCT). A group led by the national director for mental health is currently reviewing the subset with a view to publish updated guidance later this year.

<p><a name="st_168"><a name="50223w19.html_spnew6"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The national service framework (NSF) for mental health provides a rationale and evidence base for a national standard for mental health services relating to carers of people with mental health problems. In accordance with the NSF, all individuals who provide regular and substantial care for a person on the care programme approach should have an assessment of their caring, physical and mental health needs repeated on at least an annual basis. People who provide regular and substantial care for a person on the care programme approach are also entitled to have their own written care plan, which is given to them and implemented in discussion with them.

<p>
<a name="50223w19.html_para17">
The Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000 strengthens the rights of all carers to an assessment of their own needs as carers. It involves a right to a carer&#039;s assessment. It gives local councils mandatory duties to support carers by providing services to carers directly and in the provision of breaks, as well as, directly supporting carers by providing direct payment for carers&#039; services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50223w19.html_para18">
<a name="stpa_165">In line with the NHS Plan, mental health provider trusts are recruiting 700 carer support workers to increase the breaks available for carers and to strengthen carer support networks. To consolidate the progress that is being made and to build on good practice and research, the Department published guidance entitled Developing Services for Carers and Families of People with Mental Illness in 2002&quot;.

 The Office for National Statistics published a report, Psychiatric morbidity among adults living in private households, 2000&quot; in Great Britain. It was found that 164 per 1,000 of the adult population suffered from neurotic disorder, which can be broadly regarded as mild to moderate mental illness. The prevalence rate for probable psychotic disorder was five per 1,000 and for personality disorder 44 per 1,000 of the adult population. These disorders can be regarded as severe mental illness.

 As stated in my written statement on 26 January 2005, <i>Official Report</i>, column 19WS, the Home Office-led review concluded that intercept would not have made a critical difference in bringing prosecutions against the Belmarsh detainees.

 The Home Office-led review looked at the experience of a range of other countries, all of which regard intercept product as a valuable contribution to evidence used in their courts.

<a name="stpa_271">The review found that the United Kingdom could not simply transplant the evidential regimes of other countries because our legal system is very different, being both adversarial and subject to ECHR considerations. No other country examined had a statutory basis for intelligence agencies to assist law enforcement agencies as is the case in the United Kingdom. The review underlined the importance and value of the unparalleled co-operation between the United Kingdom&#039;s intelligence and law enforcement agencies but noted that this would

 Contestability is the principle that best quality and best value for money is achieved through ensuring that services are opened up to competition. The procurement of high quality services to offenders will contribute to the reduction of re-offending.

<p><a name="st_221"><a name="50223w25.html_spnew7"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 As I announced on 20 July 2004, offender managers will remain employed by Probation Boards. As the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) develops, however, this will involve changes to the role of Boards and to the management relations between Regional Offender Managers (ROMs) and offender managers. Detailed feasibility work and consultation will be undertaken before any final decisions are made with regard to organisational change.

 It is difficult to determine exactly the impact of Neighbourhood Watch activity in reducing crime in isolation from other crime reduction interventions. The 2000 British Crime Survey found that 75 per cent. of respondents thought that Neighbourhood Watch schemes were effective in preventing crimes such as burglary, the percentage being similar for members and non-members of Neighbourhood Watch schemes.

<sup>(20)</sup>General government grants comprise Home Office police grant, ODPM revenue support grant and national non-domestic rates.<br>

<sup>(21)</sup>Includes funding from the crime fighting fund, rural policing fund, basic command unit funding, community support officer funding, special priority payments, the DNA expansion programme, capital provision, Airwave and the premises improvement fund.<br>

<sup>(22)</sup>Figures for 2001&#150;02 are not directly comparable with 2002&#150;03 due to the change in funding arrangements of NCS/NCIS. Adjusted (lower) figures for 2001&#150;02 are therefore included for future comparison.<br>

<sup>(23)</sup>General government grants comprise Home Office Police grant, ODPM Revenue Support Grant and National Non-Domestic Rates.<br>

<sup>(24)</sup>Includes funding from the Crime Fighting Fund, Rural Policing Fund, Basic Command Unit funding, Street Crime Initiative, Community Support Officer funding, Special Priority Payments, the DNA Expansion Programme, capital grant, Airwave and the Premises Improvement Fund. Total for specific grants in 2005&#150;06 are an estimate.<br>

<sup>(25)</sup>Figures for 2001&#150;02 are not directly comparable with 2002&#150;03 due to the change in funding arrangements of NCS/NCIS. Adjusted figures for 2001&#150;02 are therefore included.<br>

<a name="stpa_287">Prisoners pay to make an estimated 25 million telephone calls a year. For Foreign National prisoners, Governors have the discretion to provide a free 5-minute call provided that the prisoner in question has not received a domestic visit in the preceding month. Governors also have the discretion to provide prisoners with access to an official telephone or make a call on their behalf to a close relative or partner within the first 24 hours of their arrival into prison. The only other occasion where prisoners are provided with calls at official expense is in urgent domestic circumstances involving a close relative or partner.

 The Government have put in place policies in the areas of crime reduction, antisocial behaviour, policing and active communities that are yielding considerable benefits for the Worcester constituency, as well as for all parts of the UK.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50223w30.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_295">For example, between March 1997 and March 2004, the number of police officers in the West Mercia Police Force increased by 325 from 2,040 to 2,365. The Government&#039;s introduction of Community Support Officers (CSOs) in 2002 has put 67 CSOs on West Mercia streets to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour. Between 1997 and 2003&#150;04, West Mercia has seen a reduction in recorded domestic burglary crimes of 10 per cent. and in recorded vehicle crimes of 36 per cent.

<a name="stpa_296">West Mercia Police Force is receiving &#163;111.8 million in general grants for 2005&#150;06, an increase of 3.75 per cent. (&#163;4.1 million) over this year. West Mercia benefits from the decision to provide a funding floor of 3.75 per cent. If the funding formula had been strictly applied, the Force would have received &#163;2.5 million less. General grants funding to West Mercia has increased by 27 per cent. between 1997&#150;98 and 2005&#150;06. In addition to general grants, West Mercia will also receive around &#163;10 million in specific grants funding for targeted initiatives in 2005&#150;06.

<a name="stpa_298">The Crime Reduction Programme (CRP) was a pioneering Government intervention programme which ran for three years from April 1999 in England and Wales and took an evidence-based approach to crime reduction.
