 The two main assisted voluntary return (AVR) schemes operating during 2005-06 were the voluntary assisted return and reintegration programme (VARRP) and the assisted voluntary return for irregular migrants (AVRIM).</p>

 DFID uses a range of funding instruments to improve health in developing countries. The preference is to provide budget support or pooled funds to support a country to implement its own health plan. DFID regards this as the best way to strengthen the overall health infrastructure&#151;the clinics, trained staff, essential medicines, and running costs&#151;to deliver a broad range of health services. DFID may also provide additional support to target specific diseases or new health challenges. In more difficult settings, such as fragile states, DFID is likely to initially support projects against specific diseases but will aim to move, where possible, to support broader health programmes. The two approaches are not exclusive and complement each other. For example DFID funding to the GAVI Alliance enables countries to provide the newer and underused vaccines; funding through the country budget will help train and employ the health workers who vaccinate children and to buy the basic vaccines such as polio and measles.</p>

 The Department for Transport recognises the success of the rail industry in attracting new passengers. There are a number of activities currently under way to quantify future demand in the Yorkshire and Humber region and to deliver a level of service that meets this. The Department is currently producing a regional planning assessment for the region, which will identify the role that the railway needs to play over the next 20 years in supporting the economic growth of the region. At the same time, Network Rail is producing a route utilisation strategy for Yorkshire and Humber, which will focus on improvements that can be made to the existing railway to provide an optimal level of service and capacity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="70302w0004.htm_para3"><a name="07030263000567">In addition to this, the Department is currently producing its high level output specification, which will set out the Department's objectives for the national rail network during the next industry funding period between 2009 and 2014. One of the key issues to be addressed in this period is the provision of sufficient capacity to meet future growth projections for rail travel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="70302w0004.htm_para4"><a name="07030263000568">In addition to these longer term activities, the department works closely with current train operators and other local stakeholders to identify and secure value for money opportunities to provide additional capacity. The introduction by Transpennine Express of its new class 185 fleet has expanded a number of services to three car operation as well as providing local passengers with an improved environment on their services. The Department has also worked closely with Northern Rail and West Yorkshire PTE to secure an additional six class 158 trains for services in west Yorkshire to address passenger growth in this area.</p>

I welcome the co-operation that is taking place between Merseytravel PTE, English and Welsh transport authorities and the Welsh Assembly Government to examine potential improvements, including electrification.

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="70302w0004.htm_para9"><a name="07030263000590">A decision to proceed with electrification would be subject to producing a business case with Network Rail and the rail industry, and securing the necessary funding. It would be necessary to show that sufficient extra passenger numbers would be likely to use the electrified service to make it a value for money option. It would be for the authorities in the North West Region to justify such expenditure against other priorities and to secure this via their allocated regional funding.</p>

Where necessary, these allocations took account of reasonable changes in treatment activity and charge income levels as a result of testing new ways of working. Under the dental reforms introduced from April 2006, resources for primary dental care services have been fully devolved to PCTs. It is for PCTs locally to manage expenditure and income associated with dental services in the context of managing their overall net financial commitments.</p>

<i> [pursuant to the reply, 9 January 2007, Official Report, c. 493W]:</i> I regret that in my previous answer the figure of &#163;228 million given for the cost to the BBC to support Digital UK for the period of digital switchover was incorrect. The correct figure is &#163;216 million. The full correct response to your questions is as follows:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="70302w0008.htm_para4"><a name="07030263001215">In addition to meeting its costs for the upgrade of the transmission network for digital switchover, the BBC will meet Digital UK&#146;s communication costs and a share of Digital UK&#146;s operational costs. The cost to the BBC to support Digital UK amounts to &#163;216 million for the period of digital switchover. In addition, the BBC will also fund the digital switchover help scheme for people 75 or over or who have a significant disability. Our best estimate at this stage is that the cost of the scheme will be at or around &#163;600 million over the period of switchover.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="70302w0008.htm_para5"><a name="07030263001216">There are no central estimates of the overall cost to Government of digital switchover.

The Insolvency Service&#146;s Edinburgh Redundancy Payments Office (RPO) is liaising with the Administrator of Bonne Bouche Frozen (UK) Ltd to establish what payments are due. Once the information is obtained to identify what payments are due they will be made without delay. The RPO aims to pay 78 per cent. of claims within three weeks of receipt and 92 per cent. within six weeks of receipt.</p>

It provides information on job searching; compiling CVs; further education and training for individuals who need to develop new skills; as well as benefits information. Jobcentre Plus works closely with other organisations to assess the scale of any redundancy situation so that that it can give people who are able to work, the best chance of getting a job. Its key partners include local authorities (LAs), the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), Education and Learning Wales (ELWa) and Scottish Enterprise, the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) in England, the Scottish Enterprise and the Welsh Development Agency and other Government Departments. The majority of the Bonne Bouche work force has made claims at Hartlepool Jobcentre Plus and every effort is being made to find them employment or retrain.</p>

 The criteria used to determine the level of funding for a Territorial Army unit cover pay, tasking and overheads. The pay budget allotted to a unit is based on the anticipated strength of the unit (the number of Territorial Army personnel in the unit) and the tasking budget is based on both the current and future roles of the unit (training (man training days) and deployments). Overheads cover those costs associated with the estate and administrative matters. Funding will, therefore, vary according to a unit&#146;s strength and place in the operational cycle. However, all Territorial Army units receive the funding necessary to enable them to meet their task.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="70302w0011.htm_para8"><a name="07030263001594">In general terms, there is no maximum limit on the number of training days placed on any Territorial Army officer or soldier and, as such, no formula is used in determining the allocation of training days to a Territorial Army unit. A unit at full strength will secure more funding to ensure that all its personnel have the opportunity to achieve their minimum training  <br>

requirement. Similarly, a unit that is preparing to send a formed sub-unit to an operational theatre is likely to use more funding training and preparing than a unit without a current operational commitment. It is important to note that, although there is no maximum limit, specific restrictions may be imposed upon units by the chain of command in order to avoid overspend and ensure that funding and training is focussed where most needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="70302w0011.htm_para9"><a name="07030263001595">There is no set maximum amount of training days allowed in relation to the operations cycle. The tempo of current operations and the requirement for the Territorial Army to deliver military capability determine the levels of funded training&#151;some Territorial Army personnel and units warrant and receive more than others because of an individual&#146;s particular role, capability or career progression or a unit&#146;s scale of commitment to current operations. There is funding for all Territorial Army personnel to achieve the minimum training requirement and so win their bounty and, if the circumstances warrant, individuals and units may attract additional funded training for role-specific or operation-specific reasons. All funded training opportunities and those personnel conducting them are carefully scrutinised to ensure propriety, efficacy and the timely delivery of operational capability.</p>

 Local authorities, under the Education Act 1996, have a duty, where necessary, to assess children&#146;s special educational needs (SEN) and draw up SEN statements. When doing so they have to have regard to the statutory guidance set out in the SEN Code of Practice. The Code provides criteria for deciding to draw up a statement and advises local authorities to set up moderating groups to support transparency and consistency in deciding whether to draw up statements.

 The final Food Standards Agency-led report into the possible transmission of the H5N1 avian influenza virus from imported Hungarian turkey meat to the UK was published on February 16. It concluded that there is no evidence that any meat has entered the UK food chain from the restricted zones in Hungary and that all food importing and processing activities undertaken were in line with European Commission law.
