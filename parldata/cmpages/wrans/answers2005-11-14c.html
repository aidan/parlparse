 Based on data from the World Trade Organisation for 2004, the value of total world trade in both goods and services was $11 trillion.

This encouragement includes the use of the Government&#039;s discretion under Article 11 of the waste framework directive to provide exemptions from waste management licensing.

The prime contractor will also conduct Inclining Experiments on HM Ships Norfolk (July 2006) and Grafton (December 2006) and stability calculations to confirm that all three ships continue to meet the Type 23 Stability Standard. HMS Marlborough being of the same stability batch as HMS Norfolk will not require to undergo an Inclining Experiment.

This proportion increased to 27.5 per cent. in 2005/06, and will rise again in 2006/07 to 32.5 per cent. and to 37.5 per cent. in 2007/08.

Since 1997 our work has included conferences and events to disseminate good practice, alongside the development of guidance and resources for schools. The anti-bullying Charter for Action has fostered a wide consensus among schools, the voluntary sector, and professional associations. We have supported an award scheme to share and celebrate the excellent work of schools and children and young people in this area. We have given funding to the voluntary sector to embed effective practice and offer training and support to schools, children and young people and their parents. We have run a number of public information campaigns encouraging children to &#039;tell someone&#039; and to support their friends. Anti-bullying work is embedded in the Primary and Secondary National Strategies Behaviour and Attendance strand, including through the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) materials.

In 2001 the Government published the Skills for Life Strategy to tackle basic skills needs across England. Basic skills are a long term priority for this Government and basic literacy and numeracy learning is free to learners with skills below Level 2. Since 2001, we have put in place national standards and core curricula. We are continuing to focus on driving up quality of provision and are professionalising the workforce and extending the reach of the strategy. Since the strategy was launched in 2001, we have helped 1,130,000 adults achieve first qualifications in literacy, language or numeracy. In total, 3.7 million adults have taken up 7.8 million learning opportunities. Tackling basic skills underpins our Skills Strategy, 14&#150;19 reforms, primary and secondary strategies, and our agenda set out in Every Child Matters.

We have also commenced section 120 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002, which clarified the definition of &#039;harm&#039; in the Children Act 1989, which now makes explicit that it includes any impairment suffered as a result of seeing or hearing the ill treatment of another. In addition, section 1 of the Children Act 1989, which applies whenever the court is considering an application for a contact order, requires the court to have the welfare of the child as its paramount consideration. This is reinforced by the welfare checklist at section 1(3) of that Act, which requires the court to have regard to any harm the child has suffered, or is at risk of suffering.

 The National Employer Training programme (NETP) will be funded through the Learning and Skills Council and will be rolled out across the country from 2006&#150;07. The programme will be a powerful, demand-led mechanism for changing the way in which training for adults is delivered. Employers will have greater choice of high quality provision, and colleges and providers will need to deliver high quality training programmes at a time, place and pace determined by the employer. A sum of &#163;230 million has been made available for the programme for 2006&#150;07 and &#163;399 million for 2007&#150;08.
</p>


<p>

 The Geography Development Fund was established in 2004, to improve the teaching, learning and status of geography in schools. We judge the allocation to be sufficient to lay the foundations for subject development. The Fund is targeting strategic priorities identified by the subject community. In 2004/05 a significant part of the Fund was devoted to supporting primary teachers. The &#039;Geography from Square One&#039; project provides accessible teaching ideas, particularly for non-specialists and the pilot &#039;Primary Geography Quality Mark&#039; helps schools deliver quality geography and be recognised for doing so. These developments have been well received by teachers and will be built on through further work supported by the Geography Development Fund in 2005/06.

 The Department allocates funds for education and training in the post-16 learning and skills sector to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) to meet agreed national priorities and targets. We do not agree specific regional budgets with the LSC for adult learning. It is for the LSC to determine for itself the most appropriate balance of investment in adult learning provision, within the funds allocated to it and within the overall framework set by Government. The LSC works closely with Regional Skills Partnerships, whose role is to bring together key partners including the regional development agencies, the Skills for Business Network, Jobcentre Plus, local authorities, and the LSC, to ensure that emerging skills needs are identified and addressed.

<p><a name="st_212"><a name="51114w23.html_spnew4"><b> Bill Rammell: </b> 
 We are broadly maintaining the overall public funding that the LSC will be able to allocate to support adult learning on average through to 2007&#150;08. But the pattern of that learning will change. To meet our national priorities, we need to shift the pattern so that we provide a greater number of longer and more expensive courses for adults, to equip them with the range of skills they need for employability and further progression to higher levels of training.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51114w23.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_199">As a consequence, the number of publicly funded places on shorter courses which do not lead to national qualifications is likely to fall by around 500,000. But set against this, there will be some 400,000 places available through the National Employer Training Programme and over 260,000 places for adults taking full Level 2 programmes in mainstream further education&#151;which is a total increase of 274,000 full Level 2 places compared with 2005&#150;06. So while maintaining the overall volume of adult training, we estimate there will be a net reduction in publicly-funded places of around 230,000 (about 6 per cent.). That will result in a total of some 3.5 million places available for adults by 2007&#150;08. We expect that this reduction can be offset by colleges and other providers offering a wider range of programmes at full cost. In addition, public funding will support an expected additional 46,000 16 to 19-year-olds in learning in FE colleges and schools by 2007/08 compared with 2005/06, and maintain the numbers on apprenticeships while increasing the numbers successfully completing the full apprenticeship framework.

Local authorities estimated that, compared with the same stage in the process last year, on 1 March 2005 (the national offer date for secondary schools) the number of children in London without an offer of a school place had reduced by 40 per cent.

 There are a range of factors, in both the home and school, which are shown to influence a positive learning environment. Many of these factors are shown to particularly focus on supporting low achieving children, who disproportionately tend to be from lower socio-economic backgrounds.

<p>
<a name="51114w25.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_215">Research shows that the quality of the home environment in the pre-school years has the strongest impact on child development at start of school and beyond, and is therefore the most important influence on child development in the pre-school period. The Department&#039;s effective provision of pre-school education (EPPE) study has shown that, for all children, the type and range of learning activities that parents undertake with their pre-school children (for example, reading, singing nursery rhymes and playing with numbers) are more important for intellectual and social development than parental occupation, education or income.

 The Department has made no formal assessment of the impact of low level classroom disruption on under-achievement However, research evidence indicates that there is a complex relationship between behaviour, attainment and social class. Research shows that being in a school where there are high levels of disruption can impact negatively on pupils&#039; learning and there is some evidence that it may have more of an impact on pupils from low socio-economic groups. In addition the Department&#039;s data shows that schools with higher levels of permanent exclusions tend to have lower levels of attainment as do young people who have been excluded.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51114w25.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_218">Evidence also suggests that there is a link between social class and behaviour both at an individual and a school level.

 We know that the way schools currently involve parents is varied. For example, we know that in primary schools there is a much more inclusive approach to parents, resulting in parents of primary school children feeling more confident about engaging with their child&#039;s school. However, we know this is not always the case with secondary schools, where establishing such a relationship is more difficult. Further, we know that some parents, due to the complexities of their own lives or their own educational history, are more reluctant to engage with their children&#039;s school.

Members should ensure that they have this consent prior to undertaking investigations on behalf of their constituents.

 Diagnostic testing for HIV, and any associated counselling is free to all.

This has always been the case since the NHS (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations were introduced in 1989.

<p><a name="st_329"><a name="51114w34.html_spnew6"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 Given that there is no physical security to prevent prisoners leaving Springhill, prisoners abscond rather than escape from the open estate. In the last three years the trend for absconds from Springhill has reduced significantly. During 2003&#150;04, 64 prisoners absconded, during 2004&#150;05 42 prisoners absconded and so far this year 28 prisoners have absconded.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51114w34.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_274">During the last two years, management at Springhill has taken a number of measures to seek to reduce absconds. For instance, all prisoners are seen on induction by a governor who warns them about the implications of absconding. In addition, a protocol has been introduced with Thames Valley Police to prosecute through the courts all prisoners who abscond. Moreover, significant improvements have been made to the regime with the opening of a job club and two vocational learning centres offering industrial based qualifications in computing and bricklaying. Vocational qualifications have been introduced in catering and horticulture.

 There are approximately 5,000 prisoners held in open conditions or resettlement prisons where a significant number of prisoners spend time outside the prison. To establish what representations there have been would therefore involve disproportionate cost. Prisoners are moved to open conditions only after a rigorous risk assessment, which determines whether a prisoner is suitable for open conditions.

Many terrorist offences are outside the scope of the Terrorism Act. Offences such as murder, grievous bodily harm, use of firearms or explosives are covered by general criminal law.

 Further to my answer of 2 November, under clause 47 of the Electoral Administration Bill registered political parties would be permitted to register up to five descriptions with the Electoral Commission.

 Clause 23 of the Electoral Administration Bill states that it would be a matter for the returning officer, having regard to any guidance issued by the Electoral Commission, to decide whether a description proposed by an independent candidate would be permissible. However, it should be noted that clause 23 specifies that the description must not be the same as the name or description of a registered political party, nor be so similar as to confuse with or lead an elector to associate the candidate with a registered political party. The intention therefore is that names such as those suggested would not be permissible.

Consequently we plan to widen the Belfast-bound carriageway of the M2 motorway to create an additional southbound lane between the Sandyknowes and Greencastle junctions.

<p><a name="st_420"><a name="51114w44.html_spnew3"><b> Angela E. Smith: </b> 
 Following a review of public procurement, the new procurement policy was announced in the Northern Ireland Assembly in May 2002. The overall aim of the policy is to achieve best value for money&quot; in the procurement of goods, works and services over the lifetime of a contract. Best value for money does not mean the lowest initial cost. It means securing a procurement that meets the user&#039;s needs and achieves a balance between quality and cost throughout the life of the asset. Within this definition the policy allows for the consideration of wider policy objectives into procurement, that meet the tests of need, affordability and cost-effectiveness and comply with the UK&#039;s EC and international obligations.
