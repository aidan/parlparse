<P>
<a name="71029w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what has been the overall cost of compensation for abortive tenders as a result of the Government's announcements of deferrals under the accelerated consideration of major road schemes announced in July. [12263]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71029w01.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Relevant claims for compensation will be considered on their merits. Once agreement has been reached on any sums payable in compensation these will be made public.

<a name="71029w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Dunwoody: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions for what reasons an advance warning note on the engineering work conducted on the west coast main line on the weekend of 18 to 19 October was not issued by Virgin Trains or Railtrack. [12878]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71029w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 This is an operational matter for Railtrack and Virgin Trains.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71029w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Norman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Enviornment, Transport and the Regions what criteria will apply to the Weald and Downland design, build, finance and operate project under the general roads review; what is the timing of the roads review; and what is the earliest date by which tenders for the project could be revitalised. [12781]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71029w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Following the announcement in July of the decisions made under the accelerated review, the Weald and Downland design, build, finance and operate project is no longer being taken forward as a single project. The individual schemes which were included in the project are being considered as part of the main Roads Review and will be assessed along with all other schemes against the five criteria of accessibility, safety, economy, the enviornment and integration. We hope to announce the results of the review next year. Any revitalisation of tenders for the project would be dependent on the results of the Roads Review.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71029w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Norman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what compensation has been paid to companies involved with the Downland design, build, finance and operate scheme for the cancellation of the project. [12782]

<P>
<P>
<a name="71029w01.html_wqn4"><B> Ms Walley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will require local authorities issuing enforcement notices to <i>(a)</i> hotels and <i>(b)</i> other establishments in respect of environmental health regulations to register such findings in the public register; and if he will make a statement. [12807]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71029w01.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Environment and Safety Information Act 1988 requires all authorities, including local authorities, responsible for the issue of enforcement notices under the Fire Precautions Act 1971, the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 and the Food and Environmental Protection Act 1985 to place details of the substance of such notices on a public register if the notices have public safety or environmental implications. This requirement applies to all types of premises. Each responsible authority maintains its own registers, which may be inspected free of charge.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he intends to introduce legislation to obtain powers to suspend or write off part of the Humber bridge debt. [12854]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71029w01.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 In the new year I hope to lay before Parliament, with the approval of HM Treasury, an Order under the Humber Bridge (Debts) Act 1996. This will provide that the Humber Bridge Board will not have to meet a proportion of its current debt or, on the residual debt, a proportion of the interest that would otherwise be due. Officials of my Department are currently considering options and financial projections with officers of the Board.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71029w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Dalyell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what were the results of the Sonus studies. [12857]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71029w01.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Sonus research programme is leading to a better understanding of the flux of nutrients, particularly nitrogen, from the land, though estuaries, to the sea, especially in relation to the nitrification/ denitrification processes in estuaries. The main work in the Southampton Water/Solent region indicates that algal blooms of phytoplankton occur only when tidal energy is below a certain level and light levels are sufficiently high. We hope to extend this work to allow data from the whole of 1997 to be incorporated. A final report will be produced at the end of the contract.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71029w01.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 Local authorities need to be able to respond as flexibly as possible to the needs of Montserratians arriving here under the Government's Montserrat assisted passage scheme, which provides for voluntary evacuation.
<P>

<a name="71029w01.html_para0">We recognise that authorities will incur additional costs when making accommodation available to people who would not normally have applied to them for housing. Montserrat is a British Dependent Territory and the evacuees have lost their homes. We must do our best to ensure that evacuees coming here under the MAP Scheme are given as smooth a reception as possible, although it may not always be possible to accommodate them in the area they would prefer.
<P>

<a name="71029w01.html_para1">We are proposing to offer a special grant to encourage authorities to make vacant property more quickly available to house evacuees who have come to this country under the MAP Scheme and who have nowhere to stay. This should help settle evacuees throughout the country under arrangements set up by the Home Office. Evacuees with a Montserratian passport are already broadly eligible for the same welfare benefits, state education, healthcare and access to social housing as UK nationals.
<P>

<a name="71029w01.html_para2">The special grant would be provided under the Local Government Finance Act 1988, and we intend to submit a report for the House's approval early next year. The Department has written today to Chief Executives and Chief Housing Officers of English local housing authorities, setting out details of the scheme and arrangements for making claims. Copies of the letter have been placed in the Library. Subject to approval of the House, &#163;1,500 will be made available for each unit of accommodation provided for qualifying households placed with local authorities by the Home Office between 27 August 1997 and 31 January 1998. The grant scheme has been drawn up after consultation with the Local Government Association.
<P>

<a name="71029w01.html_para3">Grant will be offered on a similar basis by the Housing Corporation to registered social landlords who independently offer to provide accommodation for evacuees under the Home Office's arrangements.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71029w01.html_spnew8"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Copies of the National Forest Company's annual report and accounts for 1996-97 are to be placed in the House Libraries.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71029w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 The Minister of State at the Department of Trade and Industry and I represented the UK at the Social Affairs Council on 7 October.
<P>

<a name="71029w01.html_para4">A structured dialogue with Social Affairs and Employment Ministers from the applicant states in central and eastern Europe discussed the accession strategy in relation to health and safety for workers, equal opportunities for men and women, and social dialogue.
<P>

<a name="71029w01.html_para5">The presidency gave further details about the preparatory work for the Extraordinary European Council on Employment (taking place in Luxembourg on 20-21 November), and announced that there would be a supplementary meeting of the Social Affairs Council on 6 November to contribute to preparations.
<P>

<a name="71029w01.html_para6">Informal political agreement was reached on the proposed amendment to the regulation establishing the European Training Foundation.

<P>

<a name="71029w01.html_para7">Political agreement was reached on the proposal for a recommendation to introduce a Community model parking badge for people with disabilities, which will be recognised across member states.
<P>

<P>

<a name="71029w01.html_para9">The Council noted the work programme of the Employment and Labour Market Committee.
<P>

<a name="71029w01.html_para10">The Commission gave two presentations: first, on the draft directive to give effect to the social partners' framework agreement on ensuring that part-time workers should be treated no less favourably than full-time workers, and secondly on a White Paper on the sectors excluded from the working time directive--transport, sea fishing, offshore sectors, and doctors in training.
<P>

<a name="71029w01.html_para11">The presidency withdrew from the agenda an item on the programme for research, analysis and co-operation in employment.

 MAFF has developed procurement procedures based upon guidance issued by the Central Unit on Purchasing in HM Treasury. These procedures are designed to ensure probity and fairness in all procurement decisions and provide the necessary checks and authorisations in accordance with Government Accounting and separate the functions of verification and authorisation from the process of payment.
<P>

<a name="71029w02.html_para0">MAFF has implemented a fully integrated computerised accounting system (RAMIS--Resource Accounting and Management Information System) running on proprietary software and hardware. Implementation of the system has been supported fully by the primary software and hardware suppliers supplemented with specialised external service providers as necessary. These have been provided for under contract. Generally the Ministry does not use subcontractors for payment work; the exception is the use of managing agents to pay small contractors for minor building maintenance work to ensure that they are paid quickly. Payments for goods and services are made using RAMIS either by bank transfer (CHAPS and BACS) or as system-generated payable orders. Significant work has been undertaken by Ministry staff to ensure that the system has been developed to meet initial and changing requirements.

 The Government and the New Millennium Experience Company aim to ensure that all who wish to visit the Millennium Experience can do so, regardless of any disability an individual may have. An Advisory Group has been established by the NMEC to consider accessibility and special needs issues, reflecting the NMEC's concern to meet all relevant statutory requirements and to apply, wherever possible, voluntary codes, guidance and specifications.
<P>

<a name="71029w03.html_para0">The Advisory Group held its first meeting on 24 June. It is chaired by David Phillips, Chief Executive of Holiday Care Service, and its members are drawn from a range of voluntary sector organisations covering physical, sensory and learning disabilities, mental health issues, and the needs of older people. The group will provide best practice guidance to the NMEC on a wide range of accessibility issues including transportation, parking, the natural and the built environment, displays and facilities, on-site information and promotional materials, ticketing arrangements, and disability awareness training.

 The Treaty of Amsterdam contains a Protocol which recognises the right of the United Kingdom to exercise, at its frontiers with other member states, such controls on persons seeking to enter the United Kingdom as it may consider necessary for the purpose of:


<BR>
verifying the right to enter the United Kingdom of European Union and other nationals of the European Economic Area and their dependants; and
<BR>
determining whether or not to grant other persons permission to enter the United Kingdom.

<P>

<a name="71029w03.html_para1">The Protocol states that nothing in the Treaties, or in any measures deriving from the Treaties, prejudices the United Kingdom's right to exercise such controls.
<P>

<a name="71029w03.html_para2">No powers will arise as a direct result of the Protocol. The United Kingdom will, however, continue to maintain the controls provided for under the Immigration (European Economic Area) Order 1994 and the Immigration Act 1971. Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971 provides powers for immigration officers to examine and identify documents of passengers arriving in the United Kingdom, to search their person and belongings and to detain them pending a decision to give or to refuse leave to enter.

 No. The Government have published the requirements on Ministers in the ministerial code; DTI Ministers are acting in accordance with these requirements. It has never been the practice of previous Ministers, including DTI Ministers, to publish details of their shareholdings, except insofar as this is required by the Register of Members' Interests; they have from time to time made public statements about their decision to stand aside from particular issues where that has been thought desirable in particular circumstances. This approach, reflecting that of previous Administrations to this issue, seems to the Government to satisfy the public interest.

<P>
<a name="71029w04.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Blood donations have been screened for antibodies to hepatitis C virus since September 1991 when reliable tests first became available. Recipients of blood or blood components donated before that date from donors since found to be carriers of hepatitis C virus are being traced in order to provide counselling, testing and 



<P>
<P><I>29 Oct 1997 : Column: 827</I><P>
specialist referral as appropriate. Organs and tissue, resulting from either live or cadaveric donations, are also screened for hepatitis C.
<P>

<a name="71029w04.html_para0">Injecting drug misusers who share contaminated equipment are at increased risk of acquiring hepatitis C infection. The guidance to purchasers of drug treatment and care services, which the Department issued in March 1997, included advice for purchasers on dealing with those who seek testing for hepatitis C. The "Guidelines for Doctors on the Clinical Management of Drug Misusers" last issued in 1991 are currently being revised and will be published next year. They will include updated advice on the management of hepatitis C in drug misusers.
<P>

<a name="71029w04.html_para1">There is a need to increase knowledge about the natural history, prevalence, transmission and treatment of hepatitis C so that the National Health Service is equipped to deliver services based on the best scientific advice available about the disease. In 1996, the Department made &#163;1 million available for research in these areas. The results of the research commissioned so far will become available over the next three years. A further &#163;500,000 will be allocated this year to expand the research programme.
<P>

<a name="71029w04.html_para2">In addition, the NHS Health Technology Assessment is considering research proposals to establish the effectiveness of the early treatment of chronic hepatitis C with alpha interferon.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71029w04.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Attempts to estimate the long term consequences of hepatitis C to the individual and the Exchequer are confounded by the unpredictability of the progression of the disease. Some individuals will clear the virus naturally, developing no long term symptoms, and others will go on to develop liver disease but often not for 20 to 30 years after initial infection with the virus. A proportion of those with liver disease will go on to develop liver failure or liver cancer.
<P>

<a name="71029w04.html_para3">Current knowledge about the natural history is insufficient to make firm estimates of the type requested. There is a comprehensive programme of research in place examining the natural history, transmission and prevalence of hepatitis C. Consideration is also being given through the Health Technology Assessment Programme to funding a clinical trail to examine the clinical and the cost effectiveness of treating hepatitis C with drug therapy at an earlier stage than is current clinical practice. These studies should enable some comparison to be made about the relative clinical effectiveness of treatment at different stages of the disease and will facilitate the evaluation of the economic and social costs of hepatitis C.

 Northern Ireland Ministers and their Departments are examining the inherited spending plans for Northern Ireland to ensure that they align with the Government's objectives and to see how better use can be made of resources.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71029w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The security forces maintain information about terrorist weaponry but it would not be appropriate for me to make this public. Terrorists retain sufficient arms and explosives to mount a sustained campaign of violence and bombing. There is no justification for this. The Government, together with the Government of the Republic of Ireland, have put in place the mechanisms for decommissioning and, though it is necessarily a voluntary process, those in possession of paramilitary weapons need to avail themselves of this unique opportunity to build confidence and contribute to lasting peace.

<P>

<P>

 The latest available information relates to September 1997 and at that time there were 29,509 claimant long-term unemployed in Northern Ireland. This represents a reduction of 15,821 compared with a year earlier and reflects a generally downward trend in claimant long-term unemployment since spring 1993.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71029w05.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Northern Ireland's energy market is characterised by lack of competition, diseconomies of scale and isolation from other markets. Considerable progress is being made, within the region's energy strategy, to redress these problems.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71029w05.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Worthington: </B> 
 Education standards in Northern Ireland are generally good and are reflected in the level of participation in higher education, the standards achieved in GCE A level and GCSE and the levels achieved by 8,11 and 14-year-olds in the first year of statutory assessment in schools. These standards must, however, be improved if Northern Ireland is to compete successfully with the rest of Europe and plans are already being put in place to accelerate the rate of improvement. Particular priority will be given to measures to address underachievement which is a matter for concern in many schools.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71029w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 The way in which people with learning difficulties are cared for, including where they live, is best determined by what best meets their needs. Local authorities, in consultation with their planning partners, will continue to have responsibility for ensuring that an appropriate range and volume of community care services are in place to respond to individuals' assessed needs and local circumstances. This includes residential accommodation for people with learning disabilities.
<P>

<a name="71029w06.html_para0">The Department of Health has commissioned research into the costs and outcomes of various types of residential accommodation for people with learning disabilities in England and Ireland. The research is expected to be completed around the end of 1998. We will give careful consideration to the findings.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will publish the oath taken by constables in Scotland and give the reasons why it differs from the oath taken in <i>(a)</i> England and Wales and <i>(b) </i>Northern Ireland. [12308]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71029w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 A person appointed to the office of constable of a police force in Scotland is required to make the following declaration, prescribed in regulation 10 of the Police (Scotland) Regulations 1976, before a sheriff or justice of the peace:


<BR>
"I hereby do solemnly and sincerely and truly declare and affirm that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the office of constable."




<P>
<P><I>29 Oct 1997 : Column: 834</I><P>


<P>

<a name="71029w06.html_para1">It differs from the oath in England and Wales, or the declaration in Northern Ireland, because ir derives from separate Scottish legislation. The declaration, largely in its current form, was first given statutory force by the Police (Scotland) Act 1857.
