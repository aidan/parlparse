<P>
<a name="10111w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on the future of vehicle licensing.  [143925]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10111w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The system of registration of all motor vehicles will continue. A system of Automated First Registration and Licensing of vehicles by manufacturers has been developed and now covers over 60 per cent. of new registrations. A similar system is being developed for use by independent importers.
<P>

<a name="10111w01.html_para0">The system of registration and periodic relicensing performs a number of important functions including the vital role it plays in the fight against crime through the maintenance of the vehicle register. It also helps to ensure that vehicles meet statutory roadworthiness and insurance requirements.
<P>

<a name="10111w01.html_para1">In recent years the regime for Vehicle Excise Duty has undergone substantial changes, principally aimed at encouraging more environmentally friendly use of vehicles--for example, the introduction of a new system of graduated VED for new cards based on CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions. The Government also introduced in June 1999 a new lower rate of VED for smaller-engined cars up to 1100cc. In March 2001 this limit will be raised to 1200cc and the Government have signalled their intention of raising that limit to 1500cc from July 2001.
<P>

<a name="10111w01.html_para2">For goods vehicles, the Government have taken into account the role played by road transport in maintaining a competitive economy. Thus, following the pre-Budget Report last November, VED for goods vehicles has been cut by up to 50 per cent. The Government have issued a consultation paper on the future of VED for goods vehicles seeking views on a number of proposals including fewer VED rate bands, greater flexibility of vehicle configuration within each rate band, better environmental signals and reduced tax on vehicle ownership. The consultation closes on 12 January.

<P>
<a name="10111w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Evans: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what representations he has received concerning secrecy in local government executive structures.  [144059]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10111w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 We have received representations on a number of issues relating to new council constitutions, including access to executive decision-making. We have taken account of these representations in making the Local Authorities (Executive Arrangements) (Access to Information) (England) Regulations 2000 which were laid before the House on 19 December. These Regulations, 



<P>
<P><I>11 Jan 2001 : Column: 588W</I><P>
together with the powerful overview and scrutiny committees introduced by the Local Government Act 2000, will put in place a robust regime of more accountable decision-making. These arrangements will give people the right to proper access to papers and meetings of the Executive and overview and scrutiny committees will ensure that the Executive are held properly to account both for what they have done and, equally, for what they are proposing to do.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10111w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Peter Ainsworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what discussions he has had with British Gas regarding the value of the proposal to sell the Millennium Dome to Legacy plc.  [144710]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10111w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 We have had no discussions with British Gas concerning the value of the potential sale of the Millennium Dome to Legacy plc. Any such matters will be discussed formally between English Partnerships and British Gas, from whom English Partnerships acquired the land.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10111w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Peter Ainsworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions over what period the Government will receive payments from the sale of the Millennium Dome.  [144714]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10111w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 The details of the financial implications of any sale to Legacy plc must remain commercially confidential at this stage, while negotiations continue.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10111w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Redwood: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) when he expects the planning decisions to be made concerning the Millennium Dome site;  [144762]
<P>
<UL>(2) if the bid of the preferred bidder for the Dome is contingent upon planning permission.  [144764]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10111w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 Completion of the sale of the Dome and the associated land will be conditional upon appropriate planning permissions having been obtained. The timing of any such permissions will be a matter initially for the London borough of Greenwich, and will depend on how any planning applications progress through the planning system. Two initial applications relating to the Legacy plc proposals for the Dome site are currently being considered by the London borough of Greenwich. Another application, for the use of associated land around the Dome, is due to be submitted within the next several months.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10111w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Redwood: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many expressions of interest have been received from companies, consortia and individuals wishing to bid for the Dome site.  [144765]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10111w01.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 I refer the right hon. Member to the reply I gave the hon. Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth) on 24 November 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 330W.
<P>

<a name="10111w01.html_para3">Over 70 expressions of interest were received in response to the competition that was launched in March 1999. All of these were encouraged to elaborate and substantiate their interest, and were subsequently evaluated prior to short lists being drawn up.




<P>
<P><I>11 Jan 2001 : Column: 589W</I><P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="10111w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Redwood: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what checks were carried out concerning other potential bidders before confirming the Legacy Consortium as the preferred bidder for the Dome.  [144769]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10111w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 Legacy plc was confirmed as the preferred bidder at the end of an extensive competition process lasting 18 months, during which more than 70 expressions of interest in acquiring the Dome site were evaluated and shortlisted in a four stage process. The final shortlist of two from this process comprised Dome Europe and Legacy plc. Dome Europe was appointed as preferred bidder, but subsequently withdrew, and discussions were then initiated with Legacy plc.
<P>

<a name="10111w01.html_para4">The competition process was open to new bidders for a period of over nine months after its launch in March 1999. While other unsolicited expressions of interest have been received since the competition was closed to new entries, these have not been subjected to the same level of development and testing; nor would it have been fair to continue accepting new entries when existing bidders had already committed substantial resources to proving the appropriateness and deliverability of their bids.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10111w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Redwood: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many acres of land will be sold as part of the disposal of the Millennium Dome.  [144767]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10111w01.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 The Legacy plc bid currently envisages acquisition of 63 acres of land, as well as the Dome itself and some additional structures.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10111w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Redwood: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what the Government's estimate is of the value of the Dome site with the Dome <i>(a)</i> removed and <i>(b)</i> remaining.  [144763]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10111w01.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 A pre-sale valuation of the Dome site has been undertaken in the context of the competition to identify a sustainable long-term use for the Dome. The Government estimate of the financial value of the site is commercially confidential while the process to secure a buyer continues.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10111w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Redwood: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what information was made available to each bidder for the Dome site concerning the willingness of the vendor to accept staggered payments.  [144768]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10111w01.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 The financial offers of each competing bidder have been considered and assessed on their individual merits, including in relation to proposed payment structure. In comparing bids, any deferred payments have been discounted for time and risk.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10111w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Peter Ainsworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) if he will name the parties with a financial stake in Legacy plc;  [144713]
<P>
<UL>(2) what percentage of Legacy plc's equity is owned by <i>(a)</i> Mr. Robert Bourne, <i>(b)</i> Treasury Holdings and <i>(c)</i> other parties.  [144712]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10111w01.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 Details must remain commercially confidential while negotiations continue, but I can confirm that the total issued share capital of Legacy plc is owned by Robert Bourne and family interests.

<a name="10111w01.html_para5">Should Legacy plc be granted a lease on the Dome there is an agreement that on the grant of the lease the shareholders in Legacy plc will be:

<P>
<a name="10111w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 A Response Group has been set up to co-ordinate the action taken to support those affected by the BCC closure. Action taken so far includes the opening of an on-site Job Shop to provide advice on job vacancies, training and benefits. Two job and training fairs have been held and Rapid Response Funding secured to help provide skills assessment and retraining for those affected. In addition St. Gobain have made 122 new or replacement jobs available to the BCC work force from elsewhere in their operation. Over the longer term the Government Office for the East Midlands, working with East Midlands Development Agency and other regional and local partners, will seek to deliver a range of training, reclamation and other economic initiatives aimed at supporting the regeneration of Clay Cross.

<a name="10111w02.html_para0">Furthermore, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister announced last week that Derbyshire county council has been invited to work up its proposals for a new junction on the M1 motorway between junctions 29 and 30 to serve the Markham Employment Growth Zone. This is part of a major regeneration scheme to provide more than 8,000 jobs in the North Derbyshire area. The Council's detailed proposals will be submitted to the DETR next summer so that a decision can be taken by the end of the year.

 I am pleased to announce that Stage One of the review of the British Tourist Authority (BTA) is being published today and copies are available in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="10111w03.html_para0">The Steering Group for the review concluded that there was a continuing need for the services and functions carried out by the BTA and, having looked carefully at all the options, concluded that BTA should remain a non-departmental public body.
<P>

<a name="10111w03.html_para1">The report recommends that the review team should look at some issues in greater depth as part of Stage Two of the review. These include the return on investment as a measurement of BTA's performance; and rate of return issues such as data for individual offices overseas, benchmarking and the quality of measurement techniques.
<P>

<a name="10111w03.html_para2">The report also recommends that BTA should draw up a specific strategy to declare what services it will provide to small and medium businesses and how it will consult them. BTA should review its strategy on the balance between short and long term market investment; should seek further opportunities for partnership working; and should develop an agenda for action to ensure that the aims of Modernising Government are met.
<P>

<a name="10111w03.html_para3">Overall, the report finds the BTA is regarded both by Government and the tourism industry as an effective organisation, which has become more responsive over recent years.

 It should not be a matter of chance whether a child will get good sporting opportunities. There are basic opportunities that should be available to all children. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment has been working closely with me to develop a range of measures that will bring real improvement. Over the next few years, our aim is to offer children an entitlement to two hours each week spent during and after school on high quality PE and sporting activity. We will consult schools, professional associations and other interested parties to identify how best to make this happen.
<P>

<a name="10111w03.html_para4">To build the capacity to make this entitlement possible, we are also extending the outside help available to schools. We will shortly begin two pilot studies to extend the New Deal into sport and create a new role of sports assistant to work alongside the new sports co-ordinators to help deliver this opportunity in schools. By 2004 there could be as many as 2,000 opportunities--many of which will be offered to suitable people on the New Deal.

In accordance with the terms of reference for this Group, data from all countries which catch bass in Area VII and in the Bay of Biscay and the North Sea, will be compiled in order to construct the age profile of bass stocks in these areas and, if possible, to carry out an assessment of their status in relation to safe biological limits. The first task will be to compile an inventory of the available data, which will be reviewed by the ICES Advisory Committee for Fisheries Management in May 2001. In the light of this information, the European Commission can be expected to consider whether conservation measures are appropriate at Community level.

<P>
<a name="10111w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 December 2000]:</i> Regional offices of the National Health Service Executive decide whether a trust keeps the proceeds from the sale of an asset. This decision is taken after careful consideration of the competing demands for capital investment within the region. The objective is to use sale proceeds from any sale of trust assets to achieve the maximum benefit for the NHS.
<P>

<a name="10111w03.html_para7">In the south west region capital receipts of less than &#163;1 million are usually retained automatically by the trust.

 The National Institute of Clinical Excellence does not itself monitor the use of and adverse reactions to particular medicines. Monitoring the use of medicines is a matter for local clinical governance arrangements. The monitoring of adverse reactions is carried out by the Committee on Safety of Medicines/ Medicines Control Agency (CSM/MCA). Health professionals are encouraged to submit voluntarily to the CSM/MCA reports of suspected adverse drug reactions via the yellow card scheme. These reports, together with data from other sources, are continuously reviewed to identify previously unrecognised hazards or new information on known hazards which might require regulatory action.

 The United Kingdom is not party to the United Nation-sponsored talks on Cyprus. However, we follow developments closely and Sir David Hannay, UK Special Representative for Cyprus, is likely to meet the parties during the next meeting. The UK urges all involved to co-operate with the UNSG's efforts to reach a just and lasting settlement.

 My right hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West (Ms Quin), the then Minister for Europe, visited Cyprus in April 1999. The visit included meetings with President Clerides, Foreign Minister Kasoulides, Mr. Denktash, and several Greek and Turkish Cypriot party leaders.

<a name="10111w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The human rights record of the Government of Belarus remains poor in many respects. The political system is oppressive and undemocratic. The judiciary is not independent of the executive. Opposition politicians are harassed and have, in some cases, been subject to politically motivated legal proceedings and harsh sentencing. There is bias in the state mass media. Independent trade unions have suffered unacceptable pressure from the authorities, including having their bank accounts frozen. The Belarusian authorities have failed to investigate satisfactorily the disappearances of several opposition sympathisers. The parliamentary elections on 15 October failed to meet international standards for democratic elections.

 The Syrian authorities, in their reply to the letter of request sent by the Scottish Court in the Netherlands, stressed that, in their opinion, they should not have been asked the question in the first place and would therefore prefer not to have to send a formal reply.

In view of this, it was decided that single Service events, including a Fleet Review for the Royal Navy, would not be appropriate. Contrary to reports in the press, the decision had nothing to do with budgetary constraints.

 The Government have been in discussion with Mr. Constantine, the Oversight Commissioner, regarding the resources he requires.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking what percentage of benefit payments were found to be accurate in each benefits area directorate for (i) 1979-80, (ii) 1996-97 and (iii) the most recent period for which figures are available.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The accuracy of benefit payments in all Area Directorates is measured by the Benefits Agency Quality Support teams which were established in 1994. Unfortunately, no data is available for 1979/80 as accuracy figures were not collated at that time. Figures for the main benefits checked by the Quality Support teams in 1996/97 and 1999/2000 (the most recent period available) are set out in the tables.</FONT></UL>

1. Short Term Benefits (STB) incorporates results for Incapacity Benefit, Severe Disablement allowance and Maternity Allowance. STB results in 1996-97 were based on a re-performance of local checks. Where there are no entries in the columns this designates that a check by the Quality support teams was not undertaken in that Area Directorate in that year.<P>

2. Long Term Benefits (LTB) consists of Retirement Pension and Widows Benefit.<P>

3. Jobseekers Allowance was introduced in October 1996 and Quality Support checks were undertaken to provide a national result.<P>

1. Numbers are given at a point in time. For 1979 the month is November, 1980 to 1984 the month is December, 1986 the month is February, and from 1987 to 1999 the month is May. Two sets of information is given for 2000: May (in line with data from 1987, and August which is the latest available data).<P>

2. Caseload figures are rounded to the nearest hundred and are expressed in thousands. Percentages are given to one decimal place.<P>

3. Numbers are not available for 1985 due to industrial action.<P>

4. Income Support replaced Supplementary Benefit in April 1988.<P>

5. Children of unemployed Supplementary Benefit/Income Support claimants are included in the figures up to 1996. Income Support for the unemployed was replaced by income-based Jobseeker's Allowance from October 1996; children of income-based Jobseeker's Allowance claimants have been added to figures from 1997 onwards.<P>

6. Children are defined as aged 0-15.<P>

7. Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance cases will include some claimants with an underlying entitlement to contribution-based benefit.<P>





8. Numbers are based on sample data and are therefore subject to a degree of sampling error. Samples sizes are as follows:<P>

1979 to 1981: 1 in 200 (Supplementary pension cases), 1 in 50 (Supplementary Allowances)<P>

1982 to 1987: 1 in 200 (Supplementary pension cases), 1 in 100 (E cases), 1 in 50 (Supplementary Allowances)<P>

1988 to 1993: 1 in 100<P>

1994 to date: 1 in 20<P>

<a name="10111w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 The increased resources this Government have made available for education and training has meant that the Learning and Skills Council will receive a 9 per cent. real terms increase in its budget for 2001-2002. People in the north-east stand to benefit fully from their share of these increased resources, including through any allocations made to the four Local Learning and Skills Councils serving the region.

 Overall, there were 6,900 more teachers in post in January 2000 than January 1998 and 5,400 more than January 1997. A survey carried out by my Department in September 2000 suggested that the secondary school figure for that month was about the same as in January that year. This year has seen the first rise in the number of people entering teacher training since 1992.

 Recruitment to secondary initial teacher training in maths declined steadily between 1994-95 and the introduction of Golden Hellos. The figure for 1996-97 was 1,650. So far this year, 1,360 people have started training in maths, including through the Graduate Teacher Programme, which we introduced in January 1998. Between 1994-95 and 1997-98, recruitment to secondary teacher training courses in maths fell by 25 per cent. Since 1998-99 it has risen by 14 per cent.

 Around 70 per cent. of newly qualified teachers in England, in both 1997 and 1998, were in service in the maintained sector in England and Wales the March following qualification. Others were in service in further or higher education institutions or the independent sector. Some newly qualified teachers take a gap period before taking up teaching posts. By five years after qualification, some 80 per cent. of teachers have at some stage worked in the maintained sector.

 The Government are committed to supporting organised sport in schools. Competitive games are a compulsory part of the National Curriculum for Physical Education for children aged 5-14 and are one of the options available for those aged 14-16. Out of school hours, the most popular activity is sport for both primary and secondary children. The Government launched their Sports Strategy "A Sporting Future for All" in April this year. One of its key aims is to increase participation in physical activities in schools, including organised sports. 1,000 School Sports Co-ordinators are currently being appointed. They will be based in communities of greatest need, working in "families" of primary and secondary schools linked wherever possible through LEAs to Specialist Sports Colleges. They will provide opportunities for young people to compete regularly for their school and take part in a wide range of sports outside the curriculum. So far, 143 School Sports Co-ordinators are in place. On 26 September 2000, the Prime Minister also unveiled a further major investment in sport, including &#163;750 million New Opportunities Lottery funding to strengthen the foundation of sport across the UK by building and refurbishing PE and sports facilities in over 1,500 schools and outdoor adventure facilities, which will provide even more opportunities for children to play sport in schools.

 Information on teaching vacancies in North Somerset local education authority prior to 1997 is not available, due to the fact that this particular authority was formed as part of the local government reorganisation of 1 April 1996. The number of full-time mathematics teaching vacancies in maintained secondary schools in North Somerset local authority on the third Thursday in January each year since the authority was created is as follows:

 We have secured early delivery of our infant class size pledge for the vast majority of infants, including in Wansbeck. In the constituency in September 2000, 2.3 per cent. of five, six and seven-year-olds were in classes of 31 or more. The figure in January 1997 was 36.7 per cent.

Figures from this release show that since September 1998, 324,000 five, six and seven-year-olds have benefited from the Government's infant class size initiative. In September 2000, 30,000 children were in classes of 31 or more children, compared to 171,000 in September 1999. This demonstrates that the Government are delivering early their infant class size pledge, which is supported by some &#163;620 million.

 My Department has made no specific grants to local education authorities to provide safer school transport. Funding for school transport is included as part of local education authorities' standard spending assessments, but it is for individual authorities to decide how they spend the money. The total amount spent by local education authorities on home to school transport in England in 1998-99, the latest year for which figures are available, was &#163;444 million. The Government recently announced &#163;2.8 billion of capital investment over the next five years for local authorities in England for small-scale integrated transport schemes, including safe routes to schools. The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) has also supported individual local projects on safe routes to schools. It has funded a pilot programme of site-specific advice on school travel plans, will roll out a larger programme this spring, and will help to fund local school travel plan coordinators.
<P>

<a name="10111w12.html_para10">The Government have also worked with their School Travel Advisory Group on a programme of initiatives to improve safety and reduce car use on the journey to school.

 We recognise that there are differences in practice between areas in the use made of funds for special educational needs (SEN). The funding arrangements allow both LEAs and schools flexibility in deciding their local priorities. We are seeking to promote good practice in this through the DfEE SEN Funding Steering Group, which is working to improve the current arrangements for reporting on SEN budgets and outturn, and to develop tools and strategies for managing an SEN budget in as inclusive a way as possible. It is aiming to produce guidance, drawing on existing LEA models, and to disseminate this by summer 2001.
<P>

<a name="10111w13.html_para0">At the individual pupil level we are also working to promote better and more consistent practice, through other good practice material, for example our July 2000 report on Education Psychology Services. The revised SEN Code of Practice should also promote more consistent practice by schools and LEAs. While individual pupils with SEN will vary in their needs it is important that schools and others adopt a consistent and rigorous approach in identifying and providing for these needs.
<P>

<a name="10111w13.html_para1">Consistency of good practice will also be promoted through amendments to the Education (Special Educational Needs) (Information) Regulations 1999. These amendments will require LEAs to set out their detailed arrangements for what schools might normally provide from their budgets for pupils with SEN. It will also require LEAs to publish their plans for providing appropriate SEN support. Schools will continue to be required to provide information about their own arrangements for identification, assessment and provision within their SEN policy. As with the revised SEN Code of Practice these amended regulations will be subject to parliamentary approval of the Special Educational Needs and Disability Bill.
