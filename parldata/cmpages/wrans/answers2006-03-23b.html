</p>


<p>
<a name="60323w02.html_para2">

<p><a name="st_12"><a name="60323w02.html_spnew1"><b> Tessa Jowell: </b> 
 Virtually every aspect of my Department&#039;s work is focussed on maximising participation in all areas of cultural and sporting activity. Particular efforts are devoted to reaching out to people who are socially excluded or for whatever reason may not feel they can participate. This ambition is underpinned by our PSA targets by which we monitor progress.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60323w02.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_11">These targets drive cultural and sports programmes which play a key role in tackling the risks and causes of social exclusion including unemployment, poor educational attainment, poor physical and mental health and crime. For example, 80 per cent. of the &#163;151 million funding for Creative Partnerships is delivered in Neighbourhood Renewal Areas. Next year, over &#163;10 million will be allocated towards funding 3,000 Community Sports Coaches, many of whom work directly with young people to tackle social exclusion. Through the Respect Action Plan, my Department will provide &#163;1 million over three years to develop and expand the Sports Champion mentoring programme through which world class athletes inspire and motivate disaffected young people. I have also directed national lottery distributors to take account of the scope for reducing economic and social deprivation in designing the arts, sports and heritage grant programmes.

 A full response to this question could be made only at disproportionate cost. Defra and its predecessor Departments have substantial research programmes.

 In line with the Government&#039;s commitment to sustainable development, the Government&#039;s policy on waste minimisation seeks to break the link between economic growth and the amount of waste produced and to drive the management of waste up the waste hierarchy of reduction, re-use, recycling and composting, and energy recovery.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60323w03.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_22">The Government&#039;s main driver for achieving waste minimisation is the waste implementation programme (WIP). The waste and resources action programme (WRAP) leads on delivering this work.

<a name="stpa_23">WRAP&#039;S waste minimisation programme aims to reduce the growth of household waste from 3 percent to 2 percent by the end of the 2005&#150;6 financial year.

</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60323w03.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_24">The retailer initiative will be important for delivering the Courtauld Commitment on minimising packaging and food waste from the thirteen top UK grocery retailers.

Notes:<br>

1. The above includes those old-scheme cases with a full maintenance assessment, and those new-scheme cases with either a full maintenance calculation, or a default maintenance decision. Old-scheme cases with a punitive interim maintenance assessment are excluded from this analysis in line with the Agency&#039;s target definition, as are new-scheme cases being processed clerically.<br>

2. The Child Support Agency&#039;s PSA target was to double the proportion of parents with care on income support or income-based jobseeker&#039;s allowance who receive maintenance for their children to 60 per cent. by March 2006&quot;. This target has been rolled forward under SR2004 and increased to 65 per cent. by March 2008.<br>

3. A parent with care is deemed to be on income support or jobseeker&#039;s allowance (income based) if they or their partner are in receipt of either benefit.<br>

4. Old-scheme data from the old computer system (CSCS) are matched with administrative data from the benefits system to obtain the current benefit status of the parent with care. Those parents with care who are not themselves on benefit, but whose partner is, are excluded from this analysis due to lack of available data. It is not possible to match old and new scheme data from the new IT system (CS2) with administrative data from the benefits system, so this information is recorded as that held on the CSA system.<br>

5. Percentages are rounded to the nearest whole percent.<br>

6. Robust data from the new IT system (CS2) covering the period March 2003&#151;March 2004 is not currently available, and is under development.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. The Agency target for accuracy in 2005&#150;06 is that by 31 March 2006 accuracy on the last decision made for all maintenance calculations (new scheme) and assessments (old scheme) checked in the year to be correct to the nearest penny in at least 90 per cent. of new scheme cases and 82 per cent. of old scheme cases.<br>

2. Measurement of Agency performance against this target is based on checks carried out on a sample of cases that grows cumulatively throughout the year, and is designed to provide an optimal level of precision for the estimate of Agency accuracy at any financial year end.<br>

3. While it is possible to derive year to date performance at any point within the reporting period in order to provide an indicative guide as to current (cumulative) performance, comparisons between individual months (particularly towards the beginning of the reporting period) are subject to sampling variation, meaning that any time series may not be wholly reflective of actual trends in performance. For this reason, figures have been provided for financial years for the period April 2003 to March 2005, and year to date for the current reporting year.<br>

4. Percentages are rounded to the nearest whole percent.<br>

5. The figures included in this table do not themselves have national statistics status, but are included in this publication in order to give a fuller picture of CSA performance.<br>

 In launching the Regional Funding Allocations process last year we were looking to obtain a clear view of what each region saw as the priorities for spending in their region across the interrelated fields of housing, transport and economic development. In doing this we recognised there could be different factors at play in different regions, and so did not prescribe the exact approach which regions should follow in preparing their advice. However, guidance issued to the regions last July made clear that advice should, as far as possible, represent wide agreement across each region on what the region&#039;s priorities were and that it would be more credible to Government if it was the product of a wide consensus.

The causes of death for 1997 were defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). The codes used are listed:<br>

Chronic lung disease (Chronic lower respiratory disease)&#151;ICD-9 490&#150;494, 496.<br>

The introduction of ICD-10 for coding cause of death in England and Wales in 2001 means that data for chronic lung disease and cancer are not completely comparable with data for years before this date.

For chronic lung disease (chronic lower respiratory disease) and cancer (malignant neoplasms) the introduction of ICD-10 caused an increase of 3.2 per cent. and 2.3per cent. respectively in the number of deaths coded to these conditions in England and Wales. Deaths in 1997 from these causes have been adjusted to provide rates which are comparable with those for 2004.<br>

 The increased penalty relates to persistent misuse of electronic communications networks or electronic communications services and is directed particularly at silent calls and does not concern breaches of the telephone preference service rules, which are dealt with by the Information Commissioner&#039;s Office.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>23 Mar 2006 : Column 520W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
the Office of Communications (Ofcom) requested DTI to consider raising the maximum penalty, which could be levied by Ofcom from &#163;5,000 to &#163;50,000 against those that make nuisance silent calls, in view of mounting public and parliamentary concern. It was felt that the current maximum penalty was not sufficient for the level of consumer harm and worry that silent calls caused and that it was not a real sanction or deterrent. Ofcom proposed that the maximum penalty should be increased to &#163;50,000. I agreed with Ofcom&#039;s proposal and launched a consultation on 31 October 2005, which closed on 24 January 2006. In response to the consultation there was overwhelming support for raising the maximum penalty and on 1 March 2006 I announced our intention to increase the maximum penalty to &#163;50,000.

 The World Food Programme&#039;s (WFP) pilot drought insurance project was launched in Ethiopia earlier this year, for one year. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has not had discussions with the WFP on this issue, but DFID officials have followed the project&#039;s evolution closely and, with other WFP members, have provided detailed feedback in the WFP executive board meetings and privately to the secretariat. The Government are not contributing to this pilot, which has received the funding it needs from other sources. The key criterion we will use in deciding whether or not to contribute to any future schemes will be the extent to which we believe they can ensure timely and reliable delivery of assistance to those who need it most.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60323w15.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_117">The current pilot in Ethiopia is designed to benefit farmers whose livelihoods are threatened by drought of the severity experienced on average once every 10 years in Ethiopia. It does not target all those whose lives are threatened by insufficient food. They would depend on other mechanisms, including emergency food aid operations and the existing Productive Safety Nets Programme in Ethiopia; DFID contributes resources to both.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60323w15.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_118">Over the past 15 months, the UK Government have proposed a number of reforms aimed at making the humanitarian system more effective. These include investing 10 per cent. of emergency response funds in measures to prevent, or reduce the impact of, future disasters, and reforming and expanding the UN&#039;s Central Emergency Response Fund, to enable the UN to launch an immediate response wherever it is needed. DFID will continue to monitor the WFP&#039;s scheme and other developments in the area of disaster insurance.

ALS can be claimed by colleges and other FE providers to cover the extra costs of learning required by an individual&#151;for example, additional support, learning aids, materials etc. The LSC allocates ALS funds to colleges and other FE providers as part of their overall FE funding allocation. In 2004/05 the ALS spend was &#163;333.3 million. Spend for 2005/06 is not yet available but the LSC allocated &#163;340.3 million to colleges and other FE providers in 2005/06.

 This Government have given an unprecedentedly high profile to tackling and preventing bullying, as well as supporting those who have been bullied. Since 1999 it has been compulsory for every school to have an anti bullying policy in place which details how the school will tackle bullying. Our anti bullying work, including the anti bullying charter for action, takes an integrated approach to preventing bullying, to addressing causes of bullying&#151;for example prejudice&#151;and to helping those who are bullied.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60323w19.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_142">As recommended by the Practitioners Group on Behaviour and Discipline, the recent White Paper committed the Department to producing specific guidance for schools on prejudice driven bullying. At the beginning of this month, we launched our new advice &#039;Bullying around racism, religion and culture; how to prevent it and what to do when it happens&#039; as the first of this suite of materials. There is a major emphasis within this advice on prevention. The advice is presented as a set of interactive web pages on the teachernet website and is being supported by a national programme of dissemination events. Feedback from schools and local authorities so far has been overwhelmingly positive. We will be following this with specific advice on countering homophobic bullying later in 2006.

<a name="stpa_143">We have secured a very broad consensus, with all the teaching professional associations and the Anti Bullying Alliance (ABA) signing up to our anti bullying charter for action. The charter is a voluntary commitment to creating a school community where bullying is not tolerated. In 2006 we plan to share examples of where the charter has been particularly well implemented with other schools so that they can learn from this best practice. The charter contains a significant emphasis on prevention.

<a name="stpa_144">Through our work with the ABA, an organisation comprising over 65 leading anti bullying charities and experts, we provide schools and local authorities with expert help to tackle bullying, including prevention.

This is in line with the increase in participation which was expected from the roll out of EMA and is the largest increase in participation for over 10 years. While it is not possible to say that all of the increase was due to EMA, this was one of the most important initiatives aimed at increasing participation. The Department and LSC will be doing further analyses of local participation when these become available to try to get a better estimate of the change which might be due to EMA. EMA was extended to 17-year-olds in September 2005 and will be fully extended to 18-year-olds from September 2006.

<a name="stpa_159">This year the LSC has adopted the strategy of measuring EMA take-up to show early impact of the scheme locally. Volumes are on target, and take-up among poorer students is higher than originally projected, which is the group upon whom EMA is likely to have the greatest beneficial effect. Take-up among 16-year-olds largely met or exceeded estimated figures in 2004/05. Where take-up is lower than anticipated, the local LSC targets additional support to raise awareness of EMA and increase the figures.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will increase resources for schools to allow children with severe behavioural difficulties to remain in mainstream education.  [59910]</p>








<p><a name="st_193"><a name="60323w22.html_spnew7"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 Children with severe behavioural, emotional and social difficulties (BESD) are educated in a range of settings including mainstream schools, PRUs and special schools. We are committed to the principle of inclusion and are providing mainstream schools with the necessary resources to enable them to make suitable provision for children with severe BESD, where possible. Overall total revenue funding per pupil is now &#163;1,070 higher in real terms than in 1997&#150;98 and is set to rise by a further &#163;400 per pupil in real terms by 2007&#150;08.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60323w22.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_178">Within a rising total of overall funding, the funding currently provided by Excellence in Cities and the Behaviour Improvement Programme that can be used for more specialised behaviour provision like learning mentors, learning support units and multi-agency behaviour support teams will continue. The Government have also made available an additional &#163;300 million over the last three years to support the general expansion of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), helping to improve access to more specialist mental health support and advice. These additional resources alongside the new, integrated, multi-agency children services, mean that schools will be better able to support pupils with a wide variety of needs, including those with severe BESD, within mainstream education.

 The Repayment of Teachers&#039; Loans (RTL) scheme repays the student loans of eligible teachers of priority subjects who have been accepted onto the scheme. Under the scheme, the Government reduce the loan balance annually, writing off the student loans of eligible teachers over a period of up to 10 years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60323w24.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_184">There are safeguards in the RTL process which mean that there should be no cases where public funds could be assessed as irretrievable and to date, none have been. The balance on the student loan is reduced once the teacher has confirmed their eligibility to remain on the scheme for the preceding year. This is part of an annual review process. If a teacher fails to confirm their eligibility or to return the annual review form, no further loan reductions are made under the RTL scheme. This should mean that teachers do not benefit from RTL in advance of entitlement as loans are not paid off without confirmation of entitlement. If a teacher notifies a change in circumstances which affects their entitlement, the SLC adjusts the repayment account to reflect the date of the change.

The data shows that the number of 19-year-olds achieving a Level 3 qualification increased from 13,608 in 2004 to 15,143 in 2005. This equates to a 3 per cent. increase, and contributes to the overall raising of qualification levels of the Thames Gateway population.

<a name="stpa_187">On the point of work-based training opportunities, according to the Learning and Skills Council&#039;s Thames Gateway Directorate, the substantial increase in learner achievements of apprenticeships and the associated costs has meant that the number of starts on apprenticeships in the Thames Gateway have decreased from 2004/05 to 2005/06. This concurs with the national picture. The increase in achievements is very good news as we committed ourselves to improving the quality of work-based learning in Creating Sustainable Communities: Delivering the Thames Gateway. The success rates on apprenticeships in the Thames Gateway have risen from 43 per cent. in 2003/04 to 47.4 per cent. in 2004/05.

 The Palestinian Authority had consistently failed to meet its obligations under the Ramallah Agreement, despite frequent requests from UK and US officials. There was no evidence that the incoming government planned to rectify this situation. On the contrary, since the 25 January Palestinian Legislative Council elections, Hamas officials had called for the release of Ahmad Sa&#039;adat. Other factions, including the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), of which Sa&#039;adat is the General Secretary, had also repeatedly called for his release. President Abbas had offered to release Sa&#039;adat on condition that the PFLP absolve him of responsibility for the consequences. We therefore had no reason to believe that the incoming Palestinian government would deal with the issue of non-compliance with the agreement, and we had good reason to believe that the incoming government intended to release one or more of the prisoners in contravention of the agreement.

<a name="stpa_208">Since 2004, UK and European Community financial support to the budget of the Palestinian Authority (PA) has been provided through a Reform Trust Fund, managed by the World Bank. Funding is conditional on the achievement of benchmarks for reform, progress against which is carefully monitored. The benchmarks cover the PA&#039;s audit and accounting processes as well as issues such as pension reform, the wage bill and the PA&#039;s budget process. The benchmarks require that the PA submit its annual financial statements to the Palestinian Legislative Council and be independently audited. This is intended to ensure the legitimate use of PA resources and that UK taxpayers&#039; funds achieve value for money. The terms governing the Trust Fund are set out accordingly in signed memoranda of understanding between DFID and the World Bank and between the World Bank and the PA. There is no evidence to suggest that Reform Trust Fund money has been diverted to private bank accounts, or been used to support terrorism.

 There have been three reported incidents of counterfeit medicines having reached patients through the United Kingdom pharmaceutical supply chain via prescription since 1994. Over 650 million prescriptions are written annually in the UK. Therefore the risk of receiving a counterfeit medicine through the regulated pharmaceutical supply chain in the UK is low.

<a name="stpa_227">However, there is evidence of counterfeit medicines being obtained by customers in the UK via the internet, by mail order or on a personal basis. The vast majority of these instances are from websites or organisations based in other countries and are mainly lifestyle products used to treat erectile dysfunction, obesity and hair-loss. Products purchased in this way cannot be guaranteed for their safety, quality and efficacy. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) investigates such websites or related persons/organisations based in the UK and refers details of overseas equivalents to respective international counterparts.

counterfeit tablets were analysed by the manufacturer (Pfizer) and the MHRA laboratory. The analysed tablets contained Lovastatin which is a different active ingredient to Lipitor&#039;s Atorvastatin but has similar actions in vivo. The medical risks and benefits were reviewed by physicians in the MHRA and Pfizer who both independently agreed that a class two recall was appropriate because there was assessed to be no immediate danger to patients. The MHRA issued the recall for this medicine on 28 July 2005 which covered both counterfeit material and genuine material which shared a common batch number.

<a name="stpa_229">Counterfeit medicines which are discovered in the legitimate UK pharmaceutical supply chain are analysed to establish the identity and amount of any active ingredients present. A medical evaluation of the risks to patients is undertaken which determines the level of recall to be conducted for the medicine. The absence of active ingredient, reduced potency, hyperpotency and/or incorrect active ingredient in suspected and determined counterfeits as well as an analysis of the length and type of treatment contribute to this risk assessment process.

 The main element of national health service dental services are the primary dental care services provided by dentists working within the general dental service (GDS), or personal dental service (PDS) pilots. The following tables display the readily available data on expenditure on these services for primary care trusts in the Lancashire area and for the Cumbria and Lancashire strategic health authority (SHA). The difference between gross and net expenditure is the contribution to costs from dental charges collected directly from patients.

<sup>(48)</sup> Gross GDS payments include adult fees (including item of service and continuing care payments), child fees (including item of service and capitation payments), commitment payments and point of treatment check payment training (in 2001 only), seniority payments, maternity/paternity/adoptive leave payments, long-term sick leave payments, continuing professional development allowances including travel hours, reimbursement of business rates, vocational training grants and clinical audit payments. The following costs are excluded from this data: employer&#039;s superannuation costs, vocational trainee salaries and national insurance contribution costs, clinical audit convenors, clinical audit secretarial support costs and travel expenses, and costs associated with any salaried general dental practitioners and emergency dental services.<br>

<sup>(49)</sup> PDS payment data are included for 2004&#150;05 only and relates to baseline payments or the agreed regular monthly payments made to PDS practices.

 Tackling antisocial behaviour is a cross-departmental issue and many Government Departments contribute to this agenda. A wide range of funding streams across Government have a positive impact on tackling anti-social behaviour. For example, Neighbourhood Renewal programmes which focus on the most deprived areas give practitioners and local communities a real opportunity to turn their neighbourhoods around; DFES through their work on schools and parenting contribute to preventing problems escalating and ensuring families get the support

<a name="qnpa_23">The Government are determined to target those individuals involved in alcohol related disorder in our towns and cities. We have recently undertaken our third Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaign (AMEC) to crack down on such behaviour. Southern Lancashire Basic Command Unit which covers West Lancashire received an extra &#163;10,000 of Home Office funding as part of this campaign. Overall during the campaign police and trading standard officers carried out over 6,000 test purchase operations, dealt with more than 30,000 offences and made over 25,000 arrests. The police work that led to the success of AMEC will now continue on a daily basis as part of everyday mainstream police activities. We have also introduced a range of new powers through the Licensing Act 2003 to deal with the problems of alcohol misuse. In addition, the Violent Crime Reduction Bill will introduce a new civil order- a Drinking Banning Order, which will allow for the exclusion from the area concerned of individuals aged 16 or over who are responsible for alcohol-related disorder.

 It remains the Government&#039;s policy that the police service will promote equality, fairness and respect and provide a working environment where diversity is recognised to enable it to achieve a greater level of trust and confidence from all communities, which can also be achieved through better engagement with communities through initiatives such as Neighbourhood Policing.

<a name="stpa_267">The Police Service continues to make progress against the Home Secretary&#039;s recruitment targets for 2009, and forces are committed to recruit from minority ethnic groups in proportion to, or at a level above, their representation in the local economically active population. Performance against this objective is a key performance indicator in the Policing Performance Assessment Framework. Since 1999, the percentage of police officers from minority ethnic communities has risen from 2 per cent. to 3.5 per cent., an increase of 2,497 minority ethnic officers. The latest figures show that minority ethnic staff make up 6.5 per cent. of the police staff total.

The Home Office is working with the Police Service to accelerate the pace of change. The measures currently in hand include outreach programmes in police forces, engagement with student faith societies and black students&#039; unions to encourage applications from minority ethnic graduates. We are also investigating the possibility of introducing weighted appointment criteria rewarding skills such as appropriate second languages. As part of the National Assessment Centre process we aim to ensure that assessment and selection panels include representatives from minority ethnic communities wherever possible.

Note:<br>

First receptions provide an indication of the number of new prisoners in a time period. A person received into prison to serve a sentence may previously have been received on remand after conviction prior to sentence, and before that as a remand prisoner awaiting trial. First receptions will count that prisoner only once in the relevant period in which they were first received.<br>

 The Government are determined to target those individuals involved in alcohol disorder in our towns and cities. We have recently undertaken our third Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaign (AMEC) to crack down on such behaviour. West Midlands police received &#163;192,000 from the Home Office and overall during the campaign police and trading standard officers carried out over 6,000 test purchase operations, dealt with more than 30,000 offences and made over 25,000 arrests. The police work that led to the success of AMEC will now continue on a daily basis as part of everyday mainstream police activities. We have also introduced a range of new powers through the Licensing Act 2003 to deal with the problems of alcohol misuse. In addition, the Violent Crime Reduction Bill will introduce a new civil order&#151;a Drinking Banning Order&#151;which will allow for the exclusion from the area concerned of individuals aged 16 or over who are responsible for alcohol-related disorder.

As noted previously, Section 63A of the Terrorism Act extends the jurisdiction of Section 54 of that Act which relates to weapons training. The Terrorism Bill will remove section 54 from section 63A and provide instead that any person who does an act outside the UK which, if committed within the UK, would amount to an offence under section 54 shall be guilty of that offence. The Terrorism Bill creates further offences of training for terrorism (maximum penalty on indictment of ten years&#039; imprisonment, a fine or both) and attendance at a place used for terrorist training (maximum penalty on indictment of ten years&#039; imprisonment, a fine or both). In either case the nationality of the offender is not material. A person can be liable for action occurring outside the UK in both cases, but in relation to the offence of training for terrorism the extension of jurisdiction is limited to offences committed by reference to the commission, preparation or instigation of Convention offences (as defined in Schedule one to the Bill).
