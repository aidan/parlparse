Is the noble Lord aware that after four or five years&#146; intensive training, aspiring criminal law barristers earn about the same as unskilled workers until they get a tenancy, which may take several more years?</p>

The Bar got a very good deal from the 2006 review of legal aid procurement conducted by my noble friend Lord Carter. He increased the amount in the graduated fee scheme, particularly in the shorter cases, to benefit exactly the people about whom the noble Viscount is asking&#151;the junior Bar. The Bar itself supported the aim of taking money out of the highest-paying cases and putting it into the lowest-paying cases. We put an additional &#163;29 million into graduated fees in 2007, which the then chairman of the Bar said amounted to an increase of approximately 16 per cent over graduated fees across the board.</p>

Many junior counsel and solicitors specialising in this field are finding it very difficult to make a living. Accordingly, the public are suffering as well. What are the Government prepared to do about that, if anything?</p>

The criminal Bar is still doing well. I give my noble friend and the House a few examples. For a guilty plea&#151;that is, defending someone who has pleaded guilty&#151;to wounding with intent, a class B offence, with 75 pages of prosecution evidence, the total that the barrister would receive is in the area of &#163;872.50. For a four-day trial of a Section 18 wounding, with 75 pages of prosecution evidence and 14 witnesses, the same barrister would get &#163;2,643.89. I submit that those are large amounts, particularly compared with the earnings of unskilled workers.</p>

They will enable the Government and the Legal Services Commission to manage the legal aid budget effectively and plan for the future. I need to tell the noble and learned Lord that we are in consultation on the scheme for solicitors at police stations. This is a real consultation; we want to hear what is said. The department will then consider the proposals and whether this is the best way forward to ensure best value for taxpayers&#146; money while ensuring the quality of criminal defence services for those that need them, which is crucial.</p>

As I said, we are consulting on the BVT scheme and we will find out whether it is workable and whether it is what we should be doing. I have to tell the House that the legal aid budget is limited and, at a time of recession, we need to spend more not less on social welfare law&#151;that is, law that looks after those with debt needs, housing needs and employment needs.

Avoidance can be defined in a variety of ways. For example, some groups argue that the use  of perfectly legitimate relief from tax, such as pension payments, represents avoiding tax; others adopt a more limited definition. I cannot provide any estimates of UK tax avoided using the Channel Islands because of the subjective nature of the definition of avoidance. For the same reason, the Government cannot prepare avoidance forecasts or statistics on a geographical basis.</p>

Through the G20, the Government have led the initiative to pursue tax evasion. This was given significant priority in the ECOFIN Finance Ministers&#146; meeting, the G20 Finance Ministers&#146; meeting and later in the meeting of the G20 leaders in early April. We are promoting the introduction of more taxation and information exchange agreements and are vigorous in our pursuit of tax evasion.

Although tax evasion is utterly deplorable and indeed illegal, does he accept that when it comes to investment to avoid and limit certain tax liabilities, if we chase all investors out of the Channel Islands and Europe, they will merely go elsewhere?

That is why the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer have been leading an international co-ordinated effort through the OECD and the G20 to ensure unified action, otherwise closing down some areas will simply see that business divert elsewhere. However, we are vigilant and determined to close down tax evasion and are alert to areas where new tax avoidance strategies are emerging. HMRC estimates that the initiatives it has taken since the requirement for pre-disclosure of tax strategies in 2004 have led to a net accrual of more than &#163;11 billion of additional tax.</p>

Of course, my noble friend&#146;s observation about historical practice is correct. That is one reason why my right honourable friend the Prime Minister, when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, introduced the pre-notification requirement, which now requires those who market and promote tax avoidance schemes to pre-advise HMRC, so that HMRC can consider whether it regards these schemes as consistent with the spirit of good business practice, or structured solely or primarily for tax avoidance reasons. If the latter is the case, HMRC can take the necessary action to close down such schemes. More than &#163;1 billion was saved in the last 12 months as a result of that initiative.</p>

On 1 January 2009, we introduced mandatory requirements for administrators to report to creditors on all aspects of a pre-pack as soon as possible. These arrangements are being actively policed by the Insolvency Service, which is examining every pre-pack report it receives, and will publish a report before the Summer Recess.</p>

For example, when a restaurant in London closed on a Friday and re-opened on a Monday with exactly the same staff and management, in that process of administration by pre-pack, all small creditors lost all claim.

However, one has to remember that the plight of small creditors, which I feel acutely as Small Business Minister, is actually the result of the insolvency, not of the pre-pack, and there is no evidence to suggest that small creditors fare worse in a pre-pack than in any other type of administration. Of course, there is evidence to suggest that more jobs are saved: 90 per cent of jobs are saved under pre-pack and about 60 per cent under other administrations.</p>

If the Insolvency Service finds abuse, both the insolvency practitioner and the directors are investigated. There were 105 cases last year of action taken against insolvency practitioners and directors themselves.

The Government cannot say simply that this is a matter for the Insolvency Service. There is significant evidence that creditors are being damaged, as the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, has indicated. There is also significant evidence, as the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, has indicated, that often the directors who caused the problem in the first place are simply buying back the business. Should not the Government be doing something about this rather than passing it on to the Insolvency Service?</p>

However, while this is an emotive issue, it is very important to consider the facts. The insolvency practitioners are required to ensure value for creditors, to protect employees and, since the Enterprise Act, to see whether companies can remain as going concerns. They have to look at the best way of doing this, and if the only available buyer is the existing owner, it would simply be cutting off your nose to spite your face to say, &#147;We are not prepared to do this. Instead, we will put it into some other form of administration&#148;. The requirement is for people to ensure that the best value is created for creditors and that the company is protected as best it can be. That is what we investigate. It is not just a matter for the Insolvency Service; it is a matter of policy.</p>

It is not practical or sensible to change that. It is a fact of the insolvency rather than the administration. Insolvency means by definition that there are not enough assets or there is not enough cash flow to cover the liabilities. That is what results, unfortunately, for small unsecured creditors. It is not because of the nature of the administration.</p>

We worked hard on a draft resolution that was acceptable to all, but Russia rejected the draft in an attempt to change the Security Council&#146;s agreed position on Georgia&#146;s territorial integrity.</p>

How closely are the Government now working with other members of the EU and other allies within NATO to make a common policy towards Russia that states that Russia&#146;s policy towards Abkhazia and South Ossetia is not acceptable and that we do not accept the imposition of new boundaries in international law on a truncated Georgia?</p>

That means that other elements of international monitoring, particularly the EU monitoring mission and the Geneva talks coming up on 1 July, are very important. It is important in that context, in the light of the demise of the UN and OSCE missions, that we support continuing work with partners to ensure that they can adapt their activities if necessary to ensure that we continue to have a presence in Georgia. We will continue to press Russia to live up to its international obligations in Georgia and we remain committed to our support for the territorial integrity of Georgia.

As I said earlier, the opportunities exist for dialogue. Today the Minister for Europe, Glenys Kinnock, departs for Georgia for a three-day visit. We have the G8 meeting in Trieste on the 24 and 25 June, an OSCE informal ministerial meeting in Corfu on the 27 and 28 June, a NATO-Russia Council meeting, which will take place on the margins of the Corfu meeting, also on the 27 and 28 of June and the very important UN-EU OSCE meeting in Geneva.

Will the Government also consider some bilateral aid from the United Kingdom to Georgia, given that we, of all the EU member states, have perhaps the lowest gas imports from Russia, while countries such as Germany&#151;our fellow member states&#151;have as much as between 47 and 52 per cent of their imports coming from Russia and are therefore in a somewhat more difficult position?</p>

Could we not point out to them very clearly the entire contradiction between their current behaviour in the south Caucasus and the north Caucasus where their suppression of minorities in Ingushetia and in Chechnya is causing increasing disorder every week, with assassinations and local conflict?

First, I thank the Minister for pointing out an error in my drafting of Amendment 42. The amendment refers to page 10, line 3. After the words, &#147;at the end insert&#148; only the second proposed new paragraph should be inserted because the phrase,</p>
<ul><a name="09062383000023"></a>&#147;is an appropriately trained pathologist&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09062383000019"></a>is already in the Bill and should not appear twice. I apologise to the Committee for not having had that corrected before the Marshalled List went into print.</p>

<a name="90623-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="09062383000002"></a>I shall address how a coroner may decide who will undertake a post-mortem. Clause 16(2) states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="09062383000022"></a>&#147;A request under subsection (1) may specify the kind of examination to be made&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062383000020"></a>I have a concern, which I have discussed with pathologists from the Royal College of Pathologists, because the coroner is not medically trained. Hence, the requirement to insert the words &#147;after consultation&#148;. The reason is that there has been a change in the way that post-mortems are conducted. The post-mortem in which the body is, essentially, cut up, the organs looked at microscopically and then tissues taken and examined under the microscope is now being supplemented by other investigations using scanning such as CT and MRI. However, I emphasise that these are supplementary examinations, not substitute examinations. The information that you get from them is different and complementary to that from a conventional post-mortem. There have been problems, too, for families, who have the expectation that a scan will somehow be quicker and less invasive than an ordinary, what you might term, old-fashioned post-mortem. These scanning examinations are conducted by a radiologist.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1464"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1464</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90623-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="09062383000003"></a>However, there are complexities over the governance of the system because if these examinations are part of an investigation of death, the clinical governance for them should fall under a pathologist, although, of course, because of radioactivity, the examination and the control of the machinery falls to a radiologist, as does the interpretation of the images. That is why it is important that there should be a discussion over the investigation of each case. In an ideal world, the pathologist would supervise everything, but we do not have an infinite number of staff. What matters is that it is not left to a legally qualified coroner and a radiologist on their own but that it involves a pathologist who, ultimately, has the experience and expertise in the governance of the investigation of deaths. In forensic work you can get important additional information from, particularly, CT scanning.</p>

<a name="90623-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09062383000004"></a>However, there are two aspects to a coroner&#146;s work: first, to ascertain whether the death was unnatural and whether there was foul play of any kind and a case to be pursued; and, secondly, to establish the cause of death where it is a natural death. There needs to be a balanced assessment, on a case-by-case basis, of how each case is best investigated, not only for the most cost-effective way but the most appropriate way to obtain the information needed. The problem is that imaging and microscopic investigation can delay the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09062383000005"></a>On Amendment 43, there is currently a grey area in training and post-mortems are essential for the training of the next generation of pathologists. However, it is not currently clear how a coroner can authorise a coroner&#146;s post-mortem to be used for training purposes&#151;certainly not when it goes beyond the training of pathologists and into the training of nurses, mortuary technicians and other people who may be involved, or when it involves the presence of medical students to observe what is happening. Very few post-mortems now occur apart from coroners&#146; post-mortems and therefore the emphasis on training in these post-mortems has become greater, not less, since the passage of the Human Tissue Act.</p>

<a name="90623-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="09062383000006"></a>Of course, using a coroner&#146;s post-mortem for training goes beyond its current statutory remit. Ideally, you should have full consent from the relatives for everyone who is present at the post-mortem, but the consent process takes time and personnel. It can be very burdensome and there is no real benefit when people are in training and coming along to observe the post-mortem. The process of obtaining consent can be a burden on the relatives and certainly the coroners&#146; officers are not happy to do this.</p>

<a name="90623-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09062383000007"></a>There is a need for consistency across the country. At the moment, under different coroners&#146; jurisdictions, different practices occur and training is happening much more in some than in others. It would seem very sensible that the Chief Coroner should be able to authorise what happens but my amendment makes an assumption that the post-mortem examination is authorised for training purposes unless it is specifically prohibited by the coroner. It would make it much easier and practical to have an assumption that, just as in any teaching hospital, teaching goes on and there are students around, similarly at a post-mortem there would be the ability to train unless of course there was

It would then seem that the Chief Coroner could produce guidance as to how those who would be in attendance at a post-mortem should be vetted. They might even be required to sign a form to verify that they had no connection whatever with the deceased or with the case involved, but there may be times of course when a clinician who has been involved in looking after a patient should, quite rightly, be present at the post-mortem, because the post-mortem can be the most revealing and important time for them to learn.</p>

<a name="90623-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09062383000008"></a>Amendment 45 has been tabled because of a number of concerns about the present regulation of the retention of tissue samples from those who have died. The existing legislative framework for the retention of tissue samples fails to serve the interests of families with inherited conditions, especially those who suffer the trauma of a sudden adult death. That is because two legislative systems apply to the retention of post-mortem samples&#151;the Human Tissue Act and the Coroners Act&#151;and they do not currently operate in a joined-up way. This Bill gives us the opportunity to rectify that.</p>

<a name="90623-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09062383000009"></a>There have been tragic consequences for families where tissue from one family member who died unexpectedly could have been used to identify other family members who are themselves at risk of sudden death. I should declare here that I am grateful to the Foundation for Genomics and Population Health for its help in providing background to the amendment and indeed to the Royal College of Pathologists as well. Noble Lords will be aware that I raised this concern during the passage of the Human Tissue Act and nothing that has happened since that time has allayed the concerns I expressed then. I am most grateful to the Minister for meeting me recently to discuss this matter.</p>

<a name="90623-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09062383000010"></a>The Human Tissue Act of course was prompted by concerns that health services were failing to respect the interests of families when they retained tissue from dead family members. The Act attempts to right the wrongs that had occurred towards families when tissues had been retained, and regulates retention storage and use of tissue held for DNA analysis for a number of prescribed purposes by introducing a statutory obligation for those wishing to use or store tissue to seek consent from qualifying family members. These purposes include determining the cause of death and obtaining scientific or medical information about a living or deceased person which may be relevant to other persons in the future.</p>

<a name="90623-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09062383000011"></a>The difficulty is that once the coroner is satisfied with the cause of death that is attributed to the deceased, the coroner&#146;s authority lapses, and the continued retention of any samples after that time will be lawful only if consent has been obtained from qualifying family members as prescribed by the Human Tissue Act. The codes of practice published with that by the Human Tissue Authority prescribe that, in the absence of the necessary consents, tissue should be destroyed up to 10 weeks after any deadline imposed by the coroner has expired. That is the nub of the problem. The coroners and their officers have a statutory responsibility for obtaining consent for continued retention of tissue

Although it is best practice for local protocols to be set up between genetics departments and coroners&#146; offices, these are rare in practice.</p>

<a name="90623-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09062383000012"></a>So what happens? The coroner undertakes a post-mortem of an unknown cause of death. On taking the heart out and examining other tissues, he realises that this is a sudden cardiac death. Having taken the heart out, he then has to put it back again, because he cannot retain it. He then asks the relatives about permission to retain the heart and other tissues and then he has to take it out again. It is manifestly important and in the interests of the family that if a young person has had a sudden cardiac death, it is understood as there may be others in the family who are genetically related and are at risk, and whose death can be prevented by appropriate interventions.</p>

<a name="90623-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09062383000013"></a>Another situation arose recently where, again, the retention of tissues was making progress in the common good difficult. The Department of Health had been supportive of a project trying to understand the incidence of new variant CJD, and it was thought that very small samples from the spleen taken at the coroner&#146;s post-mortems would allow a broad epidemiological study to occur. The problem was that, even though tiny tissue samples were to be taken, consent had to be obtained, and consent was not viewed as a coroner&#146;s task. The coroners&#146; officers did not want to be part of that process and there was no funding for a whole additional layer to go in to obtain consent, so the project has fallen through. It would have been for the benefit of society, not for the benefit of the individual families, which is why the amendment is worded as it is.</p>

<a name="90623-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09062383000014"></a>I had also felt it important that the whole supervision of autopsies was done under a trained pathologist and not put out to technicians or others. The reason is that diagnosing the cause of death is incredibly complicated. It is easier to do so when there has been a crime such as a knife crime or a shooting, but unexpected deaths and deaths in hospital can be very complex to diagnose. Someone who has training in pathology but also has full diagnostic skills training is needed in order to integrate all the information that comes together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09062383000015"></a>Recently there was an NCEPOD report about the variability in the standard of post-mortems. That has arisen because although the Royal College of Pathologists guidance is clear&#151;that guidance sets a high standard for post-mortems&#151;it has not been clear to those undertaking the post-mortem what the role of the coroner&#146;s post-mortem is. Is it simply to establish non-natural causes and rule out foul play, or is it to establish as accurately as possible what the cause of death was, getting good data that are important for the health of the nation and that are certainly important if you are looking at governance systems in somewhere like a hospital, which is a large, complex organisation?</p>

<a name="90623-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09062383000016"></a>I hope that I have been able to explain some of the background to these amendments and why this gives us an opportunity to rectify an anomaly that has arisen in relation to the Human Tissue Act.</p>

They can therefore be retained without having to get explicit consent from the family for them to be retained if it is deemed to be either in the interests of the family or for the public good. I also think that while, in a theoretical world, it is ideal to obtain consent before you start the post-mortem, these families are often so pole-axed by the death and so overwhelmed by the shock of what has happened that they really cannot cope with being burdened with a lot of complexities, when you do not even know what tissue it might be wise to retain.</p>

<a name="90623-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09062383000018"></a>I therefore hope that the Bill can be amended to allow a degree of discretion by those undertaking the post-mortem at the time to retain tissues if it is in the interests of the family or of society. I beg to move.</p>

In the investigation of an unforeseen or totally unexpected death, the performance of a post-mortem examination is crucial. Admittedly, the use of imaging techniques by radiologists and the use of magnetic resonance imaging and X-rays play an important part, but they can never themselves substitute for a full and complete post-mortem examination. I suppose that I must declare an interest: although I am not a pathologist, I did some training in neuropathology in the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston back in the 1950s.</p>

<a name="90623-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09062391000002"></a>The Human Tissue Act, which was very fully debated in this House, arose as a result of what was called the Alder Hey scandal. A large number of human organs had been retained in the Alder Hey hospital and the great majority, if not all, of the families of the patients concerned said that they had not given consent for those organs to be retained.</p>

<a name="90623-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09062391000003"></a>What many people in the profession, and particularly in the public at large, did not recognise is that, when a post-mortem is performed, organs are examined. You can identify without difficulty someone who has been killed by a bullet, someone who has been killed by a knife wound and sometimes someone who has been killed by direct trauma to the head. There are situations, however, which are extremely complex. We all know about the so-called paper-thin skull syndrome, where an individual suffering a minor head injury as a result of trauma subsequently dies and it turns out that the X-rays demonstrate that the individual had a skull that was so thin that even a minor injury could have produced serious underlying brain damage. There have been cases in which trauma to the chest has led to a person being accused of murder, but when a post-mortem was carried out it was discovered that the individual had had a heart attack due to natural causes or had had an inflammatory condition of the heart&#151;a cardiac inflammation&#151;which might well have been the primary cause of death.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09062391000004"></a>What people did not recognise after the Alder Hey situation was that, when the organs are taken out and examined by the pathologist during a post-mortem, however skilled the forensic pathologist, it is hardly ever possible&#151;except in the most extreme circumstances&#151;for the diagnosis of the cause of death to be made simply by inspection of the organs. The organs have to be retained. They have to be fixed in

They then have to be subject to careful anatomical dissection, followed by examination of tissue sections under the microscope, before a diagnosis can ever be reached. This is particularly true in the field of neuropathology.</p>

<a name="90623-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09062391000005"></a>It is just not the case that you can make a diagnosis simply by inspecting organs removed from a body at post-mortem. The organs must be retained. After coroners&#146; post-mortems, as indicated by the argument put forward so lucidly by my noble friend Baroness Finlay, there is a strong case to be made for retention.</p>

<a name="90623-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09062391000006"></a>Before the Human Tissue Act, it is true that many pathologists&#151;not necessarily in the coroner situation&#151;would carry out a post-mortem examination and would not specifically, at that time, ask for permission for the organs to be retained. Perhaps they assumed knowledge on the part of relatives that those relatives did not possess; the relatives did not always recognise that the organs had to be retained, fixed and examined before the diagnosis could be made. Since the Human Tissue Act came into force, the organs retained in post-mortems not carried out for forensic purposes can be retained only with specific permission of the relatives.</p>

<a name="90623-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09062391000007"></a>In the case of coroners&#146; post-mortems, however, I believe that my noble friend&#146;s case is very powerful, and I hope very much that the Committee will accept Amendment 45. I also confirm her view that such coroners&#146; post-mortems must be carried out by a pathologist with appropriate forensic training. That is crucial. Otherwise there are likely to be miscarriages of justice. I strongly support her amendment.</p>

However, I should like to enter a cautionary note, partly from the very experiences that my noble friend has just referred to at Alder Hey Children&#146;s Hospital. For 18 years I served as a Member of Parliament for a Liverpool division and I was involved with the parents of some of the children whose organs and tissues had been retained. The noble Lord, Lord Walton, was right to put his finger on a central question there&#151;that the parents themselves did not know about the retention of those organs. Their permission had never been sought and it came as a terrible shock to them to learn subsequently that the remains of their children had been retained. To go through the funeral services and cremations that subsequently occurred often years after the event and the reopening of the grief involved was a terrible ordeal for those parents. So we must tread sensitively.</p>

<a name="90623-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="09062391000009"></a>However, I think that the case advanced by my noble friends is overwhelmingly correct. If we can derive knowledge by the retention of organs for a reasonable period of time that we could not derive from an autopsy immediately after death&#151;for instance, in the kinds of circumstances that my noble friend Lady Finlay described&#151;then surely any reasonable person would accept the force of that argument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09062391000010"></a>Often parents are traumatised when their children have died, and that includes the parents of the children who died in Alder Hey hospital itself. I declare a

Perhaps the worst thing to come out of all that experience was the damage done to its reputation because of decisions that had been taken over the heads of the parents in the belief that the scientists and the medics involved in a sense knew best.</p>

<a name="90623-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09062391000011"></a>The arguments that have been advanced are rational, reasonable and intelligent. I think that if they are put properly to parents in these circumstances, permission will be given. However, the important thing is not to presume or to press ahead on the presumptive basis that we know better than others. With that brief cautionary note, I conclude my intervention.</p>

<a name="90623-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09062394000003"></a>Over the last number of years there have been a number of substantial changes in pathology services and the way in which they are conducted which might not come immediately to your Lordships&#146; minds. The human organs inquiry was referred to earlier. I can remember before that time when I was a young doctor and the Government&#146;s ambition was to ensure that post-mortems were conducted in 10 per cent of all deaths in hospital as a form of audit. Essentially the post-mortem is the final determinant of what has happened, at least in terms of the physical death. Since the human organs inquiry, not only has a figure like that not been remotely achieved but things have gone completely in the other direction, so that now it is extremely difficult to persuade people to have post-mortems conducted. Of course persuasion is not required in coroners&#146; cases because the decision is a matter for the coroner. Generally, however, the percentage of deaths in hospitals upon which post-mortems are conducted has absolutely plummeted to the point where it is now difficult for trainee pathologists to do enough post-mortems to get proper experience before they qualify as pathologists.</p>

<a name="90623-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09062394000004"></a>That is why Amendment 43 is relevant. It will ensure that where post-mortems are conducted, and required to be conducted by the coroner, they can be used for training purposes. We are getting to a point where the Royal College of Pathologists has to look at whether it should require so much experience of post-mortems in pathologists&#146; training. If it were to change, we would not be able to train people as pathologists at all in some cases.</p>

Nowadays it is possible to be a member of the college with scientific training. One reason for this is that, as we become more specialised in various kinds of investigation, scientific training may enable someone to be acutely aware of particular approaches to an investigation.

I suspect that a number of noble Lords will sometimes get pains in their legs, only to be told by their general practitioner that the problem is in their back, and what they have is referred pain. Sometimes there are also psychological reasons for sore backs, but that is another matter that I will not go into.</p>

<a name="90623-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09062394000006"></a>It is frequently the case, in all aspects of medicine, not least pathology, that a proper, full assessment is a time-consuming business, and a medical or other professional colleague may say something like, &#147;Would you cast your eye over this? Do not spend too much time on it, I just want your best guess&#148;. That is not good enough, which is why professional bodies have gone to considerable trouble to set out the fullness required for a proper assessment, whether a post-mortem or another kind of assessment. There is great pressure on people both to do a full assessment because it is the right thing to do, and to do things quickly and briefly because that is where financial and time-resource pressure comes.</p>

<a name="90623-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09062394000007"></a>I can imagine a situation where coroners would think that they have seen a particular investigation done on a number of occasions, would decide that it is the suitable one to do and would proceed to do it. There may be a concentration on radiological investigations. However, that is not what the Bill says; it refers to a partial post-mortem or a &#147;particular kind of examination&#148;. That could be anything&#151;it could be a fine-needle aspiration or any other kind of investigation. The question is, how does one judge whether a partial post-mortem or another kind of investigation will give an accurate understanding or a partial and misleading understanding of what has gone on?</p>

<a name="90623-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09062394000008"></a>Some noble Lords have commented that if someone, for example, has a bullet through their head, it is pretty clear how they died. Well, it may or may not be. They may have died before they got the bullet through their head&#151;looking at the brain is not necessarily going to tell you what has happened. There are many cases of people being fished out of water, but drowning did not kill them&#151;they were dead before they hit the water. We have to be very careful in these cases not to take a simplistic view. We ask pathologists to look at these things properly so that we get the proper answer, not just a glance at the problem.</p>

<a name="90623-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09062394000009"></a>We must be careful. That is why I tabled an amendment very similar to that of the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff, saying that if a coroner feels that it might be appropriate to engage in a particular, lesser form of investigation&#151;whether a partial post-mortem or another type of investigation&#151;he or she can do so, but they should ask somebody who is medically trained and qualified. The requirement is that the investigation be conducted not by somebody who is medically qualified&#151;that is clear in the Bill&#151;but by somebody who is appropriately qualified. The appropriate qualification for certain kinds of investigation might be scientific rather than medical.</p>

I refer particularly to paragraphs 148 and 150 in the Explanatory Notes. For that reason we have tabled an amendment to Clause 16(3)(a), which reads:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="09062394000040"></a>&#147;For the purposes of subsection (1)&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09062394000036"></a>which concerns the power of a senior coroner to select a suitable practitioner to conduct a post-mortem examination,</p>
<ul><a name="09062394000043"></a>&#147;a person is a suitable medical practitioner if he or she&#151;</ul>(a) is a registered medical practitioner&#148;.
<a name="90623-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09062394000014"></a>Our amendment would add, &#147;including a radiologist&#148;. The effect of this would be to make it clear that radiologists would be recognised as appropriate persons to carry out post-mortem examinations. As I have said, this is stated in paragraph 150 of the Explanatory Notes, which reads:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="09062394000041"></a>&#147;Subsection (3) defines a suitable practitioner as either a registered medical practitioner or where a particular form of examination is required, such as an MRI Scan, a practitioner who the Chief Coroner has designated is suitable to carry out such examinations&#148;.</p>

<a name="90623-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09062394000015"></a>In other words, what is sought here is the incorporation into the Bill only of what is in the Explanatory Notes.</p>

<a name="90623-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09062394000016"></a>A similar situation applies to the amendment that we have tabled to the interpretation section, Clause 39. Here, we seek to insert between the definition of &#147;person&#148; and the definition of &#147;prosecution authority&#148; the expression,</p>
<ul><a name="09062394000044"></a>&#147;&#145;post mortem examination&#146; includes both invasive and non-invasive examination&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062394000037"></a>This would make it absolutely clear that non-invasive examination is accepted as an appropriate examination in appropriate circumstances.</p>

It may help if I start by giving a few broad, crude figures.</p>

<a name="90623-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09062394000018"></a>In England and Wales in 2008, there was a total of 108, 360 post-mortems out of a total of 234,784 deaths reported to coroners; that is, 46.2 per cent. In those cases where an inquest was held, 92 per cent involved a post-mortem being conducted. In those cases where an inquest was not held, 39.2 per cent involved a post-mortem being conducted.</p>

<a name="90623-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09062394000019"></a>I shall do my best to explain how the system for post-mortems is expected to work under the Bill and to respond to the points raised by these serious amendments. The decision whether to request a post-mortem examination will continue to remain a matter for the coroner&#146;s judicial discretion. A coroner will also have discretion over whether a particular kind of examination is needed, including non-invasive examinations. I recognise straightaway how important the possibility of non-invasive examinations is to some faith groups, and I shall say a little more about those examinations later.</p>

<a name="90623-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09062394000020"></a>Clause 35(1)(b ) sets out that the Lord Chancellor may make regulations,</p>
<ul><a name="09062394000045"></a>&#147;for regulating the practice and procedure at or in connection with examinations under section 16&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09062394000038"></a>which deals with post-mortems. These regulations will be drafted with input from all those with an interest and will cover procedural matters connected to requests for post-mortems, including with whom the coroner should consult before requesting a post-mortem&#151;for example, the pathologist or particular specialist, the medical examiner, and not least the bereaved family.</p>

<a name="90623-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09062394000021"></a>While respecting the judicial independence of the coroner, the chief coroner may also issue guidance to address the considerable variations in the number of post-mortems commissioned by individual coroners regarding the deaths that are reported to them, which range from 26 per cent in some areas to 69 per cent in others. There are considerable variations in the types of deaths reported to coroners, which we shall address in Clause 18. Therefore, these figures should be treated with caution. We anticipate that guidance about post-mortems would address the circumstances in which a non-invasive post-mortem might be appropriate and those cases which might warrant a kind of &#147;post-mortem plus&#148;. This might be appropriate when family members have concerns about a possible congenital defect if one or more family members die at an unexpectedly young age, which a routine post-mortem may not reveal.</p>

<a name="90623-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09062394000022"></a>It is expected that the new medical examiners, whose primary responsibility is to confirm the cause of death entered by doctors on medical certificates of cause of death, will contribute to the decision-making process in the following ways. First, a coroner may be unsure whether a post-mortem or a related scientific examination is required in a particular case. In this circumstance, the coroner will be able to consult the local medical examiner for advice in the same way that he or she may consult the medical examiner about other issues relating to the deceased person&#146;s medical cause of death. Alternatively, a medical examiner may refer one of their own cases to a coroner because, after consulting  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1473"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1473</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the treating doctor, he or she is unable to confirm the cause of death given on the death certificate. In making the referral, the medical examiner may suggest a particular kind of scientific examination which may assist, or may be consulted by the coroner about the sort of examination that the medical examiner would recommend.</p>

<a name="90623-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09062394000023"></a>We agree with the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, that there needs to be a close working partnership between coroners and medical examiners. The difficulty we have with his Amendment 44 is that it would require the coroner to consult with the medical examiner in certain circumstances. We believe that on balance such an approach would be unnecessarily rigid and could lead to delays in arranging post-mortem examinations, which could in turn lead to delays for families in making funeral arrangements. Everyone agrees that such delays would be undesirable and that accordingly it might be better to leave such matters to the discretion of the coroner. I shall set out in more detail the relationship between the coroner and the medical examiner systems during the debate on the next group of amendments on medical examiners.</p>

<a name="90623-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09062394000024"></a>To attempt further to reassure the noble Lord about the improvements we expect in post-mortems, I shall say a brief word about training, on which the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, concentrated in her remarks. At present, coroners receive training on the medical aspects of their role, particularly when they first take up post. This will continue in a reformed system. Once the new regulations in respect of post-mortems have been devised, training for coroners will be arranged to ensure that these regulations are understood and are properly applied under the reformed system.</p>

<a name="90623-0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09062394000025"></a>Given these intentions, and notwithstanding that coroners will retain their discretionary powers, we would expect over time to see greater consistency in the commissioning of scientific examinations. Bereaved families and those who represent their views and interests have told us that this reduction in the postcode lottery is particularly important for them.</p>

<a name="90623-0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09062394000026"></a>I turn to some of the specific points raised in the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay. We are concerned that her Amendment 42 would place restrictions on which members of the medical profession could carry out post-mortem examinations. Frankly, this could be wasteful of pathologists&#146; time by requiring them to supervise procedures that they have no need to supervise. The noble Baroness will be more aware than I that there is already a shortage of pathologists in some parts of the country, particularly in some specialisms. This proposal would spread their resources even more thinly. I listened of course to her comments on the phrase &#147;registered medical practitioner&#148;, which she believes is a loose description, and I hope that can offer some reassurance.</p>

<a name="90623-0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09062394000027"></a>It is absolutely not intended that the standard of post-mortems will decline, or that those who are not properly qualified will conduct examinations, whatever form they take. I must emphasise that in most circumstances it is expected that a pathologist would conduct a post-mortem, particularly if it were a traditional invasive post-mortem; but we have heard that there are other types of post-mortem examination which it would be appropriate for a registered medical practitioner who is not a pathologist to carry out&#151;for example,  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1474"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1474</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>radiologists who carry out MRI scans. In our view, it would be an inefficient use of valuable pathologist resources to require, for example, the presence of a pathologist to supervise a qualified radiologist carrying out a post-mortem by way of MRI scan.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90623-0004.htm"/>


<a name="90623-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09062394000028"></a>Post-mortems are certainly not tasks that we would envisage being carried out by someone fresh out of medical school, although it is of course possible that some routine functions of assistance to the pathologist could be carried out by someone recently qualified, particularly as part of further training. Noble Lords may point to subsection (3)(b) of Clause 16 as a way of enabling persons other than pathologists to carry out post-mortem examinations. However, this provision is not designed to enable the Chief Coroner to designate registered medical practitioners to carry out particular kinds of examination; it is certainly not intended to use the provision to enable a range of persons with no suitable qualifications or relevant skills to carry out examinations or tests on the body of a deceased person. The provision is there to enable the Chief Coroner to designate practitioners from outside the medical profession who may be called upon to provide expert advice, such as toxicological scientists or forensic archaeologists. I want to reassure the House that post-mortem examinations will be carried out only by someone who has the necessary medical qualifications or has been approved by the Chief Coroner.</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09062394000029"></a>I turn to Amendment 43. We can see value in making provision in the underpinning regulations or the guidance mentioned earlier about training provisions for trainee pathologists, perhaps based around their attendance at and participation in post-mortem examinations. I agree that this should be considered further in the context of that work.</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09062394000030"></a>On Amendment 45, about which the noble Lord, Lord Walton, also addressed the Committee, I am of course aware of the noble Baroness&#146;s very long interest and expertise in the subject of tissue retention, and I acknowledge her reference to the different approach that is taken in Scotland. However, we do not believe that this is the time or the legislative vehicle in which to bring about the changes that she may wish to see, all of which were debated in this House some five years ago when the Human Tissue Bill was before us. As noble Lords may be aware, the Human Tissue Authority is currently preparing new codes of practice dealing with the handling and retention of human tissue, including the handling and retention of samples taken during coronial post-mortems conducted by pathologists. Officials from the Ministry of Justice have contributed to the review of the codes and we would prefer to see how the revised codes of practice bed down before we take any action.</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09062394000031"></a>I refer noble Lords to paragraph 37 of our published draft charter for bereaved people:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="09062394000042"></a>&#147;Sometimes, organs or tissues are retained for additional examination. In this instance, the coroner should reach advance agreement with the appropriate next of kin as to what should happen when they are no longer required for coroners&#146; purposes. The coroner should convey the wishes of the next of kin to the relevant pathologist&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062394000039"></a>We believe that such a statement is Human Tissue Act compliant and that it provides scope for families to agree to organs or tissues being retained indefinitely.  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1475"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1475</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>We will also be making regulations under Clause 35(3)(g) in respect of the preservation, retention, release or disposal of bodies, including body parts. There will therefore be ample opportunity to consider these issues further with everyone who has an interest, and this debate will be taken into full account as part of that process.</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09062394000032"></a>I move on to the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and I hope I can put his mind at rest that they are already catered for in the Bill. His Amendment 41A seeks to add radiologists to the list of persons who are automatically allowed to conduct post-mortem examinations under Clause 16(3)(a). My understanding is that all practising radiologists should be registered medical practitioners and therefore I reassure him that they are already covered by that clause.</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09062394000033"></a>Moving on to the noble Lord&#146;s second amendment, we do not believe it necessary to state in the legislation that a post-mortem examination includes both invasive and non-invasive procedures. This is permissible under the Bill as drafted. However, for the record, the provisions that refer to post-mortems do indeed apply to both invasive and non-invasive procedures.</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="09062394000034"></a>More generally, as noble Lords will be aware, the Government are committed to pursuing the increased use of non-invasive MRI scans as a method of carrying out post-mortem examinations. This measure has been particularly welcomed by members of the Jewish and Muslim faiths, both of which require the body not to be tampered with after death and for burial to take place, wherever possible, within 24 hours of death. At present, scanning facilities for those who have died are available in only small pockets of the country, and under the current system coroners are prevented from moving the body outside their jurisdiction or an adjoining jurisdiction. Clause 17 allows bodies to be moved anywhere to enable the appropriate examination to take place. I am pleased to say that in the current system coroners in the Manchester area have led the way, in conjunction with local health providers, in making non-invasive post-mortems available to the communities they serve. We await the outcome of Department of Health research into the full effectiveness of such procedures, especially in the detection of particular causes of death, but we are already encouraging coroners in other parts of the country to engage with their local health services to establish whether there is a possibility of making use of local scanning facilities.</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="09062394000035"></a>I hope that I have been able to give some reassurance to noble Lords whose amendments we have debated this afternoon and I look forward to hearing from them now.</p>

I must begin by saying that I am not totally reassured, and I believe that this is something that we need to continue to discuss and came back to on Report. I am also grateful to all noble Lords who have contributed to this debate. There are a few points I would like to make, just to underline my reservations. I assure the House that I will be as brief as I can on these.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1476"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1476</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90623-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09062395000002"></a>It is true that there are groups in society that do not want delays and who are worried about the body being tampered with after death. However, I think we should not be under any illusion that the non-invasive MRI is a substitute for a full post-mortem. It is not: the trials that have been done demonstrate that one gets different bits of information. I am concerned that the public may be feeling misled. It is also quite expensive to undertake these investigations, so there is therefore a problem of cost. Moreover, the machines in use for post-mortems either must be dedicated machines, or&#151;if they are also patient machines&#151;they may be taking up patient investigation time.</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09062395000003"></a>My main concerns relate to the post-mortem process being supervised by an appropriately trained pathologist. As the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, already said, there are many people who are members of the Royal College of Pathologists. Some of them are chemists, some are haematologists, but very few of them would be able to undertake a post-mortem. I am a registered medical practitioner of many years standing, but I would not be able to do a post-mortem with any degree of competence. It would be completely fallacious to pretend that I could.</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09062395000004"></a>To do a post-mortem properly, one needs to be highly skilled with a great deal of training. My amendment does not state that the post-mortem itself has to be done start to finish by somebody with that level of training, but it says that it must be supervised by somebody with that level of training. Indeed, part of the initial preparation of the body and the closing-up afterwards does not have to be done by somebody with a very high degree of training at all. Certainly, however, somebody has to be available to come in and out to make sure that the standard of post-mortem is high. If the standard is not high, it is dangerously misleading and can create a false sense of reassurance. I have a concern that, when we may be faced with, for example, convictions of corporate manslaughter that could relate to deaths, it would be very important that a high quality of post-mortem is undertaken to provide the evidence to underpin, uphold or refute such a conviction.</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09062395000005"></a>Will the Minister say whether there is a need for primary legislation to amend the Human Tissue Act, and to allow the Human Tissue Authority to change the codes of practice to extend the length of time and the amount of tissue that can be retained while consent is being sought? My understanding&#151;but I may be wrong here&#151;is that it would require primary legislation for a step in that process.</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09062395000006"></a>I would also like to return later on to training&#151;but I will not push the Minister on this now. If we do not train pathologists adequately, and we do not have a training environment created around post-mortems that are happening, we will indeed have an extending shortage of pathologists, and those we have will be inadequately trained. An inadequately trained pathologist would probably be more dangerous than not having enough pathologists around altogether, because there may be undue weight put on an opinion which is not appropriately or fully informed. That is another point to which I would like to refer after this debate.</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09062395000007"></a>My last point relates to the retention of tissues and justice for families. It may be that there is a conviction over the death of a child that is inappropriate, because it was not the parents who were the cause of death, and the child had died naturally. We have already seen that happen.</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09062395000008"></a>In the future, the opposite may occur, too; that there is a child&#146;s death and the family is acquitted. The family is asked whether it consents to tissues being retained, but of course it says no and wants the tissues to be cremated. If there is a subsequent death in that family and the tissues have gone completely, there will be no way of linking across. We have an increasing range of chemicals that can be use in poisoning, and increasing access to all kinds of substances that are toxic and can be used. Not only gross external blows may be the cause of death, and I worry that, by not retaining even the blocks and slides, we may not do justice to the dead child or may commit a gross injustice through the wrongful conviction of parents who, acutely bereaved, are not in a position to argue their case. I would like to discuss with the Minister outside the confines of this debate some of the issues arising from the Human Tissue Act and whether primary legislation is required. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09062395000012"></a>For many months, the UK Government have rightly been at the forefront of proposals to strengthen international regulation. That is why we have taken forward Lord Turner&#146;s report. Radical proposals for the reform of regulation were a key outcome of our G20 summit in London in April. With so much of Britain&#146;s financial sector&#146;s activities linked to Europe and the rest of the world, and with cross-border investments between the UK and the rest of Europe alone amounting to more than &#8364;250 billion every year, Britain needs greater European as well as wider international cross-border supervision.</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09062395000013"></a>So in line with the recommendations of the reports from Lord Turner and de Larosière, the Council agreed the principles on which a new international framework for the regulation and supervision of financial services in Europe would be delivered: first, the better early warning of financial sector risks through the creation of a new European Systemic Risk Board to complement the work of the IMF and the Financial Stability Board and to help to identify problems early and thus prevent future crises from developing; secondly, and as proposed by the review from Lord Turner&#151;which was itself welcomed by most people in this House&#151;agreement to develop a strengthened and more detailed set of European rules for the single market in financial services, measures to raise the quality and consistency of supervision across Europe, to ensure that common rules are enforced, and to improve co-ordination between national supervisors, and measures for mediation between the supervisors of institutions with operations in more than one member state; and, thirdly, a clear commitment from the Council, which,</p>
<ul><a name="09062395000086"></a>&#147;stresses that decisions taken by the European Supervisory Authorities should not impinge in any way on the fiscal responsibilities of Member States&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90623-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09062395000014"></a>The principles agreed at the Council provide the foundation for a new financial supervisory architecture, with the aim of protecting our financial systems from future risks and helping to ensure that the international regulatory failures of the past will not be repeated.</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09062395000015"></a>The G20 decided that countries should take similar action on economic policies in what is recognised by the leader of the Opposition as a Europe-wide recession. While the Council acknowledged that the co-ordinated measures taken so far in support of the banking sector and the wider real economy,</p>
<ul><a name="09062395000087"></a>&#147;have been successful in preventing financial meltdown and in beginning to restore the prospects for real growth&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09062395000016"></a>the Council also emphasised the,</p>
<ul><a name="09062395000088"></a>&#147;imperative for the EU to continue to develop and implement the measures required to respond to the crisis&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062395000017"></a>While it is absolutely right that we maintain our commitment to medium-term fiscal sustainability, it is equally vital, as the Council reiterated, that we remain determined,</p>
<ul><a name="09062395000089"></a>&#147;to do what is necessary to restore jobs and growth&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90623-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="09062395000018"></a>Recognising the worldwide nature of the financial crisis and that around 1 billion people face poverty, malnutrition and hunger, the European Council also

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09062395000019"></a>On climate change, the Council agreed:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="09062395000084"></a>&#147;The time has now come for the international community to make the commitments needed to limit global warming to under 2°C&#148;,</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09062395000020"></a>and that a coherent response to the challenges posed by both climate change and the economic and financial crisis would, by enabling the move to a low-carbon economy, offer new opportunities for jobs and growth. The Council repeated its call for all parties to co-operate in reaching an ambitious and comprehensive agreement in Copenhagen later this year and to accelerate the pace of negotiations at forthcoming high level international meetings, including the G8 and the Major Economies Forum next month.</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09062395000021"></a>The Council agreed that both developed and developing countries should contribute finance in the fight against climate change and that such global burden sharing should be strictly on the basis of two principles: the ability to pay and the scale of emissions.</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09062395000022"></a>When the Council met in December, we agreed that we would seek to provide the legal assurances that Ireland needed to move forward on the Lisbon treaty&#151;on taxation, defence, the right to life, education and the family. However, we were equally clear that, in doing so, there could be no change or amendment to the treaty, only clarification of what it will and will not do. That is exactly the purpose of the guarantees that the Council has agreed for Ireland. To be absolutely clear, the Heads of State or Government have declared:</p>
<ul><a name="09062395000090"></a>&#147;the Protocol will in no way alter the relationship between the EU and its Member States. The sole purpose of the Protocol will be to give full Treaty status to the clarifications set out in the Decision to meet the concerns of the Irish people. The Protocol will clarify but not change either the content or the application of the Treaty of Lisbon&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062395000023"></a>Its content is fully compatible with the treaty of Lisbon and will not necessitate any re-ratification of that treaty. Those guarantees will be set out in a protocol only at the time of the next accession treaty. This will be specific to Irish concerns. Its status will be no different from our own protocols and will be subject to ratification in this House.</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09062395000024"></a>On Burma, the Council marked the 64th birthday of Aung San Suu Kyi by expressing its deep concern at her continued imprisonment, as the Burmese regime still pursues its absurd and contemptible sham trial. The Council called for her &#147;immediate and unconditional release&#148; and agreed that if this does not happen, Europe,</p>
<ul><a name="09062395000091"></a>&#147;will respond with additional targeted measures&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09062395000025"></a>against the Burmese regime. It is absolutely right that we stand ready to step up sanctions. We will also work with Asia to further increase international pressure and I hope that the Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon will be able to visit Burma soon.</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09062395000026"></a>On Iran, the Council,</p>
<ul><a name="09062395000092"></a>&#147;stressed that the outcome of the Iranian elections should reflect the aspirations and choices of the people of Iran&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062395000027"></a>The onus is on Iran to show the Iranian people that recent elections have been credible and that the repression and curtailment of democratic rights that we have

We, too, have an expectation of Iran; that it meets its obligations as a member of the international community. I hope that Iran will respond to our efforts to achieve a genuine dialogue.</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09062395000028"></a>It is therefore with regret that I should inform the House that Iran yesterday took the unjustified step of expelling two British diplomats over allegations which are absolutely without foundation. In response to this action, we informed the Iranian ambassador earlier today that we would expel two Iranian diplomats from their embassy in London. I am disappointed that Iran placed us in this position, but we will continue to seek good relations with Iran and to call for the regime to respect the human rights and democratic freedoms of the Iranian people.</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09062395000029"></a>The Council unanimously agreed that it intends to nominate Jos&#233; Manuel Barroso to lead the next European Commission and, as we look forward to the next five years, this Council has put in place the building blocks for the Europe of the future. It is by co-operating on the basis of our interdependence that we achieve more. By engaging and working in partnership with Europe, and globally, we take forwards our commitments from the G20 in April. By putting Britain at the heart of Europe&#151;not on the sidelines, with Europe's single market worth over &#163;10 trillion&#151;we in Britain can responsibly deliver security, new jobs, prosperity and a strong future for all our people. I commend this Statement to the House&#148;.</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09062395000030"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</p>

I shall begin by exploring some of the foreign policy issues discussed. Were there discussions in Brussels about the strategic aims of action in Afghanistan? The summit conclusions call for Afghan election candidates this August to produce manifestos. Worthy though it is, door-to-door leafleting is rather more perilous in parts of Afghanistan than some parties in Brussels may realise. Will the noble Baroness tell the House of any additional troop commitments made by member states?</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09062395000032"></a>On Pakistan, we welcome financial assistance for displaced people. We also note the warm words about possible reconstruction aid. Is the noble Baroness able to give any details on that? Has any progress been made towards a free trade accord between the EU and Pakistan?</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09062395000033"></a>Finally, the decision on how Iran is governed is a matter for the Iranian people. But does the noble Baroness agree that when we say &#147;the Iranian people&#148; we mean the people, not those who carry guns? The summit was trenchant in its condemnation of violence against protesters and journalists. In view of the singling out of Britain, quite absurdly, as a promoter of violence in Iran, was any solidarity expressed with the UK? If so, what practical form will that take? We support the measured but firm response of the Government to these provocations. The summit declaration is vague on Iran's nuclear programme, which is surely an extremely dangerous issue of foreign and security policy. Did the Prime Minister argue that, if Iran does not negotiate,  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1481"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1481</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Europe must consider sanctions? If so, what was the response to that, given the major trade links with Iran of some member states?</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09062395000034"></a>On the economy, the Council reiterated,</p>
<ul><a name="09062395000093"></a>&#147;its strong commitment to sound public finances&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062395000079"></a>Did the Prime Minister have his fingers crossed behind his back when he signed up to that? Will the noble Baroness confirm that, after 12 years of a Labour Government, Britain now has the highest youth unemployment in Europe? Will she also confirm that Britain is heading for the biggest deficit in the G20? Were Mrs Merkel and other leaders queuing up for a teach-in on the so-called British miracle?</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09062395000035"></a>Despite the errors of recent years, no sector is more important to the British economy than finance. I declare an interest as a director of companies regulated by the FSA. Does the noble Baroness agree that no other EU member state has comparable skills in or reliance on this sector? We on this side welcomed the assurances given by the Prime Minister on the nature of proposed EU financial regulation. On 9 June in the <I>Financial </I><I>Time</I><I>s </I>the noble Lord, Lord Myners, said,</p>
<ul><a name="09062395000094"></a>&#147;national supervision must be pre-eminent&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062395000080"></a>The Prime Minister told Parliament that he did not want any new body to have powers over national supervisors. So why does the communiqu&#233; say that the decision-making powers of the European System of Financial Supervisors will be &#147;binding&#148;? Why did President Sarkozy say that Mr Brown had performed a sea-change? Take my word for it, that is French for a U-turn.</p>

<a name="90623-0004.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09062395000036"></a>Is it not the case that, as President Sarkozy also boasted, new EU institutions end up doing much more than foreseen? What assurances can the noble Baroness give Parliament on the record that the City of London was wrong to warn that we now have,</p>
<ul><a name="09062395000095"></a>&#147;a situation where binding arbitration dictated by Brussels could overrule the UK&#146;s FSA&#148;?</ul>
<p><a name="09062395000081"></a>The City has precious few friends in other EU states and many envious rivals. It would be a disaster to find national control ceded in a core area of national competitiveness.</p>

<a name="90623-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09062395000037"></a>Finally, we go from a worrying sea-change to the shabby stitch-up on the Lisbon treaty. The presidency boasted that the deal reached,</p>
<ul><a name="09062395000096"></a>&#147;will not lead to a re-opening of ratification&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062395000082"></a>It declared:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="09062395000085"></a>&#147;This is a major success and good news for the whole of Europe&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062395000083"></a>We hear daily lectures about the need for engagement with the people, for constitutional renewal and for modernisation. What could be more divorced from the people, more old fashioned in its top-down view of what the people can be allowed to do, and more redolent of the old, broken way of doing things in Europe than this collective boast that denying most of Europe a vote and forcing those who do not vote as they are told is a &#147;major success&#148; for Europe?</p>

<a name="90623-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09062395000038"></a>The presidency declares that the decision on Ireland is a legally binding decision of the Heads of State. But how is it legally binding and, if it is, why is it not being brought to this Parliament? Indeed, why is it not being put to the British people? Why are the Irish people being forced to give their view twice when the British  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1482"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1482</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>people have not been asked for their view once? The Prime Minister seems to be assuming that when the next accession treaty comes before Parliament&#151;in this case for Croatia&#151;those promised guarantees for the Irish, at present without any legal validity whatever, will at that point be metamorphosed into full legal changes in the Lisbon treaty and that it will all go through on the nod, along with the accession provisions. It is as if the Irish pumpkin is going to be turned into a golden Lisbon coach.</p>

<a name="90623-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09062395000039"></a>However, that is a very bold assumption. Many people will see it as another attempted sleight of hand to avoid parliamentary or public approval for a thoroughly unpopular policy. The Irish people are being given alterations to the negotiated package while the British people are told they have to swallow it whole and have no say in any of it.</p>

<a name="90623-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09062395000040"></a>I wonder where constitutional renewal is in this. Four years ago, at the last general election, the party opposite and the Liberal Democrats gave the British people a solemn pledge in their manifestos that they would allow the British people a say on the Lisbon treaty in a referendum. They did so, of course, for the cynical reason that they wanted to stifle public debate on the future course of Europe at that general election. They gave their word, and then they broke their word. That was an act of dishonour by the leaders of those parties that nothing can erase. We will never renew politics unless we redeem that honour, so I say to my friend, the noble Lord, Lord McNally, and those on the Liberal Democrat Benches that they may howl to the moon about what they call establishment parties; but in Europe they are the establishment&#151;a closed establishment&#151;which is deaf to the desire of people to be heard and blind to the immense challenges of the 21st century that call for a new, less introverted Europe which is ready to renew and reform itself. You cannot pose as democrats and renewers at home and be gainsayers abroad.</p>

If one is talking about honour, I say that it is dishonourable to fight a European election campaign with the body language and every statement putting forward an anti-Europe position&#151;indeed, a &#147;withdraw from Europe&#148; position&#151;but with fingers crossed behind the back and actually meaning, &#147;We would stay in Europe anyway&#148;.

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09062395000042"></a>In terms of being part of the European establishment, the Liberal Democrats certainly are in this respect: we are now part of a group in Europe far larger than the rag, tag and bob-tail group that the Conservatives have associated themselves with in the European Parliament. Therefore, to any outside interest groups that want Britain&#146;s interests defended within Europe and their views put forward in the European Parliament with some idea of their being listened to, I say that I would have thought the Liberal Democrats were a better channel now than the Conservatives with their other fringe friends.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09062395000043"></a>As far as the Statement is concerned, the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, was quite right to congratulate the Government on their measured but correct response to Iran; I associate myself with that. The accusations of the Iranian Government are quite absurd and it is pleasing to see yet another dictatorship in trouble blaming the BBC for its troubles. It sounds to me like the BBC World Service is carrying on its historic mission of telling the truth to oppressed peoples, and we congratulate it on this.</p>

<a name="90623-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09062395000044"></a>On the financial issues, the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, has drawn attention to something that has been worrying me. I was at a briefing this morning on what the Americans are doing about financial regulation. It is important, and the Prime Minister is to be congratulated on the co-ordination that he has achieved internationally, but it seems that we are now getting three different levels of approach to regulation from the United States, the European Commission and the UK. That does not augur well for the future of a global response to financial regulation. A worry has been expressed by the City of London that it will be overregulated by a commission that does not have either the same experience or the same priorities as we do in keeping London as a major world financial centre.</p>

<a name="90623-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09062395000045"></a>On climate change, we all welcome the new sense of urgency but, again, I saw a programme the other day about the Obama Administration&#146;s investment in the new technologies that will be needed to reach climate change objectives, and I wonder where in Britain&#151;indeed in Europe, but certainly in Britain&#151;are the new industries being brought forward to meet that demand. Will we find that, to meet those objectives, we have to import technologies from the United States and other parts of Europe, or indeed from China?</p>

<a name="90623-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09062395000046"></a>On Ireland, I think the truth is that the Irish people will be looking again in a colder, harsher world than when they made their first decision and this time they will not have the help of an expatriate millionaire to influence their decision. I hope that we can move on quickly to the ratification of the Lisbon treaty so that Europe can get on with its real business of economic recovery, the challenge of climate change and the war against organised crime and terrorism. That is the real agenda, and I hope that the Government ignore the Conservative Party playing party games and keep to that agenda.</p>

From the beginning we accepted the broad thrust of La Rosiere&#146;s proposals, but we were concerned about the detail. We believe that the framework is now in place and that important changes were brought about at the summit as a result of the Government&#146;s negotiations. The UK supports improved co-ordination between national supervisors. Mediation clearly has a role to play where there are disagreements to be resolved between home and host supervisors, as in the case of Icesave. Both the JEC conclusions and ECOFIN of 9 June made clear that any mediation will not impinge on national fiscal accountability. We regarded that as a key issue, and it has been agreed by the summit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09062395000052"></a>The noble Lord, Lord McNally, suggested that there would be too many approaches to regulation and that the City would be overregulated. I agree with the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, about the pre-eminence of the City and its importance not just to the people of this country but to the world. The EU proposals on financial regulations follow and take full account of the London and Washington summit conclusions. The Commission will publish legislative proposals this autumn, and the Government will continue to represent fully the special position held by the City as a global financial centre.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09062395000053"></a>I wholeheartedly agree with the noble Lord, Lord McNally; now that the issue of the Irish referendum has been considered by the summit, I hope that, whatever the result, the European Union can move on to the real agenda that it should be addressing, including climate change. There is a referendum in Ireland because that is what the Government of Ireland wish, not because it has been imposed by the EU. It is entirely up to the people of Ireland. The protocol will be legally binding when ratified. Ratification will take

That will be the accession of either Croatia, or possibly Ireland. The Government are not trying to stifle discussion on the protocol in this House. It will take place as a matter of course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="09062395000054"></a>Finally, in response to the noble Lord, Lord McNally, my noble friend Lord Drayson is actively engaged in ensuring that the new industries are there, the training is taking place, the investment is being made, so that the people of this country can benefit from the new industries, when and as necessary.</p>

When is Europe going to address its democratic deficit?</p>

I respect that official&#146;s views, but I am sure there are many different views across the European Union. The democratic deficit is constantly addressed; we have a European Parliament that is democratically elected. I am sad, like other Members of this House, that so few people bother, as it were, to vote in European elections, but we do have a democratically elected European Parliament. That is what ensures that there is no democratic deficit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09062395000058"></a>On the economic side, is it not now as plain as a pikestaff that there is no such thing as a totally independent economic state? Does my noble friend agree that the Government&#146;s pragmatic approach is well illustrated by page 7 of the Council&#146;s statement dealing with the new European systemic risk board, of which the UK will be fully a part? The members of the General Council of the European Central Bank will elect the chair of the board and the ECB will have the lead role in implementation. This is surely an historic event.</p>

Before this summit and before ECOFIN, it was not going to be the General Council of the ECB that elected the president of this new supervisory body; it was just going to be the European Central Bank. We wanted to widen this election to ensure that we had a voice and to ensure that the City of London, through the British Government, had a voice. It is a testament to the fact that we, the British Government, are in the mainstream of the European Union.</p>

<a name="90623-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09062395000061"></a>My other question is about Pakistan. It is not entirely clear to me what the position is following the noble Baroness&#146;s response to the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, about the additional &#8364;120 million funding. Traditionally, the EU&#146;s aid to Afghanistan has been appallingly meagre. In 2002 to 2006, it provided only &#8364;125 million in aid. Will the amounts that she has mentioned take the form of aid or some other kind of assistance?</p>

<a name="90623-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09062395000062"></a>Finally, in our deliberations in the European Council, will we put forward the idea that the EU should appoint a very senior regional envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan who can work alongside Richard Holbrooke, the US special envoy to the region, so that we can bring a bit more gravitas and clout to that region?</p>

<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="09062395000063"></a><b><a name="90623-0005.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09062395000113"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> My Lords, I regret that I will have to write to the noble Baroness on all three of the points she mentioned. I agree that EU aid to Pakistan has been meagre in the past, but I think that the new allocation of money at this summit will redress the situation somewhat. However, I shall certainly come back to her on Afghanistan and on a regional envoy to the region.</p>

<p><a name="st_71"></a>
<a name="09062395000064"></a><b><a name="90623-0005.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09062395000114"></a>Lord Pearson of Rannoch:</b> My Lords, I trust the noble Baroness will not mind if I suggest that she was perhaps a little disingenuous when she suggested that the European Parliament carries any form of democratic legitimacy. After all, the majority of law which is now imposed on this country is proposed in secret by the European Commission and passed in secret by the Council, and this Parliament can do nothing about it.</p>

<a name="90623-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09062395000065"></a>As to the Statement itself, perhaps I may put two questions to the noble Baroness. First, on the new European supervisory powers over our financial services, will the Financial Services Authority be supreme in those areas or will the new EU bodies be supreme? It really does not help to be told in the Statement that there will be no fiscal change, because if these new European regulations drive our leading City practitioners overseas, surely that will have a devastating effect on our financial and therefore fiscal position. Therefore, can she confirm who will be the boss in future&#151;the British Government and the City of London or this new financial supervisory set-up?</p>

<a name="90623-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09062395000066"></a>Finally, perhaps I may remind the noble Baroness of the words of Mr Jens-Peter Bonde, the leading Danish politician, who has said that all the guarantees given to Denmark when Denmark was forced to vote again on the Maastricht treaty have been broken. All those guarantees have been broken. So, really, it comes down to the question of what is the status of this protocol. Let us suppose that there is not a treaty of accession for Croatia. Where will Ireland be left then? Surely the most monstrous deception is being practised on the Irish people and I very much regret that the British Government have gone along with it.</p>

As the noble Lord well knows, co-decision means that it is agreed not only by the European Parliament, in which we have democratically elected representatives, but by the European Council, which is made up of members of this Government. So there is a very strong democratic element in the way in which European laws are made. The European Commission only proposes.</p>

<a name="90623-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09062395000068"></a>As for the views of Jens-Peter Bonde, I have long known Mr Bonde and his anti-European views. However, he has always sent his children to a European school in Brussels. I think that that is an interesting point, since there seems to be something to do with the European Union that he likes. I note his views on Denmark but I have more trust in Europe and the institutions of the European Union than he does.</p>

<a name="90623-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09062395000069"></a>I do not think that there has been any kind of monstrous&#151;I cannot recall the word that the noble Lord used.</p>

That is exactly what we were doing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09062395000072"></a>I will read out the notes that I have on supervision. I will also get back to the noble Lord in writing and put a copy in the Library. It is clear that the heads of the Council agreed to limit the scope of the binding mediation powers of the new European authorities to two areas. First, they will ensure that the rules are followed and that Community law is implemented and enforced. This strengthens the working of the single market, which is a key priority for industry. Secondly, they will deal with disagreements between home and host state supervisors. This will improve single-market protections for cross-border banking, in particular where the UK is a host to branches of banks supervised elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09062395000073"></a>The Government are confident that this will not harm the City of London. The Government, in common with all Members of this House, want to safeguard the future of the City of London for the benefit of the people of this country.</p>

We must face the truth that the European Parliament has the support of just over 40 per cent of the electorate in Europe&#151;less in the United Kingdom. It has no democratic mandate, and the public in Europe do not identify with the European Parliament or with MEPs. Is it not time that we gave consideration to maintaining a European Union run by the European Commission alongside a Council of Ministers who would be responsible to their national parliaments?</p>

I also agree that the public do not identify either with the European Parliament or with other European institutions. I do not, however, agree with the remedy that he suggests. I am sure that many noble Lords will share the concerns expressed and it is up to all of us to try to remedy the situation. We have another five years to do that. Let us hope that at the next European Parliament elections, more than 50 per cent of the electorate will vote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09062395000077"></a>On the question of fiscal responsibility, I welcome the statement in the presidency conclusions that fiscal responsibility remains firmly with member states. However, looking carefully at the conclusions, it is also clear that squaring the circle of a firm supervisory power in Europe with the fiscal responsibility of member states is not easy. Does the noble Baroness also recognise that paragraph 22 of the presidency conclusions asks the Commission to come up with proposals on how to square that circle? In other words, they may say the words, but they do not know how to do it.</p>

<a name="90623-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09062395000078"></a>Finally, given that the Commission makes it clear that it will bring forward legislative proposals by early autumn, when do the Government intend to set out their thinking on how to square the circle and achieve the objective of a clear, coherent single market in financial services consonant with maintaining fiscal responsibility? This House and the House of Commons could well not be sitting for a lot of that time. When are the Government going to make clear their thinking on this?</p>

That is precisely why we are not telling Ireland what to do, if that is what the noble Lord is referring to in any way. It is up to the Government of Ireland to decide whether they wish to hold a referendum, and that is what they have decided to do.</p>

Has she seen that in this morning&#146;s <I>Daily Telegraph</I>, Stuart Fraser, the chairman of the City of London Corporation&#146;s policy and resources committee, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="09062397000030"></a>&#147;We have lost the broader argument about ceding control of UK rules to the EU, though we are happy that some concessions have been made&#148;.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="09062397000031"></a>&#147;We now still have a situation where binding arbitration dictated by Brussels could overrule the UK&#146;s Financial Services Authority&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062397000008"></a>That is in direct opposition to what the noble Baroness and the Government believe. I would like to know whether the corporation has been consulting and whether the Government will listen to any representations that it might make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09062397000009"></a>I have one more question. The Commission believes that these changes can be brought in under Article 95 of the EC treaty on the approximation of laws to operate the single market.

That is a welcome development building on our earlier debate on the various changes, the possibility of partial post-mortems, particular investigations and so on. The idea that we would have medical examiners seems a positive development that we welcome. It is something that in many ways has been lacking for some time. That the Government have taken a step along this road is a step very much in the right direction. However, there are a number of questions about the system being put in place. The Government have rightly found it necessary to identify the position of Chief Coroner to bring the whole service together. It would be important in the development of any service but, particularly in one that is somewhat devolved down to local authorities to address, the position of Chief Coroner seems important. There are also particular responsibilities placed on the Chief Coroner to draw together patterns of illness, disorder, disease, death and anything that will be helpful at a national level.</p>

<a name="90623-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09062397000016"></a>It does not seem unreasonable that there be a national or cheap medical adviser who would assist the Chief Coroner and perform similar functions with regard to the medical examiners or advisers throughout the country. However, the Bill does not say that there shall be a national medical adviser or chief medical examiner, so I and my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford have tabled the amendment&#151;not as a new  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1491"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1491</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>idea, because it was debated substantially in the other place. Indeed, I note that the Minister in another place, responding to the proposal that there should be such a national medical adviser but that it was not in the Bill, indicated that she would be prepared to consider it and return to it, and that she had not set her face against including a national medical adviser in the Bill. Fortified by that, we return to the question to see whether the Government have thought further about this and can advise us of any good reasons for not including it in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90623-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09062397000017"></a>I note some of the arguments that were adduced by the Minister in the other place; namely, that lots of people were involved, including various staff and people from different backgrounds. That is a fairly thin argument because no one else has a national service such as the medical examiner service or the medical adviser service. As regards there being lots of other people involved such as porters, and the fact that they cannot all be represented at the national level, that is absolutely true but it is hardly the point in this connection.</p>

<a name="90623-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09062397000018"></a>One of the responsibilities, among many others, that we think would be appropriate to establish is to ensure certain standards and training among medical examiners throughout the country. I recall that when I raised this at Second Reading the Minister helpfully commented that there had been discussions about standards, training and courses with the relevant royal colleges. I had mentioned the Royal College of Pathologists in that regard but the Minister advised us that the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges had been involved in this and that things were well advanced in terms of producing training and courses. We would like to push this a little further to see whether the Minister can help us further. We have tabled amendments concerning regulations about the training of medical examiners and the standards that should be set for them. We are a little concerned about the consequences of not doing this although I have no doubt that the Minister will say it will be in the regulations. However, when one is trying to set up a large service such as this all round the country, certain areas will attract very high-quality people because there are people in place who could move fairly seamlessly into the new positions, which will offer more authority and more opportunity to use their skills. However, in other places such people will not exist or will not be available, or the people who have been doing the job will be past their sell-by date and will take this opportunity to step down. There may not be somebody there to take over.</p>

<a name="90623-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09062397000019"></a>Therefore, we harbour concerns that people who might not be as well qualified as one would hope and who are without the necessary experience might take up these positions unless clear standards are set and clearly stated qualifications are required. Therefore, we have tabled an amendment which proposes that those appointed will have to have undertaken a course and have qualified from it. Attending a course is one thing but showing that you have learnt something from it is another matter. Some of these matters may be able to be dealt with in other ways than being included in the Bill, but we want to press that matter a little further.</p>

<a name="90623-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09062397000020"></a>The standards, training and qualifications of the national medical adviser must be a substantial concern. If we are concerned about that at the local level we are even more concerned about it at the top level. Therefore, Amendment 49 proposes:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="09062397000036"></a>&#147;The Chief Coroner shall appoint an experienced forensic pathologist to be the National Medical Adviser&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062397000028"></a>This goes to the heart of the matter. We need someone who has the necessary experience to give advice at a national level to the Chief Coroner on issues concerning untoward death, to see whether patterns are emerging, standards are being adhered to, people are being appropriately trained, or whether serious difficulties are emerging while the new service is being put into place which need to be raised at a national level. One way to monitor that could be to table an amendment stating that the Chief Coroner should produce a report to your Lordships&#146; House and the other place after a few years to see how the service is operating. However, in educational terms we are much happier with continuous assessment than with periodic examinations. Therefore the idea of having a national medical adviser is that their constant and consistent responsibility would be to observe how this new service is developing and to bring advice to the Chief Coroner, Ministers or Parliament to say, &#147;This was a good idea but here are some flaws, hitches or problems&#148;.</p>

<a name="90623-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09062397000021"></a>We welcome the Government&#146;s move towards having medical advisers or examiners all around the country. However, we want them to be properly trained and qualified; they should be monitored and provide the required information; and there should be someone at the heart of things&#151;a national medical adviser&#151;to give advice to the Chief Coroner and to provide appropriate monitoring and supervision of medical advisers around the country. I beg to move.</p>

I completely concur with the need to stress training and agree that the exam should be the equivalent to licensing and incorporate revalidation.</p>

<a name="90623-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09062397000023"></a>There is a general welcome from medical examiners but there is a concern which we need to express. If they are part-time you may find that one is working in the morning and another in the afternoon; when there is a complex case perhaps only the coroners themselves&#151;who are, as now, on call 24/7&#151;would effectively provide the continuity required. Partly to get around that and partly because if you have a national service you need to set national standards, my amendments use the term &#147;Chief Medical Adviser&#148;. It is only the name that alters; however, one difference is that I have said that the chief medical adviser should be there to,</p>
<ul><a name="09062397000037"></a>&#147;monitor the performance of the medical examiners&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09062397000029"></a>because if there is to be consistency across the UK it will be important that their performance is managed from many aspects. I did not add that this person should be there also to advise the Chief Coroner, because that is tied up in the title. If you are an adviser, your role is to advise. It would be duplicative to call a person an adviser and then state that they provide advice.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1493"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1493</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90623-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09062397000024"></a>I have also suggested that whoever is the chief medical adviser needs to have more experience than that required of the medical examiners, which is why I have stipulated that the chief medical adviser should have been qualified for 10 years and have had seven years in practice.</p>

<a name="90623-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09062397000025"></a>I know from my very helpful discussions with the Minister before Committee that the Government are thinking of appointing two senior people&#151;one as a medical adviser to the Chief Coroner and another to oversee the medical examiners. If I am right, I understood that the medical examiners would be overseen by someone in the Department of Health, but that the person working directly with the Chief Coroner could be employed within the Ministry of Justice. I have a slight concern about having two people at the top of the system rather than having a more vertical structure. My preference would be to have one chief medical adviser with a deputy chief medical adviser who may be the person responsible for overseeing the standards of the medical examiners around the country; so there would be some career progression. The reason for my concern is that I am slightly worried that they could inadvertently give different messages. It would be no good for anyone if they did not get on and, therefore, gave different messages. A lot of the message-giving will relate to the way in which research is interpreted and the way in which new advances in examination techniques come along and the emphasis that is put on them.</p>

<a name="90623-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09062397000026"></a>We all know that someone who develops a new examination method in pathology can be very keen and slightly overegg the claim about how useful it will be. They do this in pursuit of the method&#146;s development&#151;not dishonestly but just because they are very keen. Therefore, it might be helpful to have someone right at the top who is able to temper whatever information comes in, and I concur with the suggestion from the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, that that person should have training and experience in forensic pathology.</p>

<a name="90623-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09062397000027"></a>Another reason for referring to this person in the Bill rather than simply in regulations is that he will need to have powers in order to deal with difficult situations. The medical examiners will be employees within the primary care trust. They will be dependent on having clear blue water between those employing them and the job that they have to do. That may include investigating and exposing poor clinical practice in their employers and therefore they will need some protection. If the chief medical adviser is referred to in the Bill and has statutory powers, that will build in a degree of protection which I fear may not be there if the appointment is made without being referred to in the Bill. That is why I have been pushing for this. It becomes particularly important in relation to possible prosecutions for corporate manslaughter and so on, which may be difficult to prove. Such cases may become very difficult and contentious, and those who give advice may require a lot of support in providing evidence to the inquest and to any subsequent proceedings. They may need to be represented by a very senior person&#151;the chief medical adviser. My concern is that, if we leave this matter to regulations and do not put something into the Bill, we may not provide sufficient

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09062399000002"></a>My own amendment in this group, Amendment 51, relates to the role of the Chief Coroner. It would leave out line 2 on page 11 of the Bill to the word &#147;must&#148; and insert &#147;The Chief Coroner&#148;, so that instead of:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="09062399000135"></a>&#147;Primary Care Trusts (in England) and Local Health Boards (in Wales)&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09062399000121"></a>it would simply read, &#147;The Chief Coroner&#148;,</p>
<ul><a name="09062399000150"></a>&#147;must appoint persons as medical examiners to discharge the functions conferred on medical examiners by or under this Chapter&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062399000122"></a>I think that it is a very straightforward amendment, which I hope will be immediately understood by the Committee.</p>

<a name="90623-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09062399000003"></a>During an earlier part of our proceedings, the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Bach, said that he had written to me about the recommendations of Dame Janet Smith, who chaired the Shipman inquiry. I am grateful for his letter, dated 9 June, in which he says that,</p>
<ul><a name="09062399000151"></a>&#147;whilst accepting the findings of the Inquiry, the Government has decided to adopt a different approach to reforming the coroner service than that recommended by Dame Janet Smith. For this reason, [it] is not possible to provide a figure regarding the exact number of recommendations responded to by legislation incorporated in the Bill&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062399000123"></a>Following that letter, yesterday the Minister answered a Question for Written Answer&#151;HL4220&#151;which I tabled last week on the same point concerning how many of the recommendations of the Shipman inquiry had been incorporated into the Bill. The Minister said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="09062399000136"></a>&#147;Other recommendations about coroners and death certification have been addressed by alternative means, including the framework within which services are delivered ... the Government are not convinced that the inquiry&#146;s recommendation for a centralised death investigation service is the most effective model. Our preference is for coroners and medical examiners to be based at a local level, and while there will be close links between the two on specific aspects of their work, we believe that they should not be part of an integrated organisational structure&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 22/6/09: cols. <I>WA 247-48</I><I>.</I>]</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09062399000004"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for being so straightforward in his reply but this highlights a fundamental disagreement between the approach the Government are adopting and that which Dame Janet Smith suggested in the Shipman inquiry. There is a fine line to be drawn between accepting the findings of an inquiry and not implementing all its recommendations. Although I accept that, or course, no Government are bound by an inquiry in advance to accept everything that it says, I think the Minister and I would agree that this extraordinary series of reports, the amazing, voluminous evidence that has been published, and these very thorough recommendations, are not something that any of us would dismiss lightly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09062399000005"></a>I think that what has been accepted and what has been rejected should be a matter of public record as we scrutinise a Bill that, as the Minister says,</p>
<ul><a name="09062399000152"></a>&#147;is the last piece of primary legislation required to implement the Government&#146;s wide-ranging programme of action in response to the recommendations of the Shipman inquiry&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062399000124"></a>It would be remiss of us not to detail where the differences lie.</p>

<a name="90623-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09062399000006"></a>When the Government say that they have been taking a different approach from Dame Janet and members of the Shipman inquiry, we do need to be clear what we are accepting and what we are rejecting. From the Minister&#146;s Written Answer, these can now be seen to be categorised into two parts. He said that in accepting parts of the inquiry a statutory duty was being laid,</p>
<ul><a name="09062399000153"></a>&#147;on doctors to report certain deaths to coroners, the appointment of a Chief Coroner, an appeals system, independent inspection, and independent medical examiners to scrutinise the certificates of cause of death of all deaths not reported to the coroner&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062399000125"></a>He went on to say in talking about the things that were being rejected:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="09062399000137"></a>&#147;Recommendations made by the Shipman inquiry into matters that are beyond the scope of coroners and death certification&#151;such as the control of drugs, complaints arrangements in health and social care, and medical regulation and revalidation&#151;are being taken forward by the Department of Health&#148;.&#151; [<I>Official Report</I>, 22/6/09: cols. <I>WA 247-48</I>.]</p>

<p><a name="09062399000126"></a>I should be particularly interested to hear from the Minister how precisely that is going to happen, whether it is going to be dealt with through legislation or through regulations, and how the House will be told about the progress of those issues that fall outside the scope of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90623-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09062399000007"></a>Amendment 51 highlights one of the main differences between the two approaches&#151;the Shipman inquiry approach and that of the Government in the Bill. It is Dame Janet&#146;s strongly held view that the English primary care trusts and the Welsh local health boards should not be the bodies to, as provided in Clause 19 of the Bill,</p>
<ul><a name="09062399000154"></a>&#147;appoint persons as medical examiners to discharge the functions conferred on medical examiners by or under this Chapter&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062399000127"></a>She believes, and I share her view, that the Chief Coroner would be best placed to do this. That is why I tabled Amendment 51. It straightforwardly transfers the tasks to the Chief Coroner from the PCTs and the local health boards.</p>

<a name="90623-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09062399000008"></a>I was particularly struck by Dame Janet&#146;s contention, based on her experience of the Shipman evidence, that local relationships can become &#147;too cosy&#148;. She says that there is a fundamental issue at stake here: the protection of independence. We must always guard against conflicts of interest and potentially incestuous relationships&#151;the &#147;Harold is one of us&#148; arguments: &#147;He plays at the same golf club. He is a member of the same circles, attends the same professional meetings, drinks in the same pub. He is a decent sort of fellow and we must all look after one another&#148;. That is a recipe for disaster.</p>

<a name="90623-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09062399000009"></a>I should like to dwell for a moment on the Third Report on the Shipman inquiry, which ran to more than 600 pages. Dame Janet spelt it out very clearly on page 3, paragraph 12. She said:</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90623-0007.htm"/>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="09062399000138"></a>&#147;The procedure for certifying the medical cause of death has remained virtually unchanged for over 75 years ... it has a number  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1496"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1496</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of disadvantages. The most serious of these is that it is dependent on the integrity and judgement of a single medical practitioner ... The fact that the system of certification of the cause of death depends on a single doctor does not give rise only to the risk of concealment of crime or other wrongdoing by that doctor. There may be occasions when a doctor knows that a death may have been caused or contributed to by some misconduct, lack of care or medical error on the part of a professional colleague. In those circumstances, it takes considerable courage and independence for a doctor (particularly a junior doctor) to refuse to certify a death, when s/he knows that, if s/he does refuse, the death will be subject to a coroner's investigation&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062399000128"></a>The point that is being made in the inquiry&#146;s report is that when relationships become too cosy, or when someone is at quite a junior level and part of a local circle, there may not be the kind of independence that is required to determine the sorts of events that were investigated by the Shipman team.</p>

<a name="90623-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09062399000010"></a>I was also very struck by the fact that the BMA, which is the only professional body fully to represent future medical examiners, has also raised concerns about Clause 19 in its briefing note. It says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="09062399000139"></a>&#147;The BMA has concerns about the independence of the medical examiner, given that the roles will be recruited for and managed by the Primary Care Trust or Local Health Board within which the post would be based ... we are still concerned that medical examiners could be subject to pressure or a conflict of interest under this arrangement&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062399000129"></a>It also highlights the failure to discuss this issue on Report in another place. In a sitting of the Public Bill Committee on 24 February, the Minister, Bridget Prentice, made a promise when she said that further details would be given of accountability and leadership arrangements. Perhaps the omission can be remedied today.</p>

<a name="90623-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09062399000011"></a>The BMA has pleaded for further discussions with the Government on issues such as terms and conditions, remuneration, recruitment, retention, training and accountability, and I hope that between now and Report the concerns which my noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, have identified today may also be properly addressed.</p>

<a name="90623-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09062399000012"></a>Dame Janet had the invidious job of sifting through evidence and listening to the witnesses detailed in hundreds of pages of evidence, but the fact that we were willing to set aside &#163;20 million of public money to enable this comprehensive review to be undertaken demonstrates Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s proper concern about this matter. It is therefore all the more frustrating and disappointing that we have not acted on some of the committee&#146;s recommendations in crucial respects. The need to place a cordon sanitaire around the appointments system and to place it in the hands of the Chief Coroner is a glaring example, and I hope that the Government will be willing to give this further thought.</p>

It is crucial that Clause 19 creates the new role of medical examiner, who will ensure the independent scrutiny and confirmation of medical certificates of the cause of death and will

<ul><a name="09062399000155"></a>&#147;current discrepancies in resources between different PCTs and LHBs, may lead to inconsistencies in resourcing medical examiners. Subsection (1) gives Primary Care Trusts ... in England and Local Health Boards ... in Wales the power to appoint medical examiners&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062399000130"></a>It is questionable whether this is the best arrangement, particularly for ensuring,</p>
<ul><a name="09062399000156"></a>&#147;the true independence of the system&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90623-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09062399000015"></a>As the Minister will be aware, the Justice Committee in another place pointed out that the role of the medical examiner requires,</p>
<ul><a name="09062399000157"></a>&#147;accountability between examiners and the new national medical advisor&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09062399000131"></a>whom it hopes to see appointed to the new Chief Coroner. The need for more direct access to medical expertise, via coroners, is accepted and, because of this, the Justice Committee suggested that it would be more appropriate for the medical examiners to be employed by the Ministry of Justice, or by the coroners&#146; service, than by the NHS. Will the Minister comment on that recommendation?</p>

<a name="90623-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09062399000016"></a>The role of these medical examiners must be monitored. A potential conflict could arise if PCTs or local health boards were to employ them because those bodies would be responsible not only for paying the medical examiner but also for monitoring performance, a role that I think is much better in the hands of the chief medical adviser to the Chief Coroner. For that reason too, an independent funding arrangement may be more suitable.</p>

<a name="90623-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09062399000017"></a>Clause 19(3) proposes that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="09062399000140"></a>&#147;A person may be appointed as a medical examiner only if, at the time of the appointment, he or she&#151;(a) is a registered medical practitioner and has been throughout the previous 5 years&#148;.</p>

<a name="90623-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09062399000018"></a>It is important to clarify the position with regard to registration because, from this year, doctors who are practising in any aspect of clinical medicine will require a licence to practise. Doctors who are retired may remain on the register and be registered medical practitioners but do not have a licence to practise. It is crucial that medical examiners must be individuals holding a licence to practise because they will have to undergo revalidation to demonstrate to the GMC on a regular basis that they remain up to date and fit to practise. It is therefore necessary that we should see details of the skill sets that medical examiners will have to demonstrate at an early stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09062399000019"></a>A number of clarifications are required from the Minister on these provisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09062399000021"></a>With great respect to those who are proposing the amendments, I do not think that in their present form they are of the necessary quality if we are seriously saying that there should be a national medical adviser to the Chief Coroner. The noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, uses the word &#147;may&#148; in his amendment:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="09062399000141"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State may appoint a person as the National Medical Adviser&#148;.</p>

<a name="90623-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09062399000022"></a>That conveys a lack of clarity and lack of necessity about the appointment. The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff, on the other hand, boldly, and I think quite rightly, says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="09062399000142"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State shall ... appoint&#148;.</p>

<a name="90623-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09062399000023"></a>With respect to the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, there is nothing in his amendment about the nature of the responsibilities. The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, however, says in subsection (1)(b) of her proposed new clause that, after consultation with the Lord Chancellor, regulations should be produced,</p>
<ul><a name="09062399000158"></a>&#147;concerning the responsibilities of the Chief Medical Advisor&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062399000132"></a>I would hope that before the Bill leaves this House an attempt will be made by those who are behind this proposal to draw up the basic responsibilities that one would expect the chief medical adviser to carry out.</p>

<a name="90623-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09062399000024"></a>The only specific that the noble Baroness mentions is in subsection (2)(c) of her proposed new clause, which states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="09062399000143"></a>&#147;The Chief Medical Advisor must ... monitor the performance&#148;.</p>

<a name="90623-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09062399000025"></a>That would no doubt lead to a report from time to time. However, that is not a chief advisory role. I hope that we will have a further and better definition of that.</p>

<a name="90623-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09062399000026"></a>The noble Baroness also referred to this officer&#146;s powers being important. If you are giving the officer powers, the place to find those should be in the primary legislation. She referred to prosecutions. Will this officer have some role in connection with that? Will the finger point to him at some stage of the prosecution? I am not at all clear about that.</p>

<a name="90623-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09062399000027"></a>I am anticipating that the amendments will not be pressed to a Division today. I may be wrong; I do not know what the Minister is going to say. I respectfully suggest to the proposers of the amendments that we should have a quite different and clearer text to look at and report on. We will then have a grip of who this new officer that we want to have in place is so that when the Bill goes back to the other place they will know what we are backing. At the moment, that is lacking.</p>

The ideal would be for the Government to be prepared to take over the idea of a national or a chief medical adviser and to use their facilities for drafting to insert the points put forward by the noble Lord and the noble Baroness. Among coroners, there are concerns about medical examiners being appointed by the local primary care trust. First, they may be perceived not to be independent. The second concern is the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, as to the difficulty sometimes in rather small areas with small primary care trusts where everyone is rather hugger-mugger. The perception is as important as the

Maybe they can be employed for other reasons by primary care trusts, but for the purpose of being a medical examiner, that should come under a different system.</p>

<p><a name="st_92"></a>
<a name="09062399000029"></a><b><a name="90623-0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09062399000172"></a>Lord Colwyn:</b> Noble Lords have stressed the importance of the medical examiners, who will ensure independent scrutiny and confirmation of medical certificates of the cause of death and provide general medical advice to the coroner. My simple amendment, Amendment 63A, requires medical examiners to liaise with the clinical governance teams in primary care trusts and local health boards to ensure that patterns or clusters of deaths are identified and shared with the relevant teams at local level. I should point out that my amendment does not say &#147;may&#148; or &#147;shall&#148;; it says &#147;must&#148;. I recognise that the Department of Health has indicated in other places that medical examiners will in practice forge close links with clinical governance teams. However, it is important for that to be explicitly reflected in the Bill, not least because it would send a strong message to the public that lessons from, for example, the Harold Shipman inquiry, to which the noble Lord, Lord Alton, referred extensively, have been learnt.</p>

<a name="90623-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09062399000030"></a>It would also show an absolute commitment by everyone involved in this area that problems will be identified and lessons learnt from deaths where that is possible. Further, this amendment will clarify the scope of the responsibility medical examiners will have in relation to clinical governance.</p>

As the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, has already indicated, this is so important because there is concern that the impartiality of an examiner appointed by the primary care trust may be seen as compromised in a situation where the death was caused by failings within the trust itself, through medical negligence or for other reasons.</p>

<a name="90623-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09062399000032"></a>One might have thought that the Government would be sympathetic to this position in the light of the charter for the bereaved. It is a relatively simple change to make, which nevertheless will command more confidence in the system. The creation of the post of Chief Coroner would seem an ideal opportunity to transfer the power of appointment to a demonstrably independent figure.</p>

I think that other noble Lords have agreed with him on that. I say straightaway that the amendments would be acceptable had the Government chosen a model or system of coroner and death certification reform which had led to the introduction of a unified death investigation service. But, in fact, such amendments would not have been required as they would have been important parts of the policy and therefore already reflected in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90623-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09062399000038"></a>However, those of you who studied the 2006 draft Coroners Bill will know that, although the Government very carefully considered this recommendation made in broad terms by two parallel independent inquiries, our preferred approach is to have two independent services with close and clear links between the two. It is in that context that my reply will continue on the basis of considering each of the amendments.</p>

<a name="90623-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09062399000039"></a>I understand that the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, and the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, want to increase the accountability for medical examiners. The amendments provide for the appointment of a statutory national medical adviser to the Chief Coroner as a way to achieve this. In doing so, the amendments seek to confer on the national medical adviser the power to make regulations on the training of medical examiners and to set down minimum standards as to the service which should be provided by medical examiners. In effect, they provide the national medical adviser with a leadership role in relation to medical examiners.</p>

<a name="90623-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09062399000040"></a>We do not believe that the medical adviser to the Chief Coroner is the appropriate person to undertake that role. That is because the Chief Coroner will have jurisdiction only for deaths which are violent, unnatural, in custody or other state detention, or from unknown causes. Like senior coroners, the Chief Coroner will have no responsibility over natural deaths unless they have occurred in custody or other state detention. It follows that the remit of the medical adviser to the Chief Coroner should not stray into the generality of deaths except to the extent that I will describe shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09062399000041"></a>The national medical adviser, who we believe should be appointed on a non-statutory basis along with the other staff to support the work of the Chief Coroner&#151;it is not suggested that they should be in the Bill&#151;will advise the Chief Coroner on policy and practice in relation to post-mortems, on issues relating to the prompt release of bodies for funerals and related issues about the retention of organs and tissues, including

We also envisage that another role for the national medical adviser will be to develop training for coroners and coroners&#146; officers on medical issues, and to advise the Chief Coroner on medical aspects of appeals by interested persons.</p>

<a name="90623-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09062399000042"></a>In relation to medical examiners, it is intended that the national medical adviser will be involved in agreeing job descriptions, agreeing protocols setting out the scrutiny that medical examiners must complete, how they interact with coroners and agreeing the curriculum for the training they require. He or she will also be involved in resolving any disputes which arise between coroners and medical examiners about a conflict of views in particular cases. The Department of Health intends to bring forward secondary legislation on these matters, as set out in Clauses 19 and 20, and the role of the national medical adviser in relation to medical examiners will be better, more fully defined there.</p>

<a name="90623-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09062399000043"></a>Amendment 63A, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Colwyn, requires that medical examiners must work with clinical governance teams in primary care trusts and local health wards to establish whether patterns of deaths give cause for concern. We agree that this aspect of the work of medical examiners is vital. The Department of Health has made clear in its consultation on improving the process of death certification, and in response to the consultation itself, that this will be one of the main responsibilities of medical examiners. As such, this responsibility will be set out by the Department of Health in secondary legislation brought forward under Clause 19. I hope that goes some way towards satisfying the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="90623-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09062399000044"></a>Amendments 51 and 53, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Alton, would give the Chief Coroner responsibility for the appointment, resourcing and monitoring of medical examiners. Given the model that we have adopted&#151;we know it is not the model preferred by a number of noble Lords&#151;and the role that we envisage for the Chief Coroner, we are not persuaded that he or she is the appropriate person to appoint and oversee the work of medical examiners. As I have said, the Chief Coroner will be responsible only for deaths referred to coroners, not for the totality of deaths, whether from natural causes or otherwise. I hope the Committee will accept our reform model and agree that it is much more appropriate for Health Ministers to identify and appoint a leader for the medical examiner system.</p>

<a name="90623-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09062399000045"></a>Amendment 50, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, has similarities to the ones to which I have just referred. It suggests that the Chief Coroner should appoint the medical examiners but that this should be in consultation with primary care trusts and local health boards. Once again I emphasise that the Chief Coroner will be appointed for his or her qualities and skills for leading the coroner system in England and Wales for deaths which are not considered natural, not for the scrutiny of certificates of causes of death where the death is entirely uncontentious; that will be the role of the medical examiner.</p>

<a name="90623-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09062399000046"></a>I come back to Amendment 49, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, which would require the Chief Coroner also to appoint the national medical adviser, with the requirement that he or she should be  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1502"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1502</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>an experienced forensic pathologist. We consider that it would be unduly restrictive to require the national medical adviser to be a forensic pathologist. Of course a forensic pathologist might be suitable for the position, but coroners deal with a broad range of types and causes of death. A registered medical practitioner with experience of treating or diagnosing industrial diseases might also have useful skills to bring to the role of the national medical adviser. We believe that the skills and experience required for the role of national medical adviser to the Chief Coroner is best left to the Chief Coroner to decide and should not be unduly constrained by the Bill.</p>

<a name="90623-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09062399000047"></a>Amendment 55 seeks to remove the requirement for primary care trusts and local health boards to monitor the performance of medical examiners, to ensure that they meet appropriate standards or required levels of performance. We understand that what the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, intends is to distance medical examiners from the trusts and boards which appoint them. Of course, as other noble Lords have stressed, it is vital that the public can be confident that medical examiners will carry out independent scrutiny, which includes the requirement in the Bill that trusts and boards have no role in the way that medical examiners exercise their professional judgment. Medical examiners will also need to be sensitive to the needs of the bereaved and provide an effective and responsive service to the communities in which they work. Requiring medical examiners to be accountable to trusts and boards for the standard of service they provide is not incompatible with the need for medical examiners to be independent in the way they use their professional judgment to scrutinise cause of death.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09062399000048"></a>Amendments 48 and 57 to 63, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, seek to create a statutory post of chief medical adviser. As she explained, the intention is to provide leadership for the new cadre of medical examiners. The Department of Health is currently considering the whole issue of clinical leadership for medical examiners with key stakeholders. Clearly there are a number of options for ensuring appropriate accountability and leadership arrangements, including the appointment of a chief medical examiner or adviser. However, in our view, it is not necessary for it to be a statutory role and that this position is consistent with the approach taken by the Department of Health in appointing national clinical directors; for example, the national director for heart disease and stroke and the national cancer director. I hope to provide further details of these arrangements while the Bill is still going through Parliament.</p>

Again, we are not persuaded this needs to be in the Bill, as regulations made under Clause 19(4)(c) will specify the training which medical examiners must have successfully completed prior to their appointment and the ongoing training that they will need to undertake during the term of their appointment. A detailed medical examiner training curriculum has been developed by an intercollegiate group established by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges. The group is being led on the academy&#146;s behalf by Professor Peter Furness, who is president of the Royal College of Pathologists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09062399000051"></a>As I said, we will expect the Chief Coroner to consult his or her non-statutory national medical adviser as well as the head of the medical examiner service, both throughout the year and when preparing the annual report. This is bound to happen given the national medical adviser&#146;s role in supporting the Chief Coroner on the medical aspects of coroners&#146; cases, as well as in the training of coroners and officers on those issues. The consultation will enable the Chief Coroner to provide the Lord Chancellor with a pertinent report covering the key issues in the coroners&#146; system over the previous year. However, we believe that the precise nature of the consultation with the national medical adviser should be left to the discretion of the Chief Coroner.</p>

It is important to recognise that the licence will be introduced this year.</p>

I was, and continue to be, somewhat puzzled by the argument from the Government, which was used in the other place as well. They said there are lots of people who are helpful to the coroners and therefore there is no reason to single out medical examiners or to have a chief medical examiner or chief medical adviser. There is a whole section in the Bill on medical examiners, there is not a whole section in the Bill in respect of all sorts of other people that may be helpful to the coroner, and for a very good reason, because we are talking about medical certification of death. It seems

<a name="90623-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09062399000055"></a>Therefore I am very grateful indeed to the Minister for indicating that his mind is not entirely closed to the possibility that it might be in the Bill. I have no doubt that if it is possible for us to have some discussions outside the Committee that we will attend to many of the inadequacies of framing which were rightly raised by the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, and the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss. The importance of these amendments is to make the point about what needs to be done and it seems to me that has been made. I welcome the opportunity for further discussions, for without that there can be no question that something will come forward at a later stage and be pressed. This is a centrally important question for a whole series of reasons.</p>

<a name="90623-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09062399000056"></a>There is a clearly a matter of substantial contention, and I and my colleagues share the view which has been put forward by a number of noble Lords, that a centralised service separate from PCTs provides a degree of independence, independence as perceived by the community&#151;as the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, has said&#151;but also independence in fact, because there is in that case much less likelihood of a conflict of interest. That is a serious matter should medical practitioners find themselves in that position, or in terms of how the community perceives it. There is a clearly a diversity of views in regard to this. The Government hold to their particular view and others, including us, hold to a different view as to what the service should be, so I have no doubt we will return to that matter as well.</p>

<a name="90623-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09062399000057"></a>With regard to the position of chief medical adviser or national medical adviser being filled by a forensic pathologist, I would not hold absolutely to that. However, I did find the Minister&#146;s response less than reassuring that actually someone who had an interest in industrial diseases might be able to advise suitably on the whole range of things that a national medical examiner would be able to advise the Chief Coroner on. It does not seem to me that that is a very reassuring response, and whether or not the qualifications should be in the Bill, we will think further about that and return to it.</p>

<a name="90623-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09062399000058"></a>However on the question of appropriate standards, qualifications and courses, I hear what the Minister says about those being properly cited in the secondary legislation and we will study what the Minister said and return to that. With those remarks and that undertaking of further discussion on these important amendments and clauses, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

This amendment is pertinent to the creation of what I believe we might be now calling a national medical adviser, if we do get to that point. The need to have work indemnity has become more important within our society. I will let my noble and learned friend Lady Butler-Sloss speak a little bit about indemnity of the coroners as she is leading on that amendment, but certainly for the medical examiners and for the chief medical adviser, indemnity will be particularly important, and it is something which needs to be clarified&#151;it needs to be crystal clear.</p>

<a name="90623-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09062399000060"></a>In the Minister&#146;s summing up on the previous group of amendments, he reminded the Committee that the coroner has no responsibility over natural death. In a way, that is exactly the problem, which is defining where the responsibility begins and ends. While a death may be unnatural, it is only after investigation that it is demonstrated to be natural, and similarly a death which is assumed to be unnatural may then during investigation be found to actually have had a natural cause.</p>

<a name="90623-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09062399000061"></a>It strikes me that within this system, and with the charter for the bereaved&#151;which I do not dispute at all, and I think everyone welcomes and commends the Government on it&#151;that there will be increasing room for certainly complaint, if not more. At the moment, as I understand it, those working as medical examiners should be indemnified by their PCT if their PCT is their employing body, but that has not been explicitly clarified. We know that indemnity by the PCT for routine medical work is in fact inadequate. Doctors are advised to have their own medical defence cover over and above the indemnity provided by the PCT or the trust, because the indemnity does not cover very much, but it is essential that it is there from whoever  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1506"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1506</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>employs them. Of course if the medical examiners were to be transferred, as suggested in the previous group of amendments, to come under the separate employment line and answerability to the Chief Coroner, then the indemnity issue would be through the Chief Coroner, but it would not go away.</p>

<a name="90623-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09062399000062"></a>The new clause for indemnity for medical examiners and for the chief medical adviser to the Chief Coroner is there specifically to clarify first that indemnity will be provided by the PCT for the medical examiners that are in the Bill, and secondly by whoever turns out to be the employer of the probable national medical adviser. So the title of this proposed new clause is wrong and would need to be amended anyway because there is more work to be done outside Committee in clarifying who does what. Similarly another amendment in this grouping relates to expenses and it is important to know who is responsible for paying expenses for those people when they incur expenses in the course of their work.

I shall speak also to Amendments 77ZA and 114A. As a former assistant deputy coroner in the Princess Diana inquest, I was judicially reviewed, successfully. My expenses were covered under Section 104 of the Access to Justice Act 1999, which inserted a new section into the Coroners Act 1988.</p>

<a name="90623-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09062399000064"></a>Coroners have shown me that there is nothing in the present Bill that replicates Section 104 of that Act, so Amendment 77ZA does just that. Its purpose is to replicate the existing indemnity enjoyed by coroners, who are extremely concerned, particularly with regard to judicial review, which is not all that unusual in the increasingly litigious age in which we live, and the possibility of some appeals outside the appellate process and on to either judicial review or the Court of Appeal. It is important that this should be in primary legislation. I doubt that it would be satisfactorily dealt with in subsidiary legislation, and currently there is nothing to show that coroners will actually be protected.</p>

<a name="90623-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09062399000065"></a>I am sure that the Minister knows, having been at the Bar, that judicial review is very expensive. I would have been extremely concerned if I had found myself having to face the costs, with four leaders in my particular review, of having lost in the Administrative Court. The loss was on the basis of incorrectly applying the law, as I was told, so this is a matter of law, not a matter of a coroner necessarily going wrong in the ordinary way of dealing with his duties as a coroner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09062399000066"></a>Amendment 114A would allow to the Chief Coroner and the deputy chief coroners exactly the same indemnity as coroners have at present&#151;I hope that the Minister will see the appropriateness of coroners having it&#151;in which case it would be necessary, for certain acts carried out by the Chief Coroner and deputy chief coroners, that they should also be indemnified. I hope that the Government will listen to these necessary protections for those carrying out an important part of the administration of justice.</p>

They relate to the issue of coroners&#146; expenses. The Bill replicates the current circumstances, where it is the coroner&#146;s responsibility subsequently to claim for paying jurors, witnesses and so on, and for other expenses. The indication that colleagues have had is that this has put some coroners in the somewhat invidious position of being required to take on personal liability, sometimes of a substantial order, for the facilitation of inquests. An example given was stenography being required for a particular trial. As I understand it, we do not place judges in this kind of position, and I am puzzled by why we do so to coroners, if that is indeed the case.</p>

<a name="90623-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09062399000068"></a>The question of indemnity in respect of judicial review has already been extensively and appropriately spoken to. I understand the wish of the Government, although not all of us agree, that matters should be held at a local authority level. If that is the case, though, we would find it helpful that the local authority was identified as the appropriate place to bill rather than the coroners themselves. Whether or not these amendments satisfactorily address the question, we look for a response from the Government in that regard.</p>

<p><a name="st_104"></a>
<a name="09062399000069"></a><b><a name="90623-0008.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09062399000184"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b> We believe that Schedule 6 sets out a clear yet flexible structure for paying allowances to jurors, witnesses, pathologists, coroners and others who claim. Similar amendments to these were tabled in the other place. In response, my ministerial colleague, Bridget Prentice, gave an understanding to take a fresh look at these provisions in the Bill. We have reflected carefully on the argument in support of the amendments, but our conclusion is that they would remove the current flexibility for paying allowances that coroners and local authorities, as well as the Government, wish to retain.</p>

<a name="90623-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09062399000070"></a>Amendments 102, 104, 106 and 107 would dictate that the relevant local authority must pay allowances to jurors, witnesses and others on behalf of a senior coroner and would prevent the coroner from doing so themselves from, for example, a delegated project. This restriction in the Bill would be of no benefit to the system, as it may evolve in the future.</p>

<a name="90623-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09062399000071"></a>I reassure the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, that coroners will not have to fund allowances and expenses out of their own pockets. It is already implicit in the schedule that a local authority will ultimately fund allowances, given that the relevant local authority funds its local coroner. Regulations under paragraph 9 will provide for a coroner who has incurred expenses to be reimbursed.</p>

<a name="90623-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09062399000072"></a>In the majority of areas the local authority already makes payments directly, but in a small number of others the local authority and coroner prefer the coroner to make payments that the local authority then reimburses. The schedule gives flexibility for these existing arrangements to continue, and allows payments to be made either by the senior coroner or by the authority on his or her behalf. Schedule 6 was drafted in that way following representations from some members of the Coroners&#146; Society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09062399000073"></a>The cumulative effect of these amendments would be to remove the ability for coroners and their staff to pay allowances. That would be unnecessarily restrictive,

<a name="90623-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09062399000074"></a>Amendment 109, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, deals with the expenses of medical examiners and the proposed chief medical adviser. We have already debated the merits of having a statutory chief medical adviser, so I do not propose to comment on that aspect of the amendment. On medical examiners&#146; expenses, I am happy to reassure the noble Baroness that Clause 19(4)(b) already provides for regulations to be made for paying medical examiners&#146; salaries, expenses, fees, compensation, pensions and other allowances.</p>

<a name="90623-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09062399000075"></a>I turn to the three amendments that deal with the issue of indemnity. Amendments 77ZA and 114A would indemnify coroners, the Chief Coroner and deputy chief coroners against any costs that they incur when carrying out their duties, against damages awarded against them or costs they are ordered to pay, and against any sums that they are ordered to pay as part of a reasonable settlement. Amendment 63B would similarly indemnify medical examiners. I will put to one side the issue of the chief medical adviser, which we have already debated.</p>

<a name="90623-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09062399000076"></a>Paragraphs (1) to (3) in Amendment 77ZA replicate the wording of Section 27A of the Coroners Act 1988, which states that coroners are indemnified by the local council. Similarly, Amendment 114A replicates the wording of a subsection of the 1988 Act, but applies the indemnity to the Chief Coroner and deputy chief coroners. Amendment 63B applies that wording to medical examiners.</p>

<a name="90623-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09062399000077"></a>The noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, is concerned that the Bill does not provide for coroners to be indemnified, which could make them liable to pay out of their own pockets any costs arising from legal proceedings. In addition, I understand her concern that the Chief Coroner and his or her deputies may also find themselves out of pocket, with no indemnity. The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, has similar concerns with regard to medical examiners. I reassure the noble Baronesses that that is not the case. Under the Bill, coroners will continue to be indemnified by the local authorities that appoint them. Any costs, including damages or sums payable by way of settlement incurred by the Chief Coroner and deputy chief coroners will be expenses which will be met by my department. I will briefly explain how the Bill provides for this.</p>

<a name="90623-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09062399000078"></a>Starting with senior coroners, area coroners and assistant coroners, paragraph 9 of Schedule 6 to the Bill provides for regulations on meeting or reimbursing coroners&#146; expenses. We will consult on draft regulations in due course, but we intend that they will cover indemnities by replicating the effect of Section 27A of the 1988 Act.</p>

<a name="90623-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09062399000079"></a>We see the expenses cited in paragraph 9 of Schedule 6 as covering not only miscellaneous monies which senior coroners have to pay out in the normal course of carrying out their duties, but also the cost to coroners of defending any claim brought in litigation, or of paying any damages or costs ordered to be paid if they lose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09062399000080"></a>Indemnifying the Chief Coroner and deputy chief coroners, paragraphs 5 and 6 of Schedule 7 provide for the Lord Chancellor to pay the Chief Coroner and his or her deputies remuneration, expenses and allowances. For these purposes, expenses will again include costs incurred when defending any claim brought in litigation and costs or damages ordered to be paid by them.</p>

<a name="90623-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09062399000081"></a>Moving next to indemnifying medical examiners, Clause 19(4)(b) allows the Secretary of State and the Welsh Ministers to make regulations for paying medical examiners expenses and other allowances. This would include reimbursing the cost to medical examiners of defending themselves in any litigation, and the payment of costs awarded against them as a result of such litigation, if such actions are brought personally against a medical examiner in respect of his work in that capacity.</p>

<a name="90623-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09062399000082"></a>In view of these explanations and assurances, I hope that the noble Baroness will agree to withdraw her amendment.</p>

That seems to me to be something that is quite separate from costs or damages. If I had been construing this in a court and was told that expenses covered this, I would have had my doubts. That is what made me raise this matter by way of amendment. Of course I read paragraph 9 of Schedule 6, and I am delighted about expenses, but I have my doubts. It may be that it is okay. It may be that &#147;expenses&#148; will be all right in regulations, but there is a question about ultra vires; are you able, under regulations, to treat costs and damages as coming within expenses in the primary legislation? I could see a question as to whether it was actually ultra vires, so I remain extremely concerned about the wording.</p>

I fail to understand how expenses, which is a very charged word at the moment, can include indemnity for litigation costs incurred in defending litigation. I note that my noble and learned friend Lady Butler-Sloss has already questioned this. I have had conversations with coroners separately who are extremely concerned that the Coroners Act, which currently provides indemnity on the face of the Bill, will be superseded by this Act, where there is not that degree of clarity. I understand their concern. I do not feel greatly reassured. I wonder, as a non-lawyer, whether we could get around this by a very simple insertion to say that it includes costs incurred in defending in litigation for work undertaken in the course of their duty, or something along those lines. That is not for us to do tonight, but I am convinced that we will return to this. In the mean time&#151;</p>

These two amendments need to be read together. The effect of Amendment 64 would be to make an alteration in line 4, page 12, leaving out the word &#147;may&#148; and instead inserting the words,</p>
<ul><a name="09062399000160"></a>&#147;will, having consulted the Chief Coroner&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062399000133"></a>As it presently stands the Bill says that the Secretary of State,</p>
<ul><a name="09062399000161"></a>&#147;may by regulations make the following provision in relation to a death that is required to be registered under Part 2 of the 1953 Act&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062399000134"></a>It then goes on to list a considerable number of provisions. My amendment would require the involvement of the Chief Coroner.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="09062399000148"></a>Amendment 66 would make an addition at page 13, line 19, by inserting the words:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="09062399000149"></a>&#147;An attending practitioner's certificate prepared under subsection (1)(a)(i) will replace the existing separate certificates issued for Cremation and Burial under the Cremation Acts 1902 (c. 1) and 1952 (c. 31), and the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953 (c. 20) respectively&#148;.</p>

<a name="90623-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09062399000093"></a>Current arrangements for death certificates reach back to the 1800s and there has been little change since 1935. The Shipman inquiry stated that the existing arrangements for certification were confusing and provided inadequate safeguards for the public. That is a view with which Tom Luce&#151;who chaired the fundamental review of death certification and the coroner service in England and Wales&#151;concurred. I was surprised when looking at the death certificates that are currently in use to see how long ago it was since we made any fundamental change to the death certification process. The certificates authorising cremation were given statutory standing in 1902 and 1952 and the burial certificates were prescribed by the Deaths and Births Registration Act 1953, with regulations following in 1987.</p>

<a name="90623-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09062399000094"></a>There is, I think, broad consensus and support for the general thrust of the Government's intentions to reform the system of certification, and I certainly welcome that. I note that the British Medical Association has, for instance, given a guarded welcome, although it does raise two questions that perhaps deserve a response from the Minister today. It says that it would like to see the introduction of short death certificates alongside the medical certificate of cause of death as proposed by the 2002 Office for National Statistics report, <I>Civil Registration: Vital Change: Birth, Marriage and Death Registration in the 21st Century</I>. It also argues that the right to confidentiality extends beyond death and that the bereaved should have the option of withholding the cause of death when disclosure is not required. Although it may be necessary&#151;for instance, as a requirement stipulated by an insurance company&#151;to know the cause of death, or, as we debated earlier in Committee, for statistical information vital to the construction of public health policy to include cause of death, we have to accept that it can also be distressing to relatives to be required to disclose sensitive information to organisations such as utility companies for which it is not necessary to have access to that information. I think that these are reasonable concerns which the BMA has raised and which we should ponder on. I wonder whether the Minister, with his usual alacrity, sees a way through that dilemma. I should be grateful to him for his response on those important points.</p>

<a name="90623-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09062399000095"></a>I would also be grateful if the Minister will tell us about the funding of the PCTs and the local health boards which will be required to make available to medical examiners the disclosure of their functions and whether we are satisfied that there will be adequate funds to deal with the changes to the certification process.</p>

<a name="90623-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09062399000096"></a>If we were able to accept the two amendments tabled today, it would abolish the two certificates currently in use and open the way to the introduction of the sort of streamlined procedures advocated by Dame Janet Smith in the Shipman inquiry. Indeed, she has produced a prototype form, copies of which I have here in the Chamber and which can be found in Appendix G of the third report of the Shipman inquiry at page 563. She believes that these integrated forms would overcome the weaknesses in the present system of certification which were identified in her inquiry. At Appendix M, pages 611 to 615, she sets out the details of how the new death certification would work in practice. It is indeed those proposals that are incorporated in these amendments. At the very outset of her report, on page 3&#151;I referred to this earlier&#151;she talks about the disadvantages of the present system. At the very minimum, I hope the Minister will agree that a pilot scheme trial-running Dame Janet's proposed system of certification might well be in order. My amendments would pave the way for the introduction of such certification and replace it&#151;if I may be mildly critical of the half-hearted wording in the Bill, which simply suggests that the Secretary of State &#147;may&#148; proceed, a point which was referred to by my noble friend Lord Neill of Bladen in another context earlier today&#151;with new certification and a duty on the Chief Coroner to get on with it.</p>

<a name="90623-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09062399000097"></a>What possible justification can there be in reserving this question to the Secretary of State? Surely this is a classic example of something that should be devolved through subsidiarity, in this case to the new Chief Coroner whom we are appointing in this legislation and whose duties should clearly include the production of new certification. We should trust him to get on with that, and mandate him to get on with it. That is the substance of my amendments. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_114"></a>
<a name="09062399000098"></a><b><a name="90623-0009.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09062399000194"></a>Baroness Finlay of Llandaff:</b> My noble friend Lord Alton of Liverpool has explained the background to the first amendments in this group. I should like to focus on the amendment that is solely in my name, Amendment 72A, and explain the thinking behind it. It may not be correctly worded but I hope that we can make some progress on the principle behind it and end up with a short death certificate, or possibly a series of two that are fit for purpose.</p>

<a name="90623-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09062399000099"></a>The first instance, referred to in paragraph (a) of the amendment, covers cases where such certificates are needed,</p>
<ul><a name="09062399000162"></a>&#147;to confirm that death has occurred prior to the full death certificate being provided&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90623-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09062399000100"></a>That is meant to deal specifically with brain-stem death. When somebody is diagnosed brain-stem dead, the diagnosis is made on the basis of brain-stem-death testing conducted by two doctors according to a clear protocol. The doctors usually, though not always, conduct the tests with a time gap in between, and they usually, though not always, witness each other's testing.  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1513"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1513</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>However, the family is told that the time of death is the time of the second brain-stem-death test occurring. That is the time when the person is stated to have died. However, their heart may continue to beat and they may continue to be ventilated.</p>

<a name="90623-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09062399000101"></a>It is in such situations that the family is approached about becoming an organ-donor family. For the family, the whole situation is incredibly distressing. It is very difficult for them to believe that the pink, well-perfused, warm body in front of them is indeed dead, particularly when they see the chest rise and fall, there is still a pulse, and so on. However, the person is already brain-stem dead. He is irreversibly dead.</p>

<a name="90623-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09062399000102"></a>Some intensive care units issue their own certificates to such families to help them understand that the person is brain-stem dead and to help them cope with the subsequent process of organ donation. I have tabled the amendment to try to standardise the format of that certificate and to improve practice. Sadly, there are some families who have declined to donate organs because they had not understood that the person was dead. Indeed, I know of one instance, which to my shame occurred in Wales, in which a consultant whom I know gave the family inappropriate information about the child. The family believed that the child would not be certified dead until after the organs had been harvested. It was a disaster and the family understandably declined to donate organs.</p>

<a name="90623-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09062399000103"></a>The amendment would therefore clarify for the public the point at which death has occurred. It would give them a piece of paper with force in law which states that that was the time of death. After that the organs can be harvested from either a heart-beating or a non-heart-beating donor.</p>

<a name="90623-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09062399000104"></a>The second situation, dealt with in paragraph (b) of the amendment, is quite different. I fully accept that it is possible that I should not have dealt with both situations in one amendment and that it might be better if they were dealt with in regulation and secondary legislation rather than in the Bill. However, this provision deals with the situation, which has already been alluded to, where there has been a death, particularly in a small community, which the family understandably do not want all and sundry to know about, especially when they have to contact utility companies and so on. Perhaps there is a hereditary illness of which others in the family have not been informed. Indeed, the death may have come as such a shock that they are not ready to cope with the implications for themselves and their own children. It may be a death of which they are deeply ashamed; it may involve suicide, drug addiction, alcoholism and so on. It is not necessary for utility companies to know why someone has died, but it is necessary for them&#151;and for housing authorities and so on&#151;to know that someone is dead. That is the purpose of having a short death certificate. It would afford a degree of privacy to the person who has died when the cause of their death does not need to be known for the legal purposes following death. I hope that that clarifies the situation that I am trying to achieve with the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09062399000106"></a>In another place, my honourable friend Mr Henry Bellingham raised the case of a constituent whose relative died. The original certificate recorded the cause of death as &#147;not ascertained&#148;&#151;it was not possible to say at that point how death had occurred. When later it emerged that the person had been unlawfully killed, the certificate could not be changed&#151;all that could be done was to make a note in the margin. Plainly, this was very distressing for the family. I accept that our amendment is wide. However, it is intended to cover a wide set of circumstances. It has the merit of being helpful for the bereaved, and would do away with unhelpful and overbureaucratic rules.</p>

<p><a name="st_116"></a>
<a name="09062399000107"></a><b><a name="90623-0009.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09062399000196"></a>Lord Bach:</b> Amendment 67 in this group is a technical government amendment designed to avoid any unnecessary requirement to make regulations under the Cremation Act 1902. The medical examiner system will replace the system of certifying cremations in the statutory forms set out in the schedule to the Cremation (England and Wales) Regulations 2008. Currently, the doctor who attended the deceased and an independent doctor complete these forms, which are checked by a medical referee at the crematorium before cremation can be authorised. The medical referee&#146;s role will be replaced by that of a medical examiner appointed under Clause 19. Therefore, the bulk of the current regulatory framework will be replaced. It is important, however, that the regulation-making powers contained in other legislation, including the Bill, do not have the unintended consequence of retaining what would clearly be superfluous regulation. In due course, I will move a government amendment on this matter.</p>

<a name="90623-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09062399000108"></a>I turn to the other amendments so ably moved in this group. Amendment 64, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Alton, requires the Secretary of State to consult with the Chief Coroner on the regulations set out in Clause 20 that relate to the work of medical examiners. Our thinking in relation to the noble Lord&#146;s amendment is that it is not necessary to set out in the Bill a specific requirement for consultation. I assure the noble Lord that the Department of Health intends to consult widely on the secondary legislation required to implement the new death certification regime. I certainly expect the Chief Coroner, once appointed, to be among those who would be consulted about regulations made under this clause. Equally, there will be other important stakeholders whom it would be appropriate to consult. We do not consider it necessary or appropriate to single out the Chief Coroner as a statutory consultee.</p>

<a name="90623-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09062399000109"></a>Amendment 65, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, introduces a general and open provision enabling an attending practitioner to issue a fresh attending practitioner certificate to replace the one he or she first issued. An attending practitioner must certify the cause of death to the best of his or her knowledge and belief at the time of death. If unable to do so, or there are reasons for further investigation of the death, he or she will have a duty under regulations made in Clause 18 to report the death to a senior coroner without completing a certificate.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1515"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1515</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90623-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09062399000110"></a>Under the provisions of Clause 20, a completed attending practitioner&#146;s certificate will be scrutinised by a medical examiner before the death can be registered and documents can be issued allowing a funeral to take place. Errors, omissions or concerns about the accuracy of the information recorded on an attending practitioner&#146;s certificate will come to light either when a medical examiner reviews the certificate and speaks to relatives of the deceased about the cause of death, or when a relative is interviewed by a registrar before the death is registered. For this reason, subsection (1)(c) of Clause 20 provides for either a medical examiner or a registrar to invite an attending practitioner to issue a fresh certificate. We think that this is preferable to a situation where the attending practitioner can change the certificate unilaterally if there is a change in circumstances.</p>

<a name="90623-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09062399000111"></a>I turn to Amendment 66, the second amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Alton. Under the provisions set out in Clause 20, a medical examiner will scrutinise and confirm the cause of death stated on an attending practitioner&#146;s certificate. This requirement will be applicable to all deaths that are not subject to a coroner&#146;s investigation, regardless of the form of disposal. For this reason, a number of cremation forms currently issued under the Cremation Regulations 2008 will cease to be used. However, the certificate issued by a registrar under the Birth and Deaths Registration Act 1953, following registration of a death and prior to disposal, is being retained for a purpose under the proposed arrangements. This is because registration provides an opportunity for relatives to raise with an independent official any issues that might require investigation before a funeral takes place, and which, for whatever reason, were not brought to the attention of a medical examiner. We propose to retain this important additional safeguard at the request of stakeholders, including registrars and the Coroners&#146; Society. That is why we cannot accept that aspect of the noble Lord&#146;s amendment.</p>

<a name="90623-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09062399000112"></a>The noble Lord asked about funding the medical examination service. The medical checks currently required before cremation cost families an estimated &#163;45 million per year. The effectiveness of these checks, which are not subject to robust quality assurance, has rightly been criticised by a number of public inquiries, including the Shipman inquiry. Our preferred option for funding the proposed new system of death certification is a single fee for certification of all deaths, irrespective of whether death is followed by burial or cremation. The fee would replace the existing cremation fee of &#163;160.50. As cremation accounts for some 70 per cent of disposals, most bereaved families would pay less under the new system.</p>

<a name="90623-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09062399000113"></a>I turn finally to Amendment 72A, an important amendment that has been debated. This would introduce short death certificates, to be issued in addition to full death certificates. The first type of short certificate is intended to speed up the possibility of organ transplantation after death by confirming that life is extinct. The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, gave us an example of that. The organs could be removed as soon as possible in this instance. The second type of certificate would be a basic death certificate for families to use  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1516"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1516</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>when dealing with administrative matters such as closing bank accounts after a person&#146;s death. The amendment is intended to prevent upsetting the family and executors further by revealing to others the cause of death, which might have a stigma attached to it as far as the relatives are concerned.</p>

<a name="90623-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09062399000114"></a>We sympathise with the aims of the amendment, and I assure the noble Baroness that it remains our intention to make provision for short death certificates in future; but we need to prioritise. Amendments to the Births and Deaths Registration Act included in the Bill have been limited to those that are consequential to the changes to the coroner system and the new death certification provisions. These are major reforms, and there are dangers in attempting to do too much at once&#151;not least because the introduction of short death certificates would require IT changes, which, as I have indicated, would need to be prioritised against the other changes that we are making to the death certification procedures. We will, however, keep the position under review.</p>

<a name="90623-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="09062399000115"></a>The noble Baroness said that perhaps she should have tabled two amendments, because she is dealing with two separate cases. She will gather in a moment that we are more sympathetic to the relatives&#146; side of the case than we are to the organ donation side. As I say, we will keep the position under review.</p>

<a name="90623-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09062399000116"></a>The position on organ donation is rather more complex. We are not aware of any difficulties when the death is entirely from natural causes. However, if the circumstances of the death are such that the coroner may need to investigate, it will not be possible to remove organs from the body until the coroner has determined whether he or she has jurisdiction over the death. Once the coroner has decided that he or she does have such jurisdiction, a decision will need to be made as to whether particular organs may be removed without compromising the coroner&#146;s duty to investigate the cause of death.</p>

<a name="90623-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09062399000117"></a>It hardly needs saying that these are tricky, sensitive and delicate issues, but in view of the importance of ensuring a better supply of organs for transplantation, protocols between hospitals, transportation teams and coroners have been worked up, or are being worked up, across England and Wales. These will ensure that the appropriate balance is struck between the needs of families for a proper investigation into the death of a loved one&#151;which may, in itself, reveal information to prevent future deaths&#151;and the needs of those awaiting donated organs. I venture to think that the noble Baroness will not be entirely satisfied with my reply to the second part of Amendment 72A, but I hope she is more satisfied with the first part of my reply.</p>

I am satisfied with the bulk of his reply because it states the situation as it is at the moment. It is completely right that the coroner must be asked for permission if organs are to be harvested from a donor in whom the coroner has an interest of any sort. That is the situation at the moment. The death certificate that I wanted to introduce is quite simply and solely to give the family a piece of paper at the time of the death stating that the person is dead, and giving the time of death and the names of the two people who

At the moment, the family does not have that. It does not have the names of both people who were responsible for the testing. They may be different from the people who ultimately sign the death certificate. It was to get that clarity for the family that I sought this. This is a discussion that we will probably pursue outside Committee. There may be merit in the Department of Health producing guidance on producing a short form of documentation that is copied into the clinical record and could be given to the family. It would not have the legal status of a death certificate but would still tell the family the time and the names of those who did the testing; and confirm that it was full brain-stem death testing, because it is so difficult for families to come to terms with brain-stem death.</p>

I know that my noble friend Lady Finlay and the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, will also want to reflect on some of the helpful points that the Minister has made. It certainly would not be my wish to push some of these questions much further. I was pleased when the Minister said that even though he was not prepared to put the role of the national coroner in working out new certification procedures on a statutory basis, there would nevertheless be proper consultation with him or her when they are appointed. I am also grateful to the Minister for his reply on funding. I had not heard that figure of &#163;45 million before. I was glad to hear what he said about the need for more robust quality assurance and the introduction of a single fee, which would be less for families to pay in future. That is welcome too. The Minister made a remark about the need to guard against stigmatisation and the merits that there might be in a short certificate in guarding against that. I think there would be widespread agreement among the Committee over that.</p>

<a name="90623-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09062399000120"></a>The one matter that I would still like to press the Minister on, and which I will certainly think about further and would be willing to discuss further with him, is the introduction, at least, of some king of pilot scheme to try out the proposals that Dame Janet Smith and the Shipman inquiry team came forward with. My mind is always concentrated when I look at the examples that she gave me of certificates that were issued by Dr Harold Shipman. When I look at the cursory way in which some of these deaths, mainly of elderly people, were dealt with, I think it behoves us&#151;in light of the enormity of the offences that were committed at that time&#151;to consider the recommendations of Dame Janet and her inquiry team to streamline the way in which these certificates are issued after someone has died. Having looked through the explanatory note and proposals that she has put forward for a more unified form of certification, it would be sensible at least to trial this in some parts of the country to see how it works. I do not know whether that will be possible for regulation, but maybe I can correspond further with the Minister on that point. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

This arises because of a difficulty mentioned by the Mid Staffordshire inquiry, which said that it had not received any co-operation from the coroner. This made it difficult to carry out a thorough investigation. The inquiry said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a><a name="090623104000025"></a>&#147;We considered that information from the coroner would be useful for the investigation. We were disappointed that he declined to provide us with any&#148;.</p>

<a name="90623-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="090623104000002"></a>I do not suggest that this is common practice. Nor do I suggest that when there are new medical examiners they will, as a matter of course, take that approach.  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1519"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1519</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>However, it is not the sort of thing that should be happening at all, so Amendment 70 reflects the proposition that the Care Quality Commission might have the power to require coroners&#151;and, in the case of Amendment 71, medical examiners&#151;to co-operate with investigatory tribunals. At present, the coroner can co-operate if he or she wishes, but in the case of the Mid Staffordshire inquiry the local coroner made it clear that he had no real interest in helping out in any way. If we are to ensure that the sort of investigation undertaken in such cases is as thorough as possible&#151;and it is in all our interests that this is the case&#151;perhaps it is necessary to do more than simply request or encourage coroners and, subsequently, medical examiners to co-operate and require them to do so.</p>

<a name="90623-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="090623104000003"></a>There is no reason to believe that this would present coroners with huge extra work. These are not particularly common matters. Indeed, as I say, we do not mean by these amendments to suggest that it is common practice that coroners do not co-operate. However, the Mid Staffordshire inquiry was a case where having access to the coroner&#146;s records would have helped to identify cases where people died of preventable or negligence-related causes, connected to the processes and understaffing that were identified in the report. For that reason, I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_122"></a>
<a name="090623104000004"></a><b><a name="90623-0010.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="090623104000036"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I thank the noble Lord for moving what I take to be a probing amendment concerned with the premature deaths at Stafford Hospital between 2000 and 2007. The Committee as a whole will want to express its regret to the families involved. At the time, as a report by the Care Quality Commission&#151;then the Healthcare Commission&#151;made clear, many of those deaths could and should have been avoided, frankly. The breakdown of which the noble Lord speaks between the commission, tasked with investigating the series of deaths, and the coroner, who had investigated some of the individual deaths at the time they occurred, was a perfect example of how those with related statutory responsibilities do not always work together effectively. That may be something of an understatement.</p>

<a name="90623-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="090623104000005"></a>We will agree that we need to tackle that matter. One way is the enforcement route, down which the amendment might take us. However, existing measures in the Bill will address the issues raised by the case. The first important reform is that every death that is not automatically referred to the coroner will be scrutinised by one of the independent medical examiners checking the information given in the medical certificate as the cause of death. They will work closely with the clinical governance teams in primary care trusts and local health boards to collate key information on causes of death and use it to analyse trends and uncover unusual patterns. We believe that the high mortality rates among patients receiving care at Mid Staffordshire National Health Service trust would almost certainly have been identified by medical examiners.</p>

<a name="90623-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="090623104000006"></a>Under current arrangements, with no medical examiners in post, it was for the doctors at Stafford Hospital to decide whether to report deaths to the coroner for investigation. Under Clause 18 there will be a duty for doctors, wherever they are based, to report certain specified deaths to the coroner so that  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1520"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1520</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>no unusual, suspicious deaths pass unnoticed. Among the categories of deaths that are perhaps likely to be referred are where the death may be related to a medical procedure or treatment or where there may have been some failure of care relevant to the death.</p>

<a name="90623-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="090623104000007"></a>Secondly, the national leadership role provided by the Chief Coroner, who will be able to liaise between coroners and organisations such as the Care Quality Commission, will help investigations to proceed smoothly. The Chief Coroner may also issue guidance to all coroners in relation to requests for information and may even intervene where there are disputes. With the assistance of his or her national medical adviser, the Chief Coroner will be able to identify unusual trends and pass on that information to those with an interest as well as publishing pertinent information in an annual report. We also expect that the Chief Coroner would want to review how coroners held information. That was a related difficulty in the Stafford case and we seek to make the systems used more efficient and consistent.</p>

<a name="90623-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="090623104000008"></a>Finally, coroners in particular interact with a number of investigating authorities, all of which have their own statutory responsibilities. Mostly it is the coroner who is dependent on those authorities&#146; reports before he or she can decide how to proceed with his or her own investigation. There are difficulties sometimes. The Coroners&#146; Society does its best to sort out those difficulties and has skilfully negotiated protocols that govern the relationships. That is something that we intend the Chief Coroner will take forward in the future, but the Bill does not propose to place those various interactions on a statutory footing, although I know that the amendment suggests that we should do so.</p>

<a name="90623-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="090623104000009"></a>I turn to the different position of medical examiners in relation to investigations by the Care Quality Commission. The Health and Social Care Act 2008 already gives the Care Quality Commission a number of powers that it is able to use for the purpose of carrying out its regulatory functions, which include carrying out investigations. As the noble Lord is aware, medical examiners will be appointed by the primary care trusts in England. Regulations under Section 65 of the 2000 Act allow the commission to require explanations from a chair, director or employee of an English NHS body, therefore enabling the commission to require explanations from primary care trusts in respect of the work of medical examiners. We are looking at whether those regulations need to be amended to allow the commission to require an explanation directly from a medical examiner.</p>

<a name="90623-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="090623104000010"></a>The 2008 Act also gives the commission the power to require any information, document and records, including personal and medical records or other items that would include the provision of data, from English NHS bodies as well as the power to enter and inspect premises. The Act makes failure to comply with a requirement imposed by the commission an offence punishable on some reconviction to a fine not exceeding level 4 on the standard scale. The commission&#146;s remit does not extend to Wales, but similar functions are conferred on Welsh Ministers by the Care Standards Act 2000 and by another piece of legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="090623104000011"></a>I thank the noble Lord for this short debate. We are not persuaded of the need to make express provision in the Bill for medical examiners to co-operate with inquiries conducted by the Care Quality Commission; existing powers suffice. I hope that that response will satisfy the noble Lord.</p>

I take it that that is the impact of what he is saying. This is one of the Bill&#146;s important developments. If I have understood that correctly&#151;I see that the Minister is nodding&#151;that is an important point that we hope would not be necessary, but the fact that it is there may make it unnecessary because people know that there is that possibility.</p>

I want to look at what the Minister has said in some detail, but if there is already progress in regard to proposed changes of regulations I would be grateful if it were possible to have sight of it at an appropriate time.

The idea behind the amendment was to try to do something about the appalling quality of the examination that occurred when cremation certificates were filled out.

It was completely wrong; it seemed completely inappropriate that when one had been qualified for a short number of years, one was suddenly able to graduate to receive this additional source of income.

The terms and period of record keeping for this system will be determined as part of the implementation process. That is yet to be determined but I reassure the noble Baroness that it is highly likely to be for at least 15 years.

<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="090623112000002"></a>The investigation of treasure finds is a small but historic part of a coroner&#146;s responsibilities, dating back to the 13th century. It is carried out on behalf of our national museums, those enthusiasts who spend their weekends scouring the countryside with their metal detectors, and very occasionally those people who have been lucky enough to find objects of value when digging in their own garden. Many areas in England and Wales are particularly rich in treasure  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1523"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1523</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>finds, from Roman coins to Saxon hoards, and from medieval jewellery to civil war weaponry. Local knowledge of the types of finds is invaluable, and relationships have been established and nurtured over the years between local museums and finds liaison officers.</p>

<a name="90623-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="090623112000003"></a>The government amendments that I intend to move in due course introduce a national coroner for treasure for England and Wales, which will help to improve the efficiency of the treasure investigation system. These amendments largely replicate the provisions for a coroner for treasure that were contained in the draft Coroners Bill, published in 2006. Following the consultation on those draft clauses and further reflection we have made a number of changes to the original proposals, and I hope the House will agree that the package set out here will achieve the best results for both treasure finders and the coroner system as a whole.</p>

<a name="90623-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="090623112000004"></a>To put the amendments in context, in 2008 there were 610 treasure cases reported to local coroners: 610 investigations where the local coroner could have been investigating deaths. As my noble friend Lord Howarth of Newport and the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, indicated at Second Reading, there have been areas around England and Wales where treasure cases have taken a particularly long time to resolve, falling outside the target time of 12 months to complete all aspects of the process in the Treasure Act 1996 code of practice. Establishing a coroner for treasure will help to expedite treasure cases but also enable local coroners to concentrate on their core responsibility for the investigation of deaths. The coroner for treasure, with his or her assistants, will be able to investigate each treasure case more expeditiously than a local coroner can, which will reduce the time taken for each investigation as well as improve the confidence that finders and landowners have in the system.</p>

<a name="90623-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="090623112000005"></a>The new clauses introduce the distinction between investigations and inquests, so that treasure investigations have a similar structure to the reformed death investigations. It will still be possible for the coroner for treasure to summon a jury for a treasure inquest, although the starting position will be that one is not required, as I understand is almost always the case at present.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="090623112000006"></a>The new clause to be inserted by Amendment 84 provides for an exception on the duty of the coroner for treasure to investigate an item under the Treasure Act. This would be where the Crown, or the franchisee, if appropriate, did not want the item, even if it were found to be treasure or treasure trove. At present, although an item may be disclaimed at any time, there is no power for a coroner not to proceed with an inquest. Since the coroner will return the item to the person who found it, it effectively means that an investigation has been wasted. In the reformed system, the Secretary of State would need to certify to the coroner for treasure that the item is disclaimed, and the coroner will then return the item in accordance with the treasure code of practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="090623112000008"></a>We believe that government Amendments 84 and 85 cover similar ground to Amendment 73 in this group in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Stoke Mandeville.

<a name="90623-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="090623112000009"></a>One of the reforms in the draft Coroners Bill, published in 2006, was that there would be a duty to deliver an object to the coroner for treasure if a person was in possession of it. This was to prevent cases where a proportion of the find was kept for the finder&#146;s own gain; failure to deliver the object would have been an offence under the Treasure Act. Our Amendments 86, 88 and 89 tackle this issue in another way.</p>

<a name="90623-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="090623112000010"></a>The coroner for treasure is given the power to order a person to give evidence at an inquest, provide a written statement, produce documents, and produce other items for inspection, examination or testing. This will include not only the item being investigated but any supporting evidence. This will ensure that the investigation is as thorough as possible. Finally, Amendment 212 extends the time limit for prosecutions under the Treasure Act.</p>

<a name="90623-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="090623112000011"></a>I am aware that there have been difficulties with the usual six-month time limit, given the time taken to complete treasure investigations. I believe that the reforms will speed up the investigation process, but I am persuaded that there is a need for the time limit to be extended, by way of a certificate from the prosecutor, to a maximum of three years. This will allow any determinations of whether the item is treasure to take place where necessary.</p>

<a name="90623-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="090623112000012"></a>Other government amendments in this group make provision for, inter alia, the appointment of the coroner for treasure and assistant coroners for treasure, for their training and inspection and for appeals against their decisions.</p>

<a name="90623-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="090623112000013"></a>I hope that noble Lords who are involved in heritage issues&#151;I see that a number of them are present&#151;and interested in treasure will agree that this package of reforms is comprehensive and addresses the issues which currently affect the system. The reforms will encourage better reporting of finds, but more importantly they will help treasure investigations to be concluded more expeditiously, to the benefit of the finder, the landowner, and not least the general public, who may see the item on display in a museum.</p>

We often impose costs on local authorities. Centralising this matter will make the system simpler. It will make those who wish to deal with metal detecting in the legal fashion much more user-friendly. The great success of the Portable Antiquities Scheme in the British Museum and the large number of finds that have come into the public domain because of that scheme are to be welcomed. Therefore, the points made by the Minister are most welcome.</p>

<a name="90623-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="090623112000016"></a>I am, of course, particularly grateful for Amendment 212, which increases the time during which these issues can be dealt with. When the scheme was not working as well as I hope it will, the six-month limit was far too short. There would be a slight problem with six months even in some cases where there is disputed ownership between the landowner and the metal detectorist. The longer period is welcome.</p>

<a name="90623-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="090623112000017"></a>I am speaking to Amendment 74 to deal with another aspect, because an element of metal detecting is not legal. English Heritage&#146;s report on night hawking has shown the scale of the problem. There is the problem of a secondary market whereby people are able to destroy ancient monuments, dig up items of treasure and sell them. The issue is that the internet and sites such as eBay have made it possible for people to find a marketplace for goods which, ultimately, have destroyed much of the archaeological value of many scheduled monuments and other monuments. This issue should be looked at not just in a monetary sense. Violence has been involved in night hawking and it has been a major problem for landowners.</p>

<a name="90623-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="090623112000018"></a>The problem we face is that many other European countries have looked at this issue and raised it with internet sites. As those countries have more stringent provision, those internet sites take the issue far more seriously. The purpose of my amendment is to raise a specific issue. Why is it impossible for the archaeological community to discuss with officials the substance of this amendment, even though the Minister has given assurances that that would not be the case? It has not even been discussed. This matter is of vital importance and its scale should not be underestimated. A Portable Antiquities Scheme survey found that the amount of treasure traffic on eBay was considerable and growing.</p>

<a name="90623-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="090623112000019"></a>Before we bring the amendment back at a later stage, I should like the Minister at this point to initiate a meeting on this issue between officials and members of the archaeological community to find out why we cannot even discuss the matter. I do not intend to press the amendment this evening, although I cannot speak for my noble colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Howarth of Newport. I hope that we can have that discussion before the next stage of the Bill, because the issue is of such importance that it may be worth testing the opinion of the House on it, as we will not get the opportunity to debate it again for a long time.</p>

<a name="90623-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="090623112000023"></a>My proposed new clause after Clause 21 deals with two of the issues covered by the government new clauses after Clause 24, to which the Minister so admirably spoke. I should record that similarities in drafting between my amendment and his are purely incidental, and, in an important respect, different. My proposed new clause deals specifically with the City of London, rather than as a general provision.</p>

<a name="90623-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="090623112000024"></a>The Minister has given an account of the new provisions, so I shall be brief outlining the City of London context. The City of London has a treasure franchise as the result of a number of royal charters granted between 1444 and 1663. The franchise entitles the City to claim treasure which does not, therefore, pass to the Crown. The Museum of London, which the City Corporation jointly funds with the Greater London Authority, is given the first opportunity to acquire treasure subject to the City's franchise for public display.</p>
<a name="time_25"></a>
<a name="90623-0011.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="090623112000087"></a>7.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90623-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="090623112000025"></a>Of course, not all finds of treasure are wanted by the Museum of London. Where a find is not wanted, the general rule is that the objects are returned to the finder. In other words, the City disclaims its entitlement to the treasure. The problem in the present law is that the Treasure Act 1996 allows the Crown to disclaim its entitlement to treasure, but does not make similar provision for the City of London as a franchise holder or for other franchise holders, for that matter. The first purpose of my new clause is to deal with this ambiguity.</p>

<a name="90623-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="090623112000026"></a>Subsections (2) and (4) of the government new clause to which the Minister referred, taken with subsections (1) and (2) of the second government new clause, provide a system enabling a treasure franchisee, and therefore the City of London, to disclaim finds of treasure. They therefore deal with the issue which my new clause addresses. The Minister&#146;s optimism about my reaction to his new clauses was correct.</p>

<a name="90623-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="090623112000027"></a>The second purpose of my new clause is to make clear that there is no need for a treasure inquest where the City as franchise holder has renounced its right to claim the find. This has been a matter of concern to the City Corporation and to the City Coroner, and clarification of the law to make clear that no inquest is needed is highly desirable. That clarification is provided by subsections (4)(b) and (c) of government Amendment 84 in the form of a general provision which includes the City.</p>

<a name="90623-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="090623112000028"></a>There are, however, two other points I should like to mention arising from the government new clauses. First, there is no requirement on the new treasure coroner to notify a franchise holder that a find which might be treasure has been made. Clearly a franchise holder will be an interested party as, unless disclaimed, the treasure will belong to that franchise holder. In the City&#146;s case, it provides the City with the opportunity to exercise its entitlement on behalf of the Museum of London to secure public display of important finds.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1527"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1527</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90623-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="090623112000029"></a>The notice procedure for Treasure which belongs to the Crown&#151;which is the general position&#151;is already catered for by Section 9 of the Treasure Act 1996. That requires coroners to notify the British Museum, which decides whether finds should be claimed by the Crown or returned to finders. There is no equivalent provision for treasure franchisees under the 1996 Act. Although finds of what amount to treasure usually come to the notice of the City or are notified by the coroner once known to him, it would seem appropriate to have an equivalent provision to the existing requirements in relation to finds which became property of the Crown as those that are subject to a treasure franchise, as in the City of London.</p>

<a name="90623-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="090623112000030"></a>Secondly, the new clauses set out the general scheme for the new treasure coroner and assistant treasure coroners. The City of London is, of course, the oldest part of the capital and finds of treasure are fairly frequent. It has been said that the City has been for the past 25 years the largest archaeological site in the world&#151;certainly in Europe&#151;because of what has been discovered below it. The Museum of London looks after one of the world&#146;s leading archaeological research facilities, the London Archaeological Archive and Research Centre. I hope that the review of the work of coroners in relation to treasure inquests, which the Government&#146;s new clauses will prompt, will take full account of the important part played by the City Coroner in the treasure jurisdiction. I shall be wholly reassured if the Minister responds on both these issues in the affirmative. In the mean time, I acknowledge that the Government&#146;s new clauses cover the substance of my new clause. Although I am speaking to Amendment 73 after the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, spoke to Amendment 74, I take this opportunity to support that amendment too. I was once the Secretary of State who encouraged the late Earl of Perth to pursue what became the Treasure Act 1996. His spirit would be happy to see the furrow continuing to be ploughed so sensitively by his successors. I thank the Minister and the Government for all their work in this area.</p>

I also welcome the amendments that would give effect to the Government&#146;s decision to extend the period permitted for prosecutions under the Treasure Act, about which he spoke just now. However, despite what my noble friend said, I do not think that the Government&#146;s response is yet comprehensive. I am sorry that he has not agreed to one of the other proposals that I made at Second Reading, which was more fully and better expounded by the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale. It is the subject of Amendment 74, which the noble Lord has just moved. I greatly look forward to hearing the observations on this amendment, as I hope we shall, from the noble Lord, Lord Renfrew, who is the doyen of parliamentary archaeologists&#151;or should I say archaeological parliamentarians?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="090623112000032"></a>Proposed new Section 8A in Amendment 74 would extend the duty to report a find to anyone who came into possession of an object where they had grounds  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1528"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1528</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to believe that it was treasure and had not previously been duly reported. This was in the Government&#146;s own draft Bill. The reasons for its omission from the Bill as finally published were explained by the Minister, Bridget Prentice, in Committee in another place on 24 February and again by my noble friend in his letter of 22 May, which has been copied to many colleagues. My noble friend said,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a><a name="090623112000082"></a>&#147;We are not convinced that it would be practical to monitor this wider duty, and it would inundate the Coroner for Treasure with finds which are not treasure within the meaning of the Act or finds which have already been investigated&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090623112000080"></a>I add my plea to my noble friend and to the Government to think again. He says that it would not be practical to monitor this wider duty. There are duties under a great many laws that we do not monitor&#151;if we did, we really would live under a Big Brother state. The law should establish particular duties and offences, and then it is the responsibility of the citizen to abide by them.</p>

<a name="90623-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="090623112000033"></a>We need to close what some dealers and collectors unfortunately take to be a loophole. At present, the duty in Section 8(1) of the Treasure Act to report treasure rests solely with those who find the treasure in the first instance. Someone who subsequently comes into possession of an item of treasure and who may know or suspect that that item has been unreported may believe from reading the Treasure Act that they are in the clear if they hang on to the object, and indeed if they deal in it. I am advised that Section 329 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 makes it an offence to be in possession of stolen property&#151;in the case of potential treasure, property of the Crown or perhaps of the landowner. However, the Treasure Act 1996, in contrast to most of our laws, allows ignorance of the law to be a defence. Only someone who can be proved to have intentionally broken the law is liable to prosecution. Currently, the administrators of the Portable Antiquities Scheme seek to advise anyone who finds himself in possession of unreported treasure&#151;perhaps a dealer in antiquities or someone who inherits an object&#151;to report it, but it is hard to reach everyone and advice is no more than advice, so it is a weak position. Some dealers may be genuinely hazy as to their legal responsibilities; others, I think, are deliberately evasive about the legal position. Either way, it is not satisfactory.</p>

<a name="90623-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="090623112000034"></a>For nearly three years, the British Museum has had an agreement with eBay to monitor its site for potential treasure. Of the 302 sellers of potential treasure questioned by British Museum staff, 6 per cent claimed that the find was an old find and therefore did not need to be reported; 2 per cent said that it was the finder&#146;s responsibility and not theirs to report; 26 per cent said that the find spot was not known&#151;that is a very important finding; 18.5 per cent said that the find was foreign; 16.5 per cent gave other reasons why the find need not be reported; 22 per cent did not respond at all; and only 9 per cent of those questioned said that they would indeed report. It is evident, therefore, that vendors are buying potential treasure finds without carrying out due diligence. If the obligation to report were widened, as this amendment proposes, then the duty of due diligence would be strengthened, and there would be a new pressure on dodgy dealers.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1529"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1529</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90623-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="090623112000035"></a>I emphasise that there are wholly respectable dealers within the United Kingdom antiquities market. Worryingly and shamingly, however, a number of dealers and collectors in Britain are not respectable. I shall illustrate this from another context. We have recently read reports about illegal excavations in Afghanistan: 1,500 items are reported as having been looted there and intercepted at Heathrow. The National Museum in Kabul has put on an exhibition of artefacts recovered from Britain. It is a disgrace that there are dealers and collectors who are prepared to collude with this kind of looting, whether from sites of very important heritage abroad or of treasure in this country. We must deter such behaviour. We need to increase the powers of the police; we need to improve the practice and ethos of the antiquities trade; and we need to improve the reputation of the London market.</p>

<a name="90623-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="090623112000036"></a>Those would all be benefits of Amendment 74 and they would be important benefits, even if the coroner for treasure were to be inundated, as the Minister fears. In fact, I do not think that the coroner for treasure would be likely to be inundated. If this amendment were on the statute book, dealers would be deterred from acquiring items that might be unreported treasure. In any case, dealers will not want to report where they do not need to do so. They do not want to get bogged down in paperwork, and they do not want the delays and the blight on being able to sell as an item passes into the coroner&#146;s limbo. In practice, 97 per cent of treasure cases are reported to a finds liaison officer employed under the Portable Antiquities Scheme and not directly to the coroner. These finds are then filtered through the finds liaison officer and British Museum experts. Another amendment might usefully state that a report can be made to a person nominated by the coroner for treasure and not directly and literally to the coroner for treasure. We should also supplement the stick with the carrot and extend the existing statutory reward scheme for reporting to third parties who report.</p>

<a name="90623-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="090623112000037"></a>The Minister says that, rather than have this amendment, a better course would be to improve awareness of the duties under the law. We should do that anyway. To that end, he says that his department will work with those who are involved with the Portable Antiquities Scheme&#151;the DCMS, the British Museum, the National Council for Metal Detecting and the Council for British Archaeology. The noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, raised this question. Will my noble friend tell the House what the timescale for this consultation and co-operation will be? I understand that the DCMS has been saying that it cannot discuss the proposed way forward with the British Museum, which has a statutory duty to administer the provisions of the Treasure Act, until after this Committee stage debate. Why the delay? Will he commit his department to embarking on this process straight away?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="090623112000039"></a>We can dispose very quickly of proposed new Section 8B, the second part of the amendment. This would give the coroner for treasure the power to require any person to hand over any object which, for the time being, the person had control of and which the coroner proposed to investigate as potential treasure. Bridget Prentice said in Committee on 24 February:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a><a name="090623112000083"></a>&#147;There has never been a case under the current system where anyone has refused to hand over an item&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Coroners and Justice Bill Committee, 24/2/09; col. 299.]</p>

<p><a name="090623112000081"></a>Since then, such a case has occurred&#151;a 14th century silver piedfort&#151;and that case is now in the hands of the police. However, my noble friend, in his letter of 22 May, has satisfied me that paragraph 1 of Schedule 4, as amended by amendments in this group, will provide the coroner for treasure with the requisite powers. So I think that proposed new Section 8B should be dropped from Amendment 74 if we find it necessary to retable it on Report. However, I hope that my noble friend will undertake to consider carefully the case that we have put forward and himself table on Report an amendment proposing new Section 8A, perhaps refined, as a government amendment.</p>

The Government have a very good record in this area. They have supported the working of the Treasure Act and they have admirably put resources into the finds liaison officer scheme, for which the heritage community and archaeologists are very deeply grateful.</p>

<a name="90623-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="090623112000041"></a>So I think the Government have a very good record in this area. They also, in the end, supported&#151;I am not saying that they initiated it&#151;the Dealing in Cultural Objects (Offences) Act 2003, which is an important part of the protection of the archaeological heritage. We are therefore very grateful to the Government for the amendments which have been proposed, including the coroner for treasure. We have nothing but praise for those elements, but that makes it all the more strange&#151;as the noble Lords, Lord Redesdale and Lord Howarth of Newport, have indicated&#151;that Amendment 74 has not yet been supported by the Government. Indeed, we are mildly surprised that it was not proposed by the Government, since there were earlier hints that such might have been the case.</p>

<a name="90623-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="090623112000042"></a>The case for that amendment has been admirably set out by my noble colleagues, so I will not repeat the arguments at length. But it is clearly a great lacuna in the present legislation that the only person responsible for reporting a treasure find is the finder. Naturally, the finder should be responsible: that is the basis of the 1996 Act. It has been demonstrated through experience, however, that that is insufficient. It is clearly the case that, if a dealer is offered an object that he suspects is a treasure find&#151;something found in recent years and obviously a gold or silver antiquity found  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1531"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1531</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on British soil&#151;there should clearly be an obligation on him to report the find. That is a serious lacuna in the present Bill.</p>

<a name="90623-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="090623112000043"></a>As the noble Lords who have spoken have indicated, the matter is complicated by the existence of eBay.  A lot of the traffic in antiquities, including illicit antiquities, is now conducted by eBay, so it is important to have a legislative framework, which is now lacking. So far, it has been very difficult to understand what the Government&#146;s objections are to this admirable Amendment 74, which was clearly in the mind of the Government at an earlier stage. I hope that the Minister will give us a very clear analysis. I think the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, has made very clear that it is unlikely that we shall be inundated by treasure finds, and if we were inundated by newly reported treasure finds, it would be a very brief inundation before the situation settled down. Moreover, it is the present case that coroners are assisted by the finds liaison officers, who very often, in practice, make the necessary investigations. That could happen if there were a spate of treasure reportings in the light of the acceptance of this amendment.</p>

<a name="90623-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="090623112000044"></a>So, like the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, I will be listening very carefully to the Minister&#146;s answer on this point. The archaeological community are as one on the matter. The noble Lord, Lord Howarth, has mentioned that there are metal detectorists who support the All-Party Parliamentary Archaeology Group. It is very significant that the Treasure Valuation Committee, which is appointed by the Secretary of State, unanimously supports the amendment, so it is very difficult to understand what the grounds are for opposing it. For that reason, I will listen to the Minister with particular care when he addresses us in just a moment. I hope that this amendment will be brought forward on Report once again if we are not totally convinced&#151;I know the Minister is very eloquent&#151;by his arguments. I warmly support the amendment.</p>

<a name="090623112000045"></a><b><a name="90623-0011.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="090623112000100"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I congratulate the all-party group on its success thus far in persuading us, along with other parties too, to change our minds, and for bringing these amendments to Committee today. When the noble Lord, Lord Renfrew, started praising the Government in such eloquent terms&#151;if I may use that phrase&#151;it was a very refreshing change from what one sometimes hears in this House and elsewhere. But I should have known, of course, that there was a &#147;but&#148;&#151;or a &#147;however&#148; in his case&#151;and indeed there was. I will do my best to deal with this issue shortly this evening.</p>

<a name="90623-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="090623112000046"></a>One thing I can say is that I make the following concession&#151;though it is not really a concession at all at this stage. That is, of course, that we will meet with noble Lords and others between now and Report to discuss the first part of Amendment 74, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale. We will certainly arrange a meeting; there is no reason whatever for not having one.</p>

<a name="90623-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="090623112000047"></a>There are two points raised by noble Lords on Amendment 74. The amendment seeks to extend the duty to report treasure finds to those in possession of objects as well as the finders of such objects. Secondly,  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1532"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1532</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the amendment seeks to impose a duty on those in possession of objects to deliver them to the coroner for treasure. We accept that there is widespread support for the amendment: there is no reason to disbelieve that at all. But our conclusion, on reflection, is that it just would not be appropriate to go that far to widen the obligation to report treasure finds. Of course, there may well be finders selling treasure items and not reporting them, and those finders remain liable for offences. The real reason why we cannot accept the amendment is that we are just not convinced that it would be practical to monitor this wider duty. In spite of what has been said in Committee tonight, we feel there could be a great deal more work for the coroner for treasure, with finds which perhaps are not treasure within the meaning of the Act, or finds which have already been investigated.</p>

<a name="90623-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="090623112000048"></a>Our reasoning has been put in the letter mentioned by my noble friend Lord Howarth. We believe that a better course would be to improve awareness of the existing duty to report finds among those with an interest in the treasure system. I will repeat what is in the letter: we will continue to work with the members of the various groups that were mentioned by my noble friend to try to solve the undoubted problem that exists.</p>

<p><a name="st_136"></a>
<a name="090623112000049"></a><b><a name="90623-0011.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="090623112000101"></a>Lord Redesdale:</b> This is an issue that was raised in the Dealing in Cultural Objects Act. As the Minister has very kindly agreed that a meeting could take place, there is a slight problem that if one goes to one of those internet sites, they do say that they are not actually dealing in the objects themselves&#151;they are just information providers. Without their services, however, it would be impossible to sell these objects. Of course, it is creating a market place which is growing, and I very much hope that the Minister&#151;though he points out that it might provide a great deal of work for the coroner&#151;would recognise that some incredibly important item could end up on eBay and it would be almost impossible to pull it up under the Treasure Act. If the Rudge cup had ended up on eBay, there would have been an outrage, but there is nothing to stop something of such significant value ending up in this position. The recourse of the archaeological community to stop the sale would be very limited indeed.</p>

As to the second part of Amendment 74, my noble friend Lord Howarth dealt with it successfully. The bespoke duty to deliver objects is no longer necessary, given that our own government amendments will extend to the coroner for treasure the powers of senior coroners in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Schedule 4. As a result, the coroner for treasure will have the power to issue a notice requiring a person to produce an object to him or her for inspection, examination or testing. We believe this approach will adequately address the point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="090623112000051"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville, was gracious enough to tell the Committee that he would withdraw his amendment in due course. I will try to answer at least one of his questions: why is there no duty to report a find to a franchisee on whose land  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1533"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1533</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>an object is found? A find must currently be reported to the local coroner. Our changes will see a duty to report any find to the coroner for treasure. The franchisee will be an interested person and will consequently be kept informed of the investigation&#146;s progress once the location of the finding is established. This area may be a matter for incorporation into the code of practice that is to be developed. We will continue to work to improve knowledge of the rules on treasure. That is all I have to say this evening on this matter.</p>

Section 23 of that Act extended the maximum period of detention of terrorist suspects before charge from 14 days to 28 days. Section 25 of that Act says that the period of detention will revert to 14 days unless the 28 days are renewed by order for a period of up to a year. The order maintains the 28-day maximum limit for a further period of one year, beginning on 25 July 2009.</p>

<a name="90623-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="090623112000053"></a>Terrorist investigations can be immensely time-consuming, and the increase from 14 days to 28 days was necessary primarily as a result: first, of the greater use of encrypted computers and mobile phones; secondly, of the increasingly complex nature of terrorist networks that have to be investigated&#151;they quite often run through many, many countries; and, lastly, of the increasingly international nature, as I say, of terrorist networks. There are huge language difficulties and there is great difficulty in getting this evidence from abroad, which all adds to the complexity.</p>

<a name="90623-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="090623112000054"></a>The potential consequences of a terrorist attack are of such magnitude that it is imperative that the police have the powers to arrest terrorists before they can achieve their goals. The current threat level remains at severe, where an attack is highly likely. Jonathan Evans, director-general of the Security Service, has recently stated that there is enough intelligence to show intent to mount an attack and that it could happen at any stage.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1534"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1534</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90623-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="090623112000055"></a>When a terrorist plot is uncovered, due to the likely severity of an attack, law enforcement agencies often have to intervene at a much earlier stage in the investigation than they would like. I have to say that I encourage them to do that. As a result, at the point of arrest the information that the police have available to them may be based more on intelligence than on admissible evidence. This is one of the fundamental ways in which terrorism is so different from other crimes. Therefore, unlike other forms of crime, proportionately more work needs to be done on the investigation after an individual has been arrested.</p>

<a name="90623-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="090623112000056"></a>The decision to extend pre-charge detention from 14 days to 28 days in the Terrorism Act 2006 took account of these practical difficulties, and it has been justified by subsequent events. It means that we have been able to bring prosecutions that might otherwise not have been possible. Since the power came into force in July 2006, 11 people have been held for more than 14 days, and six people have been held from between 27 and 28 days; of these six, three were charged with terrorist-related offences. The last person to be held for more than 14 days was held on 30 June 2007 for 18 days, 17 hours and 48 minutes, which shows the flexibility of the length of time for which people are held.</p>

<a name="90623-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="090623112000057"></a>I should point out that the existing application for an extension is a very rigorous process. Those who are arrested can be detained for 48 hours, after which the police or the Crown Prosecution Service may apply to a judicial authority for a warrant of further detention. This is to a designated magistrate for applications for up to 14 days&#146; detention, and to a High Court judge thereafter. A Crown Prosecution Service lawyer makes the application for extensions beyond 14 days. Defence solicitors are provided in advance of each application, with a written document that sets out the grounds for the application.</p>

<a name="90623-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="090623112000058"></a>At the extension hearings, the senior investigating officer is present, and the applications are usually strenuously opposed and can last for several hours. The officer may be questioned vigorously by the defence solicitor about all aspects of the case. Applications to extend the detention period may be made for up to seven days at a time or quite often for less; it may be a matter of only a day or two. Suspects can be held only for the purpose of obtaining evidence in relation to criminal offences. They cannot be simply detained for public safety reasons. This means that once the police have exhausted their questioning of a suspect, the person must be either released or charged regardless of how many days they have been detained for.</p>

<a name="90623-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="090623112000059"></a>A recently published report by Her Majesty&#146;s Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate highlighted that the Counter Terrorism Division of the Crown Prosecution Service,</p>
<ul><a name="090623112000085"></a>&#147;treat the extended power of detention very carefully. Applications are only made if properly justified and careful consideration is given to the further period required to complete the enquiries&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90623-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="090623112000060"></a>As I have already noted, all 28 days have been proved to be necessary, and while the full 28 days have not been needed over the past 24 months that does not mean that they might not be needed again in the near future. The threat level cannot be ignored, and it is simply not possible to predict what might happen over  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1535"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1535</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the next 12 months. All of us on all sides of the House appreciate the seriousness of the terrorist threat that we face and the importance of having the right measures in place to counter that threat. Terrorism is a huge international challenge, but it is a particular challenge for democracies, which must strive to protect individual liberties while ensuring collective security. It is vital to strike the balance between protecting the rights of the detainee and ensuring that an investigation proceeds properly and effectively, enabling the police to deal with the complexity of modern terrorism investigations. I hope that the House agrees that this order achieves this, and I commend it to the House.</p>

At least this year we are debating it without any other confusion, such as the proposition to extend detention to 42 days. We now see that that proposition, which we on these Benches strongly resisted, was absolutely unnecessary. I am sure that even the Minister and the Government can accept just how unnecessary it was.</p>

<a name="90623-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="090623112000062"></a>Today we consider whether we should simply renew the 28-day detention with barely a murmur or a question. Every time we consider these special and extraordinary provisions, we must be clear that the goal is to return to what we all accepted as normal pre-9/11: that no one could be held without charge for longer than four days. I want to highlight how different things are now. It is important to remember that we are at seven times the normal limit.</p>

<a name="90623-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="090623112000063"></a>I will not dwell on some of the other details that we have rehearsed many times in your Lordships&#146; House. The Minister touched on a few of them, including the issue of the suspect&#146;s access to a lawyer and what that lawyer may address. I am sure that my noble friends may touch on those issues. I should like to emphasise the importance of the steps that we make to return to normalcy. I ask the Minister to prove today that reverting to 14 days pre-detention as laid down in the Terrorism Act 2006 is neither desirable nor even it seems the goal that the Government seek to attain. The Minister said himself that, in the past 24 months, neither 28 days pre-detention nor anything like it has been used. In fact, the statistics in the independent assessor&#146;s report bear out the fact that a return to 14 days is a practical proposition.</p>

<a name="90623-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="090623112000064"></a>I should like to question the reasoning that the Minister laid out for the 28 day maximum. The Government should provide the evidence to back up  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1536"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1536</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the assertions because the statistical evidence is pointing the other way. I will take the Minister&#146;s assertions one by one. He says that there is an increasingly complex nature of terrorist networks. He would accept the strategy&#151;because he, with his department, wrote it&#151;that vastly increased resources are going into counterterrorism. At the time he published the strategy the figure was &#163;2.5 billion, rising to &#163;3.5 billion in 2011&#151;and a Security Service personnel that has doubled in size. The Government impressed upon us that they had a new strategy and better targeting when they launched that strategy in March this year. So, while the terrorist networks may be more complex, the tools that the Government have are increasingly more substantial.</p>

<a name="90623-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="090623112000065"></a>The Minister mentioned the increasingly international nature of terrorist networks, meaning greater language difficulties and a greater need to gather evidence from aboard. I am sure that the Government maintain a good network of interpreters and translators. That is never going to be a sound reason for having such a departure from our normal rules of law and justice. I am not sure whether the Minister mentioned in the Explanatory Notes the difficulty of entering premises to search for evidence where it is suspected that chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear material may be present. Legislation allows access to premises. The technological challenges, if they are that severe, are not likely to disappear on day 28.</p>

<a name="90623-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="090623112000066"></a>The Minister mentioned the need to intervene early in some terrorist investigations due to the public safety consequences of a successful terrorist attack. We had an example of that this year with the arrests in the north-east after Bob Quick inadvertently let slip information about the operation when his papers were photographed. The people were arrested early and released without charge well before 14 days. Then there is the question of the encryption of computers. As the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, mentioned some time ago, when we were debating 42 days, that is an issue of getting more computer experts to bear on the problem. Again, it is not a sound argument.</p>

<a name="90623-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="090623112000067"></a>It was very useful that the Joint Committee on Human Rights published its report today at five o&#146;clock. We have the benefit of its views. The Joint Committee believes that it is impossible for it, or for Parliament in general, to assess whether the 28-day limit is necessary without a proper independent investigation of whether those who have been held for more than 24 days could have been released or charged earlier. That has been mentioned to the Government before. Although the report on the operation of the Terrorism Act was published in June this year, and although it contains useful statistics, it does not contain any sort of qualitative assessment to give us an indication of what we are dealing with.</p>

<a name="90623-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="090623112000068"></a>This suggests that the Government do not intend to move away from 28 days at any time in the near future or, indeed, ever. Liberal Democrats are deeply unhappy at this rubber stamp renewal. We were equally unhappy with the automatic renewal of control orders, in respect of which the Government&#146;s approach was found wanting by the Law Lords. If the Government pursue this order today, we believe it will mean that exceptional

Doubtless the terrorist threat will not go away for a generation. I am not underplaying the serious nature of that threat. However, given the Government&#146;s approach, we are looking at keeping 28 day detention for a generation. We do not accept that is a desirable position. We urge the Government to develop their thinking and to return with a plan, and the actions necessary, to move us back to at least 14 days before this provision is renewed again. I beg to move.</p>

I suspect that we all also agree that the fact that this power has not been used is not in itself an argument that it is not needed. However, to uphold the system of justice that we hold so dear and that we are determined, as it is crucial to our society, that terrorists and extremist will not take away from us, it is essential to be certain that that power is necessary.</p>

<a name="90623-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="090623112000070"></a>This point was accepted by the Secretary of State for Justice in a recent lecture at Clifford Chance on 12 May, where he argued, I understand, that UK counterterrorism law was,</p>
<ul><a name="090623112000086"></a>&#147;built up in the wake of the 9/11 attacks on New York and the 7/7 attacks on London, should be reviewed and may need to be scaled back&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090623112000071"></a>He was reported as saying:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a><a name="090623112000084"></a>&#147;There is a case for going through all counterterrorism legislation and working out whether we need it. It was there for a temporary period&#148;.</p>

<a name="90623-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="090623112000072"></a>This debate is important because it would be absolutely disastrous if we slipped into an easy habit of making temporary legislation de facto permanent and, thereby, in my estimation, giving the extremists a victory, which would be very unfortunate. I am one of those who believe that one of the things that we are defending in our society is our system of justice.</p>

<a name="90623-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="090623112000073"></a>What is the justification for extending it to 28 days again? I noticed today that the Joint Committee on Human Rights has produced a report that raises some important questions in this respect. I wish that it had done it a little earlier. I know, because I have heard him say it, that my noble friend takes the findings of the Joint Committee on Human Rights extremely seriously. I am therefore a little surprised that he did not refer to its report. I hope that, before we conclude our debate, he will take up the points in its report and deal with them in detail.</p>

<a name="90623-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="090623112000074"></a>One of the questions that the Joint Committee raises is whether the procedure by which the judge who authorises detention up to the maximum period during the 28 days provides sufficient, robust and adequate standards. Information can be withheld from the suspect and his lawyer and they can be excluded from hearing it. Another specific question that the Joint Committee on Human Right raises is whether this is compatible with the UK&#146;s human rights obligations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="090623112000075"></a>In the first year of the 28-day limit, three people were held for almost the maximum period, but that was before being released without charge. What detailed, careful analysis has been made by the Government of the lessons to be learnt from that? If those people were

I would suggest that the Joint Committee on Human Rights is absolutely correct to underline that to have a proper evaluation in a debate of this kind it is necessary to see such an evaluation by the Government in order that we cannot just be by good will persuaded, but by the force of intellectual argument persuaded that these exceptional powers are necessary.</p>

<a name="90623-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="090623112000076"></a>What are the implications for the principle of the presumption of innocence, which I hope will remain central to our system of law, although I sometimes begin to become a little fearful? I believe that one of the great things about British law is that there is a presumption of innocence. What does all this amount to in terms of that very important principle for our whole society and its way of operating? What are the implications for a fundamental right to a fair hearing? It is absolutely central to our system of justice that people should know why they are being held and being charged. That goes back centuries in our history. It was fought for with tremendous commitment and courage in our history and evolution.</p>

<a name="90623-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="090623112000077"></a>I am not saying that the system may not be necessary, but it is very important to hear detailed argument of why it remains important and not just to say, &#147;Oh, we renewed it last year and the arguments are the same so we will renew it this year&#148;. It means that for yet another year we have not been operating by the standards we set ourselves. Therefore, to renew that for another year, we need to hear the arguments now and not just accept the arguments from last year. What are the implications for justice being seen to be done, which I have always again seen as central to our system of justice? What about the good will and co-operation of ethnic minority communities? From talking to police officers and others who are working on the front line with such communities, I know that co-operation and good will are absolutely essential in this vital task of holding the situation against extremists and preventing outrages against the population as a whole.</p>

<a name="90623-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="090623112000078"></a>I raise these questions because I believe that we have heard a sincere argument by my noble friend. I do not question his sincerity, nor do I question his commitment to British justice. But it seems to me that if we are undertaking a review seriously, year by year, and mean that, as the Secretary of State for Justice suggested we should, it is important to hear much more detailed, rigorous arguments as to why we should continue overriding absolutely fundamental principles in our system of law.</p>

The Joint Committee on Human Rights has criticised this order. It has not said unequivocally that the order is improper, but it has indicated that whichever Government are in office this time next year they must produce a stronger case if they wish to renew the 28-day detention power. The present Government are likely to be in office for at least the next nine or 10 months. Will they therefore begin to undertake the reviews that have been recommended by the committee in paragraphs 25, 29 and 36 of its report?</p>

<a name="090623114000001"></a><b><a name="90623-0012.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="090623114000051"></a>Baroness Neville-Jones:</b> My Lords, last year we debated this order when the Government proposed to extend the period of pre-charge detention to 42 days, as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, reminded us. Having been defeated, the Government still have on the stocks, it is important to remember, what they call the temporary Bill to extend pre-charge detention to 42 days, which they have not submitted to pre-legislative scrutiny. I note that, because it is in the background of the Government&#146;s proposal that they should retain the 28 days. There is a desire in certain circumstances to go further.</p>

<a name="90623-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="090623114000002"></a>I want to reiterate the point that I made last year; namely, that the need for Parliament to renew Section 23 of the Terrorism Act 2000 on an annual basis demonstrates that the extension from 14 to 28 days maximum is already an exceptional power, as the noble Lord, Lord Judd, just said. We scrutinise it frequently because it is such a dramatic departure from normal practice. Certainly, the object on these Benches is that the period of pre-charge detention should be reduced. We have great sympathy with the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. We agree with her that other methods should be used to bring charge at an early stage; she detailed a number of them. I add the possibilities for a more flexible threshold test than already exists, the post-charge questioning possibility and the increased resources that certainly, as she rightly reminded us, have been provided to the security services.</p>

<a name="90623-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="090623114000003"></a>One might legitimately ask if the power is still needed based on its use to the present date. A number of the previous speakers have mentioned the statistics. The Government&#146;s statistical bulletin on terrorism arrests and outcomes since 2001 shows, as has been said, that in 2006-07 10 people were held for between 14 and 28 days, of whom seven were charged and three released without charge on the last day of the 28 days. In 2007-08, one person was held for more than 14 days before being charged on the 19th day. Since March 2008, no individual has been held longer than 14 days. So, as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, said, the statistics do not of themselves demonstrate a continuing need. That certainly shows the importance of review.</p>

<a name="90623-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="090623114000004"></a>However, the statistics are only one part of the debate that we need to have. We on these Benches certainly recognise that the terrorist threat is increasingly complex. There is no argument about that. Even though the power has not been used in the past two years, that does not of itself demonstrate that the extension to 28 days is no longer necessary, as the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. However, it is imperative that the Government make the case, as has been said by other speakers.</p>

<a name="90623-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="090623114000005"></a>In their Explanatory Memorandum to the order, and as repeated by the Minister, the Government put forward five reasons to justify the need for extension to 28 days. These reasons are based on the evolving and ever increasing complexity of the terrorist threat and include: the greater use of encrypted computers; the increasingly complex nature of terrorist networks; the international linkages in plots and the need for putting everything together; and the difficulty of entering premises&#151;these are all matters to which he referred. The fifth reason, of course, is the need to intervene  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1540"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1540</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>early in some terrorist cases, which results in the investigators having less time to gather admissible evidence prior to arrest. These are all relevant considerations, as are the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller.</p>

<a name="90623-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="090623114000006"></a>On thinking back to the 12 arrests in Manchester recently, I find it worrying that, following an investigation based on what was said at the time to be strong intelligence into what the Prime Minister described as a serious terrorist plot, the police have not been able to present sufficient evidence even to lay charges against any of the arrested, let alone obtain convictions. There has been no explanation for this and what happened unavoidably gives rise to questions about the procedure followed. It is also the kind of episode that has the potential for greatly increasing communal tension in this country.</p>

<a name="90623-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="090623114000007"></a>We on these Benches have called on the Government to increase the range of evidence admissible in court in terrorist cases to include that derived from intelligence sources, which would help underpin a greater number of successful prosecutions. This call is reflected in the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. Yet despite the recommendations of the Chilcot review that it would be in the interests of national security to develop an acceptable way of bringing intercept evidence to court, frustratingly there is still no sign of the completion of the work of the follow-up committee. It would be helpful to know from the Government whether Sir John Chilcot, with his new responsibilities for the Iraq inquiry, will be able to find time in the near future to complete the work that has already been undertaken.</p>

<a name="90623-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="090623114000008"></a>We are all agreed that one of the greatest deterrents to terrorism is getting the guilty behind bars. We should therefore not go on handicapping ourselves unnecessarily by restricting the evidence that is admissible and instead lengthening the period of pre-charge detention to increase the chances of finding other cogent evidence. That is precisely the opposite of the policies followed by common-law countries in similar situations. We on these Benches take the view that we cannot go on indefinitely like this.</p>

<a name="90623-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="090623114000009"></a>As with control orders, we give the Government fair warning that our continued tolerance of extended pre-charge detention on the present basis is wearing thin, and these are the reasons. First are all the points that I have just made about the need legitimately to strengthen the hand of the prosecution in terrorism cases to reduce the resort to derogations from fundamental provisions. Secondly, there is the somewhat elderly information put into the public domain about the nature and extent of the terrorist threat. The reasons put forward by the Government for extending pre-charge detention are certainly not irrelevant, as I have already said, but they are general propositions likely to be more or less valid for a long time to come. They tell us little about the evolving threat or the current security situation and, as has been pointed out, lead to the danger of simply renewing these orders, year after year, without real examination.</p>

<a name="90623-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="090623114000010"></a>The point of the sunset clause is to enable legislators to take an informed view on a periodic basis&#151;and I mean informed. This House needs more information than the Government have provided on the terrorist  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1541"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1541</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>threat and the security situation. As part of today&#146;s proceedings we should be debating a report from the Government on the current threat and the security situation which informs us and the country about its evolution. The noble Baroness, Lady Manningham-Buller, who is not in her place, helped to move us in this direction when she gave a speech to Queen Mary College in November 2006 on the terrorist threat to the UK; her successor, Jonathan Evans, likewise did so in a speech in November 2007 and, as was quoted today, made the odd further obiter dictum. However, the assessment that we have is now getting on for two years old and these two speeches should not be the end of the information put into the public domain on a considered basis; the Minister should be willing to update us.</p>

<a name="90623-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="090623114000011"></a>As I say, as part of today&#146;s proceedings we should be debating lessons learnt from previous terrorist investigations. The Joint Committee on Human Rights has noted for many years one way in which this could be achieved. It has called for an independent review of the practice of detaining people for between 14 and 28 days, conducted by an appropriate body such as the Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate, to see whether those charged after being detained for more than 14 days could have been charged any earlier. Other noble Lords have made reference to this and it is an important recommendation which the Government should take seriously.</p>

<a name="90623-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="090623114000012"></a>I note that the report published today states that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a><a name="090623114000045"></a>&#147;The Government has provided some statistical analysis which is helpful, but it is not enough to allow us to assess whether the extension beyond 14 days pre charge detention is needed&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090623114000042"></a>Other noble Lords have said this. There seem to me two reasons. There is certainly the need to examine the efficacy of the procedures and, as I said earlier, we need to know more about the security situation.</p>

<a name="90623-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="090623114000013"></a>The Government have not really provided sufficient evidence in their Explanatory Memorandum either to support or reject their reasons for the extension. That brings me to my third point, which is the unsatisfactory nature of the legal framework surrounding the extension of pre-charge detention as it affects the rights of defendants in particular. This, I know, is something that the Joint Committee on Human Rights always looks at, and last year the committee&#146;s report on pre-charge detention was published the day before we considered a similar order. This year it was published a few hours ago. I wish that the Government would time the debate better, when they know that a report of this kind is going to come to your Lordships&#146; House, so that it enables us actually to consider the committee&#146;s conclusions and enough time to really absorb its contents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="090623114000014"></a>Last year the Joint Committee concluded that the current arrangements for judicial authorisation of extended pre-charge detention did not satisfy the stringent requirements either of habeas corpus or of Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The committee reiterated that conclusion today, and it gives a couple of reasons. First, it says the hearing of an application for further detention is not fully adversarial.  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1542"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1542</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The second reason is because judicial oversight is inadequate as a result of the narrowness of the questions the court is required to answer in making its decision, focusing on the course of the investigation and whether it is being conducted diligently and expeditiously rather than whether there is sufficient evidence to justify the original arrest and continued detention, which should actually be what it is focused on. I suspect the committee will continue to focus on that part of its report, and it seems to me quite right that it should.</p>

<a name="90623-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="090623114000015"></a>Given the recent ruling of the Law Lords in a different matter&#151;it touched on some of the same issues, however&#151;I ask the Government whether they are going to risk a further legal challenge or whether instead they might heed the recommendations of the statutory reviewer of counterterrorism legislation, the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, who has suggested that the Government consider,</p>
<ul><a name="090623114000046"></a>&#147;empowering judges to scrutinise the reasons for detention, and the adequacy of the work done to bring the case to charge, from the seventh day after arrest&#148;?</ul>
<p><a name="090623114000043"></a>That would be another way in which we might get a greater safeguard.</p>

<a name="90623-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="090623114000016"></a>All that, of course, reinforces our proposal with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, for the institution of an independent commissioner for terrorist suspects, which was first put forward when we considered the then Counter-Terrorism Bill. The Government accepted it and undertook to put forward legislation but, in March, when I asked what progress was being made, I was told,</p>
<ul><a name="090623114000047"></a>&#147;we are continuing to consider how to meet the commitment to establish an independent commissioner for terrorist suspects&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report, </I>23/3/09; col. <I>WA</I><I></I><I>106</I>.]</ul>
<p><a name="090623114000044"></a>I hope that I am not just being fobbed off and that the Government will bring forward the promised proposal. I draw the Government&#146;s attention to the opportunity which the Coroners and Justice Bill provides for them to put forward a proposal of this kind.</p>

<a name="90623-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="090623114000017"></a>Let me conclude by reiterating that the objective on these Benches is without doubt to reduce the period of pre-charge detention. We agree with the fundamental points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, but I have to say that as shadow Security Minister, I do not feel able to vote for or to support a change with real potential implications for security on the basis of today&#146;s short and incomplete debate, uninformed about the current terrorist threat and the security situation generally.</p>

<a name="90623-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="090623114000018"></a>Lest the Government conclude that this is therefore the way to obtain renewal in future&#151;by keeping the House in the dark and by ignoring the numerous objections to obnoxious features of the current legal regime&#151;let me give fair warning that on these Benches we shall not be so complaisant on future occasions. The Government must not think that they can take Parliament for granted. Can the Minister please therefore assure your Lordships&#146; House that the Government will give Parliament an opportunity to debate the security situation?</p>

<a name="90623-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="090623114000019"></a>After today, our support for the extension of pre-charge detention will depend on what the Government are able and willing to do in the following respects: first, to demonstrate convincingly to Parliament that the  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1543"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1543</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>security situation is such that 28 days remain indispensable and cannot be shortened&#151;that means that we need a proper discussion on the security situation&#151;secondly, to pursue implementation of the measures of the type advocated by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, which would help reduce the time a suspect had to spend in pre-charge detention; and thirdly, to take action to amend the legal framework governing judicial authorisation of extended detention to allow it to meet the procedural protections required by our common law, as well as by Article 5 of the ECHR. Should there be a change of Government before the next renewal comes up, this gives an indication of the approach that we would take. The Government have a duty to keep the people of this country secure and, with parliamentary consent, to take the measures that are strictly necessary to that end. That, however, is not enough; protection must and can be achieved in ways that uphold our historic freedoms and our reputation for justice and procedural fair dealing.</p>

This was mentioned by a couple of other speakers. We all want to get back to that position, but we are still in extremely unusual circumstances. I hope that over time CONTEST 2, which I will come back to, will move us in a direction that will allow us to do that. These are not measures that we use willy-nilly, though: just 11 people have gone over 14 days in the time that this has been in force. We do not just go and use this in a random way; it is tightly controlled and conducted. As I said, I would love to be able to move back via 14 days to four days, but at the moment a return to 14 days is something that the police and the agencies would be very much against, and they advise strongly against it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="090623114000022"></a>The noble Baroness touched on the issue that I talked about, the increasingly complex nature of terrorist attacks, and the answer is that they are indeed more complex. Even allowing for our increased expenditure, which has been quite remarkable&#151;from &#163;1 billion to &#163;3.5 billion&#151;they are still highly complex and getting more so all the time. I have to say, too, that they are also getting cuter; they rapidly pick up all the techniques that we use. The moment that any of these techniques are exposed in any way, we find, when we are trying to track these people down and bring them to justice, that they are using their knowledge of those techniques to make it more difficult for us.</p>

Luckily, I am glad to say, we have not come across a plot that has caused us a real problem, but I am sure, and I have said it a number of times in public, that in those areas it is not a question of if there is an attack of that type but, I am afraid, of when. That is why we put so much effort in CONTEST 2 into countering those. There is a real problem. Think of that incident with the polonium attack&#151;when trying to get into an establishment where something radioactive and unpleasant has been, time is finite, and it adds time to get forensics in there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="090623114000025"></a>A couple of speakers raised the issue of moving quickly. We need to move quickly; we are talking about a real danger. These are people who wish to kill hundreds or, if they could, thousands of innocent people. We absolutely cannot take that risk. When we have intelligence of a level that shows us that something is happening, we have to move. It would be much nicer to wait in the old way until there was a body and the chap who had done it had thrown his knife down and run for it. That would be perfect, and we could do it all in 48 hours&#151;it works beautifully. That is why these systems were set up many years ago. However, we are just not in that position now. We know, from some of the plots that we have uncovered and some of the ones that we have managed to disrupt, that they are looking at killing huge numbers of people, and we just cannot take that risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="090623114000026"></a>The noble Baroness mentioned computers and suggested we need more experts. It is not as easy as that. I thank her for raising the 42-days issue; I am scarred by that particular incident and I think I have a Guinness book of records award for the defeat in it. At the time we dealt with that issue, I looked in great detail at the question as to whether we could expand our high-tech unit within the Metropolitan Police Service. But there are narrow choke points and it does not matter whether you have 200 or 2,000 people doing it, because you are tied to working your way through that one thing, and it just does not resolve that bottle-neck. All of those reasons remain and make this necessary.</p>

<a name="90623-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="090623114000027"></a>I agree with my noble friend Lord Judd. He is absolutely right&#151;it was touched on by the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones&#151;that the fact that we have not had an example for two years, does not mean that it is wrong that we still do this. Indeed, I believe the power is still necessary. Certainly, the police and the agencies absolutely believe that we need this.</p>

<a name="90623-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="090623114000028"></a>The JCHR report was mentioned by my noble friend Lord Judd and also by the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, and the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. As regards the timing, I am not sure how exactly this happened; I do not know how much it is due to the House authorities or to us. It is not very satisfactory. I have not had the chance to go through the JCHR report in detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="090623114000029"></a>One of its points is about better information so Parliament can decide whether to renew the power. That is a good point made by a couple of noble Lords. We already have the important independent oversight of the annual reports of the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, on the operation of terrorism legislation. The noble  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1545"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1545</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord, Lord Carlile, is an authoritative and objective voice of scrutiny on all these issues. He recently announced that he will be conducting a review of Operation Pathway arrests in north-west England, which was touched on. As part of this, he will look at circumstances surrounding the detention of the individuals involved; we will be looking very carefully at that report. Due to his impartiality and his unrivalled access to details, it may possibly be the catalyst for looking at further detention issues, including any individuals who are detained beyond the 14-day period.</p>

<a name="90623-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="090623114000030"></a>We are considering the impact of the judgment on the question of compatibility with the right to a judicial hearing. But the Government do not accept that there is an automatic read-across to all other proceedings involving the use of closed material. Closed hearings are used very rarely in pre-charge detention extension hearings. They are certainly used less frequently in the later stages of detention beyond the 14 days</p>

<a name="90623-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="090623114000031"></a>It raised the very important point of the impact on suspects and communities. During the 42-days debate, a commitment was made to undertake a review of the impact of all counterterrorism legislation. Work on the scope of that review has been ongoing and, while the review will not be specifically about pre-charge detention, it will encompass it. Extensive scoping work means that this assessment has been delayed. A broad research project on the community impact is being progressed and we are committed to deliver this research by November 2009.</p>

<a name="90623-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="090623114000032"></a>As regards the presumption of innocence, that is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions to consider. In regards to ensuring that court cases are not prejudiced by external factors, such as the media, this already happens in appropriate cases, albeit via the Attorney-General rather than the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>

<a name="90623-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="090623114000033"></a>We are addressing these issues. I am sorry I do not have a more comprehensive response, but as was pointed out, I was first aware of this at about 5 pm this evening.</p>

<a name="90623-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="090623114000034"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, raised the issue of how important it is that we reduce pre-charge detention and talked about the flexible threshold test and post-charge questioning. These issues have been looked at in detail. The police and the CPS still do not believe that these actually meet the Bill and I have been through this in some detail. There is a dispute. There are some people who believe it does, but there is quite a large number that does not believe it does. The noble Baroness also pointed out, as did my noble friend Lord Judd, that the fact that this has not been used for two years does not mean that it does not have any value. She is absolutely right on that issue.</p>

<a name="90623-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="090623114000035"></a>As regards the Manchester incident, I hope the point that I made&#151;that it is being reviewed by the noble Lord, Lord Carlile&#151;covers it. It was another case where there was intelligence of such a level and nature that, when it was put together, we just could not take the risk. I am absolutely certain of that because I was aware of that intelligence. But, as I say, it is fleeting, and it is not the same as evidence. I cannot say much more about it because there are issues in the case that are still being followed through.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="090623114000036"></a>As for intercept as evidence&#151;we have had this debate on the Floor of the House before&#151;the Government absolutely support the Chilcot review. The all-party Privy Council group is looking at this and we are moving forward as fast as possible. The nine Chilcot tests are there. I am absolutely certain that this is not a silver bullet and we must make sure that all of the nine tests are actually ticked. We as a Government cannot get ourselves into a position where we could risk what are effectively the crown jewels in our capability. I have already mentioned these people&#146;s acuteness and the speed with which they pick up any of our techniques when we expose them. If we gave those away, there would be a real danger and risk to our people. We have to be certain. That is why the nine tests that Chilcot laid down are absolutely right and we are working through all of them. If we cannot be absolutely sure that we are not putting these things at risk, we should not do it. We will have to see where that stands; we have not got to that point yet. The noble Baroness mentioned that we need to get terrorists behind bars. I would say that we have put almost 200 behind bars over the past five or six years; so we are achieving that. People quote instances of what other countries do about intercept, but those countries are very different and comparisons are sometimes worse than useless. Comparing what the FBI might do with a phone tap does not relate to what the West Country can do with the internet and things like that. It is a completely different world.</p>

<a name="90623-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="090623114000037"></a>On control orders, we looked specifically at a group of nine such cases. There was not a single case in which intercept as evidence would have made a difference. I think that we need to be extremely wary there.</p>

<a name="90623-0013.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="090623114000038"></a>I was surprised that the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, mentioned a lack of knowledge of the threat. CONTEST 2 is one of the things that I have been very proud of. It explains the threat in great detail. It gives a history of the threat and talks through it. I have no doubt whatever, having been around the world, that it is the world&#146;s best counterterrorism strategy at the moment. It does explain it. Does that mean that we need to have a debate on it? I have no difficulty about a debate in the future. I cannot promise a debate on counterterrorism, because it depends on parliamentary business, but I would love to have one. I am very proud of what we have achieved over the past two years in counterterrorism&#151;in our Prevent strategy, in countering extremism, in stopping radicalisation. We have probably the most comprehensive strategy in the world. We cannot protect and arrest our way out of this problem, but as the strategy starts to bite and work, I hope that we will become safer, and then we can get rid of these requirements to hold people before charge for this length of time. Similarly, what we have done in Protect and by holding the ring is crucial. We have done a lot to protect crowded places and transport and all of these things. As for the Pursue part of our strategy&#151;that is, catching these people and arresting them&#151;this 28-day provision is still a crucial part of it. That is why I believe that we need to keep it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="090623114000039"></a>I hope that I have answered most of the questions raised. I know that there are differing views on the issue. I am reassured by the knowledge that the aim of

We might have different perceptions of how to do that but I am absolutely convinced that we are doing the right thing. In the final analysis, we as a Government are responsible for the lives of our people. They have the right to life. Crucially, sometimes we do things that are not the things that we would like or love to do, because there is still a very great threat to this nation. I do not want to keep on about that because one the great joys of the British people is that they get on with life&#151;they live it, have fun, work and travel. I want them to do that because otherwise we will be doing the terrorists&#146; work for them. CONTEST 2 will start to achieve that, and this is a small but none the less very important fragment of that. I invite the House to approve the order.</p>

She gave us a very useful list of headlines that the Government need to address. If I had wanted to move instantly to abandon the order, I would have tested the opinion of the House tonight. However, I tabled a non-fatal amendment to encourage the Government to move incrementally backwards to 14 days. For all the Minister&#146;s expertise, I did not hear him express an aspiration to approach that. It sounded to me as though he still felt that my aspiration was naive, because there was such a tremendous risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="090623114000041"></a>We on these Benches accept that there will always be risk. The need to balance our values of justice with the necessity to minimise risk was eloquently expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Judd. What the Government are not doing&#151;I did not hear the Minister say that he would be moving towards it&#151;is producing evidence for us. This creates frustration. I heard it from the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, and we on these Benches feel it, too. The Minister knows what he knows, but at the moment not enough evidence is produced&#151;I am aware of the constraints&#151;for Parliament to make a reasonable assessment based on what the Government are saying. Before we have the debate again this time next year, the Government must try harder and take on board the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Human Rights to produce that qualitative evidence. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Amendments 75 and 76 belong together. They amend Schedule 3, which details the appointment of coroners. In particular, paragraph 2 allows the Lord Chancellor to appoint assistant coroners for an area. Before doing so, he must consult the Chief Coroner and every local authority whose area will be affected.</p>

<a name="90623-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="090623117000002"></a>Our changes would make the senior coroner a consultee as well. Under paragraph 1 the senior coroner for an area is appointed by the local authority with the consent of the Chief Coroner and the Lord Chancellor. Given this deliberate interlocking of all the relevant parties, it is a curious omission that the senior coroner should not be consulted on the appointment of his assistants. It may be that the local authority is deemed to represent the views and interests of the senior coroner, whom it appointed. However, once that person has been established in the post, it would seem prudent, not to say courteous, to involve him in the process of appointing an assistant.</p>

<a name="90623-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="090623117000003"></a>Amendment 77 is more important. Paragraph 3 of Schedule 3 sets the eligibility criteria for coroners. It allows for legally qualified coroners&#151;that is to say, those who,</p>
<ul><a name="090623117000149"></a>&#147;satisfy the judicial-appointment eligibility condition&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="090623117000004"></a>but not for medical practitioners to become coroners. This is a reversal of current practice and would rule out many very able people. In another place the Minister, Bridget Prentice, addressed the latter point by saying:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a><a name="090623117000082"></a>&#147;In future it will be increasingly important for coroners to be legally qualified. Given the duty of investigations that satisfy article 2, legal qualifications will become even more essential. They will also give the coroners the skill to examine evidence and conduct investigations in the most effective way&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090623117000005"></a>She continued:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a><a name="090623117000083"></a>&#147;At the moment, a small number of coroners are both medically and legally qualified, and about the same number are medically qualified only. The Coroners&#146; Society tells me that there are about four of each. Under the reformed system, it will not be necessary for the coroner to be medically qualified, as the medical examiners will be on hand to provide independent medical expertise. However, those who are currently medically rather than legally qualified will retain their posts under the reformed system and will simply be exempted from the legal qualification requirement. They will already have picked up forensic skills through experience and training, and that is not something that we want to lose&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons Coroners and Justice Bill Committee, 24/2/09; col. 310.].</p>

<p><a name="090623117000078"></a>As the Minister admitted that the, albeit, small number of medically qualified coroners do a good job and have picked up forensic skills through experience and training, why is it assumed that newly appointed medical coroners could not do the same? I beg to move.</p>

The current system is that the coroner for a particular area chooses his deputy coroner and his assistant deputy coroners. It is important and he knows who are the suitable people to ask. It is possible that from further afield they would have to seek the advice in any event of a senior coroner for an area. It seems that they should be asking the coroner of the area who he would recommend. They do not have to accept it, but in the areas it is important.</p>

<a name="90623-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="090623117000008"></a>Taking the second point, there are members of the medical profession who have acted extremely efficiently as coroners. They have acted with enormous enthusiasm and energy to learn about the law. Lawyers have to learn about medicine; in particular, lawyers sitting as coroners need to know something about how to understand what the medical examiner is saying or about medical evidence that may be given. It is possibly unjust to the medical profession to assume that a distinguished doctor would not be able to pick up as much law as a distinguished lawyer picks up medicine.</p>

I have an amendment in this group, Amendment 110. It was tabled after some discussion with INQUEST, which feels that the Chief Coroner should be a high court judge. I do not feel that its reasons are as tight as have been represented, but it is concerned that the Chief Coroner&#146;s role should involve a High Court judge because it is a requirement in relation to the chairs of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission and the president of the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Tribunal; it should therefore involve someone of that same or equivalent standing, in view of the powers that he or she will have and the critical role that the Chief Coroner will play in the overall system. I would be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

Amendments 75 and 76 would compel the Lord Chancellor to directly consult the local senior coroner as well as the Chief Coroner and relevant local authorities before making a decision as to the number of area coroners and minimum number of assistant coroners that should be in that area. I understand from the noble Lord that his concern is that the Lord Chancellor should not impose coroner quotas with no regard for what senior coroners feel is needed in their area. Our problem with these amendments is that they would add a layer of consultation that we believe is not necessary to have in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90623-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="090623117000011"></a>In practice, a senior coroner&#146;s view will be taken into account as regards how many area and assistant coroners are required, by virtue of the Lord Chancellor consulting the Chief Coroner and local authorities concerned. First, the Chief Coroner, as head of the coroner service, will want to ensure that there are sufficient coroners and resources more generally to ensure that the standards of service he or she sets can be met across the country. It is highly likely that the Chief Coroner will be appointed during the  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1550"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1550</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>implementation period of the Bill, but it is not possible at this stage to state precisely when that will be. He or she will therefore have the opportunity to work with coroners, as all current district coroners will, as part of the transitional arrangements in paragraph 3 to Schedule 20, become senior coroners when the Bill comes into force. The Chief Coroner will gain an overview of how many area or assistant coroners will be needed as new areas are created across the country. Under the Bill the Lord Chancellor must also consult the local authority that employs and funds the coroners, when making his decision. The local authority will be best placed to ensure that any particular local factors are taken into account.</p>

<a name="90623-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="090623117000012"></a>Amendment 77 would restore the existing position whereby a coroner can be medically qualified only. We understand the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, about losing medical expertise in a reformed system. We do not believe that will be the case; if anything, medical expertise will be enhanced by the Bill. The noble Lord quoted my honourable friend in another place. My arguments are very much the same as hers. We believe it is becoming increasingly important for coroners to be legally qualified. The noble Lord referred to Article 2 in that regard. Legal qualifications, together with in-service training, will equip coroners with the necessary skills to conduct an investigation into a death in the most effective way, to weigh up evidence and reach the appropriate determination. However, the case working and court craft skills accumulated by current coroners who are medically qualified only&#151;four of the current district coroners come into this category&#151;will not be squandered. As part of the transitional arrangements, the four coroners who are medically qualified will become senior coroners for their area when the Bill comes into force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="090623117000013"></a>Another reason that it will not be necessary for coroners to be medically qualified in the reformed system is that, under Clause 19, medical examiners will be on hand&#151;as we have debated this afternoon&#151;to provide independent medical expertise to all coroners, especially in medically complex cases, in addition to their main role of scrutinising deaths which are not referred to coroners. This is supplementary to the expertise that will continue to be provided by pathologists. This increased local medical support&#151;that is an important part of the Bill&#151;together with national support from the Chief Coroner&#146;s national medical adviser, will help ensure coroners have medical expertise to hand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="090623117000014"></a>The final amendment in this group, Amendment 110, would make circuit judges ineligible for appointment as the Chief Coroner. The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, may have been prompted to table this amendment by a concern that a circuit judge would not have sufficiently senior judicial status to be the head of the coroner system in England and Wales. While we, of course, agree that the person the Lord Chief Justice appoints as Chief Coroner should have sufficient seniority to head the coroner system, we believe this amendment would be unduly restrictive. The person appointed as Chief Coroner may always be a High Court rather than a circuit judge, but we would not want to put a blanket restriction on senior circuit judges being considered, which is what this amendment would do. It might unnecessarily narrow the pool of qualified

The most important consideration for the Lord Chief Justice will be that the person he chooses as Chief Coroner should have the judicial and leadership skills and competencies to carry out the role. The Bill as drafted provides for this and ensures that the Lord Chief Justice can appoint the best-equipped person for the job.</p>

<a name="90623-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="090623117000015"></a>In this group is government Amendment 218E, which I will move in due course. This is an important transitional provision to enable us to move to larger full-time coroner areas in as efficient a way as possible. A current, solely medically qualified coroner, or any coroner over 70, will be eligible to stay in post if their jurisdiction merges with another in the reformed coroner system.</p>

<a name="90623-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="090623117000016"></a>As I have said, currently four coroners, plus a handful of deputy and assistant deputy coroners, are medically qualified. Although we cannot foresee how many coroners over 70 will be practising when their areas are merged, there are likely to be very few, as most coroners step down between the ages of 65 and 70. Despite the relatively small numbers involved, this amendment is important as it will enable us to make the most of serving coroners and the experience that they have built up.</p>

<a name="90623-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="090623117000017"></a>I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and other noble Lords will not press their amendments.</p>

<p><a name="st_152"></a>
<a name="090623117000018"></a><b><a name="90623-0014.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="090623117000266"></a>Lord Kingsland:</b> I thank the Minister for his response, and the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, and the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, for their support.</p>

<a name="90623-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="090623117000019"></a>The Minister drew attention to the fact that I quoted a substantial passage by the Minister in another place. I did that partly out of a sporting instinct, to put the argument of the other side, and partly to save the Minister from rehearsing it in your Lordships&#146; House. He made a cogent point by drawing to my attention the new regime which embraces the concept of the medical adviser. I should like to consider Amendment 77 in that context when taking a view on whether I should bring it back on Report.</p>

<a name="90623-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="090623117000020"></a>However, I feel much less sympathetic to the Minister&#146;s honeyed words about Amendments 75 and 76. As I understand it, the new system is supposed to be some ideal balance between the centre and the periphery. The Bill introduces an overarching Chief Coroner and deputy chief coroner and, under that, increasing degrees of localism. As the Minister knows, we have supported that concept. It seems perfectly sensible for the Lord Chancellor, in deciding to appoint a new assistant coroner, to consult the local authority in the area in which the new assistant coroner is going to work. However, if the local authority is consulted, why should the senior coroner for the area not be consulted as well? The Lord Chancellor is already going down to the grass roots so far as the local authority is concerned; so why is it so much more difficult for him to go down to the grass roots with respect to the senior coroner? I find that response uncharacteristically irrational of the Minister, to such a degree that I wish to test the opinion of the Committee on Amendment 75.</p>

<a name="90623-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="090623117000022"></a>Clause 24 states that the relevant authority must secure the provision of whatever staff are needed by the coroner to carry out his functions. Implicit in that is the recognition that out-of-hours staff must be provided if necessary: for example, in the context of a non-invasive MRI scan. However, it is worth emphasising that coroners may be called on at any time; and it is vital that they can function properly in those circumstances. That necessitates a substantial commitment of time, preparation and, not least, money, from the authority.</p>

<a name="90623-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="090623117000023"></a>This suggests a number of questions for the Government. What role will the Chief Coroner have in helping to secure that commitment? What happens should there be a financial shortfall? What recourse would the senior coroner have should the provision of staff be inadequate? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_155"></a>
<a name="090623117000024"></a><b><a name="90623-0014.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="090623117000269"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b> This amendment seeks to ensure that coroners&#146; officers and other staff are available outside normal working hours.</p>

<a name="90623-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="090623117000025"></a>Clause 24 already states that staff must be available to enable a coroner to carry out their functions. To do this, coroners must ensure that either they or a member of their staff are on call 24 hours a day almost entirely to ensure that a post-mortem can be urgently carried out where necessary and that arrangements are made to inform the family of the coroner&#146;s decision. This already occurs in the best areas under the present system, and coroners in particular already have a requirement, in Rule 4 of the Coroners Rules, to ensure that they or a deputy coroner are available at all times. In a reformed system, we expect the same level of cover. Indeed, the effect of Rule 4 is likely to be repeated in rules to be made under Clause 36.</p>

<a name="90623-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="090623117000026"></a>The Government fully accept that there is work to be done in the implementation stage of the Bill to ensure that coroners have the necessary support from coroners&#146; officers and other staff to enable them to meet the raised expectations that we have of them in the quality of service that is provided to bereaved families. I assure noble Lords that this is one of our main priorities, not least because it is the function of such officers to deliver most of the services to families, under the guidance of the coroner, which are set out in the charter for the bereaved. I think it would be most expeditious if I were to answer the noble Lord&#146;s specific questions by letter. I hope, in view of the assurances that I have given, that he will agree to withdraw his amendment.</p>

We do not take any issue with the creation of these powers. However, when equivalent powers are available to the police, they are required to submit themselves to the Government&#146;s code of practice. We would seek some guidance from the Minister as to whether some similar safeguards would be set out in the case of coroners because is not clear to us that, if the police have to abide by a code of practice, why it should not also apply to coroners with these substantial but, as we understand them, necessary powers. I beg to move.</p>

I understand and share the wish to ensure that any powers of search, entry and seizure that coroners have under Schedule 4 are used proportionately. However, I can reassure the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, that the Bill already goes some way to ensuring that these powers will be used appropriately.</p>

<a name="90623-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="090623117000032"></a>Clauses 35(3)(h) and 35(3)(i) make provision for regulations equivalent to provisions in Sections 15, 16 and 21 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. In its eighth report, which was published on 20 March 2009, the Joint Committee on Human Rights expressed the view that some of these safeguards on the exercise of power of search, entry and seizure should be in the Bill rather than in regulations. I have considered its arguments very carefully. However, I remain confidant that these regulations will provide the safeguards that the noble Lord seeks on the exercising of the power to enter and search premises and seize evidence. I can also offer the reassurance that we intend to consult on regulations and guidance once the Bill receives Royal Assent. In addition, regulations will then be subject to the negative resolution procedure.</p>

<a name="90623-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="090623117000033"></a>It is also likely that the Chief Coroner will issue guidance to coroners and their staff on the use of entry, search and seizure powers, which is akin to codes of practice issued in relation to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. However, as with other guidance from the Chief Coroner, I believe that this should be left to the Chief Coroner&#146;s judicial discretion when he or she takes up post, rather than be in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="090623117000034"></a>By way of reassurance, noble Lords may also be aware that Schedule 4 requires any coroner who needs to use search, entry or seizure powers as part of their investigation to obtain the written authorisation of the Chief Coroner or his nominee before doing so.

But it suggests that one has to take all of this on trust. What we have requested in the Bill was not the content of a code of practice, but just the requirement of a code of practice, which does not seem to be a terrible lot to ask for. However, I hear what the Minister says about some other elements in the Bill pointing in the right direction and I shall look carefully at the precise wording that he has used in that regard to see whether or not we will come to this matter at the next stage. With that in mind, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

For the families and the community as a whole, there are a number of important purposes for coroners&#146; inquests. It is not just a matter of the law being seen to be addressed. It is also important that bereaved families, friends and others feel some kind of satisfaction for themselves, which we can provide through the coroners&#146; inquests, not necessarily because particular guilt is identified, although that can be valuable, but to ensure that the same thing does not happen again for other people as individuals or society as a whole. It is not infrequent for us to hear it said by families or friends, subsequent to the loss of a loved one, that they did not die in vain. We often hear it said in respect, of course, of our military personnel, but we hear in other circumstances as well that their death has made a difference in some way, however it came about.</p>

<a name="90623-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="090623117000037"></a>It is also important for society as a whole that when deaths occur, if there are lessons to be learnt, those lessons are seriously taken up and not just put on a shelf in a report and forgotten about. There are a number of ways in which we could try through this Bill to press that. In these five amendments, there are two separate ways to address that. Amendments 91, 96 and 131 taken together identify the possibility of the coroner making material available, presenting it to relevant persons, forwarding it to the Chief Coroner  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1560"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1560</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and so on. But then there is a requirement on the Chief Coroner to collect that information, to seek out appropriate information from coroners around the country and to provide that to the Lord Chancellor and thence to Parliament. It has identified the timescales in which this might be done and so on.</p>

<a name="90623-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="090623117000038"></a>Another way to do this is described in Amendments 93 and 94, which are in a sense more prescriptive because they require that the coroners forward the information, which would be put together by the Chief Coroner and provided to Parliament. These are two similar ways of doing things: one simply puts the responsibility for drawing together the material at a higher level and is more permissive of the lower level; the other requires coroners at the local level to forward the information.</p>

<a name="90623-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="090623117000039"></a>However, whichever approach one takes, the purpose of the amendments is to ensure that if there are lessons to be learnt, those lessons will be taken seriously. For example, if someone has been negligent or has not been attending properly to a matter of health or safety or to some kind of procedure, the coroner will have some responsibility&#151;and if not the coroner, the Chief Coroner will certainly have responsibility&#151;to identify the problem or the pattern of the problem. He will be able to ensure that the people who need to know get to know, and that eventually it makes its way through to Parliament so that we are able to monitor these requirements and to hold people accountable for what they have done and for how they might learn from mistakes or inadequacies of the past. As I say, there are in these amendments at least two&#151;one might argue three&#151;ways in which this can be done.</p>

<a name="90623-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="090623117000040"></a>We look with interest to see how the Minister will respond because it may be that he has already given the matter some consideration. We certainly hope so. I beg to move.</p>

That is the principle behind the wording in the amendments. Amendments 117 and 118 concern the report that is to be laid before the House and require that appropriate action is taken in response to it. The amendments require that reports do not get shelved and gather dust, as so often happens&#151;we know it and we see it only too often&#151;but that they are acted upon. They establish a kind of audit loop whereby change is brought about.</p>

<a name="90623-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="090623117000042"></a>There are several aspects of the anguish that bereaved families go through that never hit the press and never come to light. One which might seem tangential to these amendments&#151;but which I would like to put on the record&#151;is the way in which we record what happens in road deaths and the way in which we respond to the enormous catalogue of them which occur year after year. Action is often not taken appropriately. There is a great furore if there is a medical area, and rightly so; there is a great furore if there is child abuse, and rightly so; but we have become numb and almost inured to this repetitive toll of death on our roads.</p>

<a name="90623-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="090623117000043"></a>This has been brought to my attention by a bereaved relative who wrote a moving letter to me on this subject knowing that we were debating the Bill. In  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1561"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1561</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>memory of her son, Adam, who was catastrophically killed in a hit and run, she suggested that we should not call them &#147;accidents&#148;; we should call them &#147;road traffic deaths&#148; and, when people do not die, we should call them &#147;road traffic incidents&#148;. She makes a very important point because it is not an accident if it is a hit and run. If you were genuinely in an accident you would be absolutely devastated; you would leap out of the car and want to get all the help that you can; you would feel terrible about it. But some people behave recklessly towards other members of society and kill people in the process and perhaps we need to change our language. As I read the letter, it also struck me that we need to respond to the reports. Too many times the newspapers have printed &#147;lessons will be learnt&#148;, &#147;things will have to change&#148;, and yet years later nothing has changed. I hope the Government will consider strengthening the role of reports, strengthen the ability to take action afterwards and ensure that people are empowered. What is already in the Bill may seem strong, but I hope that the Government will consider strengthening it a little more so that action is taken after an event, rather than people walking away from an inquest knowing what has been recommended but not feeling honour bound and law bound to do something about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="090623117000045"></a>Given that one of the chief benefits of the coronial system must surely be the capacity to learn from mistakes, this is, in our, view a very lax requirement in the Bill. Our Amendment 92 changes the discretion to a duty. If the coroner feels that someone who is in a position to make changes which might prevent another death has the power to do so, it ought to be incumbent on the coroner to act on that opinion.</p>

<a name="90623-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="090623117000046"></a>Amendment 95 is a follow-up provision. It allows the coroner to keep an eye on what action is being taken on his recommendation. While the amendment does not, in fact, confer any substantive power to compel action to be taken, the pressure it creates would presumably keep the matter from being kicked into the long grass.</p>

<a name="90623-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="090623117000047"></a>In support of this argument I can do no better than turn to the speech of my honourable friend Mr Henry Bellingham in Committee in another place.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_108"></a><a name="090623117000142"></a>&#147;If one considers what happens elsewhere&#151;for example, in New South Wales&#151; recommendations are an integral part of the inquest process and are logged in a detailed document at the end of the inquest. The document is then available to the public and is tabled in Parliament. Doing so obviously exerts substantial political pressure on the Government to take action. In Ontario, for example, the inquest jury gives a verdict and makes recommendations, which are published centrally and sent to all the parties involved. Implementation is monitored annually by a department of the chief coroner&#146;s office. Although our amendment does not go as far as the provisions in Victoria, New South Wales or Ontario, it is a sensible move in the right direction. It would put a statutory duty on the coroner to make those reports. It would put the duty

<p><a name="090623117000079"></a>I shall await the Minister&#146;s reply with keen anticipation.</p>

<p><a name="st_171"></a>
<a name="090623117000048"></a><b><a name="90623-0016.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="090623117000285"></a>Baroness Butler-Sloss:</b> I was moved by the powerful plea of the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff, but I want to speak to the two amendments from the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. I find it extraordinary, in paragraph 6 of Schedule 4, that where a senior coroner finds that an investigation,</p>
<ul><a name="090623117000150"></a>&#147;gives rise to a concern that circumstances creating a risk of other deaths will occur, or will continue to exist... and ... action should be taken to prevent the occurrence or continuation of such circumstances ... the coroner may report&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090623117000080"></a>The wording of the paragraph is strong, but its conclusion is weak. That makes for an odd mix. If it is of sufficient importance under paragraph 6(1)(a), (b) and (c), then one would expect the coroner to have an obligation to report. The other amendment, Amendment 95, is a helpful addendum to what seems to be the absolutely necessary Amendment 92.</p>

<p><a name="st_172"></a>
<a name="090623117000049"></a><b><a name="90623-0016.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="090623117000286"></a>Lord Bach:</b> We wholeheartedly endorse the laudable objectives of all noble Lords who have moved or spoken to amendments in this group. The objective is to ensure that coroners are as effective as possible in their role in preventing future deaths. I reassure the Committee that in our view the Bill already provides for the measures that are proposed, although I accept that this may not be readily apparent from the way that Part 1 of the Bill is structured.</p>

<a name="90623-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="090623117000050"></a>The first part of Amendment 91 seeks to extend the powers of coroners under paragraph 6 of Schedule 4 so that they may make recommendations, as well as issue reports to any person, in order to prevent future deaths. We believe that this is implicit in the existing drafting of the Bill, and that any report issued under that paragraph may include recommendations to prevent future deaths.</p>

<a name="90623-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="090623117000051"></a>At present, coroners do not have any express power to make recommendations. Nevertheless, coroners make recommendations in reports made under rule 43 of the Coroners Rules 1984, revised, as we heard earlier, as recently as July 2008. Coroners are in no doubt that they may include recommendations in these reports, and frequently so do. The indications are that the new system is working well. My right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor will publish the first batch of reports and responses before the Summer Recess.</p>

<a name="90623-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="090623117000052"></a>Staying with this issue, Amendment 92 could compel the coroner to make a report to prevent future deaths, rather than merely to permit this. Our concern is that this might fetter a coroner&#146;s judicial discretion in deciding when it is appropriate to issue such a report. I understand the points made so cogently by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, but we think that where we can leave it to the discretion of the coroner, then as a matter of principle we should. In this case it would be better to leave such matters to the coroner&#146;s discretion because in our view the coroner will do the right thing.</p>

<a name="90623-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="090623117000053"></a>Amendment 95 would give the coroner the power to request that the report&#146;s recipient provide an update after three months on action that they have taken. Amendment 94, in its turn, states that the report&#146;s  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1563"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1563</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>recipient should provide an update within a period of 56 days. We agree that setting a time limit for a response, even an interim one, is important. That is what we did when we revised the current relevant coroners rule last year, and it states that the response to a coroner&#146;s report must be given within 56 days. I confirm that this rule will not be diluted as a result of the Bill, but I believe that, as now, such matters can appropriately be left to secondary legislation.</p>

<a name="90623-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="090623117000054"></a>I move on to the second part of Amendment 91 and to Amendment 96, which seek to ensure that a national record is maintained by the Chief Coroner of all reports and recommendations to prevent future deaths, and that a digest of all such reports and recommendations is published annually. We wholeheartedly endorse such an approach and refer the noble Lord to paragraph 6(3) of Schedule 4 and Clause 29(4)(b), which already make like provision. Together, those provisions already provide for the Chief Coroner to receive all reports to prevent future deaths and the responses of the recipients of such reports, and for the Chief Coroner then to summarise them every year in his or her annual report to the Lord Chancellor.</p>

<a name="90623-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="090623117000055"></a>Amendment 93, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, would require the senior coroner to send a copy of any report to prevent future deaths to the relatives of the deceased and any other interested person and to the Lord Chancellor, who may publish it. This is an unnecessary level of detail for primary legislation. Under Rule 43, bereaved people and other interested persons already receive reports and the responses to them. This too will not be diluted under the Bill.</p>

<a name="90623-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="090623117000056"></a>As I have mentioned, Clause 29(4)(b) already provides for publication of a summary of the reports. I hope the noble Lord may in some way be reassured that the procedure for reports to prevent future deaths set out in his amendments is already catered for in the Bill and what will be the associated secondary legislation.</p>

<a name="90623-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="090623117000057"></a>Staying with the Chief Coroner&#146;s annual report to the Lord Chancellor, Amendment 117, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, would require the report to contain an analysis of jury findings, and an analysis of reports to prevent future deaths and responses to them. Again, I want to do my best to persuade the noble Baroness that the policy behind her amendment is very likely to be followed in practice. We would certainly expect the Chief Coroner&#146;s annual report to contain details of verdicts in different coroner areas. Clause 29(4)(b) already provides for a summary of reports to prevent deaths, and of the responses to them, to be included in the annual report.</p>

<a name="90623-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="090623117000058"></a>In the course of summarising and assessing all of these matters for his or her annual report, it is inevitable that the Chief Coroner will provide some analysis of the data he or she receives from coroners.</p>

<a name="90623-0016.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="090623117000059"></a>Amendment 118 would require the Lord Chancellor to take &#147;any action&#148; he thought &#147;appropriate&#148; in response to the Chief Coroner&#146;s annual report. I will explain what I believe will happen in practice and why this amendment is unnecessary. Clause 29(7) already provides for the Lord Chancellor to request advice from the Chief Coroner on any matter he wishes regarding the operation of the coroner system. The  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1564"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1564</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Chief Coroner must then respond to the Lord Chancellor&#146;s request. This is in addition to the annual report which the Chief Coroner will provide.</p>

<a name="90623-0016.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="090623117000060"></a>I am sure that any Lord Chancellor would wish to take whatever action is possible to support the Chief Coroner&#146;s analysis of particular problems. Certainly the present Lord Chancellor will wish to do so, particularly in the early years as the new system beds in.</p>

<a name="90623-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="090623117000061"></a>Amendment 131 is an important amendment as it sets out in detail some objectives. We share entirely the objectives to ensure that in the reformed system the Chief Coroner, in conjunction with the medical examiner service, is well placed to identify clusters or trends of deaths, so that he or she can determine whether action is needed, at a local or national level, to prevent deaths in the future. Amendment 131 seeks to empower the Chief Coroner to order an investigation into the causes of a cluster of deaths, or a trend, and send the results of the investigation to an appropriate authority which could take action to prevent subsequent deaths. It would also provide for the Chief Coroner to require information from coroners and medical examiners and send the Lord Chancellor an annual report, which may include details of trends identified and actions taken. I want to persuade the noble Lord that this proposed new clause is unnecessary.</p>

<a name="90623-0016.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="090623117000062"></a>I will focus first on the proposed new subsections (1) to (3). Coroners regulations made under Clause 35 already provide for the Chief Coroner to require information from coroners. However, I would like to clarify that this will not extend to medical examiners, as the amendment suggests it should. The Chief Coroner will have no formal authority over the medical examiners, as his or her jurisdiction extends only to those deaths which are subject to investigation by coroners, namely those deaths of violent, unnatural or unknown cause, or those that occurred when someone was in state detention.</p>

<a name="90623-0016.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="090623117000063"></a>One of the Chief Coroner&#146;s key roles, however, as the national head of the reformed coroner service, will be to review national statistics on deaths and coroner verdicts. Working with the head of the medical examiner service and his or her own national medical adviser, the Chief Coroner will identify patterns or trends. In this way the Chief Coroner will be able to identify where there has been a particular cluster of deaths, or where it seems that reporting to a coroner is high, low or otherwise unusual in any area.</p>

<a name="90623-0016.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="090623117000064"></a>I return to paragraph 6 of Schedule 4. Under that paragraph, the Chief Coroner will receive copies of all reports, and responses from organisations to those reports, to prevent future deaths and not just those that appear to be part of a trend or cluster. This will ensure that the Chief Coroner has oversight of the causes of all the deaths that are subject to reports and of the action being proposed to prevent deaths in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="090623117000065"></a>Subsections (4) to (6) of the proposed new clause deal with investigations where trends in deaths are identified. The Chief Coroner&#146;s work in identifying trends may include the commissioning of research or co-ordinating of research requests. These are important functions which the Chief Coroner's new national  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1565"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1565</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>leadership role will make possible. We intend to develop protocols regarding research as we implement the Bill&#146;s provisions. This will include protocols about the action to be taken following the receipt of an independent report. I hope that noble Lords agree that that is more proportionate than detailing provisions for formal investigations on the face of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90623-0016.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="090623117000066"></a>Proposed new subsection (6) states that an authority that receives a report of an investigation carried out under proposed new subsection (4) must say what it intends to do to prevent future deaths. We think that that is overly prescriptive as there may be no further action that the organisation can take. Already under paragraph 6 of Schedule 4, an organisation that receives a coroner's report arising from an individual case to prevent future deaths must respond to the coroner, who will then send a copy of the response to the Chief Coroner. We think that that provides flexibility for a recipient to respond by describing action that it has already taken or setting out why no action can be taken if that is justifiably the case. We think that flexibility is important.</p>

<a name="90623-0016.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="090623117000067"></a>Finally, on subsections (7) and (8) of the proposed new clause in Amendment 131, Clause 29 already places a duty on the Chief Coroner to submit an annual report to the Lord Chancellor. Such reports must include any matters that either the Chief Coroner or the Lord Chancellor deems appropriate. We can be confident, therefore, that the Chief Coroner will use his or her annual report to publicise any trends in deaths and how they are being addressed.</p>

<a name="90623-0016.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="090623117000068"></a>I have attempted to reassure the Committee that our aim is to identify trends or clusters of deaths and to take action to prevent them, and that it is achievable within the framework already set out in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="st_173"></a>
<a name="090623117000069"></a><b><a name="90623-0016.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="090623117000287"></a>Lord Kingsland:</b> Perhaps I may return to paragraph 6(1) of Schedule 4, a matter to which the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, also addressed herself. I simply want to understand exactly what the Minister is saying.</p>

<a name="90623-0016.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="090623117000070"></a>Here we have a situation where a senior coroner has been conducting an investigation. That investigation gives rise to a concern that there are circumstances that create a risk of other deaths, or that the risk will continue to exist in the future, and&#151;and here I quote paragraph 6(1)(c)&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="090623117000151"></a>&#147;in the coroner&#146;s opinion, action should be taken to prevent the occurrence or continuation of such circumstances, or to eliminate or reduce the risk of death created by such circumstances&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090623117000071"></a>So he has reached that rather devastating conclusion, yet the legislation goes on to say that his obligation is only that he,</p>
<ul><a name="090623117000152"></a>&#147;may report the matter to a person who the coroner believes may have power to take such action&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90623-0016.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="090623117000072"></a>The Minister justified the use of the word &#147;may&#148; by saying that it would be wrong to compel a judge to do anything in these circumstances. I must confess to being rather puzzled by that response. This Bill is littered with obligations imposed on coroners at all levels. So why in this case would it be wrong to say &#147;must&#148; rather than &#147;may&#148;?</p>

<a name="90623-0016.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="090623117000073"></a>Judges have discretion in relation to their judicial tasks; but in the context of coming to their conclusions in court, they are often faced with obligations. For  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1566"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column 1566</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>example, a judge is obliged, before he sentences somebody, to take into account a probation report. That is not a discretion that he has, but an obligation. Why should judges have obligations laid down in legislation, whereas the coroner, in this case, is not obliged to report the matter to a relevant person?</p>

The point was bolstered earlier by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss. I will take that point back and consider carefully the argument that has been put. Perhaps I may talk to the noble Lord about this issue before we return on Report.</p>

<p><a name="st_175"></a>

When I introduced it, I said that a number of amendments in the group laid out various ways in which we could try to ensure that what came out of a coroner&#146;s inquiry and inquest was not forgotten or lost. That is the key thing. There are various ways in which it can be done. It can be done by putting an obligation on the coroner. It can be done by putting an obligation on the Chief Coroner. It can be done by putting an obligation on all of us to try to ensure that, when reports come annually from the Chief Coroner, they are properly scrutinised.</p>

<a name="90623-0016.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="090623117000077"></a>What the Minister has done in his final response is to indicate something of the route and direction that may be most efficacious. I will take that away and think about it, so that when we come back and see what the Minister&#146;s thoughts are, we might strengthen it, so that what is learnt is not forgotten but acted upon and implemented for the good of the community. As I said, there is often little more that one can do for the family and friends who have lost loved ones by whatever means. However, if they know that it is not forgotten and someone else will not suffer, that can often be a worthwhile and important thing, and something of great value to the community as a whole. With the positive encouragement that the Minister is going to think about this and come back&#151;and all of us can think and come back&#151;I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_187"></a>
<a name="090623121000001"></a><b><a name="90623-0017.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="090623121000033"></a>Baroness Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde:</b> In moving Amendment 128A, I will speak also to Amendments 132A and 206A. These are not technical amendments. They go back to Second Reading and my concern for the families of military personnel who have lost their lives in the service of the country. I accept, however, that amending the Bill will affect all families. My concern is that the Bill is intended to make the system more accessible, understanding and compassionate to families. It is particularly relevant for military families who lose their loved ones many hundreds or thousands of miles away and, as we are all aware, often have to wait a long time for an inquest. When multiple fatalities are involved, many of those families have to travel a long way to go to the inquest. It is very important that they are not faced with feeling&#151;as many of them do, to judge from a consultation that I was fortunate enough to be part of last summer&#151;shut out of the system, and that it is not accessible to them. They come away from the inquest all too often feeling that they have not got to the root of what happened. They really do not understand fully; do not feel that they have been treated fairly; and have not been part of what could have been part of the process of healing and moving on from a very traumatic period in their lives.</p>

<a name="90623-0017.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="090623121000002"></a>My first amendment would mean that the Lord Chancellor would be required to consult those he thinks appropriate, arising from any proposed amendment to subsection (2) on page 18. There are some quite profound statements here. I give as examples a decision to resume an investigation; a decision whether there should be a jury at an inquest; a decision not to request a post-mortem examination. Those are all profound points that go to the core of the issue. My amendment makes a simple but important request: to seek consultation with those families before changes are made. Amendment 132, to which I am speaking, would also require consultation before regulations are drawn up.</p>

<a name="90623-0017.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="090623121000003"></a>Amendment 206A on page 107, provides a new clause that requires the officials specified in the amendment to be consulted. They are three straightforward amendments. I will not trouble the Committee at this late hour going into a detailed case in support of it, because they are straightforward. With that, I beg to move.</p>

I hope that it should be taken as read that when making secondary legislation the relevant Minister or Chief Coroner, as the case may be, would consult relevant interested parties, including coroners, local authorities, coroners&#146; offices and third party organisations. With regards to Amendment 128, I remind the Committee that an order made under that clause to alter the grounds on which an appeal can be made to the Chief Coroner will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. As such, the drafting of such an order would need to be debated and approved by both Houses.</p>

<a name="90623-0017.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a><a name="090623121000006"></a>In addition, for regulations made under Clause 36 the Lord Chancellor must also have the agreement of the Lord Chief Justice or his nominee. It is envisaged that the Chief Coroner will also be involved with the process along with the new statutory coronial advisory council, which will comprise all those with a strong interest in the coroner&#146;s service. It is our intention when the Bill receives Royal Assent that we will as soon as possible begin an extensive process of consultation that will continue for 12 to 24 months to inform the secondary legislation and associated guidance for which the Bill provides. The secondary legislation and guidance covering a wide public interest will be subject to written consultation during which the public and all other stakeholders will have the standard 12 weeks in which to respond. However, there will inevitably be some secondary legislation that is technical or of limited general interest, which will be subject to more targeted consultation. I hope that the comments give adequate reassurance to the noble Baroness and that there will be consultation on secondary legislation for which the Bill provides, and that she will withdraw the amendment.</p>

I declare an interest as patron of the mother and child clinic in the Panjshir Valley.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000004"></a>With the problems created in Afghanistan due to the war over the past three or four decades, there exists, especially within the UK, a keen interest to help the people of Afghanistan to better their lives and develop a strong and stable nation. One of the steps to creating economic strengths and stability within Afghanistan is through agriculture, and one of the successful substitutes for growing opium poppies is the cultivation of pomegranates.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000005"></a>In 2007, Afghanistan produced 95 per cent of the world&#146;s refined opiates, with a street value of some $38 billion. On average, 90 per cent of the heroin in the UK stems from Afghanistan. The cost to the UK alone of the heroin problem is &#163;16.4 billion per annum. Furthermore, opium cultivation now takes place almost exclusively in provinces most affected by insurgency, with Helmand being the most profitable. Therefore, a substitution would also seriously damage Taliban financing. The UNODC said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09062370000055"></a>&#147;There is now a perfect overlap between zones of high risk and regions of high opium cultivation. Since drugs are funding insurgency, and insurgency enables drug cultivation, insurgency and narcotics must be fought together&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062370000006"></a>Since the Russian invasion of 1979, agriculture has received new impetus, and lately Afghanistan has become poised to become a major exporter of pomegranates, a traditional crop for centuries. Foundations such as POM354 are already in place, trying to persuade more farmers and tribal elders to make this transition from the growth of opium poppies to pomegranates and to help meet the need of farmers.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000007"></a>DfID recently launched its country plan for the next four years for Afghanistan. This plan sets out the framework for Britain&#146;s aid to Afghanistan, with a pledge of more than &#163;127 million per year between now and 2013. This is worth &#163;30 million a year being used to help farmers move away from opium cultivation. As a result, other nations are beginning to take interest, such as the US, Canada and the Netherlands.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000008"></a>The Foreign and Commonwealth Office acknowledges that eliminating the opium poppy without developing viable legal livelihoods is not sustainable, and it is therefore suggested that the focus should be on substitution, mainly by pomegranates. The case for replacing opium poppies is clear, but why with pomegranates? Afghanistan is known to have the best pomegranates in the world. Kandahar in the south produces perhaps the world&#146;s best. The Afghan Government are currently implementing a $12 million US-funded initiative intended to modernise and expand the country&#146;s pomegranate industry.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000009"></a>However, many farmers still need to be persuaded to make the transition from poppies to pomegranates. Fourteen of the 34 provinces are poppy-free and I hope that more will follow that trend. The key organisation doing this is POM354, which was founded in Britain by James Brett. Its concept is simple, and as a result, has led to its huge popularity within Afghanistan and the rest of the world. In a short space of time, POM354 has managed to establish substantial consensus within the Government and among farmers. In November 2008, 22,000 farmers signed up to the POM354 scheme and, as a result, in March 2009, 40,000 pomegranate trees were planted. Furthermore, as a result of aid and work by foundations such as POM354, Afghanistan as a whole saw a 6 per cent decrease in opium production between 2007 and 2009.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000010"></a>The goal now is for POM354 to obtain further financial support from organisations in donor countries. It is generally accepted that there is only a short window to alter Afghanistan&#146;s agriculture in favour of pomegranates. Without outside aid, the project would not be able to become operational, as the farmers need to be sustained during the three-year period of conversion&#151;the time between the saplings being planted and becoming fruitful. POM354&#146;s target is over the next 10 to 15 years to develop 175,000 hectares of mature pomegranate orchards generating a substantial income. Through its various schemes, farmers will create their own infrastructure to facilitate this new agricultural development and, in the process, generate greater revenue per hectare than the poppy. Will the Government continue to support alternative viable crops? As a result, the heroin supply would drastically fall and the Afghan people would have a development

<p><a name="09062370000011"></a><b><a name="90623-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09062370000069"></a>Lord Ramsbotham:</b> I apologise for not putting my name down, but I was concerned about my possible involvement in the Coroners and Justice Bill. However, I seize the opportunity of the gap to support every word that the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, said. One always listens with interest and admiration to what she says.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000012"></a>My interest in Afghanistan was stimulated by my visit to Helmand province last year to see what was going on and to listen to what people said about what they were trying to do, very much along the lines of what the noble Baroness was talking about. I was told&#151;I had read about this before but I had not heard it from the people&#151;that until the time of the Russian intervention, Afghanistan was one of the major exporters around the world of dried fruit and nuts and produced the best. It was mentioned that that should be restimulated as an alternative to the heroin crop&#151;not just pomegranates.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000013"></a>It is particularly sad to learn that our intervention in 2002 was very largely responsible for what has happened to that wonderful growing land in the Helmand valley. Until 2002, that valley was virtually the grain basket of Afghanistan but in 2002 the World Food Programme took in an enormous amount of grain to help feed the people in Afghanistan, so much so that they destroyed the market for the Helmand farmers. Being unable to sell their crops, the farmers took to poppies instead, stimulated, of course, by the Taliban. I discovered what we were trying to do about it: the Royal Air Force had flown in a very large number of sacks of seedcorn which were being held in depots so that, at the end of the poppy crop, the farmers could be given seeds and encouraged to grow something else.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000014"></a>Of course, growing wheat is not what it is all about as much as selling it. Therefore, in taking over the villages and towns of the Helmand province, the military were trying to open markets to which the farmers could take their wheat and sell it. Unfortunately, the Taliban realised that, so they tried, first, to undermine the whole market structure. Secondly, knowing that farmers have to get their wheat along the roads, the Taliban and others have been mounting roadblocks through which the farmers have to pass and in which they are relieved of money, which undermines their wish to go to market. In addition, of course, by having to keep those roads open, the military lay themselves open to all the mines and other devices planted beside the roads which cause so many casualties. So the process, admirable though it is, is not at present organised well enough to be able to achieve the end for the farmers, which is to help them to break away, and it is causing great problems for the military.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000015"></a>What do we do about it? I had a long talk with the commander of the Afghan National Army in Helmand and asked him what he felt was most needed. He said, &#147;Two things: first, you have to stop the bombing&#148;, but that is nothing to do with this particular subject, &#147;and,  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC408"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column GC408</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>secondly, water&#148;. He said that if you look at the geography, not just at the Helmand valley but at adjacent valleys and other valleys in similar places, you will see it is possible, through civil engineering, to introduce water into the valleys which would encourage the growing of the sort of alternative crops mentioned by the noble Baroness. Therefore, if the world community really wants to help Afghanistan, it has to enable the crops to be grown in the areas where they might be grown, and so encourage the whole process to start.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000016"></a>I think that we could do more. I used to talk about dried fruit and nuts until listening to the noble Baroness speak about pomegranates, but I have often wondered whether the supermarkets of the world might not be encouraged to get together to buy the crop from the farmers in advance to give them some economic wherewithal to survive until the crop is sold, thereby contributing to what they would gain. In this whole area to which the noble Baroness has drawn attention, there are openings in which the world can contribute very considerably to the development of Afghanistan and, particularly to the development of those whose lives are made such a misery by the activities of the Taliban at present.</p>

<p><a name="09062370000017"></a><b><a name="90623-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09062370000070"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> Before I come to the subject of this afternoon&#146;s debate, I extend our sincere condolences to the family of Major Sean Birchall, who was killed in Helmand last Friday, the third Welsh Guardsman to be killed in action, and our profound gratitude to all the soldiers of my regiment and other servicemen who are risking their lives in a cause that is absolutely vital to the whole world&#151;the maintenance and strengthening of a free and democratic Afghanistan. It is essential that we support them with the military resources that they need to defend themselves and the civilian population against the Taliban and, in particular, to deal with IEDs, the favourite weapon of the terrorists. Do we have access to the counter-IED technologies, on which the Americans are reported to be spending $4 billion a year?</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000018"></a>I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, on securing this debate and having dealt so effectively with the question of crop substitution. As she says, poppy cultivation reached an enormous peak of 8,200 tonnes in 2007, and the area under cultivation was also a record at 193,000 hectares in that year. But there are now hopeful signs. There was a reduction in 2008, and the business is concentrated in the seven provinces of the south and south-west, where the terrorists are still influential. The Secretary-General's special representative says that a further improvement is likely in 2009. With the extra 20,000 NATO troops, and the Afghan army also increasing in numbers and efficiency, there ought to be positive feedback, as the terrorists find it harder to coerce farmers into growing poppy, and to raise the taxes on their production, which is their main source of revenue. Crop substitution would make an enormous impact on the finance of terrorism, whether in the form of pomegranates, fruit and nuts or what seems to be the main alternative&#151;wheat.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000019"></a>At the same time, the relative economics of growing poppy and those other crops have changed. The EU special representative's April counternarcotics update  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC409"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column GC409</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>quoted a local estimate from Helmand that wheat is now about 8 per cent more profitable than opium, and the report suggests that there may be a window of opportunity for alternative crop development, as the noble Baroness said. In 2008, DfID and USAID jointly issued free wheat seed to 32,000 farmers in Helmand, and it would be useful to know what the plan is for this year. We are also reviewing, with the Afghan Government, a new four-year programme to succeed the Helmand agriculture and rural development programme, to which DfID contributed &#163;30 million over 2006-09 for infrastructure, including roads, wells&#151;I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, that water is of vital importance in this climate&#151;and an agriculture high school. How far has the review of the programme progressed, and do we believe that it will achieve a permanent and sustained transfer from poppy to wheat cultivation in Helmand?</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000020"></a>The same report contrasted the huge success of governor-led eradication programmes in Helmand, which it says dwarfed those in all other provinces and were the highest ever recorded for GLE in 2008. This governor, as the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, will confirm, is exceptional in Helmand, in terms of both his abilities and his incorruptibility. Does the Minister think that perhaps that is not the case with other governors of provinces where narcotics are grown or trafficked, and that some may either have active interests in the local narcotics industry or are not strong enough to challenge the authority of local narcotics traffickers? If so, do we have to acquiesce in the situation, or could there be a strategy for their replacement?</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000021"></a>Richard Holbrooke, the US special envoy, has slated US eradication efforts as &#147;wasteful and inefficient&#148;. If eradication is to continue, should it not be concentrated on the GLE rather than the poppy eradication force activities, which are costing more than a hundred times as much per hectare as the GLE and achieving less? Do the Government have a view on whether eradication should be done at all? If so, how should it be incorporated into development at provincial and district level, and who should do it?</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000022"></a>Do we also agree with Mr Holbrooke's call for,</p>
<ul><a name="09062370000058"></a>&#147;a very significantly expanded agricultural sector job-creation set of programmes involving irrigation, farmer-to-market roads, market places and seed&#148;.?</ul>
<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000023"></a>This seems to be the pattern in Helmand, where a month ago Mr Ian Purves, the UK's development co-ordinator in Garmsir, was showing journalists round the new bazaar, new tarmac roads, solar-powered streetlights and the refurbished school and health centre. The local farmers in and around the town are now growing wheat from seed distributed in 2007 instead of poppies. The Commander of the UK Task Force Helmand told the journalists that the local government and people had grasped the opportunity of better security to improve their living conditions, and the same could happen throughout the south as the Taliban is defeated.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000024"></a>For the time being, according to DfID, Helmand still accounts for more than 50 per cent of the country's opium poppy cultivation in 2007-08 and was also the most important province in terms of heroin processing and trafficking. But provinces in the peaceful north,  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC410"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column GC410</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>such as Badakhshan, now virtually poppy-free, also need help. Of the $32 billion spent by international donors in Afghanistan, only $8 billion has been channelled through the Government, and in Badakhshan the farmers say that they have had no help from either the Government or the aid agencies. UNAMA, the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, is supposed to co-ordinate the aid programmes, but with those vast sums, a third of the population is still chronically food insecure. What is the Government's view on the transparency and accountability of these programmes, and can the Minister say whether any of the missing $24 billion not spent through the Government has been allocated to the promotion of alternative crops? Why is that not among the six core areas of UNODC's strategy?</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000025"></a>The DfID evaluation report published last month said that counternarcotics efforts are a combination of economic development, provision of social services, and better governance and the rule of law. It said that programmes such as the Afghanistan alternative livelihoods project and research in alternative livelihoods fund have made valuable contributions to producing alternatives to poppy. There is considerable effort to secure Afghan ownership of the programmes. We fund most of our alternative livelihood programmes through the Afghan Government and their agencies, and that must be the right approach in the long term. But the narcotics mafia has infected the Government themselves, with senior figures either using government institutions to run the business, or protecting the major narcotics traffickers. These traitors to Afghanistan would take ownership of counternarcotics efforts only in order to subvert them, as has happened, to some extent, with eradication. The quarterly report from NATO puts this in more diplomatic language when it says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09062370000056"></a>&#147;Most of the ministries remain ineffective, under-resourced and lacking in skilled or experienced personnel, and this lack of institutional capacity makes it difficult for ministries to administer and disburse funds&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09062370000054"></a>Are we using financial, developmental and military forces effectively to drive forward Afghan-led reform to clean up the Administration, and can these efforts succeed when President Karzai himself tolerates drug collusion by senior officials and even Ministers?</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000026"></a>The management response to the DfID evaluation says that both on the Afghan side and in DfID, the context has changed since the evaluation, and on poppy cultivation, a new initiative to sustain reductions is being developed by the Afghan Government with DfID's support, taking into account the lessons learnt from both successful and unsuccessful efforts to date. Could the Minister say how is this work progressing and, in particular, how the weak co-ordination among donors and the ineffectiveness of UNAMA and other UN agencies are being tackled? Can the knowledge and experience of counternarcotics that we have acquired be transferred to other donors, particularly to our 18 EU partners who are involved?</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000027"></a>Finally, does the Minister consider that PRTs have a useful role to play in counternarcotics strategy, bearing in mind their lack of an explicit mandate and, if any of them have done effective work, could that be continued by other agencies?</p>

I would have been even more grateful had it been standing room only at the back and had a lot more noble Lords been interested in the subject&#151;it may be due not to a lack of interest but to other attractions. However, in the contributions that we have heard we have had quality even if we have not had quantity. I shall seek to answer the many questions that were asked, but perhaps I may start by putting the issue into context.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000029"></a>It is one of those debates where there are no two sides; we have had a series of points, questions, criticisms&#151;justifiable in many cases&#151;and an understanding that we have to do more to alleviate the tragedy that is Afghanistan. While there is much to do, we have some successes to point to.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000030"></a>As we all know, Afghanistan remains one of the world&#146;s poorest countries. We know that the UK&#146;s own security is threatened by continued instability in the Afghanistan and Pakistan region. We are committed to helping the Government of Afghanistan secure the future of their country and forge a better life for all Afghan people.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000031"></a>Three years ago, the UK and Afghanistan signed a 10-year development partnership agreement. This April, the Secretary of State for International Development launched a new DfID country plan for Afghanistan, worth &#163;510 million in aid over the next four years. That firmly underlines our commitment, and makes Afghanistan our fifth largest development programme world wide. Our efforts, civilian and military, are contributing at national and local levels towards helping Afghans overcome the insurgency and secure, govern and develop the country for themselves&#151;a point that was made in the debate.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000032"></a>It is worth looking back over the past seven years to some of the progress that has been made. This year, Afghanistan will hold its second set of democratic presidential elections. In the previous election, six out of 10 Afghans exercised their democratic rights by voting for the first time in more than 35 years&#151;a figure that should make us slightly ashamed of our own voting performance in elections held recently. Five million refugees have been able to return home. And where just one in 10 Afghans lived in districts with access to basic healthcare, that figure is now up to eight in 10.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000033"></a>Of course, very serious challenges remain across Afghanistan. In the past year, many Afghans have become more pessimistic about their personal safety and their country&#146;s prospects for moving forward. Afghanistan is facing simultaneously four scourges that would individually trouble any country in the world: weak governance, poverty, insurgency and narcotics. It is the last of those challenges and how we find alternative ways forward which are at the centre of today&#146;s debate.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000034"></a>The noble Baroness spoke of alternative agricultural products to replace the farmers&#146; requirement to grow poppies. She made reference to Helmand province in particular, where the suggested alternative to poppy-growing is pomegranates through the project, POM354.  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC412"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column GC412</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>DfID is supportive of the aims of POM354. Discussions have taken place with Mr Brett, who is no relation of mine&#151;I say that to protect his reputation, not mine&#151;and officials have offered technical assistance and advice. Our development programme works to create the economic conditions for organisations such as POM354 to succeed, but we do not fund individual initiatives. Our recommendation to Pom354 and its initiative is to produce a detailed business plan which will help to maximise the programme&#146;s chances of success and help conversations with donors. DfID will continue to provide advice on such a plan. We have also had reference to the wheat-growing initiative, which I will come to in the latter part of my contribution.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000035"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, raises an important point about the infrastructure requirement to allow markets to work and the growers of products to have access without intimidation. DfID is supporting infrastructure in Helmand with &#163;32 million over the next four years aimed at irrigation, the Lashkar Gah to Gereshk road&#151;which addresses the question about access to markets&#151;the Gereshk hydro-power plant, which will help to boost the economy and the opening of airfields for the first commercial flights at Bost on 3 June, together with &#163;4.5 million for an agricultural centre to improve access to markets.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000036"></a>We are also aware of the need to improve the economic and commercial background to the country. DfID is supporting the Afghanistan investment climate facility with &#163;30 million to improve the regulatory environment in which to start businesses, removing some of those bureaucratic and difficult obstacles that prevent small businesses of any kind getting to the point at which they are sustainable.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000037"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, raised a series of points that are all worthy of comment. He made a point which I echo, and to which the Government have already committed, which is of course our condolences on the death of Major Sean Birchall. It is a sad fact of life that our brave soldiers give service. That inevitably has its cost, which is a terrible burden for their families. Whenever we hear of the death of service personnel, support staff or the innocents involved, we can only send out our hearts to those who have lost a loved one.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000038"></a>The noble Lord raised counter-IED technologies, on which the Americans, as he pointed out, are reported to be spending $4 billion. He gave me advance notice of the question, so I was able to seek reference to the ministerial Statement to the House of Commons made by the then Secretary of Defence, John Hutton, on 29 April. He made the point that units will provide important additional capabilities for UK forces in Afghanistan, and said:</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90623-gc0002.htm"/>


<p class="tabletext"><a name="09062370000057"></a>&#147;We shall also enhance our capability to counter Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). These devices are a major threat to our troops, those of our allies and to the ordinary Afghan people. We are deploying personnel with a range of skills to detect, dispose and exploit IEDs and to prevent them being laid. Other personnel will improve our ability to defend our bases while we shall also reinforce our already significant reconnaissance capabilities. We shall increase the number of tactical unmanned aerial vehicles. We shall also deploy Sea King air surveillance and control helicopters and the new airborne stand-off radar. These complementary systems track use radar to track movements on the ground.

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000039"></a>The noble Lord also referred to the extra 20,000 troops and sought positive feedback. We hope to see security gradually improving with the additional 20,000 NATO troops, and increasing numbers and efficiency in the Afghan National Army. Security is an important aspect of our long-term development efforts. It will allow for better access to markets and, in turn, offer farmers an alternative to poppy growing. Poppies are collected at the farm gate, while farmers take other crops to market&#151;a point ably made the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. NATO rules allow ISAF partners specifically to target individuals with narcotics interests.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000040"></a>The noble Lord also raised development to replace the HARDP programme, how it has progressed and whether we can achieve a permanent and sustained transfer from poppy to wheat cultivation in Helmand. DfID has agreed in principle to fund the Helmand alternative livelihoods programme, the first stage of which will be operational by September. The aim of the programme is to reduce poppy cultivation, but its success will depend on the overall security situation and the development of market prices for poppy and agricultural produce.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000041"></a>The noble Lord also raised the comparative lack of success of the GLE in other provinces compared with Helmand. He rightly made comments about the energy and efficiency of a particular governor and whether other governors were being encouraged or, indeed, removed if they do not achieve the same endeavours. At the moment, I prefer to take some comfort from the successes, but we need to seek to sustain and to improve the capabilities of the Government of Afghanistan in all the areas where we can clearly see weaknesses that need to be reduced.</p>

<p><a name="09062370000042"></a>On illicit livelihoods, we have previously had a debate about whether poppy cultivation could be changed from illicit to licit, which, on that occasion, was not seen as an answer to the problem. Equally, eradication on its own will not solve the problem. It is an important deterrent and can play a catalytic role in influencing farmers to give up poppy cultivation. It needs to be balanced with measures to interdict drugs, bring criminals to justice, build institutions and encourage development of rural communities to provide alternatives for poppy farmers. It is essential to insert a credible risk to poppy growing and to target the big traders who will benefit most from the narcotics trade. We also need to ensure that we do not measure success merely based on the area where the poppy has been eradicated. The important factor is that the contribution of the poppy trade to the economy is falling, which is something from which we should take some comfort.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000043"></a>We also have an answer to Mr Holbrooke&#146;s call for a very significantly expanded agricultural sector job-creation set of programmes, which is a very firm yes. That is why DFID&#146;s programmes focus on economic development and the agricultural sector, two key development priorities of the Afghan Government, as outlined in the Afghanistan National Development Strategy. We are also supporting several major infrastructure programmes in Helmand province to improve access to markets. That includes rebuilding

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000044"></a>On the Government&#146;s view of the transparency and accountability of the &#163;32 million spent on aid, we are working hard to ensure that international aid to Afghanistan is more transparent and that the donor community holds the Afghan Government to account. We want to see other donors increase the proportion of aid which they spend directly through the Afghan Government&#146;s systems and we are committed to spend at least 50 per cent of our aid through the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, which is managed by the World Bank and independently monitored. The ARTF reimburses the Afghan Government on proof of legitimate expenditure. A significant proportion of international aid is spent through NGOs which promote alternative crops, but we are unable to provide a precise figure for that. The promotion of alternative crops is a key priority under the Afghan national drug control strategy, which informs the UNODC&#146;s programmes.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000045"></a>On central government, under the new country plan, DfID has placed renewed emphasis on supporting the Afghan Government in building credible state institutions. We are supporting the High Office of Oversight which is the Afghan body tasked with the implementation of the Government&#146;s anti-corruption strategy. We are also helping the Afghan Government to strengthen the rule of law and we are supporting a number of NGO-led programmes to improve transparency and accountability. However, it is for the Afghans to elect their Government and to hold their Government to account.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000046"></a>On the management response to DfID&#146;s evaluation, which was raised by the noble Lord, DfID has committed &#163;30 million over four years to the comprehensive agriculture and rural development facility&#151;CARDF&#151;to boost the agricultural sector and job creation in Afghanistan. We have focused on three pilot areas, including Nangahar, and we are working closely with the UNAMA agricultural task force and with the Afghan Ministry of Agriculture&#151;MAIL&#151;and Minister Rahimi to support MAIL&#146;s reform programme. We are also in contact with the deputy special representative for UNAMA, Mark Ward, who is responsible for donor co-ordination.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000047"></a>The question was also raised about the knowledge and experience of counternarcotics that we have acquired. I was asked whether we could transfer it to other donors, particularly our partners in the EU. The answer, again, is yes. Several EU partners are now interested in joining and supporting the CARDF programme, which is to be welcomed.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000048"></a>The last point was on the PRTs and the roles that they have to play in CN strategy, bearing in mind their lack of an explicit mandate. The UK-led PRT in Helmand is an integral part of the development effort in Afghanistan; DfID works through and with the PRT to plan stabilisation and long-term development in Helmand province. The PRT works with the Afghan Government, line ministries and bilateral donors, and we understand that other PRTs do the same.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000049"></a>There is no silver bullet to address the scourge of narcotics in Afghanistan, and I suspect that there is no particular silver bullet to provide one alternative solution,  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC415"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column GC415</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be it pomegranates, wheat or whatever. We have had success in the distribution of wheat; unfortunately, the production of wheat is dependent on price in the market and on having a successful harvest, which is something that farmers have had to be concerned about for centuries. That has proved in the past year or two to be very favourable in respect of Afghanistan; we cannot guarantee that we will have such success in climatic conditions in future.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000050"></a>Our approach is to deliver real success. The Afghan Government&#146;s existing programmes have contributed to the completion of some 28,000 community-led development projects, from agriculture, irrigation, and power and water supply, with another 50,000 on the way. The Government have distributed with our support some &#163;500 million in small loans to 440,000 farmers, families and shopkeepers to help to invest in new ways to feed their families. In Helmand, where the US funded the governor&#146;s food zone programme, to which I referred when talking about wheat production, wheat seed was distributed to 32,000 farmers as an alternative to growing poppy. While it is too early to make a long-term judgment, it has proved to be a success in the early stages. As a result, we have seen the decrease of poppy production by some 19 per cent across the country. Only two years ago, six provinces could claim to be free of poppy; today it is 18&#151;just over half of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan. However, we recognise that progress is fragile. The risk of reversal is a high one; although higher wheat prices, lower poppy prices and the climate have worked in our favour, we cannot guarantee such factors.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09062370000051"></a>We can guarantee that our commitment to Afghanistan is long term, as is our commitment to democracy and the freedom of its people. Our commitment to assisting the democratically elected Government and their agencies to bring a better life for Afghanistan&#146;s people is also long term, and I hope that this debate will stimulate thought and encourage others to continue to support the efforts that we make. I am very grateful to the noble Baroness for bringing this debate to our Table and to noble Lords who have contributed. I hope that I have answered their questions in my responses as well as joining in with the chorus of support for what we are doing and encouragement to do more.</p>

<ul><a name="09062373000024"></a>
<p>To ask Her Majesty&#146;s Government what action they will take regarding those prisoners released from Guantanamo Bay who return to the United Kingdom.</p>
</ul>




<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC416"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column GC416</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09062373000001"></a><b><a name="90623-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09062373000026"></a>Lord Bridges:</b> On hearing President Obama&#146;s decision to close the interrogation centre at Guantanamo, I was pleased that that courageous and difficult step had been taken. It is of course against the principles of our own legal system for a citizen to be indefinitely imprisoned without charge. It is specifically contrary to the provisions of our own Magna Carta. The President's action was thus in accordance with our own precedents and tradition and his courage in making a clean break with the previous American practice was to be welcomed. I sense that that was also the reaction of many of our fellow citizens.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09062373000002"></a>At the same time, I can see that the consequences might lead to some awkward decisions for our own authorities. It would only be just for a British citizen released from Guantanamo who wished to return here to be entitled to do so, accompanied, if he wished, by his wife and children. But other cases might be less straightforward. What if a released prisoner not of British nationality, who has previously had the right to reside here, which right had expired meanwhile, wished to return as a resident? I believe that there has been a case of that kind. We could no doubt ask the US authorities what they knew about this person&#146;s political activities in the United States and why he had been imprisoned. I have little doubt that they would try to help, but while we should not be unsympathetic to his request, we could not be said to be under a particular obligation to him.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09062373000003"></a>Then there are other applicants who may have had no previous close connection with our country, but who may have concluded that this would be a desirable place for them to live for an indefinite period. Here, too, we should feel under no obligation to admit such persons but we could ask the American authorities for an account of the reasons leading to their imprisonment.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09062373000004"></a>My interest has been that an early debate would enable us to be enlightened about the attitude of Her Majesty's Government to such requests, which could be of considerable interest to public opinion in this country generally. To my knowledge, no such statement has yet been made. Some several weeks have elapsed since I gave notice of this Question for Short Debate, since it seemed rather a large topic for an ordinary parliamentary Question, which means that it has lost a certain amount of its topicality.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09062373000005"></a>Meanwhile, there has been a fresh development. According to an article in the <I>Guardian</I> on 16 June, an important meeting was held by European Union Governments in Brussels the previous day to discuss these issues. The newspaper stated that the meeting cleared the hurdles for up to 50 Guantanamo returnees to be accommodated in EU countries. It also stated that the United States had agreed to pay the European countries that accommodated them. Each country would decide whether to take in the former detainees, with a deadline in January next. According to the newspaper, officials were said to remark that they were,</p>
<ul><a name="09062373000019"></a>&#147;not far away from a breakthrough&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09062373000006"></a>Meanwhile, I read some breaking news in another newspaper article recently that the United States Government had reached an agreement with Bermuda for four prisoners from Guantanamo to be transferred to Bermuda financed by a payment from the United  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC417"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column GC417</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>States Government. Were our own Government asked about that? Did the US Government consult us before making an agreement with a British territory, and if not, why not?</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09062373000007"></a>It would be appropriate for the Government to make a formal statement about their attitude to these developments, which are of considerable interest and some concern to our citizens. Could they also cover the awkward fact that, whatever we decide ourselves, other European Union states may be inclined to accept these people who, having established themselves within the EU, would then be free to travel to this country as EU residents? That might have awkward and unforeseen circumstances.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09062373000008"></a>My task today was not to criticise the Government but suggest to them that this is a subject of some considerable importance to the nation as a whole, and it would be helpful if, at an early date, a full authoritative statement could be made, possibly in Parliament, for the information of the country at large.</p>
<h5><a name="09062373000022"></a>4.35 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09062373000009"></a><b><a name="90623-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09062373000027"></a>Lord Ramsbotham:</b> I take the opportunity of the gap to make a practical point on the Question raised so clearly and succinctly by the noble Lord, Lord Bridges. When I was the Chief Inspector of Prisons, I went to the special centre in Belmarsh where IRA terrorists were held. I was extremely concerned about the conditions in which they were held, but also about the staff who had to look after them.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09062373000010"></a>Noble Lords will remember that a number of Iraqis were put in Belmarsh without trial for a considerable time. Again, their conditions and treatment had not been pre-planned. Fortunately, there was an extremely able governor in Belmarsh who realised that this was not a normal imprisonment, of either a sentenced or unsentenced prisoner, but for an indefinite period. Again, there is the question of the staff who have to look after them.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09062373000011"></a>Obviously, this is a hypothetical question. We do not know if, or how many, people from Guantanamo may be returned to the United Kingdom. We do not know for how long they may have to be detained. My question to the Minister is simple, although I acknowledge that it is possibly more for the Ministry of Justice than the Home Office. Have the Government taken steps to identify the sort of conditions in which people like this ought to be held? To pitch them into a normal or high-security prison would be wholly inappropriate, bearing in mind where they have come from.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09062373000012"></a>Secondly, have the Government identified the special staffing measures required for psychiatric and other treatments from the time that they have been in that place? Have they taken steps to identify the sort of staff who might be suitable? Not all of them are. Have they taken steps to make certain that there is briefing and training for them before they go to where the prisoners are sent with the resources needed to look after them while they are there?</p>

We are not here today to discuss the whole of extraordinary rendition, but I simply mark the fact that there are wider issues that will continue to exercise us.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09062373000014"></a>I have recently read yet further information coming out of the United States that suggests that Diego Garcia has been used as part of the extraordinary rendition programme. I gather that a large number of prisoners is still being held in Bagram, not all from Afghanistan. The question of what happens to them remains active. How far members of the British Government or intelligence agencies were aware of what was going on, or may indeed have colluded in questioning some of these prisoners, are questions that we must leave at the moment to lie on the table but which we have to come back to.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09062373000015"></a>Today, we are concerned with what happens to British citizens and residents as they are released from Guantanamo and whether Her Majesty&#146;s Government will be playing an active role in taking non-British citizens in order to help the Obama Administration in closing Guantanamo&#151;something which, in principle, we strongly support. However, we recognise that the practicalities are complex. We hope that the Minister can tell us the position on British citizens and residents who remain in Guantanamo. Progress has, we know, been made. What arrangements will be made for them as they return to Britain?</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09062373000016"></a>I should like, however, to ask in more detail about the situation with Bermuda and, potentially, other British Overseas Territories, and how far we will share in taking non-British citizens. In a BBC report some days ago, a senior US official was quoted as having told the BBC that,</p>
<ul><a name="09062373000020"></a>&#147;it was a deliberate decision not to consult London on the resettlement, after other countries came under pressure from China not to accept Uighurs&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09062373000018"></a>It is unclear from reports that I have read whether Her Majesty's Government preferred not to know what was happening, or were kept entirely out of the loop and were not informed about what was happening. I hope that the Minister may be able to throw at least a shadowy light on the distinction. Is he aware of any other consultation between the United States and other British Overseas Territories which might be willing to take such ex-detainees? Might there have been some agreement between Bermuda and the United States dating from the Cold War period which covered particular arrangements between them, as people have suggested to me, or was it simply a one-off?</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09062373000017"></a>On non-British citizens, the European Union has, as the noble Lord, Lord Bridges, remarked, agreed in principle to help the Obama Administration close Guantanamo. Italy, I understand, has already agreed to take three of them; I do not know whether the Minister yet has information on whether other Governments have decided that they will share in this process and, if so, how many they will take. Do Her Majesty's Government consider that it should be part of our responsibility to help close Guantanamo and this deeply unfortunate episode in American foreign policy? If so, will we be willing to take people who would have to be kept in detention after they arrive in

Whether we allow them to be released when they arrive here or recognise that they may also have to be detained&#151;and, if so, under what authority&#151;are more complicated issues. I hope that that does not raise too many questions for the Minister.</p>
<h5><a name="090623107000126"></a>4.42 pm</h5>

<p><a name="090623107000001"></a><b><a name="90623-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="090623107000136"></a>Baroness Neville-Jones:</b> I thank my noble friend Lord Bridges for introducing this timely debate. It is rather a pity that more Members of our House were not here to join in.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000002"></a>As my noble friend said, we on these Benches have long called for the closure of the facility at Guantanamo Bay on grounds that I think we all share: that if we, the coalition countries, seek to respond to terrorism in ways that undermine shared values, the outcome will be to achieve precisely the objectives that the terrorists seek. It is therefore extremely good news that the facility is going to be closed, although I think that we all recognise that it poses some real challenges, including the requirement not to return detainees who are assessed as posing no security threat to countries where they might as a result of their return be tortured or face other degrading treatment, and, in countries where they may be received, that they do not pose a security threat, which is one of the main concerns of those of us in this Room today. The net result of that, as we are beginning to see, is that the closure process is going take perhaps a little longer than the US Administration might have wished.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000003"></a>Does the Minister know how many detainees the US Government have now assessed as being capable of release? Reports have consistently indicated that something in the order of 220 detainees are still being held at the facility, which is still quite a large number, of whom 50 have been cleared for release without trial. Has he any further update on how many are going to face some kind of process and how many are to be released? Is the UK going to take any of them? I understand there are 50 of them, but there may be more. Have we had further requests from the US Administration?</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000004"></a>I turn to those who are coming back to this country. The noble Lord, Lord Bridges, referred to the US/EU statement of 15 June on the closure of Guantanamo Bay. It contains two slightly contradictory sentences. It states:</p>
<ul><a name="090623107000123"></a>&#147;the primary responsibility for closing Guantanamo and finding residence for the former detainees rests with the US&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090623107000112"></a>It goes on to state,</p>
<ul><a name="090623107000124"></a>&#147;we also recall the request by the Government of the United States to assist it in finding residence for some of those persons cleared for release ... whom it will not prosecute, and who for compelling reasons cannot return to their countries of origin&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="090623107000113"></a>It goes on:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="090623107000120"></a>&#147;Decisions on the reception of former detainees and the determination of their legal status falls within the sole responsibility and competence of a receiving EU Member State&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090623107000114"></a>That slightly suggests that in general we are prepared to take people, but in particular and in practice, that may be very difficult. Does the Minister have information about how many of our partners in the EU are likely to be taking them and how does the UK compare with them?</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC420"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column GC420</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000005"></a>The UK has already accepted 14 detainees over the years, the most recent being Mr Binyam Mohamed, whom I shall return to in a minute. The Foreign Office has said that it regards that as &#147;already a significant contribution&#148;, implying that we are not willing to take many, if any, more. I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify that situation.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000006"></a>The safety of the British public is of paramount concern. If detainees are coming back to this country, and particularly if there are to be more of them, can the Government explain the criteria they are adopting for admission and how they will ensure that these individuals do not represent a security threat? In the case of Mr Binyam Mohamed, can the Minister update us on his status? Will he remain resident in the UK? If so, on what basis? Is he judged to be a security threat? If so, what would be the circumstances of his residence here and how, if necessary, will the general public be protected? The issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, are relevant in this particular case and more generally. We need to know. It places a burden on our security services if these people have to be detained and if they are not, but are a threat, they are a danger to the public. I do not underestimate the difficulties, but it would be good to have some clarity.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000007"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bridges, and other speakers referred to the detainees who went to Bermuda. I am as curious as they are about the circumstances under which this transaction took place. It is a great oddity that when two sovereign states are close allies, the sovereign power in Bermuda appears to have been uninformed and kept out of the picture. I do not regard that as a friendly act. It seems improper conduct on the part of the United States. I hope a protest has been delivered.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000008"></a>As a practical matter, what is the status of these Chinese Uighurs? Are they considered to be a security risk? Will they have freedom of movement? Are they expected to integrate into Bermudan society in the long term? Are they at liberty to leave? There are some interesting questions, and if this experiment goes wrong, we, as the sovereign power, will be landed with the problem.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000009"></a>I have another question about the EU/US statement to which Her Majesty&#146;s Government have signed up. It says that,</p>
<ul><a name="090623107000125"></a>&#147;as a result of EU rules relating to an area without controls at the internal borders, a decision of one Member State to accept&#148;,</ul>

That is as may be, but as my noble friend has said, people can travel around inside the EU. I would be grateful to know what internal arrangements between member states will be made to ensure that the Schengen arrangements&#151;the UK is certainly not a full member but it has a relationship&#151;do not become a means of evading the necessary security precautions.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000010"></a>In the UK, our security services are still facing allegations about complicity in torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. That is not the object of today's discussion in detail, but I would be grateful for any update that the Minister can give us. It is a pity that the Foreign Secretary continues to refuse to publish  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC421"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column GC421</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the guidance from the Government. I know that it is old guidance and the new guidance that the Government have promised will be published when it is consolidated and reviewed, but when will that be? I also hope that the Government will be willing to publish the Intelligence and Security Committee&#146;s further report on alleged complicity of the agencies in torture and other degrading treatment, which we know was submitted to the Prime Minister in March. I say that not out of idle curiosity because it is important that we do what we can to preserve the good name of the country. Our intelligence services do such extraordinarily important work on our behalf that we must not let this odour of suspicion about their standards and behaviour linger. It is an important part of having clarity and confidence&#151;clarity about the facts and confidence in the agencies of government.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000011"></a>Finally, on the question of Mr Binyam Mohamed, it would be helpful if the Minister could give us an update on where the Attorney-General has got to in her investigation and whether there is any indication of when her investigations are likely to be concluded. There is a key lesson to be drawn from the operation of the facility at Guantanamo. As I said at the beginning, let us not in future respond to the terrorist threat in ways that defeat the purposes of our own society.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000012"></a>It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify some of the issues that have been raised in the debate because the object of debates of this kind are on the one hand to know what the security situation is, and on the other to know that we are securing ourselves in ways that are consistent with our liberties.</p>

<p><a name="090623107000013"></a><b><a name="90623-gc0003.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="090623107000137"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord West of Spithead):</b> I thank noble Lords for what has been a useful discussion. As was mentioned by a couple of speakers, it is a shame that more noble Lords were not involved, because it is useful to go into some of these areas. They are important.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000014"></a>As a backdrop, before we go into detail, it is important for us to remember what a monumental event 11 September was to the United States, which did not lose 60,000 people in the Blitz in London. Something like this had never happened before. It is the largest ever loss of life&#151;just under 3,000 were killed&#151;on US soil as a result of a hostile attack. It was a shattering moment for the US and for the world. There was a realisation that we faced a new kind of threat. It is fair to say that the world has changed as a result.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000015"></a>We all know how the United States responded and I do not think that it would be sensible to rehash all those arguments here. However, on one specific point, the United Kingdom has long held that the indefinite detention of detainees is unacceptable and that the Guantanamo Bay&#151;I am never quite sure of its pronunciation, but I am sure that it is not &#147;Gitmo&#148;, as the Americans seem to call it&#151;detention facility should be closed. As the noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, said, one of the problems of Guantanamo Bay is that it has added to our problem and our risk. It has been a cause of radicalisation and further extremism. It was not very clever in any sense. It was wrong that it happened, but it was also damaging and extremely dangerous.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC422"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column GC422</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000016"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Bridges, mentioned, not just the people of Britain but also the Government welcomed President Obama&#146;s executive orders of 22 January covering the closure of Guantanamo, interrogation techniques and detention standards. That was a brave and absolutely correct thing to do. These moves demonstrate a real commitment to addressing the challenges of violent extremism in a manner consistent with upholding human rights, civil liberties and the rule of law. All of us would applaud that.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000017"></a>However, we have not just said that we welcome this commitment to close Guantanamo; we have backed it up with action. We should be proud of that in this nation. We have already taken back into the UK 14 former detainees, nine UK nationals and five individuals who were previously lawfully resident in the country. That is more than any other European country; I will come to numbers, as far as we currently know them, of other European countries a little later. We have also requested the release of one further lawful resident, Mr Shaker Aamer. That is going on at the moment.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000018"></a>We continue to discuss with the United States Government how best we can work with them and our European partners to see the closure of Guantanamo, and we will share our experience in accepting the transfer of former detainees. Again, I will come on to the checks we do on them later. Certainly, it is not our current intention that we should take any more. We have done rather well in this area. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, asked whether we were taking any more. As I say, we are negotiating on one at the moment, but we have no intention of going any further.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000019"></a>A number of speakers raised the issue of Bermuda. We were unaware that that was going to happen until it did. By accepting these detainees from the US Government, Bermuda overstepped our constitutional agreements with it in handling foreign and security policy. It was not a proper thing to do. It was a mistake. We have been clear with the Government of Bermuda that their actions were unacceptable and are looking at the operation of the general entrustment. However, we must deal responsibly with the situation as it stands. We are looking at ways to ensure that these men are dealt with in a properly humanitarian way while protecting the security of the United Kingdom. They do not have travel documents, so they cannot actually get here. We are considering all options and are discussing them with the United States and the Government of Bermuda. That discussion is still ongoing, so I cannot really go into any more detail. I am particularly interested because I am going on holiday to Bermuda in July, so I hope that they are reasonably safe chaps. It would be awful for the Minister responsible for counterterrorism and security to be blown up in a hotel sitting alongside four Uighurs, but I am sure that they are not that dangerous and that it is being handled.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000020"></a>On other British Overseas Territories accepting detainees, which the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, mentioned, that is a good question. As I hope we have made clear, we have taken a lot ourselves and have been in touch with all these other Governments in the region and elsewhere who are now fully aware of the need to discuss any such action with us; I think they were before. We have discussed it with them under the terms  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC423"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column GC423</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of their individual entrustments. They have confirmed that they are not in similar discussions with the United States.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000021"></a>It was mentioned that the EU justice and home affairs Ministers agreed a framework in early June for accepting into the European Union those individuals cleared for release but who, for compelling reasons, cannot return to their countries of origin. As I understand it, France has so far accepted one individual and Italy will accept three. I do not know how many Ireland will be taking, but Spain is taking four or five, Portugal two or three and Hungary one or two. Those are the latest figures I have and I know no further details. However, something is happening. I was at the JHA conference where this was discussed. One area of concern was the ability of individuals returned to the EU to travel within the Union. It was a key consideration in that debate. People in the Schengen area were particularly concerned, but our borders are a little tauter and tighter. There were discussions about how security concerns would be discussed between states, how people would be monitored and how relevant information would be shared between member states about these people and their movements.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000022"></a>President Obama has committed to closing Guantanamo Bay within the year. We would encourage all nations to do their part, as Britain has, to help the President fulfil his commitment, but we recognise the real difficulties in this. We must not kid ourselves; Guantanamo Bay contains some dangerous individuals. Noble Lords will be aware of statistics issued by the US Department of Defense on the number of individuals who have been released from Guantanamo Bay who have returned to fight coalition troops&#151;there is one man who is heavily involved in killing our people in Afghanistan&#151;or to engage in terrorist activities elsewhere in the world. Of course, a number of them are not a risk, which is where the difficulty lies. On top of this, some of the men in the camp come from countries where they would be at risk of cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment on their return, which adds to the problems.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000023"></a>People coming back to this country have had a very thorough check by our agencies to look at their details and ensure that they are not a major risk. If they were, the prime role of the Government is to protect our citizens, so we would have to ensure that they were locked up.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000024"></a>That brings us on to the issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. He touched on the slightly hypothetical question of whether we had taken steps to identify the conditions in which a difficult, long-term person would be held and the special staffing necessary. None of the people we have taken are anywhere near that category. Some terrorists we have put in prison are inside for quite long periods. The noble Lord raised important issues about psychological profiling and having a proper psychologist looking at them. As far as I am aware, the MoJ does that to an extent. If I am wrong in that, I will get back in writing. It is a valid issue, but it is hypothetical with these people because we do not intend to take any such person.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000025"></a>These difficulties mirror our experience in trying to disrupt terrorist activities. When we cannot prosecute or safely deport people, what we do with them is a real  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC424"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column GC424</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>issue. It is one of the things we are constantly wrestling with and we have debated it on the Floor of the House on a number of occasions.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000026"></a>We are doing our bit to close Guantanamo. Our first priority and overriding responsibility is the safety of the British public, which must come first. We gave full consideration to national security, and we have made sure that those who come back here are not a risk to the British public. Assisting the US to reduce the number of individuals at Guantanamo Bay helps it in its efforts to close it. It has real difficulties, for example, in the negotiations with Palau. It is getting quite desperate in some areas. We need to do everything we can. I cannot go into specific details on individuals.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000027"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bridges, asked about statements. The Foreign Secretary and the Home Secretary have updated Parliament on developments when appropriate. Indeed, they reported on the EU discussions. I do not think they could produce much more than that.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000028"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, asked about the number of individuals still in Guantanamo. The latest figures I have&#151;I think it is a moveable feast&#151;show that 244 individuals remain detained. All the cases are being reviewed on a rolling basis and, so far, only 30 have been cleared for release&#151;not the figure of 50 that was given. As I said, this is a moving figure and will be changing all the time.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000029"></a>We touched on torture and allegations of UK complicity. I would first endorse what the noble Baroness said about our agencies. We are extremely lucky with the quality of the people in them&#151;as well as in the police force, SO15 and across the board. We should always recognise that when we discuss this matter, we must not let any of them be fall guys for some error that might have been made in how instructions were passed out. We condemn torture wholeheartedly; it is not acceptable. I cannot talk about ongoing cases involving the police. They were passed to the Attorney-General and the police are now dealing with them.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000030"></a>The Prime Minister has said that we will produce a new code, in which the ISC will be deeply involved. It remains our wish to consolidate the review with the ISC. It is not clear when we will be able to publish it, but we are moving forward as quickly as we can. I agree that that is very important, because our agents and people in the field are at risk. I know, for example, that one of our allies&#146; agents was killed when carrying out an interview. They are involved with really dangerous things. The alleged torture of Mr Mohamed is the subject of a police investigation which I cannot talk about.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000031"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, spoke about extraordinary rendition, which we condemn. He mentioned Diego Garcia. It is a fact of record that a couple of flights went through there. We were totally unaware of them; the Americans apologised profusely. It was quite appalling that it should have happened, but I believe much more in mistake than conspiracy. It is amazing how often mistakes happen in huge, complex operations.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000032"></a>The issue of rendition is made all the more difficult because the Americans talk of a &#147;war on terror&#148;&#151;I do not like that term&#151;the theatre for which is world   


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC425"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column GC425</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>wide. That immediately makes the perception of rendition different from the way in which we would look at it. These are difficult, complex issues.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000033"></a>As we made clear when we published the CONTEST strategy in March, the Government&#146;s approach to counterterrorism is based fundamentally on a set of guiding principles, foremost among which is respect for human rights. If lose that, we do the terrorists&#146; job for them. As a nation, we believe that Guantanamo Bay should be closed&#151;I have described how it helps the terrorists&#151;but we cannot just stand on the sidelines and criticise it, which I do not think we have done. We have stated our position; we have not shirked our responsibilities. We have taken 14 detainees and are trying to get a further one. This is a good thing; it strengthens our national security, notwithstanding some of the other issues that then come to light. The message that we send to the rest of the world is that the closure of Guantanamo Bay is fundamental to our concept of how one should behave, which I hope will help our huge prevent strategy for radicalisation and recruitment. I know that we would all agree that promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law is the best guarantee of our security. That is the way forward.</p>

I thank all who have spoken, particularly the noble Lord, Lord West, for his thoughtful and thorough reply. There is a tendency, which I hope we have avoided, to adopt a tone of high moralistic disapproval of what has happened. We should remember, after all, that we have done something not too dissimilar in our own past, for example, in transporting people to Australia in conditions of terrible inhumanity. Only a few of them ever came back&#151;they built Australia as a result, so perhaps some good came out of that. I trust that no one will feel tempted to repeat this particular experiment, which is very difficult to bring off for a democratic and law-abiding country.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000035"></a>It is extraordinary that one should try to find a sort of terra nullius, where there is no legal jurisdiction and which you pinched or borrowed from somebody else called Cuba. That is repugnant to our own attitudes, and it is rather astonishing that our American friends should have done it. It is courageous of President Obama to have drawn it to an end. If we can help him bring it to a conclusion, I am sure that we are doing the right thing. I thank the Minister for replying so carefully to the points that we have raised.</p>

<p><a name="090623107000037"></a><b><a name="90623-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="090623107000140"></a>Lord Janvrin:</b> It is a great pleasure to open this short debate this afternoon. I declare my interests. I am deputy chairman of HSBC Private Bank (UK) Ltd, I am a member of the advisory board of the UK India Business Council, and I was a member of the parliamentary delegation on a visit to India arranged last March by the Industry and Parliament Trust.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000038"></a>In addition, I declare, rather more informally, a long-standing interest in India and in British-Indian relations stemming from a three and a half year diplomatic posting to New Delhi in the early 1980s. The extended visit arranged by the Industry and Parliament Trust gave me the opportunity to take a snapshot of the new India and the opportunities now presented to British business. That led me to request this short debate today.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000039"></a>At this stage, I pay tribute to the work of the Industry and Parliament Trust. It performs an invaluable service in fostering better understanding between Members of both Houses and the world of business. I think my noble friend Lady Coussins may intend to say a little more about our recent IPT visit, but I want to place on record my gratitude to the IPT for arranging the visit and my admiration for the work it does. I also express my thanks to other organisations, including Virgin and KPMG for generously supporting our visit.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000040"></a>The Question I tabled asks Her Majesty's Government about promoting trade between the United Kingdom and India because I think it is timely to remind ourselves and others of the huge importance of India to our national economic well-being. I firmly believe that India is important to us in the short term, as we look at opportunities and the importance of trade with the emerging markets as vital components in extracting ourselves from the recession. In my view, it is important in the medium term because there are good reasons to believe that further deregulation of the Indian economy will offer real opportunities for important sectors of the British economy. It is important in the long term because I believe that India, the sleeping giant that I knew 25 years ago, is now wide awake and intent on developing into one of the major economic and political powers of the 21st century.</p>

<p><a name="090623107000117"></a>The UK&#146;s business relationship with India is founded on three very solid pillars: first, India's stable democratic political system; secondly, its growing economic strength; and thirdly, our unique bilateral relationship. India's political stability is a vital anchor not just for British business interests, but globally. It was therefore with a mixture of relief and admiration that the world watched as 400 million Indians went to the polls in their recent general election. Any business operating overseas welcomes the reassurance of a stable political context in which to operate. The recent general election not only gave that reassurance but, in producing a clear result rather than a period of weak coalition politics as many pundits feared, it has offered India the possibility of firm political leadership at this time of global economic crisis.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000041"></a>India has not escaped from the consequences of the crisis, but for Indians it is a downturn, not a recession. India is still registering positive economic growth of the order of 6 per cent, having for some years been running at 8 to 9 per cent. This is a huge achievement,  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC427"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column GC427</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>certainly for one who remembers the &#147;Hindu rate of growth&#148; of the early 1980s. The liberalisation policies of the 1990s transformed the Indian economy. Our hope must be that the recent election result will encourage this liberalisation process to continue in a way that will provide further real opportunities for British business.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000042"></a>The breadth of our bilateral relationship is the third pillar. It is certainly true at the political level, but it is so evidently operational in business relations and in the dynamism and excitement of the cultural relationship. The danger here for British business is complacency. Since we speak the same language, share 250 years of history and enjoy each other's culture and company, we might make unwarranted assumptions about each other that our competitors avoid. Nobody these days can be complacent in any world market.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000043"></a>How can we build on these pillars? I have five suggestions on which the Minister may care to comment at the end of this short debate. The first is to make sure we think through the give and take of our relationship with India. British business needs the help of the Indian Government. It needs them to introduce further measures of market access and deregulation in the sectors of financial and professional services, retail, education and defence to name a few of major interest to this country. Are we now working out how best to encourage this process by thinking where we can help in return? It may not be by reciprocally offering market access here because so much of this exists already. It may well be across our wider political relationship with India, whether it be in the Home Office over visas, climate change negotiations or on counter-terrorism. I believe we should take nothing for granted. We need to devote our scarce diplomatic resources to ensuring that, with India, we are partners of choice in multilateral forums and partners of habit in our bilateral dealings.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000044"></a>My second suggestion is that in our business dealings with India we concentrate on co-ordinating the work of the many agencies: the FCO, DfID, UKTI, the British Council and UKIBC. Promoting business with India is a crowded area. Certainly, on our recent IPT visit, I was impressed by the way in which these organisations were working together. However, there could easily be a degree of overlap, duplication and, at worst, competition.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000045"></a>My third suggestion is that we need to need to look for creative, innovative ways to encourage SMEs to look for opportunities to trade in both directions. How do small firms make the initial approaches, look for partners or undertake market research? At one end of the spectrum, small but adventurous enterprises that are willing to explore India need help and guidance to get going. The UKIBC is hard at work here, but are we devoting enough resources at regional level both here and in India to stimulate and inform this crucial SME sector?</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000046"></a>My fourth suggestion is that we need to understand and anticipate the speed and extent of India's economic development. I have been much impressed by the recent work done by the UKIBC to promote India's emerging cities beyond the well known centres of Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore. There are real opportunities in the so-called "tier 2" cities. Are

Of course, rural India has the most enormous issues of poverty and deprivation, but there is every evidence that Indian business is looking at how it can bring growth to this huge emerging market. We should keep an eye on it too.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000047"></a>Finally, we should encourage British firms that are operating in India to look at their corporate social responsibility programmes to ensure that they complement and support their business plans. In all conscience, it would not be acceptable for any significant enterprise in today&#146;s world to operate in India without having a serious corporate sustainability plan, to contribute over and above the direct economic impact of the business to help in some way to address the social issues besetting that 42 per cent of the Indian population below the poverty line and the many others who are not far off it.</p>

<p><a name="090623107000048"></a>I am grateful for the opportunity to open this debate by raising these points. I do so not in a spirit of criticism but in the hope of making a contribution to the policy-making debate on a subject to which I think is extraordinarily important to the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="090623107000049"></a><b><a name="90623-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="090623107000141"></a>Lord Bilimoria:</b> On the eve of India's independence over 40 years ago, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru made a pledge in his famous speech, &#147;Tryst with Destiny&#148;. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="090623107000121"></a>&#147;A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance. The service of India means the service of the millions who suffer. It means the ending of poverty and ignorance and disease and inequality of opportunity. The ambition of our generation has been to wipe every tear from every eye&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090623107000118"></a>Has Pandit Nehru's dream come true? Sadly, not yet&#151;nowhere near it. But we know more than ever that India today, as my noble friend Lord Janvrin has said, is an emerging global economic superpower.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000050"></a>I congratulate my noble friend on securing this debate on such an important issue. India&#146;s success offers opportunities to us all. I am very proud to be the chairman of the UK India Business Council whose aim is to spread the awareness of business opportunities between Britain and India, especially among the small and medium-sized enterprises in all parts of the UK, in the regions and in London. Our mission is to increase trade, business and investment between our two countries in both directions.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000051"></a>However, the reality is that people have been very slow to realise the renaissance that India has been undergoing. I can give you an example. Whenever I speak to business audiences around the UK, I ask how many people are doing business in or with India. In a room of, say, 200 people, I do not exaggerate when I say that only a few hands go up.</p>

<p><a name="090623107000052"></a>In my own business I try to practise what I preach. In 2005, after a long break, we started manufacturing in India once again for the Indian market. After a year and a half of teething problems and settling in, we were soon producing in nine locations across India. We have an entirely Indian team operating in India, with sales increasing rapidly. For five years, India's GDP growth rate has averaged nearly 9 per cent. My own company is just one example of a growing trend and I know that there is enormous potential for partnership between the UK and India. The non-resident Indian community, the people of Indian origin in the UK, can be a real bridge between our two countries and ambassadors for both countries. The Asian population of this country makes up just 2 per cent of the population, yet contributes more than double that to the economy of this country. Where the UK and India are concerned, we are pushing at an open door. Our skills, experiences, common use of English, the rule of law, democracy and a free press all lend themselves to closer co-operation.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000053"></a>In November last year, I spoke at the <I>Hindustan Times</I> Leadership Summit in Delhi. I shared the podium with a remarkable young man, Chetan Bhagat, who, at the age of 35, has become the biggest selling author in India. In his speech, he spoke about what really matters to young Indians. He said that young Indians want politics of similarity and not the politics of difference and elitism and, above all, they want education.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000054"></a>There is a huge shortage of capacity and quality in education at every level in India&#151;in higher education as well as in skills&#151;and yet, to this day, foreign universities cannot open in the country. On the other hand, I am delighted to see that here in the UK we have numbers of Indian students increasing and record numbers coming here to study. Last year, I am proud to say that the UKIBC and the UK India Roundtable, of which I am a member, played a crucial role in ensuring that foreign students are now able to work in the UK for two years after they graduate. That will be a huge help to foreign students, particularly those from India. Our universities are fantastic. We punch above our weight continually: four out of the top 10 universities in the world are British. The number of Indian students now has increased five-fold to 25,000.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000055"></a>People are still not waking up to the India story. In 2006, Larry Summers, who at that time was president of Harvard and is currently the director of the White House National Economic Council, opened up the Harvard Business School research centre in India. He said that if, in 1991, when he was the chief economist at the World Bank, he had said that in 15 years&#146; time India, which at that time was nearly bankrupt, would have foreign exchange reserves of nearly $200 billion, he would have been called insane; and if he had predicted that a company that was nearly bankrupt would be growing at 9 per cent a year, he would have been called mad. That is the reality of India.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000056"></a>In 2007, when the UK India Business Council held an event, Jim O&#146;Neill, the chief economist of Goldman Sachs and an advisory board member of the UK India Business Council, gave an update on the famous BRIC report on the rise of Brazil, Russia, India and China.   


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC430"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column GC430</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>He said that when it was first published in 2003, it was criticised for being too optimistic as regards India, but when he gave his update he said that in 2003 Goldman Sachs was not even looking at India as a country until the BRIC report. It revised its forecast and has now predicted that India and China could be two of the largest economies in the world by 2050. While the western world is in recession, the Indian economy is expected to grow at around 6.7 per cent, which is fantastic. The Indian middle class is growing very rapidly. It is already estimated at over 200 million and is projected to grow to over 500 million in the next 15 years. That is amazing. India saves 35 per cent and has woken up to the world.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000057"></a>Today, we had a meeting with the Confederation of Indian Industry. It confirmed that today, more than ever, India is looking west. Having chaired the Indo-British Partnership for six years and the UKIBC, I have seen this Government&#146;s support for doing business in India go from zero to the &#163;1 million a year we receive from UK Trade &amp; Investment, which is fantastic. We are now generating our own income as well. It shows what a difference &#163;1 million can make to the bigger picture. It is an example of public/private partnership at its best because we work closely with UK Trade &amp; Investment, the British High Commission in India and the Indian High Commission over here.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000058"></a>We are seeing Indian investment here increase by leaps and bounds with Tata acquiring Corus and Jaguar Land Rover, hundreds of Indian companies investing in the UK, and trade between our two countries increasing rapidly with &#163;10 billion of goods and services both ways. However, I still believe we are scratching the surface. Vodaphone&#146;s purchase of Hutch in India has been an enormous success. In a short while, it set itself the target of 100 million users in India by 2010. It has already reached 74.1 million users.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000059"></a>Quantum leaps are being made. I always tell small businesses to go out to India and have a look for themselves. In 2004, there were 19 direct flights between the UK and India and two airlines to choose from. Today, there are more than 119 flights. British Airways alone has 43 flights per week to Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai and Kolkata, with flights to Hyderabad being added. However, there is so much more we need to do. The UKIBC recently released a report on emerging cities in India. They are cities we do not hear about over here, but they have enormous potential for British business&#151;and for SMEs in particular.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000060"></a>We have all been lucky recently to witness one of the greatest spectacles in the history of democracy: a country of 1.1 billion people voting in five phases over nearly four weeks with nearly 60 per cent of the population casting their votes. Regardless of which party they voted for, each vote represented democracy, justice, empowerment and the right to be heard, and the winner with the clearest margin was democracy. With a leader like Dr Manmohan Singh at the helm, we can expect greater reforms in every area, economic liberalisation and the opening up of pathways to and from the country. However, we must respond with openness, and we are continually criticised by Indian business about visas, which I find very embarrassing.</p>

<p><a name="090623107000061"></a>I conclude by imagining India and Britain as two great rainbow nations in every way, and a rainbow stretching between the UK and India. The normal story goes that there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, but there is a pot of gold at both ends of this rainbow.</p>
<h5><a name="090623107000131"></a>5.53 pm</h5>

<p><a name="090623107000062"></a><b><a name="90623-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="090623107000142"></a>Baroness Coussins:</b> I, too, am grateful to my noble friend Lord Janvrin for securing this debate. First, I put on record my thanks to the Industry and Parliament Trust for organising the delegation to India last March, of which I was fortunate to be part. Although it was my first visit to India, the advance briefing sessions organised by the IPT were detailed and wide-ranging and were reinforced by helpful sessions in Mumbai by UKTI and the British Council.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000063"></a>I wanted to go to Mumbai and Chennai to see what I could learn about how Indian businesses are responding to the challenge of corporate responsibility and sustainability issues, in which I have a special interest. My remarks on this topic will pick up from where my noble friend Lord Janvrin left off. I am also interested in the value placed by employers on language skills in the workforce and the impact of that on economic success. Finally, I wanted to learn something about the place and role of women in the labour market. On all three counts, I learnt a great deal, and I believe that British business could also learn a great deal and benefit from the closer economic ties with India that more relaxed regulation should encourage.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000064"></a>In the UK, my professional work is advising businesses on corporate responsibility, but I should perhaps declare here for the avoidance of doubt that I have never worked in any paid or unpaid capacity for any of the companies that we visited in India, or those whose names I shall mention today. I am aware that, in some cases, companies in the UK are still at the stage of needing to have the basic business case for social responsibility spelled out to them. In India, there seems to be a different, much more open and positive, mindset about this issue that UK companies looking to take advantage of business opportunities in India should appreciate.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000065"></a>We should not, of course, underestimate the different social backdrop against which these comparisons are made: the grinding poverty of India is overwhelming and 240 million people live on less than a dollar a day. Only 3 per cent of the workforce pays taxes, the remainder being in the so-called informal sector. Basic infrastructure like road building, rubbish clearance and public transport are desperately inadequate, and the culture of corruption is still rife across much of commercial and public life. However, perhaps because of all these things rather than despite them, leading-edge companies in India have understood and mainstreamed their corporate responsibility programmes in an impressive way. This goes both for Indian companies like the Supreme Group, Tata or the Bollywood studios, as well as for the vast big-name multinationals operating in India, such as BAe Systems, HSBC, Shell, Cadbury or KPMG. Of course, there is Hindustan Unilever, which my noble friend Lord Janvrin also mentioned, which, although part of Unilever's global operations,  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC432"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column GC432</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is uniquely permitted by the company to have its geographical designation of Hindustan in front of the word Unilever in recognition of its groundbreaking corporate history in India.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000066"></a>I have time only to mention briefly a few examples of what some of these companies are doing, but the best place to start is to quote Jamshetji Tata, the founder of the Tata Group, who said as long ago as 1904:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="090623107000122"></a>&#147;In a free enterprise, the community is not just another stakeholder in the business, but is in fact the very purpose of its existence&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090623107000119"></a>This is a good summary of the philosophical case for embracing corporate social responsibility. The community comprises your future consumer base, future workforce, future investors and future shareholders, so it is nothing more nor less than enlightened self-interest which should drive responsible business practice in the interests both of commercial success and social benefits.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000067"></a>In Tata's case, it has identified the opportunities offered by the growth of the so-called second-tier cities in India as a focus for backing a massive road-building programme, which, together with their new environmentally friendly Nano cars, will offer new routes to market for millions of rural producers. Prospective UK investors and businesses would also do well to look at the second-tier cities and not just target the obvious places like Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi and Bangalore.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000068"></a>I will also mention the work that we heard about at HSBC in Mumbai, which sets a genuinely global standard in understanding what corporate sustainability is all about. Through partnerships with NGOs, its programme empowers rural women with economic and educational skills and experience. This results in possibly the only real example of the achievement of social mobility we saw and, of course, helps to provide HSBC with a broader base of customers and workforce for the future.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000069"></a>An excellent example of corporate social responsibility delivering a win-win situation in both India and the UK is the manufacture of sustainable packaging by the Supreme Group. Accredited by the Fairtrade Foundation, Supreme's eco-friendly and ethically manufactured bags not only provide much employment in state-of-the-art factories in south India, they provide the bags for several UK supermarket chains including Tesco, Sainsbury and the Co-op, which helps these companies meet their own environmental targets&#151;and the rest of us to use less plastic.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000070"></a>I also want to mention the concept of social enterprise, and one particular example in Mumbai which demonstrates brilliantly what can be achieved by an ambitious young individual trained in business and economics who wanted to put her skills to use by meeting a social need through the medium of business. This was a young woman who established a company called Dial 1298, which is Mumbai's&#151;and probably the world&#146;s&#151;first sustainable ambulance service. Mumbai did not have an ambulance service that served the whole population, free and on the basis of need. Sweta Mangal decided to set one up, which would sustain itself by charging people who wanted to be taken to private hospitals, so that a free service could be provided  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC433"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column GC433</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to everyone else. The company now attracts independent investment, and receives technical advice from the London Ambulance Service, which Sweta Mangal had come across herself when she was a postgraduate student at the LSE. The company is seeking further investors and partner organisations so that it can roll out the 1298 service in eight more Indian cities and the entire state of Kerala over the next five years. I ask the Government to ensure that opportunities to engage with social enterprise in India are drawn to the attention of UK businesses in the same way as more traditional, profit-making commercial opportunities are.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000071"></a>Sweta Mangal's postgraduate study outside India is a typical story, which is also relevant to why India's economy is so healthy. Well-educated Indian graduates are hungry for experience and opportunities and their confidence, ambition and willingness to take risks is an attitude the UK could learn from. In a global market, and with multilingual skills as well as top-notch scientific credentials, Indian graduates are in a position to exercise a significant competitive edge over UK graduates in the jobs market. I hope that the Government will do more to encourage UK graduates to seek post-graduate and work experience in India, in order to broaden their horizons and enhance their competitive position.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000072"></a>I read an article in the <I>Hindu</I> newspaper while I was there that seemed to sum up the attitude I was talking about. It was about how teachers at a Chennai training centre, which offers courses in 26 languages, were reporting a surprising new demand for learning Swedish. This turned out to be because Sweden had recently relaxed its visa requirements, which in turn had opened up educational opportunities for Indian students, who were seizing them with great alacrity and making sure they learnt Swedish first. India expects to be the world's second largest economy by 2050. Despite the obstacles of scale, India has lessons to teach the UK and business opportunities to offer, both here and there. I look forward to hearing from the Minister how the Government intend to make sure the UK learns from, contributes to and benefits from India's economic success.</p>
<h5><a name="090623107000132"></a>6.02 pm</h5>

<p><a name="090623107000073"></a><b><a name="90623-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="090623107000143"></a>Lord Dholakia:</b> First, I take this opportunity to thank the noble Lord, Lord Janvrin, for this important debate. The noble Lord could not have chosen a better time because a number of key events have taken place over the past few weeks both here and in India.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000074"></a>First, we had the general election&#151;a point well made by the noble Lords, Lord Bilimoria and Lord Janvrin, in the world's largest democracy of 1,000 million people. The sheer scale of the operation beggars belief. Over 650 million voters went to the polls over a few weeks to elect a new Government. That is twice the number of electors in the whole of the European Community. It was almost a faultless performance with the use of electronic computerised voting machines. Unlike Iran and Zimbabwe, there were no allegations of vote rigging. The most important part of the process was that a substantial number of voters participated. That puts our European elections to shame when the mother of democracy cannot get even half her electors to the polls. The results demonstrated a strong Congress  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC434"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column GC434</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government. Communal politics have been cast aside and the fundamentalist parties could not dent the desire of Indians to have a secular country. Look around the subcontinent; while the rest of the neighbours are faltering to maintain the semblance of a democracy, India has emerged as one of the most important, mature democracies in the world.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000075"></a>Secondly, I draw attention to the meeting held between the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the Indo-British All-Party Parliamentary Group on 9 June 2009 at the House of Lords. We were delighted to welcome Dr Amit Mitra the chief executive of FICCI and its director Harsh Pati Singhania. The meeting featured the former President of India, Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, who spoke about the global sharing of knowledge and resources to improve development. The dialogue between the two groups revealed the extent of the opportunities and the enthusiasm on the part of Indian businesses to interact and forge relationships with UK business. That has been achieved to some extent with big business and large corporations. However, it was revealed that the UK's reception of Indian business teams is the weakest in Europe. France, for example, hosted bilateral trade talks with Indian and French businesses, with over 200 French corporations represented. The UK is also under-utilising its small and medium enterprises in its trade relations with India.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000076"></a>FICCI noted specifically that it has a dynamic and growing corporate sector, which is interested in working with UK SMEs. Unfortunately, all requests to the UK Government and business organisations have received little or no response, other than some of the initiatives taken by the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, and others. I hope that the Minister will have some comment to make on that point.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000077"></a>While UK regional development authorities, such as the UK India Business Council and the CBI, work on SME-related issues, they are all disjointed and work on piecemeal projects. As a result, no one knows what is happening on a regional or even a countrywide basis. The main deficiency is the absence of a single co-ordinating body that is able to mobilise a quality, robust SME group that could engage in large-scale business-to-business meetings. FICCI, for example, has been doing this with all other European communities, such as France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. Why not the United Kingdom?</p>

<a name="90623-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000078"></a>This is a longstanding problem. There is an urgent need to have a co-ordinated effort from the UK to get Indian SMEs and their UK counterparts to engage in an exchange of bilateral trade. We are looking for the Government to take some kind of leadership role and harness the UK's SMEs. The advantages of this approach are two-fold. It will generate enormous growth in entrepreneurial activity, which is one of the most important forms of economic growth in the recession. With ordinary avenues of employment shut down, many highly skilled individuals are unemployed. Their skills need to be harnessed and the self-starters encouraged in engaging in creative, innovative work. Secondly, it is highly advantageous for the long-term eradication of poverty in countries such as India, where entrepreneurship is often the only way out of poverty.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC435"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column GC435</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90623-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000079"></a>However, it is also important that people who become wealthy, who are able to generate large sums of money, do not take a top-down approach. The development of the country as a whole needs to be linked to the increase in high-net worth individuals so that the generation of wealth does not create a country of rich and poor but rather a healthy economy which helps to alleviate the dire poverty which affects all of them. According to the World Bank, small and medium enterprises are essential for dynamic economic growth and job creation. The sector in India has been hit hard by the current downturn with credit growth slowing and demand falling in both domestic and export markets. Improving access to finance for this sector is the key to long-term development. This cannot be achieved without robust attention to the role of women in the formal and informal sectors. Hard work alone is not enough to promote economic mobility. Organized dialogue in all sectors and also across urban and rural areas between India and the UK is the key to achieving millennium development goal number one: the eradication of poverty.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000080"></a>India is often criticised for its government, particularly in relation to its bureaucracy. It is said that Britain invented bureaucracy and that India perfected it in triplicate. However, let us remember that there are more than 1 million self-help groups, many supported by NGOs, which are creating a grassroots revolution. The magnitude of this invisible groundswell is much larger than Grameen Bank. The positive side of the Indian economy is its strong financial institutions. There is a great challenge ahead: the demographic dividend can be prevented from becoming a demographic deficit. We salute the major conglomerates like Tata and others, which have shown what can be done in their contribution to India&#146;s economy. They may not feature in a list of the world&#146;s richest millionaires, but their contribution to alleviating poverty and promoting educational programmes is second to none.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000081"></a>I am delighted that the Minister is responding to this debate. I do not wish to make him uncomfortable, but I will pose questions. Why is there not an exemption from social security contributions for Indian professionals on short-duration visits from India? They pay social security contributions despite no social security benefits being available to them. If Belgium, France and Germany can do this, why can the United Kingdom not do it? Bilateral trade is also impacted by our visa regime. I do not criticise the points system, but repeated attention is drawn to the difficulties of obtaining a visa. We are not talking about immigration, but we should make sure that business visitors and senior providers are facilitated to travel to the UK to explore business opportunities and business contracts. Will the Minister not accept that timelines are short in the business world? We need clarity, uniformity and transparency in visa and work permit procedures. An example is the IT industry. It is particularly impacted by issues such as delivery of service, which is dependent on movement of professionals at short notice.</p>

Then there is the classification of Indian products. A case in point is the Indian whisky made not of malt but of molasses. It cannot be sold as whisky here, so now the British Government term it rum. Something must be fundamentally wrong. I do not wish to undermine the quality of Scotch, but India consumes a substantial amount of Black Label, yet it cannot reciprocate by selling its own product in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="090623107000084"></a>Finally, in the 17th century, Britain entered into trade with India in the name of the British East India Company. That was 250 years ago and provided us with 250 years of British rule. I promise one thing: Indians are not here to establish Indian rule or an Indian Raj, but they can surely show a way out of the dire economic predicament in which we find ourselves.</p>

<p><a name="090623107000086"></a>India has always held a special fascination for the English. I do not think that we, today, fully realise quite how much, in relatively recent times, India dominated the thoughts and aspirations of so many English men and women. India, with its huge diversity and its immense variety of scenery, culture and climate still retains its fascination&#151;a fascination almost mesmerising, as one sees the country rising from nowhere to become one of the foremost economies in the world, as commented upon by many of your Lordships, including the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000087"></a>Reforms in the 1980s and 1990s have allowed business the freedom to develop, and one can only stand in awe at the release of the energy and vitality of India's 1.2 billion inhabitants, which has driven the economy forward and enabled the development and manufacture of increasingly sophisticated goods. Anyone who revisits today one of the main Indian towns after a gap of as little as three or four years will hardly recognise the place. It is unquestionably an economy and a country in which British companies should be heavily involved. As well as an enormous and fast-growing market place, there are other advantages, such as no language barriers, a generally warm welcome to the English, a legal system which is at least comprehensible and a skilled workforce which grows in number on a daily basis.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000088"></a>Equally, we should welcome Indian investment in, and involvement with, the UK economy. Sadly, recent events have not shown Her Majesty's Government at their best. The Foreign Secretary's recent visit to India was not a success. It is a mystery to me how a Government such as the present one, with their record of failure, can have the temerity to start dictating to others how to run their affairs&#151;especially a country like India which is currently demonstrating such success.</p>

<p><a name="090623107000089"></a>Closer to home, there is the case of Tata, owner of Jaguar Land Rover and other major investments in the UK. I read in the press that, because of the economic downturn, Tata is now seeking further working capital on normal commercial terms&#151;although from banks; there would be Government involvement. I am unable to comment on the merits or otherwise of this request, but I hope that Her Majesty's Government will bear in mind that Tata, as has been mentioned today, is a serious Indian company and not the sort of business out for the quick kill, but here for the long term. It is one of the largest and most highly respected companies in India and all the work of such organisations as UK Trade and Investment, and the other organisations that we have heard of in the debate today, will become pointless if Indian investors see that a company of the stature of Tata is not treated with respect and straight dealing.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000090"></a>I ask the Minister to help avoid creating an example to potential Indian investors as to why they should avoid the United Kingdom. There is great affection in India for this country, and it would be a pity for anything to damage that goodwill.</p>

I am glad to have the opportunity to discuss the issues that he and other members of the Committee have raised this afternoon. It has been a wide-ranging and fascinating debate. I confess an interest in as much as I live in Southall, a centre for Indian businessmen, and have a love of Indian literature and culture.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000092"></a>This is a historic moment for India. Less than a month ago, we witnessed the conclusion of the elections in the world&#146;s largest democracy, an election that has returned a Government with an increased mandate to drive forward economic reform&#151;a point emphasised by the noble Lords, Lord Bilimoria and Lord Dholakia. I am confident that India&#146;s commitment to the liberalisation of its economy can only be strengthened and will continue, because here is a Government who genuinely understand that opening up the economy will create a quantum leap in India&#146;s ability to attract foreign investment, accelerate much-needed infrastructure development and drive forward inclusive, sustainable growth.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000093"></a>India is not immune from the global downturn. It no longer remains on the sidelines of the crisis. Growth is likely to fall to 4.5 per cent in 2009 from the 8.5 per cent average of recent years. It is estimated that there will be an extra 9 to 12 million Indians living in poverty in 2009 as a result. While 6 per cent growth might seem high to us, for India to achieve its millennium development goals and lift the 456 million Indians who live on less than $1.25 a day out of poverty, it needs to deliver sustained growth of at least 9 per cent a year. Unlike in China, the population is getting younger, but India will be able to reap this demographic dividend only if it makes substantial investments in its physical and social infrastructure. UK companies have

<a name="90623-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000094"></a>Since 1991, India&#146;s gradual opening up to international trade has fuelled consistently high economic growth that has made a real and substantial impact on people&#146;s lives in India. Now India is entering a new phase&#151;it is moving up the value chain. Whereas the early years of its growth were fuelled by offshoring and low-cost, low-value service provision, the emphasis now is on value-added, R&amp;D-rich, manufacturing and services&#151;from ground breaking new oncology treatments in the pharmaceuticals sector, to highly sophisticated knowledge process outsourcing, to world-class, innovative production in sectors as diverse as nanotechnology, animation and renewable energy.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000095"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, and the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, remarked, we are witnessing the beginnings of a geographical shift to the tier 2 and tier 3 cities of India, where new clusters and new opportunities are emerging and where those who have not so far benefited from India&#146;s awakening will have a chance to do so.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000096"></a>For UK companies to maximise their potential for success in India, they need to understand that the Indian market of today is not the same as it was 10 years ago, or even five years ago; the opportunities, the challenges, and the business environment have moved on, and so must the mindset of any UK entrepreneur seeking to engage with India. There is a critical need, therefore, to raise awareness in the UK of the new opportunities emerging in India so that our companies can maximise the potential from this challenging, exciting and important market. We were urged in that direction by everyone who contributed to this debate, especially the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia. I am delighted, therefore, that on 9 June, during World Trade Week, my noble friend Lord Davies, Minister for Trade, Investment and Business, officiated at the UK India Business Council launch of a detailed report on the opportunities that exist in tier 2 cities in India. The UKIBC will now work in partnership with our UK trade and investment staff in India over the course of the coming year on outreach activities in these cities, aimed at alerting and demonstrating to British business the opportunities that they represent.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000097"></a>I have a couple of comments on UK social responsibility&#151;an area that I declare an interest in as I am still the vice chair of the Ethical Trading Initiative. Benoy, an architecture firm based near Nottingham, builds retail malls in tier 2 cities in India. It is very successful. It built 50 houses for low-income families at the same time as building a mall. I was interested in the comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, about the Tata approach on enterprise and the responsibility to community, and the Supreme Group and its eco-friendly bags. I was even more interested, as my young daughter is currently studying for a degree in paramedics, to hear about the Dial 1298 sustainable ambulance service. I would be fascinated to hear more about that. A point was also made about the opportunities for UK companies to engage with social enterprise.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000098"></a>If there was a difference in the analysis, I felt that the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, did not fully recognise the work going on by the UKTI network. We have 86 staff working in nine offices in India&#151;an increase of 18 per cent over the last couple of years. These new staff include a financial services specialist seconded by the Treasury to the Deputy High Commission in Mumbai, and a new deputy director based in Delhi to oversee the UKTI network in India. The team has a real record of success, generating nearly &#163;270,000 in chargeable services last year, providing support to nearly 3,000 British companies seeking to do business in India.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000099"></a>As a matter of interest, 90 per cent of UKTI customers are SMEs; 50 per cent of all Indian investments in the EU are in the UK. The British Chambers of Commerce work closely with the UK Indian Business Council and the UKTI to help SMEs to get into India. The UK Indian Business Council has a special programme called Next Generation, which helps new young entrepreneurs and SMEs break into Indian markets. I do not feel competent to comment on the rather complex rum deal in relation to&#151;</p>

Those are the people at the other end who know precisely what is going on in relation to the business issues that I was talking about. It was their reflection and if they do not know, it is no good saying, &#147;This is what we are doing&#148;. It is about time those people at the other end are informed about the activities the British Government are undertaking in their country.</p>

<p><a name="090623107000101"></a><b><a name="90623-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="090623107000147"></a>Lord Young of Norwood Green:</b> I will reply to the noble Lord on that point to ensure that we are doing as he says.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000102"></a>I will give a few examples of the recent successes that UKTI in India has been involved with in the last three months. It has helped Pavers Shoes, a Yorkshire-based family firm, with plans to set up a manufacturing facility in India and collaborate with local partners to set up 1,000 retail outlets across the country. It helped Sheffield Forgemasters to win a &#163;30 million contract in March as part of a technology transfer deal with Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited. In February, it supported Integrated Project Management Limited in winning the supervisory project contract for the expansion of Chennai airport. Of course, UKTI has been instrumental in supporting some of the biggest UK commercial deals in India, such as Cairn Energy&#146;s oil project in Rajasthan, which will provide 20 per cent of all of India&#146;s domestic oil production, and Vodafone&#146;s $11billion acquisition of Hutch Essar, the biggest ever British investment in India.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000103"></a>It is through this commitment that UK exports to India in 2008&#151;the latest year for which figures are available&#151;were at &#163;5.9 billion, an increase of 49 per cent on 2005. The UK is now the third biggest exporter to India. There is no room for complacency, but that is surely not a bad track record. We would all like to improve the situation, but on that basis I would rather see the glass half full than half empty, as it was in the assessment of the noble Lord, Lord Howard.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC440"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column GC440</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90623-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000104"></a>We can achieve far more in India. That is why, in 2007, in response to a recommendation by the Trade and Industry Committee, we decided to set up and fund a new organisation&#151;the UK India Business Council. The UKIBC receives &#163;1million of grant funding per year from UKTI and is on course to achieve full match funding from the private sector by the end of its third full year of operation. It plays an important role in supporting our efforts to raise awareness of the opportunities in India&#151;something that all contributors to the debate have emphasised, and they are surely right.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000105"></a>The UKIBC&#146;s programme plan for 2009-10 has an ambitious set of objectives. It aims to advise at least 800 UK companies through the course of the year, referring at least 400 of those to UKTI for specific, bespoke support. It will also continue to produce research and conduct awareness raising events throughout the UK, support us on ministerial and other high-level visits and on the full range of bilateral trade issues that we address under the banner of the Joint Economic Trade Committee.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000106"></a>The UKIBC has a real asset in its board members, its staff and the networks of entrepreneurs and business leaders that it has created in order to capitalise on the opportunities of the new, emerging India. I would like specifically to mention the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, the chair of the UKIBC, whose visionary leadership, dynamism and passionate commitment has been instrumental in driving forward our relationship with India. He will step down as chair in July, and we sincerely thank him for his marvellous efforts. He will be succeeded by Patricia Hewitt. I am delighted, however, that he has decided to stay on as president of the UKIBC and will still be playing a role in the organisation in the years to come. We will only benefit from that experience.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000107"></a>The scope for increasing bilateral trade between the UK and India is limited by the fact that, despite 18 years of economic liberalisation, some key sectors in India remain closed or partially closed to foreign competition. There are regulatory hurdles and legislative barriers that prevent our banks, accountants, law firms, retailers, insurers and educational institutions, to name but a few sectors, from competing in the open market. The Joint Economic Trade Committee was launched in 2004 to address these market access issues so that both countries can benefit. They will benefit if there is more open trade.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000108"></a>When my noble friend Lord Mandelson co-chaired the last JETCO meeting in Delhi with Kamal Nath, the then Indian Commerce Minister, in January, he emphasised the advantages to the Indian economy of opening up to wider competition. He also stressed that UK companies were mindful of the perceptions that some in India had of the perceived threat to domestic concerns of market opening, and that is why we have factored these issues into our lobbying strategy. For example, my noble friend Lord Mandelson, launched a financial inclusion strategy during his visit, the aim of which was to raise India&#146;s awareness of the extent to which UK financial service companies are committed to participating in an inclusive growth agenda. Similarly,

<a name="90623-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000109"></a>I am conscious of the time, so I should like to end on inward investment. Around 600 Indian companies have a base in the UK, of which approximately two-thirds are in the ICT/software sector, the next significant knowledge sector being pharmaceuticals. Their investment is worth around &#163;9 billion, and the UK attracts around 50 per cent of all Indian investment in Europe.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000110"></a>The success of Indian entrepreneurs in the UK is well known in India. India has entrepreneurial talent and is a priority market for UKTI&#146;s Global Entrepreneur programme, supporting links between exceptionally talented entrepreneurs and their counterparts in the UK.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="090623107000111"></a>India is a young country; 40 per cent of the population is under 15. As we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, it has a young mindset. Challenges are huge as regards poverty, social exclusion and literacy but, if the economy opens up, UK companies have a lot of expertise to offer and can drive forward long-term, sustainable and inclusive growth. Once again, I thank noble Lords for the opportunity to debate this vital issue. If there are one or two points that we have not covered, we shall do that in writing.</p>

<p><a name="090623113000004"></a>We reap what we sow. When we fail to value our social workers and our residential childcare workers, we are responsible for what follows. For instance, when we point a finger at the principal social worker responsible for Victoria Climbi&#233;, three fingers point back at us, indicating our failures to provide the framework in which that social worker could succeed.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000005"></a>A fortnight ago, I received an email from a recently qualified child and family social worker. It stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="090623113000054"></a>&#147;Last week I happened to interview three newly qualified social workers working in child protection for my research project. The interviews were very hard as all the three social workers broke down and questioned why they were putting themselves through this; with one social worker telling me that the interview was the first time in months that she had a chance to reflect on her work and talk to someone about her practice and its emotional impact&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="090623113000053"></a>When we neglect the people at the front line working with our most vulnerable and challenging children and families, we find ourselves with consequences unbearable to own, and rather than taking responsibility for our failures, we too often blame the staff or their managers.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000006"></a>I was prompted to table this debate in response to the death of Baby Peter. I was reminded that so few of us know what these practitioners do day by day. We all know teachers, doctors and nurses, but how many of us have spent time with a social worker or residential childcare worker or with their clients? I hope that this debate may increase awareness of the important, varied and challenging work that these professionals do. Will the Minister undertake to do all that she can to deepen understanding in Parliament of what they do? Without this understanding, I fear that we will never create the secure base that makes practice effective and safe.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000007"></a>I pay tribute to front-line child and family social workers for what they do. These professionals are the advocates for families with disabled children, helping the child with Down's syndrome to get the support he needs to enjoy life. They are the people who enter squalid flats, braving bull mastiffs and threatening language to check on a child's welfare. They are the ones who support the child in care, taking a consistent interest in their welfare, being at the end of the phone, sending Christmas and birthday cards. They are the ones with the judgment of Solomon, who decide whether a child is safe in their family, whether they should be placed with their grandmother or aunt or better placed in care. They are the ones requiring the judgment to weigh all the factors and make the best decision in the circumstances, a decision which may profoundly affect that child's whole life. Truly, we should value these people at least as highly as we do doctors or lawyers.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000008"></a>I now pay tribute to residential childcare workers. These are the staff who sit with an asylum-seeking child from Afghanistan and comfort her on the evening she hears that her parents' town is being shelled. They listen to the young woman from Sierra Leone as she weeps and tells of how her sister had her hand cut off by a militia man. They comfort the bulimic, the anorexic and the self harmer. They have to respond to the child who absents himself from home overnight and the young women who has been receiving gifts from men, possibly grooming her for prostitution. They befriend the children who have been abused, physically, sexually

<p><a name="090623113000009"></a>According to the Office for National Statistics, 68 per cent of children in residential care have a mental disorder. A psychiatrist observed to me that often the profile of needs of children in a residential home is close to that in a psychiatric unit. In the latter, the carers are nurses and a doctor acts as manager. In children's homes, the staff are still often without a minimal qualification and managers are without a degree. Surely, we should value staff in children's homes as highly as doctors or nurses. When staff in children's homes can be paid less than those working at the check-out in a local supermarket and when newly qualified social workers can receive minimal support, as my noble friend Lord Laming's most recent report highlighted, are not we guilty of monstrous ingratitude for their work?</p>

<a name="90623-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000010"></a>Carl Anselmo, a care leaver and current intern of David Kidney, MP for Stafford, spoke last week of what he had learnt in Parliament. He said that, most of all, he now recognised the need for parliamentarians to understand much better what social workers, foster carers and other front-line workers do. This is all the more important, I think, because of the tremendous progress that Her Majesty&#146;s Government have made in recent years in beginning to address the needs of these practitioners. The Social Work Task Force, led by the respected Moira Gibb, chief executive of Camden local authority, is expected to report in the autumn. There is now the opportunity for the Government to do for social work what they have so successfully done for teachers: to raise the status of the profession and restore its standing. Yet Ms Moira Gibb has raised concerns that the recession may undo some of this tremendous progress. Many parliamentarians may soon, I regret, depart. How do we sustain the gains made? Surely, this legacy must not be lost. Will the Minister consider learning from business and the armed services as she thinks how to bring the experience of front-line social care more powerfully to the heart of Parliament?</p>

<a name="90623-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000011"></a>The Industry and Parliament Trust provides fellowships in business for parliamentarians. Could this model be adapted for social care? Would the Minister consider offering hospitality to parliamentarians and front-line practitioners to make the work of the latter more vivid and present for us? I recognise the good work already done by the General Social Care Council and others in this regard. A health visitor&#146;s representative recently advised me that there are four health visitors ready to take me or other parliamentarians on their visits to some of their clients. Would such an offer be impossible from social workers? Might Parliament not develop a corporate social responsibility policy involving visits to front-line practice? I recognise that many parliamentarians already take a great interest in this area.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000012"></a>I thank again all the child and family social workers and residential children&#146;s work workers making a difference to the lives of their children. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response to this debate and to learning of examples of good practice. I repeat my sincere thanks to noble Lords who are to speak.</p>

It is because I have unqualified respect for the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, who always raises the standard of our debates on issues of this kind, not just because he speaks with passion and sincerity but because he speaks with experience of the subjects under consideration. He is a frontline worker. In the second Chamber of Parliament&#151;and we all say that the great advantage of a place like this is that it brings so much experience together for our deliberations&#151;we are short of people with frontline experience in this sphere of our national life. The suggestions that the noble Earl made about giving opportunities for parliamentarians to familiarise themselves with the realities of what this entails by spending real time with social workers in action in society are commendable. I hope that the Minister can endorse that suggestion and look at ways in which it can be furthered.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000014"></a>There is a wider reason why I want to speak in this debate. I worry about our society. What kind of society do we want to be? What has happened to us that we have become so materialist that we all sneer at the concepts of compassion and concern? I sometimes wonder whether there is not a sort of defensive psychological dimension to public attitudes: people have a guilt complex about not doing all they should to ensure the well-being of children, so they look for scapegoats to blame when things go wrong and project the responsibility that we all share on to an individual, quite unfairly. We now hear that there are indications of a crisis developing in the recruitment of social workers. The evidence so far is anecdotal, but it seems likely. After the way in which the cheap, superficial, entertainment media have sensationalised serious events in recent years, I am hardly surprised. Why would somebody want to go and expose themselves to that kind of not just ill-informed, but easy, sordid criticism that will sell more newspapers? Every time something goes wrong, the overriding critical priority is to get to the bottom of it and to consider it judiciously and carefully, not quickly to find a scapegoat, blame him and run him out of town. The noble Earl is right in what he said; we all share responsibility in these circumstances.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000015"></a>When we are discussing penal policy, we discuss the problems of the young in detention. In debates in that context, I have said more than once over my years in this House that when I had the opportunity to see some of that work at first hand, I was repeatedly struck by how it would be miraculous if young people did not end up in an offender institution because of the failures of society on so many fronts and the nightmare that they had gone through in their lives. Then to expect a social worker suddenly to be parachuted into a situation and to make right everything that has gone wrong in society as a whole is just unimaginative and stupid, as well as being very wrong. As the noble Earl said, many social workers have been seriously damaged for a lifetime by the kind of ill informed and vicious criticism that is meted out. Of course, it is very easy to say, &#147;All that is very well but it is bleeding heart liberalism and not the tough stuff of managing society&#148;.  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC445"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column GC445</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I happen to believe that it is the liberal sentiments of the so-called bleeding heart liberal&#151;and noble Lords present who belong to the Liberal party will forgive me if I use that word not in a party-political sense&#151;that get to the heart of the issue. That is why it is easier to sideline them in deprecating terms of that sort.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000016"></a>If we are to get this right, we all have a responsibly to recognise that there are not scapegoats. It is not individuals who are responsible; we are all responsible, as the noble Earl said. In that context, we must resist the temptation to pass off our responsibility on to the shoulders of others. I am very glad that the noble Earl introduced tonight&#146;s debate and glad of the siren call that he put forward praising and building up our social workers. Why do our newspapers not tell more success stories and more cheerful stories about the good work that is done all over the place, day in and night out, all over the country? There are, as he says, dedicated people who are working with conditions of service that are not as good as they would get working at a checkout in a supermarket. We must get our priorities right in society, and the noble Earl has again given us an opportunity to open up a debate in that direction. What can we say to the journalists who play the cheap game and play to the gallery in a nasty, sinister way? What can we say to politicians of all parties who do the same thing? Let us not pretend that the political community is immune from the fault of looking for easy scapegoats instead of taking the opportunity to educate the public as a whole about the complexity of the situation. Let us say, &#147;Each time you behave in that way, you become very much part of the problem and not the solution&#148;.</p>

The noble Earl is a great champion of disadvantaged children and families and raises issues with great knowledge and passion that should be of concern to us all. I am also greatly encouraged to hear the noble Lord, Lord Judd, extol the virtues of liberalism.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000018"></a>We have spoken on previous occasions in this Chamber of our dismay that the United Kingdom, one of the wealthiest countries in the world, fails to ensure that all our children have care and support commensurate with our national resources. International reviews and analysis has the UK well down on the list in the well-being of children. We know that the Government are investing &#163;130 million in social work reform, including &#163;57.8 million in response to the report from the noble Lord, Lord Laming. The increase in expenditure on children&#146;s social care has increased by more than 90 per cent in the past 10 years, which is a commendable response to need but a sad reflection that the need is so great. The figure also raises questions over whether the resources are being used to best effect.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000019"></a>Without any doubt, social workers undertake a complex and difficult job, as the noble Earl described so graphically, taking decisions that can be life-changing for children and families. They work with unfortunate, dysfunctional and sometimes dangerous communities and, to quote the Social Work Task Force, they do,</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC446"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column GC446</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul><a name="090623113000056"></a>&#147;some of the most valuable yet challenging jobs in our society. They support people at times in their lives when&#151;perhaps because of bereavement, addiction, mental illness, disability, old age or because children are at risk of neglect or abuse&#151;they are at their most vulnerable, and can be most difficult to help&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000020"></a>The task force's first report last month sets out clearly the messages from social workers of the stresses of their work, the pressure of high caseloads, staff shortages, bureaucracy and a lack of resources to do the job. Sometimes it is the lack of quality supervision, poor IT systems, an office environment which makes it difficult to work confidentially, or burdensome processes. In order to comply with the integrated children's system, experienced people find that in this sector, as in other professional sectors, administration detracts from professional judgment and expertise. Given the nature of this work, in sensitive and often highly charged cases, it is to the credit of this hard-working profession that, with nearly 80,000 social workers, over a period of three years only 74 conduct hearings were completed. Yet the GSCC receives an average of 42 complaints about social workers a month. That is a picture of how many of these complaints end up being without foundation or cause to pursue.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000021"></a>Social workers need a rich variety of personal skills, yet are often measured in mechanistic, numeric ways. We see the dead hand of filling forms and ticking boxes, which is rewarded more readily than humanity, judgment and care. We have the extreme example, which has already been cited, of the Baby Peter case, where the measurable reports rated well, yet a young child suffered and died. The publicity from that tragic case had ramifications which could endanger more young lives. The media raged against failures in social work, and this undoubtedly had an effect on current and potential social workers. Those of us in politics and Parliament at this time can begin to understand how demoralising it can be to have an entire profession tarred with the shortcomings of a very few. Following the Baby Peter case, the <I>Guardian</I> in February declared:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="090623113000055"></a>&#147;The same voices who are so keen to diagnose gaping wounds in society are often also the most given to attack the profession that administers the social bandages&#148;.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000022"></a>Vacancy rates in some areas have threatened to become a vicious circle, as shortages impose additional, sometimes intolerable, burdens on remaining staff. A recent survey from the Local Government Association reported that councils are struggling to fill vacancies in children's services, with 57 per cent finding it harder to recruit child social workers over the past six months and 38 per cent saying that it has become more difficult to keep them. A staggering 91 per cent report difficulties in retaining frontline workers; in that connection, I, too, welcome the noble Earl&#146;s suggestion that some of us might perhaps experience at first hand what some of the social workers are living through on a daily basis. These shortages cannot be adequately filled with temporary appointments. It is a real danger that good people are being deterred and fewer people are coming forward as social workers. We are now also hearing of shortages of foster parents, so that young people who might benefit from and flourish in a family situation find themselves in residential homes, not because it is best for them but because it is the only accommodation available.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC447"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column GC447</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000023"></a>The Government's response needs to be positive and creative, with education of course having a key part to play. Currently in your Lordships' House, we are considering the Apprenticeship, Skills, Children and Learning Bill, parts of which address measures for children in residential care. There are measures to ensure continuity of care and education for young people, endeavouring to put in place measures for the children of today to become confident and caring parents of tomorrow. As a long-term aspiration, we should surely aim to reduce the number of children and families in need of social care, through reducing the number of children who become disenchanted and demotivated while at school.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000024"></a>That Bill also addresses apprenticeships, aiming to expand the numbers of employment opportunities for the young. Apprenticeships can be appropriate for adults, too, and the Government have announced plans for 50,000 new adult social care apprenticeships and a new management trainee scheme. The General Social Care Council is working with other bodies to expand education and training. Since the creation of social work degree courses in 2003, they have registered over 10,000 graduates, but it is not known how many of those graduates are currently practising social workers. By its very nature, social work tends to involve high levels of practical vocational achievement, which may more appropriately be accredited through vocational certification than academic, but having a degree pathway offers wider choices to those in the profession.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000025"></a>It is a reality that too many children and families do not have the quality of life that this country should offer them. There have been reports, task forces, and initiatives addressing these issues. We should now be seeing action, results and improvements, not just in numeric reports but in cultural changes in behaviour, as the noble Lord, Lord Judd, said, and in a more caring and supportive society. I look forward to hearing from the Minister on how the Government are responding to the issues raised so pertinently this evening by the noble Earl.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Judd, is of course right: it is crucial that we do not scapegoat individuals but look more broadly at what we expect from social workers and the system.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000027"></a>I declare an interest as a provider of social care in the care sector. I understand very much the concerns that the noble Earl raises. The sector has undergone many dark days, yet even with all the reports, inquiries and recommendations, we often find ourselves reading news headlines reporting another victim and another social worker being blamed. Recent figures show that nearly half our local authorities have a social worker vacancy rate higher than 10 per cent and at least eight local authorities are missing at least one-third of the required number of social workers. While vacancy rates rise, we have also seen an increased demand for care places; March 2009 saw the highest figure ever

Can the Minister say if there are sufficient resources and accommodation to care for these children?</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000028"></a>We were all dismayed when we read the horrific details of baby Peter&#146;s injuries. Since then, some other cases have been reported and, while the Government have said that they accept the recommendations made by the noble Lord, Lord Laming, after the enquiry into baby Peter's death, I urge the Minister to look at one of the proposals made by my own party to create the role of chief social worker. That person would work across government departments, with unions such as Unison, BASW and with other bodies to ensure that what often falls between different departments is delivered through a much more focused direction led by a dedicated person.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000029"></a>If we are to ensure that social workers command the same respect as workers in healthcare, we first need to raise their standing in the community. I come across social workers who are extremely committed to caring for, protecting and delivering effective services to those in their charge. The difficulty that the sector has is that it remains the Cinderella service of healthcare and social care. My honourable friend Tim Loughton convened a social workers commission to examine how children's social work can be strengthened and supported. The findings placed great emphasis on improving training, working conditions and front-line services. That cannot happen if social workers are tied to their desks through bureaucracy and form-filling. Will the Minster look at a programme, similar to Teach First, dedicated to care to help and encourage graduates enter the profession of social work?</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000030"></a>For children who are the most vulnerable and whose start in life has seen little happiness, stability or love, the most important thing is to know that the person managing their case work is constant and that they will not be not pushed from pillar to post with different social workers as each time there is a change the relationship needs to be redeveloped.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000031"></a>How do we put value on those who deliver the service? We should surely do so, first, by looking at pay structures that correspond with those of similar professionals working in multi-agency teams and recognise differences in living costs across the country. Given the shortage of qualified social workers, can the Minister say whether she agrees with me that the Government&#146;s recent recruitment campaign to encourage 500 former social workers to return to work will still fall short of the numbers required? What interest has there been and what has been the cost of the campaign?</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000032"></a>I have long argued that if we are to be serious about encouraging people to work in the sector, there must be a real change in the Government&#146;s attitude to the value and savings that the sector brings if early intervention with multi-agency support can be made consistent when a child enters the system. The Baby Peter case, like that of Victoria Climbi&#233;, highlighted the failings of communication and contact with the children. What is being done to employ more health visitors? How will those staff employed from outside of Great Britain be assessed for recognising circumstances that may be culturally different from their own? There may be issues around language, for example. Are there statistics  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC449"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column GC449</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to show what proportion of cases of abused children comes from minority communities? Is there ongoing training for working within those communities where reporting may not be, for whatever reasons, even harder than within the wider population? I ask only because a number of incidents have been brought to my attention.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000033"></a>This is an area of life where we all want improved outcomes for all our citizens. We know that those who have a poor start are disadvantaged educationally. Through low self-esteem, they find low-end employment, if any, and they are more likely to be the victims of drugs, alcohol and crime. I say &#147;victims&#148; because that is what they are. They fall into a failed-life outcome because we as a society have failed to provide the support that those children need. We then, sadly and wrongly, place the blame at the door of social workers.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000034"></a>I say to the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, that I know the difficulties that social workers face. They are there to provide care. I understand why in his eloquent opening speech he asked the Government to get to grips with the weaknesses within the system. It is the system that fails the children, not the social workers.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000035"></a>As always, I shall listen carefully to the Minister&#146;s response to this important debate. I know that she shares our concerns.</p>

I think that we are all hungry to have a full and comprehensive discussion about all the issues of concern that noble Lords have raised. As ever, the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, has facilitated our discussion, for which I am grateful to him. I noted his comments on behalf of his noble and learned friend Lady Butler-Sloss, who called in and listened to some of the speeches.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000037"></a>What we really want to talk about is the transformation of the social work profession, to which we will return. So much work is being done around the country, led, as the noble Earl pointed out, by the extremely able chair of our Social Work Task Force, Moira Gibb. There is great experience around the country to draw on, such as in Hackney, where innovative practices are being developed.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000038"></a>Noble Lords have touched on a real concern about the public standing of social workers and the impact that the media coverage of the tragic death of Baby Peter has had. We are extremely concerned to support the profession.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000039"></a>I am delighted to be able to use this opportunity to say how highly the Government value the contribution made by social workers. We recognise their unique contribution and we want to do what we can to support and develop the profession. One way in which we are going about that is to develop, for example, a marketing campaign which will help to improve the public understanding of social work. That has to wait a little until we have heard more from the Social Work Task Force. We are working at laying the foundations of that campaign and we are ready to get started as soon as the situation is right.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000040"></a>I was very interested in the idea suggested by the noble Earl about how we can facilitate a greater engagement between parliamentarians and the social work profession. I shall certainly think about that, as it has cropped up a couple of times. Analogies with other professions can be well made.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000041"></a>I note the extreme challenges faced by the profession, which have been highlighted by noble Lords today, and the difficulty of continuing to do a great job in the face of what is sometimes very challenging media coverage. I agree that we should do everything that we can to support social workers and to ensure that they feel valued for what they do. For example, in advance of hearing from the Social Work Task Force, we have introduced the newly qualified social worker programme, which is about supporting all new social workers. That is being rolled out in September to all social workers in public and voluntary sector settings and it will ensure that newly qualified social workers have the support and the time after gaining their degree qualification to develop into fully confident professionals.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000042"></a>Noble Lords will be aware of how concerned we are about vacancies and the turnover of social workers. That varies around the country, but it is too high and it is a big challenge to provide the quality of service which we know the profession wants to deliver. We have asked the Social Work Task Force to look at this and to give us its recommendation about how workforce planning could be developed. In the mean time, we are sponsoring graduates to undertake social worker training and we are encouraging them to turn to a social work scheme. We are also looking at developing a significantly ambitious marketing campaign. As the noble Baroness, Lady Garden, pointed out, the degree in social work has resulted in an increase in the number of social workers coming forward to work for a degree, which is very welcome. The bursary has also helped.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000043"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, talked about the challenge to get the balance of record keeping, administration and front-line service right. We have been very clear. We invited the Social Work Task Force to give us recommendations on, for example, how we should develop the integrated children&#146;s IT system which has been mentioned in the media. We have been delighted to accept recommendations on how the system should be developed and simplified for local authorities to implement locally. We look forward to receiving further recommendations from the task force on further barriers to effective front-line social work practice. I know there will be many. Like many, I am committed to doing what we can to develop and transform the social work profession in the light of our experience working with the teaching profession. The noble Earl has been very clear on a number of occasions about the benefits of drawing from the teaching experience. We are doing just that.</p>

<p><a name="090623113000044"></a>I am slightly conscious of time, so I want to move on and talk about some of the points that we were aiming to make with regard to, for example, residential care. I want to use this opportunity to emphasise the important role that residential care plays in the lives of many children, as my noble friend Lord Judd emphasised. Although most children will benefit from living in a family setting, residential care is the right choice for

The Government&#146;s <I>Care Matters</I> White Paper set out our agenda to give all looked-after children a better start in life and is well established as a comprehensive and thorough programme following on from the Children and Young Persons Act, which noble Lords were very involved with. The key to achieving that is high-quality provision but, at the same time, we must make sure that children are placed in the most appropriate placement for them. That is why the work we do to develop the social work profession is so important, because of the judgments that must be made.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000045"></a>At the heart of our policy and of our thinking are the child and young person. That is why the <I>Care Matters</I> White Paper highlights the importance of basing every placement decision on a proper assessment of the individual child&#146;s needs and why empowered professionals are so important. The care plan for each looked-after child must be based on those needs, setting out clearly agreed objectives for each individual child and timescales for achieving them. Those judgments are made by professionals. In addition, the <I>Care Matters</I> White Paper also committed us to revising the existing statutory guidance&#151;this picks up a lot of the concerns of the noble Baroness, Lady Garden&#151;putting on a statutory footing the requirements for delivering best practice through guidance for health bodies as well as for local authorities. Ensuring that high-quality provision is delivered through advice and guidance is key.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000046"></a>I am pleased that this debate gives me the opportunity to highlight some specific actions that the Government are taking to improve the quality of care for looked-after children, especially those with particular mental health problems. As I have mentioned, we are producing statutory guidance that will raise expectations about how local authorities and primary care trusts should improve access to CAMHS services for looked-after children.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000047"></a>We are committed to developing innovative approaches to meeting the needs of children and young people with the most complex needs. This includes children and young people on the cusp of care, whom noble Lords have been interested in, and those who are looked after. An example of best practice that we are looking at is piloting the multisystemic therapy

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000048"></a>We are supporting a multidimensional treatment foster care programme to develop interventions for looked-after children and young people with the most complex needs and challenging behaviour. These are tightly controlled and carefully evaluated programmes, and are starting to show what I consider to be some positive results&#151;which is more than I can say for the Minister&#146;s time allocation.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000049"></a>I know that I will have to wind up in a minute. I will have to write a letter. I wanted to talk a lot about the Children&#146;s Workforce Development Council and how we are reviewing the national minimum standards for residential care, which is so important. I also wanted to talk about how important Ofsted&#146;s role is in driving up standards, and more about how to ensure that the children&#146;s workforce is knitted together through a common language, common approaches to information sharing and common professionalism, working to deliver the best possible outcomes for children and young people.</p>

<a name="90623-gc0006.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="090623113000050"></a>There are so many examples of best practice around the country that it would be unfair to draw on a few, although I was particularly interested in the remodelling social work practice that Hackney has been leading on. So I fear that I will end up having to write to Members of the Committee to answer some of their specific questions.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="09062389000069"></a>Armed Forces: Armoured Fighting Vehicles</h2>
<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="09062389000003"></a><b><a name="90623-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09062389000063"></a></b><b>The Minister for International Defence and Security (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Quentin Davies) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90623-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09062389000004"></a>The provision of armoured fighting vehicles to our forces has attracted considerable interest among honourable Members and the British public.  I am today announcing the MoD&#146;s new armoured fighting vehicles sector strategy and how it links to the defence industrial strategy.</p>

<a name="90623-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="09062389000005"></a>The defence industrial strategy set out the Government&#146;s approach to the delivery of the capabilities required by our Armed Forces now and in the future, recognising the important contribution that the  defence industry makes.  Building on the principles of the DIS, the new AVF sector strategy lays out further guiding principles which will shape MoD&#146;s relationship with industry, setting the context for individual project decisions and contributing to a coherent sector programme.</p>

<a name="90623-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="09062389000006"></a>In our strategy, we have changed the emphasis on how we meet our operational sovereignty<b></b>requirements, making clear that it is not necessary to retain industrial capabilities in the UK in order to achieve appropriate operational sovereignty.  We plan to make greater use of the global market, particularly within the EU and NATO, so long as we have assured access to the appropriate capabilities and expertise to design, modify, maintain, repair, overhaul, assemble, integrate and test our armoured fighting vehicles.  Of course our critical requirement for affordability and value for money will remain.  We continue to have a requirement to manufacture certain UK-specific critical sub-systems on-shore and we will retain onshore the ability to maintain, repair and overhaul our vehicles, making use of the Defence Support Group.  However where bids we receive offer comparable value for money, I will always take into account employment and industrial considerations in this country. </p>

<a name="90623-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09062389000007"></a>Contrary to our present position which normally involves manufactures or lead contractors retaining the exclusive right to the use of the design information of platforms or systems we acquire, we will in future in principle wish to acquire at the outset rights over design information, as well as assured access to relevant design knowledge, sufficient to allow third party modification of designs where appropriate, and to permit routine maintenance repair and overhaul activities.</p>

<a name="90623-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="09062389000008"></a>Our strategy will generally be to procure base vehicles which can provide a suitable platform for the systems we require and which allow for modification and enhancement in the light of future developments in technology and future operational requirements.  This  


<notus-date day="23" month="6" year="2009" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS106"></a><b>23 Jun 2009 : Column WS106</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>strategy will cover the whole of our AFV fleet, both legacy and future.  As an intelligent customer, we need to be able to define technical standards and architectures and make intelligent decisions about using the right technologies and integrating them using best systems engineering practice.  Where we do not have these in-house, we will need to source independent advice from elsewhere.</p>

<a name="90623-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="09062389000009"></a>We owe a great debt to the men and women of the Armed Forces who operate in hostile environments, risking their lives to secure freedom and to ensure that international terrorism, which threatens us all, is not allowed to take hold.  We must ensure that they receive the very best support and the very best equipment for the roles they are undertaking.  In this Statement today, I have outlined a new strategy, one which will enable us to make the best procurement decisions in support of our Armed Forces.  I believe that once the strategy is fully implemented it will ensure that we give our Armed Forces the armoured fighting vehicles they need and deserve to do their jobs as safely and effectively as modern technology can provide at best value for money for the UK taxpayer.</p>

<a name="90623-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="09062389000013"></a>In my oral Statement to the House on 18 June I warned that the threat to the UK posed by floods, heat waves and coastal erosion presents a great challenge which we need to plan for. According to the UK climate change projections, the UK faces warmer, wetter winters and hotter, drier summers, with more drought, heat-waves, flooding and sea-level rise. The results illustrate how important it is for the country to plan for the impacts of climate change. The projections underline that cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to limit future climate change is essential for the UK&#151;as for the rest of the world.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="09062389000014"></a>In response to this, experts have been appointed to the Adaptation Sub-Committee to the Committee on Climate Change, which has been established under the Climate Change Act 2008 to advise government on

<a name="90623-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="09062389000017"></a>With permission Mr Speaker, I wish to update the House on the issue of parliamentary standards. But first, I would like to offer you congratulations on your election yesterday. I look forward to working with you to address the issues of concern to members of the public and to members of this House of Commons.</p>

<a name="90623-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="09062389000018"></a>The public want to be able to have full confidence in the parliamentary system.</p>

<a name="90623-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="09062389000020"></a>As you said yesterday, Mr Speaker, I strongly believe that the overwhelming majority of Members of Parliament are decent people who work hard to serve the public interest, not to serve their own self-interest. But that is not the impression that the public have and so we are taking action.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="09062389000022"></a>And it is those actions which are under way which I want to set out to the House today. They are:</p>
the changes to our allowances that we have already made;the publication last week of our past four years&#146; allowances;the publication of our 2008-09 allowances; and thena revised Code of Conduct for Members&#151;updated by the Standards and Privileges Committee and published today;the introduction later this afternoon of the Parliamentary Standards Bill;the proposal to be debated this Thursday for a new committee of the House&#151;chaired by the honourable Member for Cannock Chase&#151;to strengthen the role of Parliament;a new registration system starting on 1 July for full transparency on Members&#146; second jobs;the work of Sir Thomas Legg leading a team to establish what might need to be paid back from claims over the past four years;

<a name="90623-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="09062389000024"></a>First, changes have already made to our allowances system. Since 19 May this year and arising out of the meeting between the then Speaker and the party leaders, there can now be:</p>
 no claiming for furniture;no changing the designation of main home;a cap of &#163;1,250 on monthly rent or mortgage payments;every claim must be backed up by a receipt; andMPs who are couples can only claim for one second home.

<a name="90623-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="09062389000026"></a>Last Thursday, every claim and payment to all Members over the past four years was published by the House Authorities on the House of Commons website.</p>

<a name="90623-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="09062389000027"></a>Of course we must protect Members&#146; security but I can tell the House that for the publication of the 2008-09 receipts this autumn, the question of redaction will be looked at again, considering the advice of the Information Commissioner.</p>

<a name="90623-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="09062389000029"></a>Work has begun by Sir Thomas Legg who has been contracted by the House Authorities to lead a reassessment of all claims over the past four years and having reconsidered each claim and the evidence submitted to support it, to report whether it was within the rules as they obtained at the time with a view to ensuring that where there has been overpayment then it must be paid back.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="09062389000030"></a>The public expect that overclaims will be paid back&#151;and that will happen, together with any necessary disciplinary action.</p>

They are taking evidence and will complete their work in the autumn.</p>

<a name="90623-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="09062389000033"></a>I have already given oral evidence to the Committee and set out the principles which I believe the House would want to underpin a new allowance system, namely</p>
that it should be simple;transparent;that it should reduce the cost to the taxpayer;that second home arrangements should be consistent as between the allowances system and the tax system;that it should sustain the all-important constituency link;and it should sustain our ability to work effectively on behalf of our constituents;

<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="09062389000034"></a><I>Publication of Parliamentary Standards Bill</I></p>

<a name="90623-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="09062389000035"></a>This afternoon will see the publication of the Parliamentary Standards Bill which will establish a new and wholly independent authority to take over the role of the Fees Office in authorising Members&#146; claims, overseeing a new allowance system, following proposals from the Committee on Standards in Public Life, and maintain the Register of Members&#146; Interests.</p>

<a name="90623-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="09062389000036"></a>I can assure the House that although there will be a new independent authority for allowances, we will work closely and sympathetically with the House authorities on the future for the staff currently working in the Department of Resources.</p>

<a name="90623-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="09062389000037"></a>The Bill will create new criminal offences for</p>
 knowingly making a false claim for an allowance;failing without reasonable excuse to register a relevant interest; andcontravening without reasonable excuse the rules on paid advocacy.
<a name="90623-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="09062389000038"></a>This will put MPs on the same footing as we have&#151;in legislation&#151;put local councillors and Members of the Scottish Parliament.</p>

<a name="90623-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="09062389000039"></a>I shall set out in my business Statement the date for second Reading of the Bill but the House should know that we intend that its committee stage as well as Report and Third Reading will be taken on the Floor of the House and we hope that there is sufficient consensus&#151;following the consultation which has been led by my right honourable friend the Justice Secretary&#151;for it to reach Royal Assent by the time the House rises for the Summer Recess so that it can be ready to start work with the Kelly Committee&#146;s recommendations by the end of the year.</p>

<a name="90623-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="09062389000040"></a>The Justice Secretary and I are grateful for the constructive cross-party discussions that preceded the Bill&#146;s introduction. A number of those on the cross-party group, including the Government, are prepared to go further. This Bill is the first stage of legislation and covers the specific but important and urgent task of setting up an independent authority to run our expenses system.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="09062389000041"></a>There is likely to be further legislation should there be a consensus for further action.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="09062389000053"></a>Following the publication of the 18th report Part 1 of the School Teachers&#146; Review Body (STRB) (Cm 7546) on 31 March 2009, to which I responded in a Statement of that date, I have today written to consultees with the outcomes of my consultation on the report and my response. Copies of the letter are available in the Vote Office, the Printed Paper Office, the Libraries of the House, and at <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/pay">www.teachernet.gov.uk/pay</a>.</p>

In this regard I am making one change to the recommended approach. I want to ensure that there are appropriate incentives for heads becoming responsible for the very largest federations of schools. I am not, therefore, accepting the STRB recommendation that there should be a cap of 20 per cent on the salary increase that is available to heads who take on permanent responsibility for running a number of schools.</p>

<a name="90623-wms0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="09062389000055"></a>To recognise the greater responsibility associated with running a number of schools, I will be encouraging governing bodies to make responsible use of the flexibilities that they already have to determine an appropriate level of pay for these heads in a way that is not constrained by the maximum of the leadership pay range but is appropriate, fair and transparent. These are interim arrangements while the STRB looks in greater depth in the coming year at new pay arrangements for school leaders that will recognise and reward the vital contribution that they will make to the delivery of our vision of the 21st century school.</p>

My  right honourable friend the Secretary of State for  International Development (Douglas Alexander) also met Mr Tsvangirai and set out how that pledge will include support for improvements to Zimbabwe&#146;s water and sanitation infrastructure to reduce the likelihood of further cholera outbreaks, as well as resources to help work to tackle HIV and rebuild the health sector, livelihood support and food aid.</p>

<a name="90623-wms0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a><a name="09062389000060"></a>We want the inclusive Government to succeed, and to help them meet their commitments to reform outlined in the global political agreement. As my right honourable friend the Prime Minister made clear, we are prepared to provide further support to help rebuild Zimbabwe should there be further progress by the Zimbabwean Government in meeting their commitments to deliver political and economic reform. The Zimbabwean Government have made some progress in delivering reform, notably on the economic front, but much more needs to be done to deliver improved services and security to ordinary people. This includes work to implement IMF recommendations and reform the Central Bank; to reform the constitution as a prelude to new elections; to promote respect for human rights, freedom of the media and the repeal of repressive legislation; and to stop land seizures.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a><a name="09062389000061"></a>The southern African region has a key role to play in supporting reform in Zimbabwe. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister signalled yesterday our wish to work closely with South Africa, and I look forward to working with the new South African administration. My noble friend Lord Malloch-Brown is in regular touch with Ministers from the Southern African Development Community, a number of whom he met this month in Cape Town.</p>
