<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Higgins </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What progress is being made in preventing the export of live horses for slaughter.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  My Lords, following the failure to agree new rules for live animal transport at the Agriculture Council on 26 April, the UK will continue to operate its existing legislation, including the minimum-value rules, although, as is well known by horse welfare organisations, those rules do not actually ban the export of horses for slaughter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for bringing us up to date on these matters. Of course, it is disappointing that it has not been possible so far to continue the minimum-value legislation, which is surely the best way of ensuring the prevention of the provision of live horses for slaughter. What objections are being made in the course of the negotiations with regard to the continuation of the minimum-value legislation? Does he agree that, although the improved conditions for the transportation of animals should be welcomed, horses are a special case and are unlikely to be looked after as well as they should be if their owners know that the horses will be slaughtered at the end of their journey?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the negotiations were on animal welfare and transportation legislation generally rather than on horses. The negotiations did not break down on the issue of horses, but related to hours of transportation, space, stalls and other issues on which there was no consensus in the Agriculture Council. The minimum-value regulations are British, not European, but they could have been modified by the provisions, which would have brought great animal welfare benefits.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister take note of the plight of Welsh mountain ponies, which are quite used to the weather that is beating on the roof here at the moment? They are declining because they are of very little value off the hill. One of the problems is the cost of horse passports, which is often more than the value of the pony. The ponies are sold at markets. Unscrupulous dealers buy and export them, and they are slaughtered on the Continent. Many of us feel that that is totally unacceptable. Not only that, these ponies do not qualify for single farm <P>


<a name="column_982"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 982</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>payments. Will his department do something about the cost of these passports or even abolish them, or ensure that these ponies qualify for single farm payments?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I am glad that as I stood up the Welsh weather declined. The noble Lord has brought his weather with him. The passport system for Welsh mountain ponies is a matter for the devolved administration. Within England, we have made special provision with regard to passports for those responsible for Dartmoor and New Forest ponies. I suspect that the Welsh authorities will look at that. Again, the administration of single farm payments in Wales is not a matter for me.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that there is not much point in us being goody-goodies when the rest of Europe is exporting its horses under extremely cruel conditions, together with an export market of horses for the meat trade in South America? Does he agree that we need a uniform effort on behalf of all the nations involved in this disgusting trade to get together and have one law for everybody?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, certainly, as far as Europe is concerned, that was our intention and that of the Commission when we proposed these regulations. It is greatly to our regret that the Agriculture Council failed to agree the legislation, which would have improved the welfare conditions of horses and other animals throughout Europe.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Trumpington, rightly referred to "this disgusting trade". Does the Minister agree that it is equally disgusting whether it involves the export of live horses or any other mature animal? The objection is to the cruelty inflicted on animals of any kind if they are transported in this way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Yes, my Lords. There are two different aspects to consider. The first is welfare at the point of slaughter. When animals, including horses, are slaughtered within the UK, we try to enforce the very best welfare standards, which is not always the case if they are exported. There is also the manner of transportation, on which we were trying to tighten legislation for all animals in the discussions that failed last week.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-01_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for confirming that the derogation has been allowed to continue. Will he tell the House exactly where the negotiations broke down? In the light of the breakdown, will more stringent rules on policing the transport of animals within the European Union be put into place?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, because of the Agriculture Council's failure to agree the provisions, neither the tighter rules nor their enforcement will be put into place. The issues on which there was disagreement included maximum transportation hours, the space <P>


<a name="column_983"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 983</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>assigned to animals, and, of particular relevance to horses, the detailed regulations on stalls. So a number of items could not be accepted by some member states and the negotiations broke down.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Tordoff: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Lord tell us which member states those were?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Broadly speaking, my Lords, the further south you go, the more likely they are to object. Of course, that will be complicated after last weekend&#151;probably, the further east you go, the more likely they are to object as well.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-01_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Strange: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that even the heavens are crying because of the fate of the poor horses?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, previously I blamed the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, for bringing his weather with him, but maybe it was an intervention by the Almighty. Certainly, a lot of cruelty is involved in the horse trade across Europe. However, that applies also to other animals. It has to be recognised that the UK does permit the slaughter of horses for human consumption and there is an industry here. The important point is that the welfare provisions are of the best at the point of slaughter and the point of transportation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-01_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper. In doing so, I declare an interest. This is an issue that has arisen very sharply in Camden, where I am a resident although not a council tenant.
<P>

<a name="40504-01_para0"></a>The Question was as follows:
<P>

<a name="40504-01_para1"></a>To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they are refusing extra money for refurbishment of council homes in cases where tenants have voted against transferring housing management to an arm's length management organisation; and whether they object to direct council management.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister   (Lord Rooker): </B>  My Lords, the funding available for social housing, although greatly increased under this Government, is inevitably limited. We must therefore use it in ways that will most improve the lives of tenants. The Government have repeatedly made it clear that they will provide additional funding only to councils that separate their landlord and strategic functions. We believe that this provides a strong incentive to better performance, ensures a sharper focus on the two distinct housing functions, and guarantees tenants a greater role in the future management of their homes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-01_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that response, which I find rather disappointing. How is his statement to be reconciled <P>


<a name="column_984"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 984</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with the Government's desire to ensure wider choice in the provision of public services? After all, this is a case in which the tenants themselves have voted and have therefore expressed a choice. For that choice they are apparently to be penalised.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, it could be argued that they had a vote. We have made it clear that there are three options: local voluntary stock transfer, private finance initiative, and an arm's length management organisation. Under the latter two, the homes remain in the ownership of the council. We have also made it clear that we will make additional funding available only under those three options. There is no fourth way. Camden and every other council have been told that. Camden made its decision in the light of that information. The money is limited and we are directing the extra funds to one of the three options, for the reasons that I gave in my original Answer. Just in case anyone thinks that no money has gone into the decent homes standard in recent years, I should point out that, since 1997, no less than £18 billion has been spent on the decent homes standard covering the social sector.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040504/text/40504-02.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Maddock: </B>   My Lords, I listened with interest to the Minister's Answer, but he has not really answered the Question. When local tenants choose to stay with their local council, what is the justification for penalising them? Of the local councils that have voted to stay or have not had a vote, how many have been inspected and found to be bad in their housing management?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, you cannot rig the ballot. When the ballots take place, it is known that one of the three options will bring in extra resources. If any or all of those options are voted down, the extra resources will not be available. That does not mean that nothing will happen; as I said, money has gone in. Indeed, about 100 authorities can meet the decent homes standard without selecting any of the three options. The fact is that tenants sometimes choose to stay with the council on the basis of false evidence from campaigners. Ministers are not allowed to campaign in favour of a "yes" vote because of ludicrous legal arrangements and straitjackets, and that applies even to policy enunciated and agreed by the Government.
<P>

<a name="40504-02_para0"></a>The fact is that the consequence is known: there is no fourth way to extra money. That message has not quite got across. As I understand it, however, Camden has now accepted that that is the case. It is looking at another options appraisal and has started work on the process.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, as the former chairman of a housing committee and leader of a first-class local authority, I ask whether the noble Lord is aware that many people cannot understand why there has been a change in status. Good local authorities have always been able to manage their housing and their housing policy without any privatisation or assistance from outside bodies. If they had been granted sufficient resources by all governments to do <P>


<a name="column_985"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 985</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>exactly that, they would be providing, and able to provide, a much better service than the present split-personality service.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   Look, my Lords, for years some local councils have operated on the basis, "Vote for us and we will keep your rents down". However, they never say that the consequence is that there will be no repairs and no modernisation. It is a con. We are doing it differently. As I said, £18 billion has gone into social housing since 1997.
<P>

<a name="40504-02_para1"></a>I give my noble friend one example. He is a noble Lord; he was my noble friend. He still is my noble friend; I am not arguing that point. I give my noble friend one example of how the separation of landlord and strategic functions works. Today we announced the reaching of the target that was set two years ago to get all families with children out of bed-and-breakfast accommodation. Two years ago 4,000 families with 6,000 children were in bed-and-breakfast accommodation. That has been a highly targeted, highly managed process. It has been achieved with input from the public sector, the private sector and registered social landlords. Not all those families have gone into council housing. The point is that councils which have achieved that success rate of 99.3 per cent have dealt with their major strategic housing function of making sure that people are decently housed, not necessarily operating their narrow landlord function when some of them, of course, could not even collect their rents.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware of the recent result in Waltham Forest council? Does that result not rather challenge his assertion that housing services are inevitably better managed by an arm's length operation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My Lords, I regret to say that I do not know the details of Waltham Forest. All I can say is that there has been success on this matter across the country. The largest stock transfer took place in Sunderland where 37,000 dwellings were successfully transferred. New organisations have been built up based on housing that are creating jobs and training enterprises going beyond the normal narrow range of the landlord function.

<UL>Whether they will lay a duty on other departments entering future public spending rounds to consider the implications of their decisions for the Department for Work and Pensions.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport   (Lord McIntosh of Haringey): </B>  My Lords, in past spending rounds, and in the current one, the Treasury expects government departments to consider <P>


<a name="column_986"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 986</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the implications of their spending and delivery proposals for all other government departments, including the Department for Work and Pensions.
<P>

<a name="40504-02_para2"></a>The 2004 spending review guidance sets out the requirement for departments to discuss proposals with financial implications for other departments with the department in question and secure its agreement before including such proposals in their submission.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-02_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that Answer. He has indicated that the issue is not a dead letter, but is it a very live letter? When a large regional employer is closed, or when a decision is taken depriving old people of their weekly walk to the post office at a time when we are more concerned with the financial implications of fitness, the Government are passing to the Department of Social Security or the Department for Work and Pensions a cost that it cannot avoid. Should not that be considered always and carefully before the decision is taken?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that I do not need to introduce the noble Earl, Lord Russell, of all people to the delights of DEL and AME. DEL stands for departmental expenditure limits and AME stands for annual managed expenditure, and is that part of expenditure which is demand led. The expenditure about which we are talking here is demand led. If additional expenditure is incurred by the Department for Work and Pensions as a result of decisions by other departments, that expenditure will be met. That is not to say that I condone any particular examples to which the noble Earl, Lord Russell, may refer of which I have no notice and of which I have no particular knowledge.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, so far as demand-led expenditure is concerned, there is an obvious knock-on effect between activities of the Department of Health and of the Department for Work and Pensions. Is the Minister aware that Norwich Union Healthcare's ongoing survey has estimated that 9 million of the annual 22 million sick notes are suspect? Its survey of 255 GPs also found that those GPs believed that at least a third of sick notes are invalid. Surely this has a knock-on effect on sickness benefit which, of course, calls into question at the very least the Government's statistic on the number of employed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, as I have no notice of that question, I have no basis on which to challenge the figures that the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, puts forward, although they indeed sound extremely suspect to me. However, I repeat that if, as a result of the policies of any other government department, additional burden is put upon the Department for Work and Pensions, that expenditure is protected because it is annually managed expenditure and it is demand led. I very much doubt the figures that the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, offers to the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, why has my noble friend accepted the premise of the Question of the noble Earl, Lord Russell, which is that one department's activities place a burden on another? Surely it frequently happens, not least <P>


<a name="column_987"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 987</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>as regards the Treasury, that good economic policies actually lower the burdens on other departments. For example, the great increase in employment and decrease in unemployment has made life very much easier rather than harder for the Department for Work and Pensions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Indeed, my Lords. That is why the expenditure on unemployment benefit in particular is so much less under this Government than it was under previous governments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-02_spnew12"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I wonder whether the Minister could ask the noble Lord, Lord Peston, to read more carefully the implications of the Question. It refers to the "implications of their decisions". That was intended for good or ill. It is more often for ill, but I do not think that anyone disputes what the noble Lord says; namely, that implications can be good. I just think that people ought to know.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I suppose that I have to be grateful for that although the supplementary question of the noble Earl, Lord Russell, certainly went in the opposite direction.

Will the noble Lord also say whether in this transfer the Government will make it a condition that the successor company implements the 29 recommendations made by Stephen Shaw in his inquiry into racism and other matters at Yarl's Wood, and that the recommendations of that report and of the Chief Inspector of Prisons are applied not only in Yarl's Wood but throughout the detention estate?

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, as I explained at the outset, the Home Secretary is currently considering the request for consent regarding Global Solutions. No final decision has been made on that, although my understanding is that a decision will be made shortly. As regards Stephen Shaw's very excellent investigation and report into allegations of racism and abuse at Yarl's Wood, given the importance of those recommendations I have no doubt that they will be studied very closely and that the important and salient conclusions which Stephen Shaw reached will find their way into improving the quality of practice across the detention centre and prison estate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-03_spnew2"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Worcester: </B>   My Lords, I wonder whether the Minister can help us by telling us what are the criteria that operate in the mind of the Home Secretary when deciding whether to grant permission for a change of ownership or not. In particular, does he bear in mind the need to sustain patterns of regime and delivery of crime reduction objectives, or is it simply a financial consideration of viability that is in his mind?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, the Home Secretary will have to pay very careful regard to the financial standing of the company and the way in which it responds to change in the marketplace. For that reason the Home Secretary takes very careful account of legal and financial advice that is given. Of course, the Home Secretary will have regard to other matters as it is very important that contracts which specify particular issues of importance in terms of policy are understood by the operating company and those who own the contract.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-03_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister clarify slightly his response to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, with regard to last week's report on Yarl's Wood, which is run by GSL? No doubt the Minister has, like me, read the report. The earlier remarks appeared to imply that the charges of racism had been proved correct. So far as I understand it, the initial allegations were not found to be proved by the ombudsman, and the recommendations involve additional training in race relations and cultural awareness but do not as such find an allegation of racism proved against those running the facility.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for her question. She is right to focus on the particular, because that is exactly what Stephen Shaw, the ombudsman, did. It is important that he specifically did not find that there was a general culture of racism, abuse or violence, an allegation that has been made on a number of occasions. That is not to say that the events recorded by the Daily Mirror were not deeply shocking. I am satisfied, as I am sure other noble Lords are, that those involved in the incidents no longer work in the Prison Service. One <P>


<a name="column_989"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>of them resigned and the other was sacked. I hope that that draws a line under the matter. All the recommendations made by Stephen Shaw have been accepted, and it is the Home Secretary's intention to put an action plan in place to ensure that they are very carefully followed through.

<P>
<A NAME="40504-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts: </B>   My Lords, in the light of the Minister's assurance that government consent has to be given for change of ownership, did the Government consent to Capita subcontracting part of its work on the Criminal Records Bureau to Hays PLC in India?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, that is extremely wide of the Question, and I am afraid that I am not in a position to answer it this afternoon.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-03_spnew8"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   My Lords, can the Home Secretary insist on a change of terms of the contract when a sale or transfer takes place?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, my understanding is that when it is the desire of the contractor to change ownership, the Home Secretary has to take all such points carefully into consideration. As a consequence of a change of the holding of the contract, there may well be some changes, but I suspect that those would be carefully negotiated and the subject of very careful advice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-03_spnew10"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   My Lords, the changes have to be carefully considered by the Home Secretary, but does he have the power to alter a contract on a transfer?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, we should deal with matters that relate to the detail of contracts carefully. I am happy to provide the detail that the noble Earl requires in writing, because that is a better way of dealing with it. He will get more precision from me. I believe in giving noble Lords the best, most truthful and most direct answer.

<FONT SIZE=3>specialists were among those crew members left ashore for medical assessment were also untrue; none of those personnel can be described as safety experts.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Methuen: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. However, can he confirm: that the ship sailed with more than 250 defects; that the nose cone, which had to be replaced after the ship was grounded, was not replaced correctly; and that the radiation limits in the reactor compartment exceeded those permissible?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, I am afraid that I cannot confirm what the noble Lord says. However, I insist that no Royal Navy ship or submarine would sail after a maintenance period without satisfactory completion of rigorous safety checks, a process that is always fully documented. Of course it is not unexpected for there to be minor defects following a period of maintenance. It is the purpose of the testing and training phase to ensure that all the equipment is functioning correctly, but I cannot agree with the noble Lord that there were that number of defects or that they were of the kind to which he referred.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that HMS "Trafalgar" has been in Portsmouth Harbour for nearly 200 years, and is a magnificent memorial of a great victory and a fine museum? Why should it be exposed to the peril of going to sea when there is no need for that to happen?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-03_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, I am afraid that I was not aware of the ship that the noble Lord mentioned, with its distinguished history. For the moment, I do not see its relevance to the Question.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-03_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever: </B>   My Lords, following the Minister's point about minor defects, can he confirm that the crew members were specifically concerned about the safety of the nuclear reactor and the safety-hatch covers?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-03_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   No, my Lords, I cannot confirm that. The 12 of the crew who went to see the commanding officer were concerned about a number of issues. He thought that, in most cases, they could be suffering from some sort of stress and wanted them properly medically examined. One of the 12 stayed on board. The rest were medically examined, and five are now back on board, four have been medically downgraded for a month, and the remaining two are under investigation for disobedience to orders. However, they are not under investigation for mutiny.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-03_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Redesdale: </B>   My Lords, the Minister does not seem to be answering many questions about some of the problems with the submarine "Trafalgar"&#151;I do not believe that HMS "Victory" had a nuclear reactor on board&#151;so will he say whether there was a problem with one of the control rods in the nuclear reactor? <P>


<a name="column_991"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 991</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>How minor was that? It has caused a great deal of concern. Are the numerous faults that my noble friend highlighted so minor? Last week, three crew members were treated after diesel fumes entered the sub's ventilation system during an exercise at Devonport. Also, breathing masks had to be worn when Freon, a refrigeration gas, escaped in another incident.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-03_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, there was a minor problem with the single control rod. That is a minor defect, and the design authority that originally designed the reactor plant&#151;Rolls-Royce, which I am sure that the House agrees is a fairly respectable UK company&#151;agreed that the submarine was safe to sail. That decision has been agreed by the Ministry of Defence experts and, to put the cherry on the cake, independently assessed by the MoD's independent nuclear auditors. No country in the world takes more care to make sure that, when its ships sail, they sail safely.

<a name="40504-04_para9"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 47A, 50A and 52 to 59.
<P>

<a name="40504-04_para10"></a>I am grateful to Members opposite for agreeing broadly to the procedure whereby I should move my amendments, which, in effect, put forward the structure in relation to the replacement of the existing judicial review ouster. Noble Lords have indicated that they do not intend to move their amendments so that there is a proper opportunity to consider my amendments, which is sensible.
<P>

<a name="40504-04_para11"></a>Clause 14 is the central part of the Bill and it has provoked considerable interest and discussion. Clause 14 will create a unified appellate structure for asylum and immigration appeals but, as I said at Second Reading, we need to ensure that we have proper and appropriate judicial oversight of the system so that it is independent, thorough and fair. I agreed at Second Reading that we did not have that correct just yet, but I made it clear that any new system of judicial oversight must also ensure an increase in speed and a reduction in abuse.
<P>

<a name="40504-04_para12"></a>For this reason I have brought forward these amendments to replace the judicial review ouster with a new system allowing oversight by the Administrative Court and Court of Appeal. Although I shall be referring to the Administrative Court and the Court of Appeal, I want to be clear that the arrangements for higher court oversight involve the higher and appellate courts in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="40504-04_para13"></a>The amendments have been brought forward in consultation with the Lord Chief Justice. He is not here for this debate, but he has sent me a letter about the amendments, from which he has kindly said that I can quote in the debate. A copy of the letter has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="40504-04_para14"></a>It may be helpful if I set out how we intend the new system to work. Amendment No. 46A replaces subsections (6) and (7) in Clause 14 with the new system of judicial oversight of tribunal decisions set out in new Sections 103A to 103E that will be inserted into the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.
<P>

<a name="40504-04_para15"></a>New Section 103A will allow a party to an appeal to the tribunal to apply to the High Court, for an order requiring the tribunal to reconsider its decision on appeal, on the grounds that the tribunal made an error of law. If the High Court judge thinks the tribunal made an error of law, the case will be sent back to the tribunal for reconsideration. We would expect cases to be sent back to the tribunal only if the judge thinks the error of law may have made a difference to the outcome of the case and we will ask the Civil Procedure Rules Committee to make this clear in the civil procedure rules.
<P>


<a name="column_996"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 996</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40504-04_para16"></a>The application must be made by an appellant within five working days from receipt of the tribunal determination, unless the appellant is appealing from abroad and then the application must be made in 28 days. If the Home Office decides to make an application, it must always lodge an application within five working days. An application will be determined by reference only to written submissions from the applicant. The decision of the High Court will be final. A person will not be able to use this review procedure to review procedural, ancillary or preliminary decisions. The review process is there to allow review of the substantive appeal determination made by the tribunal. Neither will a person be able to make more than one application to the High Court for a review. Where a case is remitted back for reconsideration, any further oversight of the tribunal's decision would be by way of appeal to the Court of Appeal.
<P>

<a name="40504-04_para17"></a>We expect this system to operate much more efficiently than at present so that appeals in future will take a maximum of around 15 weeks&#151;at present, although many appeals are decided quickly, those that go through every stage of the process can take a year or longer. In future, we anticipate it will take eight weeks from when the appeal is lodged until the appeal is promulgated by the tribunal. This is shorter than the time it takes for most appeals to be determined at the adjudicator stage at present and will be the result of concurrent working in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate and the tribunal&#151;and better case management in the tribunal so the eventual hearing is better focused on the key issues. These changes will allow cases to be listed and determined quicker than at present.
<P>

<a name="40504-04_para18"></a>We expect most appeals to be concluded after eight weeks, but for the minority of appellants who wish to challenge the tribunal decision, it may take a further seven weeks to have the review carried out and, if necessary, any reconsideration of the case by the tribunal. I should also add that during the transitional period, when the filter is operating, which I will explain later, another two weeks will be added to the later stages.
<P>

<a name="40504-04_para19"></a>New Section 103B provides that where an appeal to the tribunal has been reconsidered, a party to the appeal may bring a further appeal on a point of law to the Court of Appeal. They will not be able to seek a further review by the High Court. If they wish to dispute the decision, the only recourse is to appeal to the Court of Appeal. An appeal may be brought only with the permission of the tribunal or, if the tribunal refuses permission, the Court of Appeal.
<P>

<a name="40504-04_para20"></a>New Section 103C allows the High Court to refer a case straight to the Court of Appeal if the judge thinks the case raises a question of law of such importance that it should be decided by the Court of Appeal. This could be described as a "leapfrog" procedure, as in such cases they would leapfrog straight from the High Court to the Court of Appeal without a reconsideration in the tribunal.
<P>

<a name="40504-04_para21"></a>New Section 103D provides an enabling power to make regulations for a new legal aid scheme for both the High Court review process and reconsideration of <P>


<a name="column_997"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 997</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cases by the tribunal. We wish to take such an order-making power because we intend to make specific legal aid provision for those applying to the High Court for a review. The amendment provides for the order to be introduced by negative resolution, but I understand that earlier today the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee asked that we change this to affirmative resolution. I am willing to make this change and will bring forward an amendment at Report.
<P>

<a name="40504-04_para22"></a>I am concerned that the new system has been overwhelmed by too many weak applications being made. For example, in 2003 there were 32,000 decisions taken on applications for permission to appeal to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal. Just 12,000 were allowed to pursue the case to a further level&#151;not necessarily having the decision overturned. That means that 20,000 applications did not even have an arguable case and had no real prospect of success. We are therefore taking a new power in the Bill to introduce a new way of funding cases making a review application to the High Court and in any subsequent reconsideration proceedings. This will ensure that we are targeting the most meritorious cases. Instead of the Legal Services Commission taking the funding decision, we will provide the judiciary with the power to order that legal aid is paid in these proceedings.
<P>

<a name="40504-04_para23"></a>In his letter, the Lord Chief Justice said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I am sure the Government will consult fully before the regulations are made, but in principle I welcome legal aid arrangements which allow meritorious cases to proceed but discourage applications without merit overwhelming the High Court".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-04_para24"></a>
I share the concern of the Lord Chief Justice, and I believe that the power we are taking in this Bill will enable us to achieve this aim. I should make it clear that we are not changing the initial funding arrangements for the appeal before the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal. The new arrangements, which we will bring forward in regulations, will affect the review application and any reconsideration proceedings that follow the review.
<P>

<a name="40504-04_para25"></a>We are asking lawyers to share the risk with the taxpayer when deciding whether there is an arguable case against the tribunal determination and if it should be challenged. We believe that will lead to lawyers giving a more rigorous examination to the prospects of the case succeeding. Good lawyers will already be doing this, but we want to encourage this throughout the profession. It will enable us to focus ever more sharply on the deserving cases that merit legal aid funding. As your Lordships will understand, the legal aid budget is limited and we have to balance priorities carefully across jurisdictions.
<P>

<a name="40504-04_para26"></a>The regulations will set out the detail of the scheme and these will be the subject of full consultation. The scheme will form part of the legal aid scheme and payments would come from the legal aid fund. We are not removing these cases from the scope of legal aid, but are proposing a new approach to evaluating the merits of seeking review and reconsideration proceedings. One could say that we are asking the legal representative to share the risk of bringing a case. <P>


<a name="column_998"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 998</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>However, to help mitigate the risk they are taking, we will pay a success fee to those cases that are successful on reconsideration of the case.
<P>

<a name="40504-04_para27"></a>I would call the scheme "no win, no fee", but subject to exceptions. We envisage that a judge in the tribunal would order legal aid to be paid in circumstances where cases have been successful in reversing the earlier appeal decision, and cases that I characterise as "near misses". I think we all know what we are talking about when we speak of near misses, but we have to think carefully how this is captured in the regulations.
<P>

<a name="40504-04_para28"></a>We also anticipate that the High Court judge would be able to order legal aid to be paid if they consider there are exceptional circumstances for the review application and payment is required now&#151;for example, a case of real general importance to the system that they are forwarding to the Court of Appeal. As for cases that have been brought to defend an appeal decision after it has been successfully challenged at the review by the Home Office, the applicant for status shall receive funding.
<P>

<a name="40504-04_para29"></a>I am not taking this power as part of some anti-lawyer agenda. There are many good immigration lawyers, but a serious consequence of widespread bad practice is that specialist immigration lawyers are all tarred with the same brush. I wish to make it clear that I am wholly committed to keeping good lawyers within the legal aid scheme. There are a number of dedicated, highly skilled immigration solicitors and counsel. We recognise that these lawyers provide value for money to the Government and the taxpayer. They help us to process cases efficiently and to get the results right first time. They deal with difficult cases, often in difficult conditions. They enable us to be sure we fulfil our international obligations, and so perform a valuable public service. There are many good lawyers active in the Immigration Law Practitioners Association. ILPA works with my department, and with the Immigration Appeal Authority, in a way that benefits the appeals process as a whole. We are grateful for their hard work and contribution to the policy process.
<P>

<a name="40504-04_para30"></a>New Section 103E provides that, where an appeal decision has been made by the tribunal sitting as a panel of three or more members, a party to the appeal could bring a further appeal on a point of law with permission to the Court of Appeal. Such cases would not be subject to review in the High Court; instead, they could leapfrog the High Court and go straight from the tribunal to the Court of Appeal.
<P>

<a name="40504-04_para31"></a>If the tribunal sits as a panel with three or more members, this will usually mean the tribunal has identified the appeal as giving rise to a question of law of such general importance that it may result in a starred determination being promulgated by the tribunal. Such panels may include the president of the tribunal, who of course will be a High Court judge. In such circumstances, we think it right that the right of appeal should lie to the Court of Appeal, and it will ensure the Court of Appeal will receive the appeal more quickly than would otherwise be the case.
<P>

<a name="40504-04_para32"></a>Amendment No. 47A introduces new subsections (9) to (11) to Clause 14. These new subsections set out a new order-making power that can be exercised by the Lord <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Chancellor after consultation with the senior judiciary. That will allow the Lord Chancellor to vary the time limits on the face of the primary legislation for lodging review applications to the High Court or Court of Session, or vary the time limits for specific categories of cases or circumstances. This is a sensible measure to take so that we can extend or reduce the time limits, depending on how the process works in practice, or enable us to vary it for particular types of cases if circumstances require it&#151;for example, in relation to the fast-track cases, where the applicants are in detention.
<P>

<a name="40504-04_para33"></a>Amendments Nos. 50A and 52 to 59 make changes to Schedule 2, which provides for consequential amendments and transitional provision. In particular, I would like to draw the attention of noble Lords to Amendment No. 59. It introduces the transitional measure of a filter mechanism for cases applying for a review to the High Court. This is to ensure that we do not put more cases to the High Court than it is able to deal with. The filter mechanism will operate for a limited period, until cases likely to come before it are at a manageable level. Under the filter mechanism, if a party applies to the High Court for a review under Section 103A, his application will initially be reviewed by a senior member of the asylum and immigration tribunal, who will either make an order requiring the tribunal to reconsider its decision, or refer the application to a High Court judge with his reasons for not ordering the tribunal to reconsider its decision, and notify the applicant.
<P>

<a name="40504-04_para34"></a>For those unsuccessful review cases that are referred to the High Court, the appellant is required to write within five days to confirm they want the High Court to review the case as well, otherwise the application is considered to have lapsed. However, this opting in is not a further appeal right. There is only one review application under consideration. The appellant will not be able to introduce new grounds at that point.
<P>

<a name="40504-04_para35"></a>The transitional provision will apply for an indefinite period until an order is made by the Lord Chancellor to bring it to an end. The Lord Chancellor will consult the Lord Chief Justice&#151;and I will make a commitment to publish the Lord Chief Justice's advice&#151;before making the order. If an order is made, the Lord Chancellor will also have the power later to restore the filter provision by order, if circumstances require it to be put back in place.
<P>

<a name="40504-04_para36"></a>It is important that the appeals system is fair, but it must also provide speed and finality. A swift and final decision is in the interest of both genuine refugees and the British taxpayer, who should not have to fund those seeking to play the multiple tiers of appeal of judicial review and the costs that they incur.
<P>

<a name="40504-04_para37"></a>I apologise for the detail of these opening remarks, but I think it is helpful in the consideration of these amendments.

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1000</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Committee on Home Affairs, the Constitutional Affairs Committee, and Asylum International? All of those bodies have a major role to play.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   All of the points that they put in relation to the original Clause 14 were taken into account, and all of them had a significant part to play in the amendments we are now putting forward. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   We on these Benches give a qualified welcome to these new amendments. They are indeed a great improvement over the original version of Clause 14, which was highly objectionable and should never have been brought before Parliament. That does not mean that the new Clause 14 is perfect&#151;we have a number of queries, and some criticisms of it.
<P>

<a name="40504-05_para0"></a>Let me start with one point that is not in fact covered by the new amendment, as it is outside its scope, but it deserves to be. Under the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, neither adjudicators nor members of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal were required to be legally qualified. Section 81(2)(d) of the 2002 Act authorises the appointment of someone who,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"has legal or other experience which in the Lord Chancellor's opinion makes him suitable for appointment",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-05_para1"></a>
but under new Schedule 4 to the 2002 Act, which is set out in Schedule 1 to this Bill, all members of the asylum and immigration tribunal must have legal qualifications or experience, and I would like to know the reason for that change. 
<P>

<a name="40504-05_para2"></a>I turn to the new government amendments. In new Section 103A, what is meant by "error of law", and, therefore, what are going to be the grounds on which the tribunal can be asked to reconsider its earlier decision? Does "error of law" extend to all the grounds on which a decision might be quashed by judicial review, for example irrationality, or the absence of evidence to support a conclusion of fact? If not, since judicial review is not excluded by the new Clause 14, we could end up with a situation where a decision could not be sent for reconsideration under new Section 103A(2), but could be quashed by a judicial review. That, it seems to me, would be a waste of time, and I hope the Government make it clear that reconsideration can be ordered on any grounds that would justify judicial review if there were no provision for reconsideration of the tribunal's original decision.
<P>

<a name="40504-05_para3"></a>Perhaps the most objectionable provision of the new clause is the time limit under new Section 103A(3), to be inserted into the 2002 Act. In-country applications must be made within five days of the communication of the original decision to the appellant. While we agree that speed is important, five days seems to be seriously overdoing it. An application will require the applicant's legal adviser to receive a copy of the decision, to read and consider it and to draft and file an application to the High Court. It may well also require a meeting with the applicant at which the presence of an interpreter is needed. Any one adviser may be handling several cases at the same time, which will make his availability that much more limited. In all those circumstances, five days is wholly inadequate. <P>


<a name="column_1001"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1001</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>We believe that two weeks would be the minimum in which to set the proper balance between speed of decision and justice to the applicant.
<P>

<a name="40504-05_para4"></a>I note Section 103A(4)(b), which gives power to extend the time, but this should not be used as an excuse to make the original time unduly short. I note that Amendment No. 47A creates a power for the Lord Chancellor to vary the period specified in new Section 103A(3) by order. That order is presently under the negative resolution procedure. Such procedure is permissible for an extension of time or, once it has been extended, perhaps for bringing it back to what was originally specified in the Bill. However, given the tight time limits imposed in the Bill, I believe that any order which reduces them should require an affirmative resolution. I do not know whether the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee has considered that.
<P>

<a name="40504-05_para5"></a>Next, where reconsideration is ordered, there should be a requirement on the face of the Bill that it should be conducted by a panel of at least three members. If a decision has gone wrong the first time it comes to the tribunal, it is particularly important that it is corrected on the second occasion. The decision of one member of a tribunal should not be affirmed or overruled on reconsideration by a single member of equal status. I believe that reconsideration should therefore be carried out by a panel of three members.
<P>

<a name="40504-05_para6"></a>I turn to the new Section 103D on costs. It is planned to convert the cost regime for applications to reconsider and reconsideration itself into a no-win, no-fee system. I can see some justification for that in principle. It is obviously not desirable to pay for representation in hopeless cases which should never have been brought, but many cases which do not succeed are not hopeless. In civil cases, where there is a no-win, no-fee system, that is allowed for by giving lawyers a mark-up on their normal fees in successful cases. I do not imagine that that is what is intended here, but if not, it is then surely necessary that lawyers should be paid where they have reasonable grounds for appealing but were not successful and not just in those cases described as "near misses".
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I thank the noble Lord for giving way. In all the cases he has mentioned, the Law Society, or whichever body, can consider what is appropriate initially. Therefore, the solicitor making the application automatically has grounds if legal aid is granted. In those circumstances, is it not right that legal aid costs should be awarded to the applicant?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   Yes, I accept that in general it is the principle that the Legal Services Commission will provide a system in which there is initial vetting of the validity of the case. I am aware of the problem here; that that is a source of considerable delay in the system. While I would welcome an arrangement by which the justification for the application was vetted by the Legal Services Commission in the ordinary way before it was made, I am not wholly unsympathetic to the Government's view, which I assume is behind the provision, that that would delay the proceedings <P>


<a name="column_1002"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1002</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>beyond what is reasonable. If that is the Government's view, they should accept the corollary that cases which are not demonstrably unreasonable should be given, ex post facto, legal aid by the decision of the tribunal.
<P>

<a name="40504-05_para7"></a>It therefore seems to me that if the exclusion of the normal procedure for legal aid is to be applied in this case, it should be on the face of the Bill that legal aid under new Section 103D should be refused only where it should have been apparent to the applicant's legal advisers that there were no reasonable grounds for the application. If not, the consequence will be that some applications which would have succeeded and would have led to a successful reconsideration will never be brought. That may have disastrous consequences to those who are returned to their countries of origin as a result.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-05_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   I apologise for intervening again. Is not the remedy the noble Lord wishes to pursue something of a gamble? Certain tribunals may not like legal aid and will therefore be averse to it. Would it not be more acceptable if the committee considering legal aid applications were to speed up its consideration?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-05_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   That would be a highly desirable conclusion, but whether it is practicable is another matter. That is a decision for the Government and if they are not prepared to do so, they must put on the face of the Bill a provision making it clear that wherever there are reasonable grounds for making an application, legal aid will be provided ex post facto.
<P>

<a name="40504-05_para8"></a>Amendment No. 58 provides that some decisions of the tribunal are to be treated, under the direction of the president of the tribunal, as authoritative. What is the purpose of that provision? If a decision of law is treated as authoritative, the normal rule is that only a decision of the High Court, or a court at a higher level, is binding on inferior courts and tribunals. The decision, for example, of one judge of the circuit court is not binding on another. I can see no reason to change that rule. There is no justification for making the tribunal's decision on a question of law binding on some other subsequent proceedings before the tribunal when in fact there is a procedure by which questions of law can be decided at the level of the Court of Appeal. It seems appropriate that only those decisions made by the Court of Appeal should be regarded as binding on the tribunal.
<P>

<a name="40504-05_para9"></a>If Amendment No. 58 is also intended to provide that a decision of fact can become authoritative&#151;for example, that a particular country is safe for particular groups of applicants&#151;that decision should not be authoritative in other cases because it should always be open to an applicant either to give evidence of a change in circumstances in that country or to introduce new evidence, which was not provided for reasons good or bad at the earlier hearing and was therefore not available to the tribunal in making the decision now said to be authoritative.
<P>

<a name="40504-05_para10"></a>The Government are trying to have it both ways: to have a single-tier asylum and immigration tribunal but making one decision binding on another decision <P>


<a name="column_1003"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1003</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>maker at the same level. In other words, all decisions in the tribunal are equal, but some are to be more equal than others. That seems inappropriate.
<P>

<a name="40504-05_para11"></a>Finally, the Bill does not deal with the most serious problem, which is made clear by almost all organisations dealing with immigration and asylum cases. That is the unsatisfactory quality of the first-stage decisions taken by immigration officers before the matter reaches the tribunal. If the quality of those decisions could be improved, that would do more than anything to speed up and improve the quality of decision taking in immigration and asylum cases. Although the new clause is a substantial improvement on the original Clause 14, it is still capable of considerable improvement. We shall return with the necessary amendments on Report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   In following the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, may I say that I agree with his conclusions about the inadequacy of the five-day rule? It is not practicably possible in five days to assume that all those practitioners can come to a proper decision. I hope that my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor will conclude from the submissions made to him that that period should be extended.
<P>

<a name="40504-06_para0"></a>As I said in my intervention, the Select Committee on Home Affairs, the Constitutional Affairs Select Committee and Amnesty International have all made valuable contributions, acknowledged by my noble and learned friend. But to imply that they are without criticisms of the present proposals is not accurate. All have concluded that there are factors attached to the present amendment that are unsatisfactory in certain material respects, among them&#151;I can see no difference of view expressed by any of the bodies I have mentioned&#151;that the five-day rule is utterly inadequate. I hope that my noble and learned friend will come to a different conclusion on that matter when he considers what has been said in the debate.
<P>

<a name="40504-06_para1"></a>Certainly I share the view advanced by the Law Society that it is possible to have a swift conclusion of the representations made but that a five-day rule does not have to be applied. I agree with what my noble and learned friend said. Where I depart from him is his profession that he is prepared, initially at least, to leave the matter of legal aid to the tribunal. I consider that to be a gamble. If the procedures can be speeded up with regard to asylum, why should the Legal Services Commission not be able to speed up its own procedures? It has to conclude that there is a prima facie case that the representations that are to be made to the tribunal are adequate. It is perfectly possible for it to come to the conclusion that, prima facie, it is desirable that legal aid should be extended for that purpose.
<P>

<a name="40504-06_para2"></a>I am also worried about a matter that was touched on by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. The initial decision making by the Home Office is itself seriously flawed regarding the information about the countries of origin from which the asylum seeker has fled, the credibility of applicants and their allegations about torture where such allegations are made. I should like to know what has been the response of my noble and learned friend's department to those concerns.
<P>


<a name="column_1004"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40504-06_para3"></a>The second tier of appeal is supposed to provide significant protections. It does not, as my noble and learned friend suggested earlier, represent an abuse of the system. But I would like to know whether he sticks to that point of view. Is that the view of the Government about all similar systems; for example, the employment tribunal and so on? Where is the Government's evidence to justify what amounts to a radical departure from what, up until now, has been the norm?
<P>

<a name="40504-06_para4"></a>I turn to the suggestion of legal aid in relation to immigration and asylum cases. In asylum cases there is to be a system whereby the legal representatives can provide up to five hours' advice regarding the initial decision. That can be departed from if the case is "genuine and complex". Are there to be special guidelines regarding that? What does "genuine and complex" mean? I think that there is a certain ambiguity about that. In immigration cases, the initial advice is to be undertaken in three hours. But no legal aid is available for Home Office interviews, save for unaccompanied minors, people suffering from mental incapacity and those going through the fast-track decision process. I wonder whether that is altogether fair.
<P>

<a name="40504-06_para5"></a>Provision is also made for legal aid for immigration and asylum seekers' appeals to be diminished. Is that right? In what way is that fair? Does my noble and learned friend agree that there may be further restrictions under proposed new Clause 103D regarding legal aid?
<P>

<a name="40504-06_para6"></a>The other matter to which I want to refer&#151;this is my last point&#151;is the Leggatt committee, which made certain recommendations concerning the second tier. The committee formed the view, with which I am wholly sympathetic, that there should be a right of appeal on a point of law. Will my noble and learned friend say something about that?
<P>

<a name="40504-06_para7"></a>Finally, I entirely agree that what my noble and learned friend has put forward today is rather better than what was put forward in the past&#151;something that I wholly rejected. On the other hand, I believe that some vital matters still require the consideration of this House and of another place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I agree with every word that my noble friend Lord Goodhart said, but perhaps I may also focus on the decision by the High Court judge to return the matter to the tribunal. Subsection (6) of proposed new Clause 103A states that a decision of the High Court judge,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"on an application under subsection (1) shall be final".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-06_para8"></a>
Subsection (5) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An application under subsection (1) shall be determined by reference only to written submissions of the applicant".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-06_para9"></a>
Therefore, the respondent&#151;presumably the Home Office&#151;will not be represented and will not make written submissions.
<P>

<a name="40504-06_para10"></a>However, the High Court may make an order to return the matter to the tribunal only if it thinks that the tribunal made an error of law. In the field of judicial review, the customary position is that the High Court judge who is considering an application for leave will grant leave if he believes there to be an arguable case&#151;not if he makes a subjective decision that the particular tribunal with which he is concerned made an error. That provision requires the <P>


<a name="column_1005"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1005</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>High Court judge, without any representations from the respondent, to come at least to a provisional conclusion, which must have some influence on the tribunal to which the matter is returned.
<P>

<a name="40504-06_para11"></a>When the word "tribunal" is used in subsections (1) and (2), is the thinking that the High Court judge will order the matter to be reconsidered by the member of the tribunal who heard it in the first place? In other words, does the application go to the High Court and, if the judge thinks on written representations only from the applicant that the original decision was wrong, does he then send it back to that person telling him that, in his view, he has made an error? If that is the case, it is hardly an appeal to any degree at all. I want to underline the point made by my noble friend Lord Goodhart that, if the matter goes back to the tribunal, it should be heard by a different member of a different panel of three members of the tribunal.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-06_spnew2"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Newcastle: </B>   At the end of the debate on Second Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, set out three conditions that any replacement of Clause 14 should fulfil. They were: the right of appeal to the Court of Appeal and onwards; the reinstating of the supervisory powers of the higher courts; and improving quality so that any new system is better than the present one.
<P>

<a name="40504-06_para12"></a>I, like other noble Lords, very much welcome the reinstatement of the right of appeal. It is important for refugees, whose causes may throw up very complex cases of law, fair procedure and, indeed, the interpretation of the convention relating to the status of refugees, that the right of appeal should be reinstated.
<P>

<a name="40504-06_para13"></a>However, I also share the concerns of other noble Lords about the practicality of the five-day time limit. It seems to me to be far too short. No one knows when the decision will come through. The decision must be read, instructions must be taken from the appellant, interpreters must be found and an application to the High Court prepared. I fear that submissions will be very hastily prepared, and that is a recipe for neither good quality nor efficiency. In any case, children's charities and those working with refugee children already report difficulties in finding good legal aid representatives. The demand far outstrips the supply, and many hours are already spent trying to find a good lawyer who is willing to take on the case. This very tight time limit will simply make things even more difficult, and I hope that the measure will be reconsidered.
<P>

<a name="40504-06_para14"></a>I also worry about the no-win, no-fee scheme of payment, if that is how it is to be described. Or is it a no-win, no-fee but near misses will be funded as well scheme? Surely making people ineligible for the funds to pay for an appeal when they are already destitute could have the simple effect of preventing them appealing altogether.
<P>

<a name="40504-06_para15"></a>Of course, I acknowledge that the whole asylum system is difficult, and we have many concerns about its present quality. At a recent tribunal hearing, the then Dean of Newcastle, who was there in support of <P>


<a name="column_1006"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1006</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a regular worshipper at the cathedral, was asked by the chairman of the tribunal, "Tell me, is the cathedral mainstream religion or is it some kind of way-out sect?". Such incidents do not fill me with much confidence in the quality of the system that we have at present.
<P>

<a name="40504-06_para16"></a>I have real concerns about the five-day limit. I have concerns about the no-win, no-fee arrangements, which will make immigration and asylum an even less attractive area for lawyers to practise in. We know that the best protection against bad representatives is a sufficiency of good representatives. Of course, the Government are working very hard to ensure proper regulation in this field. That seems to me to be the best way to go rather than using conditional fee arrangements.
<P>

<a name="40504-06_para17"></a>I want to make one last comment on the subject of supervision. Why is it necessary for the application for review to be by written submission only? Why not allow the court to determine whether it wishes in exceptional cases to hear oral arguments? Surely we can trust our judges to exercise such a power both wisely and well.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   It is necessary to consider the Government's amendments both for their own merits and because this is a very important occasion when an ouster clause was taken far beyond any limit that anybody in the past had considered. That clause has now been reconsidered by the Government and we have these amendments. I want to underline the fact that this is not a trifling change; it is something almost and possibly actually historic.
<P>

<a name="40504-06_para18"></a>I shall deal with three points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. First, I shall comment on error of law. I hope that there will be no attempt to define an error of law, cynically perhaps because I have always thought that the ability of the judiciary was to regard what others might ignorantly regard as an error of fact as being an error of law. Such a definition would deny a degree of flexibility which is highly desirable.
<P>

<a name="40504-06_para19"></a>The second aspect is that I have never understood it to be suggested that any of the grounds upon which the Administrative Court&#151;as it is now called&#151;has acted in the past was other than an error of law. I served for quite a time in that court and I never thought that there was any doubt about that. Wednesbury springs to mind. In the early days of Wednesbury, and comments about it, the logical basis for Wednesbury was that the Minister concerned was of course a very reasonable man. All Ministers of the Crown are irrebuttably reasonable men. So if he reached an unreasonable conclusion it must be because he failed to take account of something which was relevant, or took account of something that was irrelevant, and that was necessarily an error of law. Subsequent cases have said that you do not need to go through that rigmarole&#151;it is sufficient that unreasonable decisions can be set aside or omitted. I hope therefore that that will be left like that.
<P>


<a name="column_1007"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1007</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40504-06_para20"></a>The question of reconsideration has caused me some surprise because I had assumed that any remission to the "tribunal" would be a remission to the same tribunal&#151;whatever kind of tribunal it is: whether three men, one man, or whatever. While I can see the advantages or merits of the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, that the appeal should go back to a different tribunal, that would be a very different proceeding because the new tribunal would have to start again. In a typical situation, if the reviewing body sent the decision back for reconsideration, it would be on the basis that the tribunal has omitted to look at something or failed in some other respect. That could well be a Wednesbury situation. But the man who made the original decision would be in the best position to correct it, in the light of direction and advice from the reviewing body. If the appeal goes to an entirely different tribunal then that is a different animal. There would have to be rules or procedural arrangements to enable that new body to start again, with the awful possibility that, having started again, there might be entirely fresh grounds for objection or asking for review. It would be quite impossible to say that there could not be a second review or anything of that sort.
<P>

<a name="40504-06_para21"></a>The other point concerns Amendment No. 58. I agree with the objections and criticisms of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, that you cannot have a tribunal deciding at its own level that decisions shall be authoritative, short of the much higher level of the Court of Appeal, where that does apply&#151;although there are devices for distinguishing earlier decisions on the grounds that perhaps it was a two-judge court. I once had the privilege of sitting with Lord Denning in just such a case, who said, "I have decided that, on an interlocutory matter, in this particular appeal, but I do not think I was right. We will therefore ignore it". It seemed to me, as a junior member of the court, to have a lot of merit on those particular facts. I assumed that it was not going to become part of the jurisprudence of the court.
<P>

<a name="40504-06_para22"></a>Amendment No. 58 has a point, obviously, that where you have multiple tribunals&#151;which will inevitably be the case&#151;and parallel courts, as far as possible they should sing from the same hymn sheet. I assume that Amendment No. 58 is intended to produce that result. The amendment could produce that result if it had a persuasive rather than a binding provision so that it would be open to other tribunals to depart from it to some greater or lesser extent.
<P>

<a name="40504-06_para23"></a>There is a lot to be said against matters of fact being even of persuasive authority, although it is not as objectionable as a binding authority would be. But that could be ameliorated to some extent if one considers what question of fact will be of binding authority. It cannot be a fact peculiar to the applicant, because it would never be the same. On the other hand, it could be a matter of enormous importance, such as <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Clashfern: </B>   I certainly warmly welcome the fundamental change of stance which the amendment, moved by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, signals in respect of Clause 14. Nothing that I will say hereafter is intended in any way to detract from that. These amendments are a huge improvement on what went before, but perhaps they are capable of some further improvement.
<P>

<a name="40504-07_para0"></a>I will look first at Amendment No. 46A and Clause 103A, which it is proposed to put into the Act. I do not intend to raise the question of the time limit&#151;that will have to be the subject of an amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, indicated that he will table such an amendment at a later stage. However, I can see arguments that are important in that connection.
<P>

<a name="40504-07_para1"></a>Subsection (5) of the amendment states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An application under subsection (1) shall be determined by reference only to written submissions of the applicant".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-07_para2"></a>
Obviously, a decision under review would require to be referred; it cannot just be a matter of the submissions of the applicant. When it states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"reference only to written submissions of the applicant",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-07_para3"></a>
that is a slightly over-emphatic way of saying what is intended. It must be right to allow written submissions from the respondent; otherwise, a court may overlook a fundamental point. It is exceptional to hear only one side in a judicial process. I know that it happens in relation to leave in the ordinary case. But I would have thought that the court should have power to have, if it wanted, written submissions from the respondent.
<P>

<a name="40504-07_para4"></a>That brings me to mention the very moderate statement made recently about judicial decisions by the Home Secretary. I was wondering whether he was aware that the difficulty that he had was because the Home Office, or whoever in government was responsible for these matters, was seeking to oust the jurisdiction of the court to deal with interim matters such as bail. That was so successful that apparently no appeal was left unless judicial review was opened. I just wondered whether the Home Secretary was aware that that is how the situation was brought about.
<P>

<a name="40504-07_para5"></a>I assume also that the application under subsection (1), referred to in subsection (5), may well be dealt with by a reasoned decision, so that the judge's reasons for sending the case back will be before the tribunal. I hope that it would be within the power of the judge to decide whether the case should go back to the same or a different tribunal. For example, if the error in law concerned the bias of the tribunal member who decided the case, it would be unsatisfactory for the matter to go back to him or her. So, I think that it would be right to leave the judge the power to decide the issue in relation to the circumstances of the case.
<P>

<a name="40504-07_para6"></a>I also welcome in principle the filter mechanism in Amendment No. 59, to which the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor spoke. If I heard him right, he said that the review would be entrusted to a senior <P>


<a name="column_1009"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1009</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>member of the tribunal. I do not notice that in the clause, but it may be that seniority is to be inferred without reference in this situation, as in some others.
<P>

<a name="40504-07_para7"></a>So far as concerns treating a decision of the tribunal as authoritative in respective of a particular matter, I am not clear what is intended by that. Is it authority for the tribunal itself? If so, it must be only so long as it stands because it is open to be set aside by the Court of Appeal. I cannot remember a previous example of that. The noble and learned Lord may have some examples in mind, but there are none in my mind at the present moment. That may be due to lack of recollection rather than to absence of fact.
<P>

<a name="40504-07_para8"></a>I should like to say a word or two about the legal aid provisions, which are supposed to be a no-win no-fee type of arrangement. My understanding of the no-win no-fee type of arrangement is that where it applies and there is no win, there is in fact no fee. In other words, in that situation the lawyer is not in a position to charge his client. This arrangement is not of that kind. So far as I can understand it, it is a legal aid arrangement. Therefore, even if the lawyer loses, he may still be entitled to charge his client. What the right reverend Prelate said about that must be relevant.
<P>

<a name="40504-07_para9"></a>The other point about the lack of uplift, referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, is of course relevant. One purpose of the uplift is to enable genuinely borderline cases to be taken, so that the lawyer would not refuse to take a case simply because the chances of success were not greater than 50:50.
<P>

<a name="40504-07_para10"></a>Incidentally, the legal aid position, as far as I can understand the section, does not apply to Scotland. There must be some extremely good reason for that. I expect that legal aid is a devolved matter. I am not certain what the reason is, but the section does not apply to an appeal decided in Scotland. One can envisage certain types of appeal in which there might be some pressure to go to that beneficial jurisdiction to have the case decided.
<P>

<a name="40504-07_para11"></a>The provision that troubles me, although I can see the reason for it, is that there can be only one application to the High Court in any appeal. As a result of the decision to refer the case back to the tribunal, one can see that a different line might be taken than was taken on the first occasion. The judge's reasoned decision might well aid that, or help to cause that to happen. If that happened&#151;in other words if the grounds of the decision of the tribunal were very substantially different from the grounds of the first decision&#151;I think that it would be unfair to prevent a second application. I can see the trouble that would be caused by a number of applications being taken in the same appeal. I can see the desire to stop that. I can also see occasions in which restricting the number of applications to one might create a manifest injustice. I hope that it would be possible to leave the court to deal with that. The review mechanism&#151;that is the filter mechanism&#151;so long as it lasts might produce one way to handle that.
<P>

<a name="40504-07_para12"></a>As I said, this provision is a great improvement on what we have had before, but I hope that the noble and learned Lord will be prepared to improve it further. I <P>

The noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson of Lymington, when he said that the original version of this amendment was "almost historic", I think could safely have cut out the qualification. If it had gone ahead it would have been. I am immensely grateful to all those concerned who have put a great effort, both public and private&#151;and I suspect the private in some cases is more important than the public&#151;into ensuring that we did not have a historic battle. I welcome the body of these amendments in that spirit. However, that does not mean that we are not subject to the ordinary disagreements of parliamentary life as this needs to be considered, as my noble friend Lord Goodhart suggested, very much in the spirit in which we consider any new legislative proposal.
<P>

<a name="40504-07_para14"></a>I always enjoy listening to my noble friend. I do not think I have ever heard him speak quite as well as he has today. The five days is a point on which practically the whole House seems to be agreed. Two recent developments have made the five-day limitation a great deal more unreasonable than it would otherwise be. The first is the relic of the policy of dispersal. We have all heard my noble friend Lord Greaves talking about the difficulties of attending at Croydon at 9.30 when one has to travel down from Lancashire and one has no money for fares.
<P>

<a name="40504-07_para15"></a>The other reason why five days has become more unreasonable is the rapid decline of the postal service. We do not have to believe the "Despatches" programme for that. According to Sunday's business section of the Observer, the Post Office is liable to face fines of £80 million for having missed almost every one of its performance targets. My own record is the time when my whip took 16 days to travel from Westminster to Kilburn. Under these circumstances, requiring the lodging of an appeal within five days does in many cases fall foul of the maxim that the law does not compel the impossible. We really are going to have to think again about that.
<P>

<a name="40504-07_para16"></a>I will say just a little bit about what was wrong with the initial amendment, not in any critical spirit, but because I am sure that all of us, including the Home Secretary, do not want to end up here again. In fact, it is important that we should not. The original amendment, in words that reversed the judgment in Anisminic, said that one could not condemn a decision of a tribunal by reason of lack of jurisdiction, irregularity, error of law, breach of natural justice, or any other matter. It is the definition of a sovereign power that it can do what it likes, and it cannot be corrected but by itself. Those words conferred something similar to the powers of a sovereign power on the court in that particular matter. It is by claiming powers <P>


<a name="column_1011"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1011</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>like this, in what used to be described as lex parliamenti, that parliaments in the past have found the power to condemn judges, Ministers, Privy Counsellors and even Lord Chancellors for offences as severe as treason.
<P>

<a name="40504-07_para17"></a>Sir Thomas Wentworth had a point when he said, "they say God deliver us from his arbitrary government; I say God deliver us from their arbitrary treason". It is not in the Minister's interests to encourage courts to think that they are capable of taking powers as arbitrary as this. Purely in their own interest, I hope that they will never do it again.
<P>

<a name="40504-07_para18"></a>I was interested in some of the points made by my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford. The difference between believing a case is probably right and believing that it is arguable is like the watershed between the St Lawrence and the Mississippi. It is very flat ground; it may be almost invisible; but it makes a difference of many thousand miles to where the water ultimately flows. I hope that the remarks made by my noble friend will be taken with the seriousness that they probably deserve.
<P>

<a name="40504-07_para19"></a>I was also taken by his point about whether the case is to be referred back to the same person. When one is asked to review one's own decision, one inevitably bears the appearance of being judge and party in one's own cause. Purely casually, I happened to find in the course of reading, rather late last night, a case where that was roundly condemned from as early as 1220, and it was stated as a long-established principle that it was assumed everyone already knew. The reflexive character of that was one of the things that was wrong with the original Bill. I do not want it coming into the amended version by the back door. James Bond once turned to swear at Goldfinger, and got the reply, "Even I am incapable of that, Mr Bond". We do not want to get into that situation either.
<P>

<a name="40504-07_para20"></a>I share the anxiety that has been expressed about conditional fees, but I will not develop it any further. I have a lot of sympathy with what has been said on the question of what is authoritative. I remember a story that Jeremy Thorpe used to tell about a counsel who had a case that had been before that judge before, some 20 years earlier, on the basis of which counsel, most unwisely, had assured his clients that victory was certain. The judge judged the other way. Counsel, white as a sheet, said, "But these facts have been before you before, my Lord". "I know, but they do not appear to me now as they appeared to appear to me then". Statutory provision that a decision shall be authoritative will cause very great difficulties to our present judges' successors. We should be wary how we do it.
<P>

<a name="40504-07_para21"></a>With those reservations, I should like to join the universal gratitude to Ministers, intermediaries, senior persons, Members of the Opposition Front Benches&#151;in fact to everyone&#151;for showing the spirit of moderation and compromise for which this House is justly famous and for which I am extremely proud to have the privilege of belonging to it.

<P>
<A NAME="40504-08_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I wonder whether, as a complete amateur in these matters, I might ask the noble and learned Lord a question concerning <P>


<a name="column_1012"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1012</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Amendment No. 47A, and how the five-day period might be varied. As I understand it, it would be done by an order subject to annulment, after consultation by the Lord Chancellor with the head of the judiciary of the part of the country concerned.
<P>

<a name="40504-08_para0"></a>I was not able to be at the meeting of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee this morning, but looking at the manuscript report, it seems that the committee accepted that this order should be subject to annulment, not after agreement by both Houses. I wonder what the problem is with this. Is it the case that the Lord Chancellor intends that the variation of, say, the five days might be different in different parts of the country in different circumstances? In his letter to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, he pointed out that this order will interact with the rules of court. I am not sure whether the rules of court are different in Scotland and England. Perhaps I should know that.
<P>

<a name="40504-08_para1"></a>Is the problem that, say, for Parliament discussing this matter, different periods might relate to different circumstances&#151;for example, whether the asylum seeker was in detention or not, but also for different parts of the country, and how the courts were working? I can see that the head of the judiciary would know whether there is a problem about five days in one part of the country, whereas another head of judiciary might not know about that particular problem. I wonder if the noble and learned Lord, when he replies, could clarify that point. I hope that I have explained it properly. It is slightly difficult for me to do it concisely.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   One should not overlook, in the congratulations that have been referred to, congratulating the former Lord Chancellor. It was, after all, his initiative to put his name down to fight the ouster clause that caused this Government to think again.
<P>

<a name="40504-08_para2"></a>I know no more powerful argument for the retention of the Lord Chancellor than what happened in relation to the ouster clause. The existing Lord Chancellor was prepared to back it. It was only a former Lord Chancellor who decided to break his vow of silence and speak against it that caused this Government to repent. The previous Lord Chancellor did not even have to open his mouth. He merely indicated that he would open his mouth unless the Government thought again. That shows how essential it is that there is some power concentrated somewhere in order to make the appropriate resistance to what was a perfectly monstrous proposal to deny the public a right of access to the courts.
<P>

<a name="40504-08_para3"></a>I make a number of points. As regards the reference throughout to "the Lord Chancellor", what happens if and when there ceases to be a Lord Chancellor? Is all decided by the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs when it is accepted that he could well not be a lawyer and that he ought to be in another place? Where is the independence which is assumed to exist here? The Lord Chancellor is the person who makes the serious decisions. What happens when he goes?
<P>

<a name="40504-08_para4"></a>I turn to a point of law. Do the Government accept that, for instance, a failure to comply with the rules of natural justice is a point of law? The rules of natural <P>


<a name="column_1013"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1013</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>justice have been defined as being merely the elementary rules of fair play in action. Technically, that does not sound like a point of law although I appreciate that it has often been so treated. If the Government accept that it should continue to be so treated it ought to be said clearly.
<P>

<a name="40504-08_para5"></a>I fully appreciate and support the speeding up of the processes. That is best achieved through the filter system. We in this country do not realise how fortunate we are with the degree of tolerance which has been shown as regards filters. It does not exist on the Continent. Some time ago, Italy was aghast at the time it took for appeals to be heard. It decided that it would bring in a very moderate filter system. It was thrown out with indignation. It was said that everybody who wants to appeal should have the right to do so. But our system is rightly shot through with filter systems. I do not object to them in any way, as long as they are fair.
<P>

<a name="40504-08_para6"></a>On that subject, I do not accept, as others have said, that the court must think that the tribunal made an error of law. That really requires the "court of appeal", to reach a firm decision when it is accepted that the respondent has not entered any material on his behalf and when at that stage it has always been accepted that a good, arguable case is wholly sufficient. There is a distinct difference between saying, "I consider that there has been an error of law" and saying, "It is fairly arguable that there has been an error of law". It may not be workable, but there should be situations where, for example, the "appeal court" could say that, as the suggested error in a case is lack of jurisdiction, it would like to hear what the respondent says. On that kind of point, having heard the applicant and respondent, the court should decide that there has been an error of law; the matter should not be sent back to the tribunal for it to reconsider what is a pure point of law that should be easily definable in those circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40504-08_para7"></a>I do not repeat what has been said about five days being too short. But, for my own education, I invite the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor to give us a short snapshot of where legal aid begins and what are the earlier decisions when it is refused so that the prospect of getting forensic help is unlikely to have been achieved. That is all I have to say at this stage.

<P>

<a name="40504-08_para8"></a>As the noble and learned Lord rightly pointed out to the Committee, we did not move our amendment for a very simple reason. The three fundamental criticisms that we had of the Government's original Bill are met by the noble and learned Lord's own amendment. First, the Government have rightly and thankfully expunged the ouster clause. Secondly, they have restored the right of appeal to the Court of Appeal and then on to the Judicial Committee of your Lordships' House. Thirdly, and perhaps more controversially for some Members of the Committee, they have taken the two stages of adjudicator and tribunal and reduced <P>


<a name="column_1014"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1014</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>them to one. We support all those components of the Government's amendment. But we do have things to say about it.
<P>

<a name="40504-08_para9"></a>I start with a point which has troubled a number of Committee Members and that is the distinction between an error of law and a point of law on which normal appeals are based.
<P>

<a name="40504-08_para10"></a>I do not know whether it is true, but there may have been an element of confusion in translating the old Section 101 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 into the new Bill.
<P>

<a name="40504-08_para11"></a>The new Section 103A states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A party to an appeal under section 82 or 83 may apply to the appropriate court, on the grounds that the Tribunal made an error of law, for an order requiring the Tribunal to reconsider its decision on the appeal".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-08_para12"></a>
Under the 2002 Act there was an additional stage of appeal. It was not just an appeal from the tribunal; but, first, from the adjudicator to the tribunal and then an appeal further from the tribunal. The former appeal was dealt with in Section 101 of the 2002 Act. I make no apologies to the Committee for quoting from it. Subsection (1) states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A party to an appeal to an adjudicator under section 82 or 83 may, with the permission of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal, appeal to the Tribunal against the adjudicator's determination on a point of law".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-08_para13"></a>
Subsection (2) states,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A party to an application to the Tribunal for permission to appeal under subsection (1) may apply to the High Court or, in Scotland, to the Court of Session for a review of the Tribunal's decision on the ground that the Tribunal made an error of law".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-08_para14"></a>
So in the 2002 Act the issue of error of law arose only if the tribunal, itself, refused an appeal to itself from the adjudicator on a point of law. The issue is whether the Government have now deliberately substituted "error of law" for "point of law"; or whether there is some other reason, which I have not yet fathomed, to explain why the translation of the first two subsections in Section 101 has not taken place in the way in which the Committee would have wished. 
<P>

<a name="40504-08_para15"></a>I turn now to the second question that I wish to raise, which is about the transitional provisions. I know that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has been under a certain amount of pressure from the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice and the Administrative Division of the High Court to introduce into the Bill a filter stage. The reason for this is that the judges, in my view rightly, discern that, without this filter, the administrative court would be engulfed with applications from the tribunal now that there is only a single stage.
<P>

<a name="40504-08_para16"></a>My concerns are not about the principle but about two aspects of the way in which the noble and learned Lord intends to implement the filter. The first aspect has been referred to already by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, and a number of other Members of the Committee&#151;that is, exactly what are the arrangements internal to the tribunal which will ensure that the principles, to which the Committee rightly adheres in matters of appeal, are properly respected? The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, was quite right to ask the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor to give as much detail as is necessary to reassure the Committee that these principles will be respected.
<P>


<a name="column_1015"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1015</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40504-08_para17"></a>On the issue of reconsideration, I share the view of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson. In normal circumstances&#151;for example, where the tribunal has misdirected itself in law&#151;I see no reason why the matter should not be remitted by the High Court to the same tribunal to reconsider it. However, there may be circumstances in which, for example, a member of the tribunal had certain characteristics which ought to have led to his or her standing down rather than hearing the case. In those circumstances, clearly the tribunal that rehears the case would have to be a different one. In sum, in my submission, the Committee will need to see more on the face of the Bill about the way in which the process of reconsideration will operate in practice.
<P>

<a name="40504-08_para18"></a>My second concern about the filter is its open endedness. In my view, it is very important that pressure is brought to bear on the system to improve the quality of decision making at lower levels. If the filter is there indefinitely, in my submission, that pressure on the system will not be there.
<P>

<a name="40504-08_para19"></a>We all know that the reason why there is such a high volume of appeals throughout the system is because of the poor quality decision making at the Home Office interview stage and at the adjudicator stage. If no changes are made in those areas, the filter will be there permanently. So I think it is desirable that the House should have the opportunity, every two or three years, to look at how the system works to ensure that the filter is not simply used as an excuse for not committing appropriate resources at the interview and tribunal stages to get better quality decision making.
<P>

<a name="40504-08_para20"></a>The Committee is familiar with the issues and I do not intend to go into them in detail today. I simply propose to remind the Committee that at the interview stage we believe it important that not only is a tape-recording made of the interview but also that a transcript of what is said is subsequently produced and that the legal aid provisions are a great deal more generous than those recently implemented by the Government.
<P>

<a name="40504-08_para21"></a>I have equal concerns about what is likely to happen at the new single tribunal level. I hope that I am wrong&#151;but I cannot resist the temptation to say it&#151;in suggesting that I fear that the new single tier tribunal will simply mimic the existing adjudicator system; in other words, the Government are saying that they are merging the adjudicator into the tribunal but what they are really doing is merging the tribunal into the adjudicator system. In my submission that would be unacceptable.
<P>

<a name="40504-08_para22"></a>It is especially unacceptable to have in any future tribunal a single legally-qualified person taking the tribunal decision. Such a decision will be the only occasion in the immigration and tribunal system when the credibility of an asylum applicant is examined objectively. There is to be no appeal on the facts. There is clearly not an objective analysis at the Home Office stage because the Home Office has a particular view about the way in which the system should operate. So the tribunal stage is the only moment when the facts are objectively considered.

<a name="40504-08_para23"></a>In my submission, it is essential that the Government ensure that each tribunal has at least two, and normally three, members to consider all the factual aspects of an asylum seeker's application. The issue of credibility, more than any other issue, determines the outcome of tribunal decisions. In this regard, I support what I take to be the proposals of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, that at least one, and preferably two, lay members should always sit when a tribunal decision is taken. Lay members are at least as well qualified as judicially qualified members to assess issues of credibility and it is unacceptable that only one adjudicator should undertake that responsibility.
<P>

<a name="40504-08_para24"></a>My third concern is the lack of anything in Clause 14&#151; or, indeed, in other parts of the Bill&#151;to deal with matters of expedition outside the tribunal process. The biggest delays in the immigration and asylum system are those that occur between the time that an asylum seeker makes his application and the time it is determined by the Home Office. There is nothing in the Bill to impose time limits on this phase. It would be, in my submission, an enormous improvement to the operation of the system if such a provision were made.
<P>

<a name="40504-08_para25"></a>Equally, there is no time limit imposed between the moment when the tribunal phase, and any appeals from it, is finally terminated and the moment of deportation, if, indeed, the result of the judicial process is adverse to the asylum seeker.
<P>

<a name="40504-08_para26"></a>I sought, in my amendment, to provide a solution to this problem. I had at the time some doubts about the degree to which it fitted the Bill, and so I was not surprised to be criticised by the noble and learned Lord for it. He kindly sent me a letter on 27 April and I cannot resist quoting part of the final paragraph to the Committee. The noble and learned Lord stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In particular, it is meaningless for the tribunal to set a date&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-08_para27"></a>
I say, parenthetically, that I sought in my amendment to set a fixed date after the tribunal decision was made for a person to be deported if the tribunal decision was adverse. I repeat:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In particular, it is meaningless for the tribunal to set a date, as a person may assert there is new evidence that has come to light and needs to be considered, otherwise their removal is unlawful. The claim of new evidence can be made by way of judicial review against the removal directions or in further representations to the IND who have to make a decision on new evidence".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-08_para28"></a><P>

<a name="40504-08_para29"></a>I accept that my amendment was imperfect; but I do not accept that it is beyond our joint abilities and imagination to find a statutory solution to this problem. We opposed the ouster clause; but we support a general approach to these matters that sets in place a statutory regime which covers all eventualities in the immigration and asylum system.
<P>

<a name="40504-08_para30"></a>I understand what the Government are saying to me&#151;that judicial review is inevitable at the deportation stage and there is nothing we can do about it. The Government have certainly said nothing about the deportation stage in the Bill. It is almost inevitable that every decision by the statutory system which results in deportation will, in a very high number of cases, lead to a further judicial review when the moment for deportation arrives. Surely it is much better to devise a scheme within the Bill which covers all the issues likely to arise on deportation by <P>


<a name="column_1017"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1017</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>statutory measures. In that way, judicial review will become otiose. Otherwise, all the problems that all political parties have been concerned with, over all these years, will re-emerge in the old way.
<P>

<a name="40504-08_para31"></a>I shall be most interested to hear from the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor whether the Government, having thought further about the matter, propose to introduce an amendment on Report which would draw all these deportation issues into the mainstream of their statutory approach. Perhaps the statistics exist and I have negligently overlooked them; but I would be interested to know whether there are any which establish the ratio between the number of orders made for deportation and the number of individuals who have actually been deported. I do not know whether those statistics exist, but if they do, it is important that your Lordships are made aware of them.
<P>

<a name="40504-08_para32"></a>I find myself in some difficulty over the question of five days. In my amendment I recommended that the time period should be seven days, which is not a great deal longer than five. I understand the arguments about a longer period; perhaps the matter ought to be further canvassed on Report. But I, for my part, think the period should be short&#151;whether it is five, seven or 10 days can be a matter for further investigation.
<P>

<a name="40504-08_para33"></a>As to the point about legal aid, I respectfully share the view expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, which I seek to summarise&#151;I hope not incorrectly, but, I am sure, inadequately&#151;by saying that if an advocate were reasonably satisfied that there were reasonably arguable grounds for believing that an error of law had been made, then that, in principle, ought to be enough to ensure a grant of legal aid.
<P>

<a name="40504-08_para34"></a>While I support the efforts of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor to remove wholly inappropriate cases from the scene by limiting legal aid, nevertheless it is, in my submission, important for your Lordships to bear it in mind that at the end of the day, for some of these individuals, the decision whether or not they go home is a matter of life and death. Given that that is the background, I think that the Government ought, on balance, to err on the side of generosity in dealing with legal aid. However, we shall return to that on Report.
<P>

<a name="40504-08_para35"></a>In the mean time, I should like to say, once again, that in broad terms the Opposition support the Government's amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="40504-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   Before the noble Lord sits down, could he help me on one point which he has made? I take his point that there should not be a tribunal of one; I accept that the tribunal should consist of three people. However, he also said that the tribunal might consist of two. Does he agree that that would open up a new danger?
<P>

<a name="40504-09_para0"></a>I have always taken the view that a tribunal of two is very unsatisfactory. The risk of a compromise decision, which is an undesirable decision, is always on the cards. If you sit as a tribunal of two and are the more senior of the two, you go through a period of anxiety wondering whether your colleague might <P>


<a name="column_1018"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1018</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>suddenly roar off on a frolic of his own and how on earth to get him back. I ask the noble Lord to reconsider his choice of two as appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   I have, on occasions, appeared in front of tribunals of two, both at the Divisional Court and Court of Appeal level. In most cases, since both judges were against me, the addition of a third person would have been academic.
<P>

<a name="40504-09_para1"></a>I, of course, agree with the noble and learned Lord about the desirability of a tribunal of three. The only reason that I suggested a tribunal of two was to try to help the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor on this issue. I understand that sometimes immigration and appeals tribunals sit as tribunals of two, with one legally qualified and one lay member. I know that one aspect of the Bill that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor will be bearing in mind is that of cost. I was trying to help him in coming to a view about what I regard as an extremely important matter by saying that it might, in certain circumstances, be acceptable to have a tribunal of two. I am trying to avoid a tribunal of one; but I, of course, accept that in an ideal world, the number is three.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I am very grateful for the welcome from all sides of the Committee for our proposals to amend Clause 14. I am also very grateful for the many constructive points that have been made. Although this is similar to a Second Reading debate in some respects, I think it is right that I should reply in detail, without taking too much time on the individual points made.
<P>

<a name="40504-09_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, asked why there was a difference between the legal qualifications required for the single-tier tribunal and that which was in place under the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. He rightly drew attention to the fact that the requirement for legal qualification was not there before, whereas it is now. However, the Bill provides that, for someone to be a member of the single-tier tribunal, the equivalent of seven years' legal qualification can also be sufficient. The reason is that we think in very many cases, contrary to what the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, suggests, some decisions made by the single-tier tribunal will be decided by a member of the tribunal sitting alone. We therefore think that the higher qualification level should be set.
<P>

<a name="40504-09_para3"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, also asked what is meant by an error of law for the purposes of the statutory review. It is the same as is meant by "error of law" in Section 101 of the 2002 Act&#151;not point of law, but error of law. That is the approach that is currently taken in relation to statutory review. It allows the statutory reviewers in effect to apply the same approach in determining whether there is a relevant error of law, as would be applied in relation to judicial review.
<P>

<a name="40504-09_para4"></a>I rather agree with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson of Lymington, that it would be unwise to try to be too precise in the definition. However, could it include lack of jurisdiction? Could <P>


<a name="column_1019"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1019</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>it include failing to apply the rules of natural justice? Could it include having no evidence at all on which the conclusion could have been reached? Yes, it plainly could&#151;all those factors would be regarded as errors of law. The distinction that we have sought to draw is that statutory review is based on a legal error, not simply an attempt to re-hear the facts again a second time. That distinction is well understood.
<P>

<a name="40504-09_para5"></a>On the five-day period, in the majority of cases, legal aid will have been available to the applicant in relation to the conclusion of the hearing before the single tier. That legal aid would include a determination of whether there were any grounds for appeal. Five days will mean five working days, so there will be a week within which lawyers can consider whether there has been an error that justifies an application for statutory review. We believe that that is sufficient, because there is specific provision in the amendment for extensions of time to be granted when it is not reasonably practicable to put in the notice.
<P>

<a name="40504-09_para6"></a>The five-day period begins when the appellant or applicant receives notice of the determination. I take the point about the post, but all such matters can be dealt with in the tribunal's discretion. We think that a short time limit is very important because these matters should be dealt with with reasonable expedition. In effect, it will be for the High Court or the filter to determine whether the five-day limit proves to be adequate, but we think that it will.
<P>

<a name="40504-09_para7"></a>Reconsideration by three members of the tribunal was mentioned by several of your Lordships. If statutory review is granted and remitted to be heard, who should hear it? Should it be heard by the same individual who heard it before, should it always be heard by a different tribunal, or should there always be more than one member on the rehearing tribunal? The answer will depend on the circumstances in each case.
<P>

<a name="40504-09_para8"></a>The president of the single tier has the power to direct whether there should be a reconsideration. If the statutory review indicates that a hearing should be by a different tribunal, then so be it. If he or she indicates that it should be heard by a tribunal sitting with more than one member then, almost invariably, the president of the tribunal will comply or follow that recommendation. If the president thinks that something else should happen, he can determine that. I do not think it would be right to say that it must be one or the other, such as, "It must always be a different tribunal" or, "There must always be three members". That would not be appropriate. It would not lead to the most just or expeditious result.
<P>

<a name="40504-09_para9"></a>What we are aiming for in relation to the costs regime is some appropriate measure that ensures that only meritorious cases get legal aid. If there is no win or no near-miss, then there is no fee. Who will determine whether that is the position? It will be determined by the person at the end of the process who sees all the material. In effect, it will not be the Legal Services Commission&#151;some body that is in some way related to the Government&#151;but independent judges who will determine where the line is to be drawn.
<P>


<a name="column_1020"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1020</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40504-09_para10"></a>I agree that we need to debate quite carefully how we define "near-miss". We are not that far apart in the House. The measure is intended to deal with those cases that have a sufficiently high degree of success to justify support being given. However, that support will be given at the end and I recognise that risks will be taken. Contrary to what the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said, I take the view that we may well need to consider success fees for those who are successful because there must be enough good lawyers in the field to ensure that every meritorious claim will receive representation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   Since the matter can go back to the tribunal for reconsideration only after a High Court judge has taken the view that he thinks&#151;or, if the provision is amended as we have suggested, that there is at least a good arguable case&#151;that there has been an error of law, is that not enough on its own to justify extending legal aid to the application when the case goes back to the tribunal for reconsideration?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I accept the implicit premise in the noble Lord's point. Plainly, in ordering reconsideration, the High Court is bound to be setting the test lower than one that it is bound to win and there must be some degree of arguability about it. However, that does not lead to the conclusion that the moment one gets past that point one immediately gets legal aid. It may often be apparent that, even though an error of law can be identified, if the facts are re-examined, the case still has little merit. I do not say for one moment that that would happen in every case. However, we could frequently be in possession of facts that broadly indicate that time has been wasted in relation to an application.
<P>

<a name="40504-09_para11"></a>I am not saying that that is the position in every case. However, an error of law could be identified because the wrong test was applied. If one knew from all the facts available that, even if the right test were applied, there would be little prospect of the application being granted, should public money be spent on that sort of claim? I believe that it should not.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-09_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   Is what the noble and learned Lord advocates totally unprecedented, or can he point to some example of the provision being applied?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-09_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   Several examples could be provided. The proposal was first put to the Government by the judges. It was their proposal because they were keen to ensure that there was a sufficient degree of filter on cases. The original example given was in relation to criminal appeals where the Court of Appeal Criminal Division makes decisions in relation to criminal legal aid. That is not a direct parallel because, although there are similarities, <P>


<a name="column_1021"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1021</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>it is not completely the same. However, whether the scheme works depends on the judgments that have been made to ensure that enough people are in the field. I believe that the judges would be right. Sufficient discretion will be given to ensure that the flow of legal aid is focused on the winning cases and on those cases that do not win but were sufficiently meritorious to justify consideration at another level.
<P>

<a name="40504-09_para12"></a>Amendment No. 58 relates to giving some tribunal decisions authoritative status&#151;that they would be binding on other tribunal decisions. That is a sensible and right approach. It allows certain decisions to be binding in other tribunals to ensure consistency in relation to practice in law. If there is an issue about whether the decision is right, either new facts could be presented or there could be an appeal to the Court of Appeal.
<P>

<a name="40504-09_para13"></a>I agree with all those who said that there should also be improvements to the way in which the original decisions are made. As noble Lords know, the Government are committed to much higher-quality asylum decisions at all stages. This is not the time to go through the list of provisions, but they include setting specific targets for decision quality, introducing quality assurance systems involving internal and external assessment, enhanced training and other such matters. We all accept the need for the highest possible decision-making at the IND stage. However, that is not a reason for not dealing with the appeal arrangements, or the relationships between the appeal arrangements and the High Court.
<P>

<a name="40504-09_para14"></a>My noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis mentioned the latest proposals. It is important to recognise that the Leggatt report did not propose a one-size-fits-all approach for asylum where there is incentive to delay. It is important to design a system for the needs of this particular jurisdiction. The arrangements that are now being put forward do precisely that.
<P>

<a name="40504-09_para15"></a>I have considered the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. He is concerned about the error of law, which I have dealt with. He believes that matters should always be dealt with by a different member of the single tier. I dealt with that by saying that everything will depend on the facts.
<P>

<a name="40504-09_para16"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Newcastle mentioned the five-day appeal period, "no win, no fee" and good decision-making, with which I have already dealt. He also mentioned written submissions. He asked whether the statutory reviewer should have the opportunity to order an oral hearing. That issue also has been discussed with the judiciary. The statutory review process currently does not involve that. We believe that the most effective system to balance justice and reasonable expedition is that which allows for cases to be dealt with on the papers. If further submissions are required they can be dealt with by the body to which the matter is remitted.
<P>

<a name="40504-09_para17"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, raised the issue of errors of law. I have already addressed that. I have also addressed the issue of <P>


<a name="column_1022"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1022</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>remission. He opposes the idea of Amendment No. 58, but I think that it is a good and sensible course. Consistency in these matters is quite important.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040504/text/40504-10.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   On the question of remission, it is clear that I took one view and the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, took another as to what was meant by reconsideration. Perhaps the noble and learned Lord would like to give us some assurance that that will be looked at with a view to making it quite clear that his flexible approach will be open.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I certainly agree to make sure that that is made clear in the most appropriate way&#151;which may be by including it in the rules rather than placing it on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40504-10_para0"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, raised the issue of the five-day time limit. I think I have addressed that issue. He also raised the issue of legal aid in Scotland. He is absolutely right that legal aid is a devolved matter. It is therefore not for your Lordships' House to determine what happens in relation to legal aid in Scotland. My understanding of the position of the Scottish Executive is that it would like as much as possible to follow the approach that England takes to legal aid and asylum cases, although, obviously, to do so consistently with the provisions of all their relevant legislation.
<P>

<a name="40504-10_para1"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, referred also to written submissions, reasons for remission, filter mechanisms and the authoritative decision of the tribunal. I think that I have dealt with each of those points. He made an additional point in noting that the amendments provide for only one remission. That is absolutely right. We believe that a balance has to be struck between ensuring that there is proper jurisdiction while not allowing an endless series of loops round and round the system.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Clashfern: </B>   I believe the amendment says that one application, not one remission, is allowed. However, the point is really the same. I can see the force of that, but the situation could change on a rehearing. I just wonder whether that is completely fair and whether it might not be wise at least to consider that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I will certainly consider it. However, I am sure that the noble and learned Lord can see the balance that we are seeking to strike by allowing only one application. He is right; I stand entirely corrected in that respect.
<P>

<a name="40504-10_para2"></a>In answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, our intention is not to say that a different time limit would apply in different parts of the United Kingdom. We recognise, however, that there is a very strong possibility that there could be certain categories of case where a different time limit might apply. The category we have in mind consists of cases where the applicants are detained, legal advice is effectively available to them round the clock and special fast-track procedures have been applied. The answer to the basic point is that we would not envisage different times for different parts of the country.
<P>

<P>

<a name="40504-10_para3"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, for his welcome for the proposals. I have dealt with his points on errors of law and transition. I hope that I have made it clear that I do not agree that every tribunal hearing should be conducted by three people. I do not believe that that provides the right degree of flexibility or is the right approach to the tribunal. I do not accept the implication that it would be good to have laymen sitting on the tribunal. I think that our proposal will make for a fair but expeditious arrangement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   I am astonished to hear the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor say that. The biggest single criticism of the way in which the system works at the moment is the unevenness of the adjudicator decision. If one has a single lawyer sitting at the tribunal level, all one is doing is replicating the adjudicator system.
<P>

<a name="40504-10_para4"></a>The fundamental issue in most of these cases is that of credibility, which is an issue of fact; in my submission, the noble and learned Lords needs at least two people in order to make the system secure. There is no appeal from the decision of this tribunal excepting on the basis of an error of law. The issue of credibility is not covered by that. I am astonished at the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor's reaction, and dismayed that he intends to continue with the adjudicator system in the disguise of a tribunal.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-10_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I have complete confidence that judges sitting alone, which will include those in the single tier, are well able to form judgments on facts.

<A NAME="40504-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall repeat a Statement made by my right honourable friend the Minister for the Armed Forces in another place earlier this afternoon. The Statement is as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<a name="40504-11_para3"></a>"I am grateful for this opportunity to speak to the House following the serious allegations that have been made in recent days about the conduct of some British soldiers in Iraq.
<P>

<a name="40504-11_para4"></a>"Any decent thinking person will have been disturbed by photographs published in the Daily Mirror on Saturday which appear to show the mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners by British soldiers.
<P>

<a name="40504-11_para5"></a>"From the outset, we have taken the allegations seriously and taken the photographs at face value and will continue to do so unless there is evidence to the contrary. The Special Investigation Branch of the Royal Military Police was immediately informed, and an investigation was launched.
<P>

<a name="40504-11_para6"></a>"The Royal Military Police Special Investigation Branch teams are currently following up lines of inquiry in Iraq, in the UK and in Cyprus, where the <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_1027"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1027</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>1st Battalion, the Queen's Lancashire Regiment, is currently based. Investigating officers are in touch with the Daily Mirror, to see what further information it has that might help get to the bottom of the incident. To date, the Daily Mirror has handed over a total of some 20 photographs.
<P>

<a name="40504-11_para7"></a>"It would be wrong for me to speculate about the outcome of this investigation, which must be allowed to take its course. As right honourable and honourable Members will be aware, it is not appropriate for Ministers to intervene with police investigations. I can assure the House, however, that if British soldiers are found to have acted unlawfully, then appropriate action will be taken. But our immediate priority is to establish the truth as quickly as possible. That is why I would urge individuals with relevant information to come forward. We are determined to leave no stone unturned.
<P>

<a name="40504-11_para8"></a>"The House will know that a number of other allegations have been made concerning the treatment of Iraqi prisoners and Iraqi civilians, some of which have resulted in fatalities. These are also serious matters which, where necessary, are being thoroughly investigated. There have been suggestions that such investigations are not being pursued properly or are unduly slow. This is unfair to investigating personnel. Many of these investigations require detailed work to be undertaken in difficult and often dangerous circumstances. They cannot and should not be rushed. I am confident that they are being carried out properly. It is my intention to release as much further detail on all of these incidents as possible, bearing in mind the rights of all those involved. It would be quite wrong to prejudice this process by applying undue pressure for haste or, indeed, to point the finger of guilt outside the due process of law.
<P>

<a name="40504-11_para9"></a>"The Daily Mirror article will have caused some people to question the integrity of British soldiers and the validity of their mission in Iraq. Thousands of service personnel have served in Iraq over the past 14 months. They have done an exceptional job in testing circumstances, and in turn have secured the support of the majority of Iraqis. I hope that right honourable and honourable Members will join me in paying tribute to the superb work that our Armed Forces are doing both in Iraq and elsewhere around the world. While treating these allegations with full seriousness, we should not allow them to colour our judgment of the quality or integrity of our troops, or of the Army as a whole.
<P>

<a name="40504-11_para10"></a>"Very grave allegations have been made. They challenge the reputation of the British Army here, in Iraq and elsewhere. We must ascertain the truth or otherwise. At best such allegations undermine the excellent work that our Armed Forces are doing under the most difficult conditions today in Iraq. They undermine the progress that we have made with our coalition partners in moving Iraq forward from the tyranny that the Iraqi people suffered under Saddam Hussein. Our forces serve with distinction throughout the world, whether in Iraq, Afghanistan, Sierra Leone, the Balkans, Northern <P>

<a name="40504-11_para11"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for repeating the Statement. The allegations in the Daily Mirror are extremely serious. This is a public relations catastrophe. The damage caused by the photographs continues to do untold damage to the coalition's image and will put the lives of British soldiers serving in Iraq at even greater risk.
<P>

<a name="40504-11_para12"></a>These allegations must, of course, be thoroughly and very swiftly investigated, but they are the more shocking because of the outstanding reputation of the British Armed Forces not only for their remarkable war fighting capabilities but also for their abiding humanity and decency in peacekeeping operations. I have no hesitation in joining Her Majesty's Government in paying tribute to the superb work that our Armed Forces are doing in Iraq and elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="40504-11_para13"></a>A very great deal is expected of our soldiers. They are required, sometimes, to deploy on operations that are extremely dangerous, to obey orders which may put their lives at risk, and to live and work for long periods under the most challenging conditions.
<P>

<a name="40504-11_para14"></a>This House, the country and the media need to understand that military service is like no other in the demands that it places on individuals. Soldiers exist to engage in war, and war places unique demands on them. They overcome these challenges only if morale, discipline and training are of the highest order. From every soldier is demanded exceptional levels of commitment, self-sacrifice and mutual trust. We therefore support the most vigorous and detailed investigations to restore the good name of the British Army.
<P>

<a name="40504-11_para15"></a>I should be grateful if the Minister could clarify the following. What representation has his department received from Bertrand Ramcharan, the acting United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, regarding the alleged abuses of Iraqi prisoners by British forces in Iraq? Has his department's investigation been able to confirm the authenticity of the photographs published by the Daily Mirror? Military analysts have expressed reservations. They do look very contrived, as does the timing of these allegations straight after reports of American ill-treatment of prisoners. Indeed, there is speculation that these images may be a dangerous hoax.
<P>

<a name="40504-11_para16"></a>When were the specific incidents alleged to have taken place? How many alleged incidents of the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by British soldiers were reported to senior officers at that time? Finally, is the Minister satisfied with the training given to our troops for the handling of detainees prior to deployment and when they are in theatre?
<P>

<a name="40504-11_para17"></a>The allegations centre around the Queen's Lancashire Regiment. This regiment is over 300 years old and carries more battle honours on its regimental <P>


<a name="column_1029"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>colours than any other infantry regiment of the line. In the recent campaign in Iraq its commanding officer was awarded the DSO. The RSM was awarded the Military Cross and the regiment received several distinctions. If wrong has been done, then clearly it must immediately be dealt with. But let this House and the wider country keep in perspective 300 years of the most loyal and distinguished service to the Crown and the nation.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Redesdale: </B>   My Lords, I, too, wish to thank the Minister for repeating the Statement. It is important that the veracity of the photographs is ascertained. However, the damage has already been done in publishing the photographs. They have been flashed round the world and the smear on the British Army's reputation&#151;a reputation so hard won&#151;has already occurred in the minds of many. In that respect the photographs have lost some of the hearts and minds that have been won over.
<P>

<a name="40504-11_para18"></a>Although I speak only in my own right, I question the veracity of the photographs. The American photographs were taken as trophy photographs. The American soldiers were not scared to show their faces. Those photographs were taken to show those American soldiers committing horrendous acts. However, the soldiers in the photographs that we are discussing, despite the question marks regarding their uniforms, were photographed in such a pose that their identity was hidden, which is slightly strange. Many trophy photographs are taken by soldiers in the field, for example, in Basra, although obviously not in such a situation as the one that we are discussing. However, that is a question that has to be answered.
<P>

<a name="40504-11_para19"></a>I refer to the pristine state of the uniforms in the photographs. Having served in such uniform, I know that it is incredibly difficult to keep it in such a pristine state. Anyone who had been involved in the activity in which it was alleged the British soldiers in the photographs had been involved could not have kept the uniform in such a pressed state.
<P>

<a name="40504-11_para20"></a>The work of British soldiers abroad is of the highest standard. However, the MoD stated recently that the European Convention on Human Rights does not apply to soldiers in Iraq. Can that really be the case, and should it be the case, especially after the questions being asked about other outstanding cases, which I shall not raise today but which are obviously being processed under the due process of law? As the UK has signed up to the European Convention on Human Rights, is it not the case, as many courts believe, that the agents of the state are bound by the rules of the convention wherever they act for the state?
<P>

<a name="40504-11_para21"></a>However these photographs are to be viewed, they have made the work of British soldiers in southern Iraq even more dangerous than it was previously. Noble Lords on these Benches support that work which is necessary. We hope very much that the consequences of the publication of these photographs will not be the loss of British life.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, I am very grateful to both noble Lords for their support. There is very little with which I could disagree in what they said, and the House would feel the same way. I told noble Lords that I was briefly in Iraq last week and in Basra last Wednesday. Like everyone else who has been there, including many Members of this House and the other place, I was immensely and immediately impressed by the conduct of the British troops whom I came across. They have an incredibly difficult task and, from what I saw, perform it with skill, humour and understanding, and are indeed a credit to this country.
<P>

<a name="40504-11_para22"></a>I shall come to the questions in a moment, but I shall make a point that both noble Lords made without stating it obviously. The matter is serious either way. If the allegation made in the Daily Mirror is proved, it speaks for itself how serious that is for the reputation that the British Armed Forces enjoy&#151;rightly, in my view. Of course I shall not comment on whether the photographs are authentic, but if it turns out that they are not, that is pretty serious for all kinds of reasons, not least that it will potentially have put British lives at risk.
<P>

<a name="40504-11_para23"></a>I am not aware of any representations made from the relevant United Nations official, but I shall check that out for the noble Lord and let him know. I stress that the authenticity is absolutely a matter for the Special Investigations Branch, which along with others is looking into the issue at present.
<P>

<a name="40504-11_para24"></a>I reassure the noble Lord and the House that all in the Armed Forces are given thorough mandatory training courses, which include specific guidance on handling prisoners of war. All personnel must attend refresher training every year. The House will not be surprised to hear that, before going to Iraq, all personnel are briefed on the rules of engagement and on procedures for dealing with prisoners of war and other detainees. It may not be so widely known that each combat unit is required to have eight senior non-commissioned officers trained in handling prisoners of war. Units responsible for the routine handling of detainees conduct further specialist training.
<P>

<a name="40504-11_para25"></a>I was delighted by what the noble Lord, Lord Astor, said about the Queen's Lancashire Regiment. Indeed, it has a very proud history, as was well said in this House and earlier this afternoon in another place.
<P>

<a name="40504-11_para26"></a>I hear with interest the view of the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, on authenticity. He will forgive me if I do not comment on it; he would not expect me to. The Ministry of Defence has given some attention to human rights legislation. It is our belief that, strictly speaking in law, it does not apply in Iraq. Whether it does or not may one day be tested. The important point to make is that the Armed Forces are fully aware of their obligations under international law, and training in the Geneva Convention is given to soldiers. The suggestion made in some quarters that our troops are not subject to the rule of law is not true; CPA order 17 sets out the jurisdiction that applies to the personnel of the multinational force and others. UK personnel are subject to UK law, as they would be in the United Kingdom.

<A NAME="40504-11_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, would the Minister agree that the editor of the Daily Mirror must be either the stupidest or the most avaricious man alive to have published the photographs in question, whether they be real or fake? Will he tell me whether the soldiers who are alleged to have taken the photographs were paid? Bearing in mind the damage that the editor may have inflicted on allied captives in future, will the Minister tell me whether the law permits him to be charged with an offence?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, I understand the strong feelings expressed in those questions, but I am afraid that I am not able to make any comment on them from the Dispatch Box. We very much hope that the Daily Mirror will give the investigators the fullest co-operation. Indeed, the leader in that newspaper last Saturday stated that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"for the sake of the British Army's reputation and the integrity of every decent member of our forces, those who carried out this and other savage acts must be court-martialled".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-12_para0"></a>
Those are sentiments that we can all understand. However, the newspaper claims to know the identity of one of the attackers and says that he and a colleague provided the photographs. That information has been the basis for the allegations on which the noble Baroness commented.
<P>

<a name="40504-12_para1"></a>Nevertheless, the Mirror appears intent on protecting the identities of its informants because the soldiers fear reprisals by the Army. That is not a concept that I understand very clearly in this context, or at all. I have every confidence, as I suspect that the House will, that anyone who has relevant information will be treated fairly and lawfully, and that his or her rights will be fully respected. We hope that the Mirror will reconsider its position on that matter and assist the investigating authorities in getting to the bottom of the allegations as quickly as possible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-12_spnew1"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Oxford: </B>   My Lords, those of us who served in Her Majesty's Armed Forces, have had contact with them over the years and know the very high standards inculcated&#151;standards that we have experienced ourselves&#151;find the allegations extremely difficult to believe. Nevertheless, we live in a very wicked world and, as my friend, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Worcester, reminded me, war brutalises. I very much welcome the Government's Statement that our immediate priority is to establish the truth as quickly as possible.
<P>

<a name="40504-12_para2"></a>If, as I very much hope, the allegations are discovered to be unfounded, will Her Majesty's Government think seriously about what can be done to rehabilitate the reputation of the regiment concerned? If, very sadly, they are discovered to be well founded, will there be wider lessons to learn from them? It will not be enough simply <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the right reverend Prelate for what he said; no one could disagree with his comments. However, he will understand that I am not really in a position to answer his questions. If the allegations are proved, that will be a serious matter that of course goes beyond the regiment in question.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wright of Richmond: </B>   My Lords, as one who has been very critical from the beginning of our decision to go to war in Iraq, I nevertheless endorse very warmly the tributes paid to the performance of our troops. I am afraid that the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, is right in saying that, whether the photographs are proved to be fakes or genuine, the damage has been done&#151;very serious damage in the Middle East. I was originally going to ask precisely the question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Trumpington. The House should be told whether the Daily Mirror paid for the photographs.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, who has vast experience in the Middle East. I was in Jordan before going to Iraq last week and learnt a lot. I dare say that if I had been there after the photographs had been shown, I would have learnt a lot more. The question of whether the Daily Mirror paid money to whoever provided it with the photographs is of equal fascination to me, but I am not in a position to be able to answer it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-12_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, has it been drawn to my noble friend's attention that the wording used on the front page of this morning's Daily Mirror and the wording used in several BBC programmes over the weekend made it clear that in the eyes of the people responsible for those programmes the charges have already been proved? It is not a scandal that language of that sort should be used and will my noble friend make representations to the chairman of the BBC and the editor of the Daily Mirror to that effect? Will he tell us what response he receives?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-12_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, it was for precisely that reason that I said at the end of my reply to my fellow Front Benchers opposite that we all need to approach this matter with considerable caution and care&#151;and perhaps that includes particularly the press and the media. Of course I have seen the Daily Mirror headline today. I have not had the pleasure of listening to what the BBC has said about the matter today, although I listened to it over the weekend. What I can say to my noble friend is that I will take back his request and see what can be done.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-12_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister clarify matters regarding prisoners of war? In the articles in the Daily Mirror it was alleged that the individuals who had been ill-treated had been arrested on ordinary <P>


<a name="column_1033"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1033</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>criminal charges and that they were not handed over to the Iraqi police because they knew that they would immediately be released. Can the noble Lord say what instructions have been given to the forces about people who have been arrested since the cessation of hostilities, who, presumably, he would not classify as prisoners of war?
<P>

<a name="40504-12_para3"></a>Does the Minister not think that, irrespective of the outcome of the investigations that are now being conducted, there should be some independent authority to which Iraqi civilians could complain when there are allegations of ill-treatment by coalition forces? Will the Minister reply to the suggestion that I made on 20 April, before this matter blew up, that we should consult our allies on the possibility of inviting an independent authority, appointed under Article 90 of Protocol 1 of the Geneva Conventions, to go to Iraq and conduct an independent international investigation of any allegations that have been made against either the British or the American coalition forces?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-12_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure that I did use the expression "prisoners of war".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-12_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   The noble Lord did, my Lords.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-12_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, if I did then I accept what the noble Lord is saying&#151;that we are not talking just about prisoners of war but about Iraqi citizens who are in the custody of the coalition forces. I understand that. Regarding all of the questions and points raised by the noble Lord as to how we might progress, I shall take them back with me and give him an answer. All of those matters are now of distinct relevance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-12_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, strictly speaking these are not prisoners of war because they can be referred to as such only if there has been a formal declaration of war between states. In such cases there is a protecting power, a neutral power who has access to the prisoners and where they are detained. That cannot be so in this case. All that can happen is, as was suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that there should be appointed&#151;and appointed soon&#151;an independent power that will have the same access as a protecting power under the Geneva Conventions. That is the only way that one can cope with a situation where there are armed hostilities between those seeking to occupy and pursue peace-keeping duties and the others seeking to oppose them by arms. There must be some diplomatic effort soon to establish an independent person, body, state or arbitrator.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-12_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, I am advised that we are entitled to arrest and hold people who are, in our view, a serious security threat. Internees are told of their right to have their status reviewed. An independent military body reviews the status of internees after 28 days. UK forces in turn inform the ICRC, which informs families, and a list of internees is held by the local police. As I have said, there is considerable <P>


<a name="column_1034"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>training of the Armed Forces regarding their obligations under international law, not least the Geneva Conventions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-12_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Swynnerton: </B>   My Lords, during the Second World War the Daily Mirror published a cartoon drawn by the caricaturist "Zec" showing a sailor dying on an oil ship. The Prime Minister, Churchill, summoned the general manager and the editor of the Daily Mirror, Mr Cecil Thomas, who happened to be my uncle, and told them that if that sort of thing occurred again the Daily Mirror would be closed down. Can the Minister say whether, even with the present uncertain, illegal or undefined war, any consideration has been given to the possibility of some kind of censorship?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-12_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, my understanding is that the answer to that question is "no". That is certainly true of the prospect of closing down the Daily Mirror or any similar newspaper. That would be a brave, indeed foolish, course for any Government even to consider. I have to say that however difficult we may find this&#151;which we all do; and I find it difficult to stand here and understand why the articles appeared when they did&#151;we have to recognise that what we and our troops in Iraq and elsewhere in the world stand for is a press that says things that we do not always like.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-12_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Campbell-Savours: </B>   My Lords, can we be assured that International Committee of the Red Cross personnel have total and unrestricted access at all times to all prisoners at the Basra detention centre? Can we impress upon our American coalition allies that they should allow precisely the same level of access to the ICRC at the Abu Graib prison in Baghdad?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, the UK currently holds about 80 security internees in southern Iraq. Of course we have no interest in holding anyone unless they pose a serious threat to security. The noble Lord will know that the right to hold such people derives from the 4th Geneva Convention and, as I have tried to say this afternoon, we take our responsibilities very seriously under that convention. I am happy to be able to tell the noble Lord that the International Committee of the Red Cross has full and unrestricted access at the detention facilities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Campbell-Savours: </B>   My Lords, is that at all times and to all prisoners?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, "full and unrestricted access" is the phrase that I have here. Whenever the ICRC asks for it, it has that access. Those are the words that I use. I would remind all noble Lords that the reason why we have to hold people at all is because our forces are so often in danger of lethal, deadly attacks. It is right and proper that we arrest those who pose such a threat. It is equally right that we allow the full access that we do.

<P>
<A NAME="40504-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   My Lords, returning to the question asked by my noble friend Lady Trumpington, I wish to ask the Minister three questions which I think that he can answer without prejudicing the outcome of this inquiry. First, in view of the obvious sensitivity of the photographs, what information, if any, was given by the Daily Mirror to the Government of its intention to publish the photographs beforehand? Secondly, what attempts have been made by the Government to obtain from the Daily Mirror the evidence on which it bases its claim of the accuracy of the photographs? Thirdly, what has been the Daily Mirror's reply?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-13_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, I can certainly attempt to answer all three of the questions put by the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle. First, as I understand it, the Daily Mirror informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of the photographs before they were published, but not very long before. The noble Lord will recall they were published in Saturday morning's edition of the newspaper. I understand that it was some time on Friday afternoon, the day before, that we were first informed. If I am wrong about that, then of course I will let him and the House know in the usual way.
<P>

<a name="40504-13_para0"></a>Secondly, as to the investigation taking place, I think I have already said that the Special Investigation Branch of the Royal Military Police, is "in touch"&#151;the expression I used&#151;with the Daily Mirror, and I have already expressed our hope that the newspaper will give the fullest co-operation. As to the third question, I am afraid that it is too early to be able to tell the House whether it has given the fullest co-operation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-13_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   My Lords, would my noble friend accept that many of us were deeply impressed by his words when he said that the outcome of this issue either way would be a grave and serious matter? Does he agree that ultimately stability, peace and the future of Iraq depend upon the battle for hearts and minds, and that therefore, in any security operations, only the highest exemplary standards are acceptable? Does he further agree that the message that should go out from this House today is: first, that we have nothing but unqualified respect and admiration for all those in the armed services who are determined at all times that the highest standards will be maintained; and, secondly, that anything of the kind alleged ever happening within the British services simply will not be tolerated?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-13_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, I can agree with what my noble friend says. The "highest exemplary standards", to use his expression, is exactly what we expect and look for from our British Armed Forces, and that is what we receive. Of course, it would be a sad blow if these allegations were proved to be correct.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-13_spnew7"></A><B> Lord King of Bridgwater: </B>   My Lords, in endorsing the warm tributes that have been paid to the general conduct of British forces in Basra and in Iraq in recent times, is not the least of their achievements that they seem to have opened up the opportunity for freedom <P>


<a name="column_1036"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1036</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the press in Iraq, something quite unknown under Saddam Hussein? Each one of the editors of those media organisations that are now able to communicate in Iraq will learn that with such freedom comes responsibility as well. In this exceptionally dangerous and volatile situation, that responsibility clearly rests also with the editor of the Daily Mirror, to ensure that whatever information can help to reach the truth of this matter is made available, not just after prolonged legal proceedings or prolonged applications by the Government but immediately to those responsible for this investigation. The fact of these revelations has undoubtedly made the life of other British troops in that region and elsewhere more dangerous, and the editor of the Daily Mirror now has a duty to give every co-operation to that investigation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-13_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord speaks with huge experience on these matters. I agree with every word he said.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-13_spnew9"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that atrocity in war is as old as war itself? We have no reason for believing that sin is more original in this century than in others, though the means of publicising it are more ready to hand. Does he also agree that one of the things that distinguishes the great armies from the good ones is expedition and authority in dealing with this sort of thing, and that therefore, should these charges turn out to be proved, reprimands would be insufficient? Does the Minister further agree that when General Sir Michael Jackson said that anyone found guilty of such action is unfit to wear the Queen's uniform he was looking in the right direction?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-13_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   My Lords, again I agree exactly with what the noble Earl has said. The British Armed Forces have the respect of the world, and if these matters are proved they will be dealt with extremely seriously.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-13_spnew11"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel </B>   moved Amendment No. 1:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 1, insert the following new clause&#151; 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-13_para6"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "Qualifications for Commissioner
<br>
(1) The Commissioner shall have had ten years practice as either&#151;
<br>
(a) a residential social worker;
<br>
(b) a child psychotherapist;
<br>
(c) a health visitor;
<br>
(d) a youth worker; or
<br>
(e) a child care worker;
<br>
or equivalent professional practice in direct work with children.
<br>
(2) The Commissioner shall have had experience of professional practice in direct work with children not less than one year prior to his appointment."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40504-13_para7"></a>The noble Earl said: The purpose of this amendment is to probe the Government on the qualification and selection of the Children's Commissioner. It has been my concern, and that of some social workers I have spoken with, as well as the Royal College of Nursing, that the commissioner should have some substantial first-hand experience of professional work directly with children. This is the assurance I am seeking from the Government in this particular amendment. 
<P>

<a name="40504-13_para8"></a>I also feel it important that the commissioner has this experience of being part of the childcare workforce, broadly speaking, over many years, and that that experience is relatively current, because we recognise&#151;and the Government most definitely recognise&#151;that it is in the area of the childcare workforce that we have so much to do to improve outcomes for children. Perhaps this is the point to say that, when we think about children, it is good to have the focus on children; but we must recognise that most children exist within a family, or within a caring context, where they are more or less dependent and it is essential that the carers are well-supported. Regrettably, this has not been the case so often in the past.
<P>

<a name="40504-13_para9"></a>I am very glad, if I may say so, that my noble friends Lord Northbourne and Lady Howe, among other Peers, have put down amendments to the Bill concerning the inclusion of parents and families. In previous and recent discussions, the noble Baroness has implied&#151;and I hope I am not misquoting her&#151;that she regrets the fact that parents were not included more in the deliberations and consultation on this Bill, and that this is a matter she is now seeking to address.
<P>

<a name="40504-13_para10"></a>We are short of 6,000 foster carers in England. They have not been supported in the past as they should have been. Until recently, 80 per cent of residential workers had no relevant qualification for working with perhaps the most vulnerable children in our society. In the secure estate only last week, a 15 year-old boy was killed following control and restraint intervention at the Rainsbrook secure unit. There are steps forward within the secure estate and I do welcome them, but if we compare our practice in this country with that followed on the Continent we see that in most cases such a boy would not be placed in a prison in the first place, and might well find himself in a children's home where most of the practitioners would have three years' relevant qualification and training to work with such troubled young people.
<P>


<a name="column_1038"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1038</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40504-13_para11"></a>When I listened to the response of the noble Lord, Lord Bassam of Brighton, in the Chamber last week to a Question on the boy's death, he said the officers working at that establishment are licensed. I thought he meant that they are licensed in childcare, but what he was actually saying was that they are licensed in the application of restraint on children. That, of course, is very important. However, prison officers dealing with 16 and 17 year-olds can be trained for nine weeks. They may then do two or three days' further training, after which the only mandatory training is in control and restraint: yet they can work with these vulnerable children. I understand that the training at Rainsbrook is similar. These examples illustrate the huge mountain we must climb as regards the childcare workforce and its neglect. There should be an assurance that whoever is charged with the post has real experience in the subject.
<P>

<a name="40504-13_para12"></a>Perhaps I may give an example of someone who exemplifies that experience. I refer to Peter Wilson, recently retired, who for the past 10 years nurtured the YoungMinds charity dealing with the mental health of children. He trained and practised for many years as a child psychotherapist and his wife is a psychotherapist. He is totally imbued in the work. I have taken his invaluable advice on many occasions and he has instructed me on how to prioritise and choose the most important project where the interests of children are most in danger.
<P>

<a name="40504-13_para13"></a>The commissioner needs to have that kind of experience in order to select from a range of projects presented to him those which are the most important for children. I look forward to the Minister's response and I beg to move.
<P>

<a name="40504-13_time1"></a><H5>6 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-13_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   I rise to speak to Amendments Nos. 2 to 7. Amendment No. 2 seeks to involve children in the appointment of the commissioner. If the commissioner is to be someone who feels sympathetic towards children, who they will feel confident to speak to in confidence, who is able to speak to them and be understood, who uses their language and yet has credibility in their sight, children must be involved in his appointment. Experiments have been carried out by various organisations involved with children in the selection of professionals. For instance, many teachers have been appointed with the involvement of children. The NSPCC, in which I express an interest as parliamentary ambassador, has often used children to assist it in the appointment of staff. The children take the task extremely seriously and often show maturity beyond their years. Their input can be extremely valuable because sometimes they can be more perceptive than adults in getting beneath the surface that we all show at interview.
<P>

<a name="40504-13_para14"></a>Amendments Nos. 3 to 7 relate to the appointment and terms and conditions of the commissioner. The Bill proposes that the children's commissioner is to be appointed and discharged by the Minister of State; that he will report to the Secretary of State rather than to Parliament; and that he will have his subject set by the Secretary of State. Concern has been raised that being <P>


<a name="column_1039"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1039</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>answerable to Ministers will affect the independence of the children's commissioner. The Minister will know that the independence of the commissioner exercises many noble Lords.
<P>

<a name="40504-13_para15"></a>Perhaps I may quote from the ninth report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"existing arrangements are insufficiently independent from Government to ensure that the rights and interests of all children in England are fully protected . . .  independence is the key value that a Children's Commissioner would add to existing mechanisms . . .  We favour [a commissioner] independent from but working closely with central government and other agencies".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-13_para16"></a><P>

<a name="40504-13_para17"></a>The Government may contend, and the Minister may be about to tell us, that the Nolan principles address this concern. However, these amendments have been tabled with the aim of probing whether there is an alternative model of selection which would retain parliamentary accountability but increase independence from the Executive.
<P>

<a name="40504-13_para18"></a>I do not propose to go into a great deal of detail about how the model might work in practice because these are probing amendments. Briefly, Amendment No. 3 proposes that the children's commissioner will be appointed not by the Secretary of State but by Her Majesty on the nomination of Parliament. Amendment No. 4 proposes that Parliament will set the terms and conditions of the commissioner. Amendment No. 5 proposes that if he resigns, he must do so in writing to Her Majesty. Amendment No. 6 proposes that he would not be removed from office by the Secretary of State but by Her Majesty after addresses from both Houses of Parliament. That would ensure that he could be dismissed only with parliamentary approval. Of course, although I have said "he", I mean "he or she".
<P>

<a name="40504-13_para19"></a>Amendment No. 7 would mean that the Secretary of State would not control remuneration and funding. It would be done by Parliament to such an extent as may be sanctioned by the Treasury. Therefore, the system of funding would also be independent from direct ministerial control.
<P>

<a name="40504-13_para20"></a>We have not just invented this model; it is drawn from other successful models of appointment used, for example, for the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, the National Audit Office and the Commissioner for Children and Young People in Scotland. The Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration is appointed by the Crown under Letters Patent on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Scottish Commissioner is appointed by the Crown on the nomination of Parliament.
<P>

<a name="40504-13_para21"></a>The method by which Parliament would select the Children's Commissioner could be as follows, based on the National Audit Office model. That is the purest example of parliamentary accountability almost fully separated from the Executive. The chief executive of the NAO is appointed by a resolution of the Commons on a Motion which must be moved jointly by the Prime Minister and the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. The chief executive is answerable to a non-statutory board&#151;the Public Accounts Commission. <P>


<a name="column_1040"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1040</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>This comprises the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, the Leader of the House of Commons and seven Back-Benchers appointed by the House.
<P>

<a name="40504-13_para22"></a>Therefore, a model such as this&#151;I do not intend to be too prescriptive&#151;would ensure that the appointment and the terms and conditions of the commissioner would be as independent as possible from the Executive. I hope that the amendments receive a fair wind from the Minister.

<A NAME="40504-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   In supporting Amendment No. 2 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, and others, I must first declare an interest as president of the Royal Mencap Society. Furthermore, I am not certain that the amendment as currently drafted goes quite far enough. Amendment No. 2 suggests that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State must take reasonable steps to involve&#151;(a) children".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-14_para0"></a>
I would have liked that to have read,

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"(a) all groups of children, including those with disabilities".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-14_para1"></a><P>

<a name="40504-14_para2"></a>Later in Schedule 1, the appointment of staff is dwelt upon. Can the Minister assure the House that there will be effective equality and disability training before such staff are allotted their various tasks?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-14_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   I support Amendment No. 2 in particular. It is important that children are involved in what is, after all, their Bill. They should be involved in every aspect of it and certainly in the selection of the English commissioner.
<P>

<a name="40504-14_para3"></a>Many years ago, when working for the principal of the Architectural Association School of Architecture, I discovered that students were part of the governing body and that they took part in selecting the principal of the school. In those days, that was an unusual occurrence.
<P>

<a name="40504-14_para4"></a>Over time, there has been much more involvement of the individuals concerned with an organisation in the selection of people appointed to it. However, from the point of view of independence and its verification and the crucial need to involve children from an early age in citizenship issues, I support the amendments and that one in particular.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-14_spnew2"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Manchester: </B>   I add my voice to those who have supported the idea of children being involved in the appointment of the commissioner. However, I am aware of the difficulties and nuances which exist in appointment to any office. What do the Government have in mind in terms of guidance and training for the children who are to undertake the task?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   While I understand some of the enthusiasms of noble Lords who have spoken to the amendments, I hope that the Minister will take into account the extraordinary range of ability&#151;mental and other&#151;and the general capacity of children to make responsible choices in such matters. We do not want to be carried away by great currents of enthusiasm; we need to consider the matter coolly and objectively.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   I agree with those who have spoken about the importance of consulting children, <P>


<a name="column_1041"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1041</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>although we must not get the matter out of proportion. However, if the Government were to accept the amendment it seems to me odd that the only people to be consulted would be, on the one hand, children, and on the other, organisations; not, for example, any individual or parents who have parental responsibility and therefore frontline knowledge in relation to the child.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-14_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   I apologise for being a few minutes late and therefore having to gather where I am in the debate and which clauses are being addressed. Perhaps someone will put me right if I find myself in the wrong place.
<P>

<a name="40504-14_para5"></a>I have some concerns about the suggested amendment in relation to the appointment of the commissioner, possibly by Her Majesty the Queen. One of the things that has always concerned me about the existing commissioners and the present suggestions is the accountability of commissioners. I have not been able to work out to whom the Welsh commissioner is accountable. I have always thought that it might be more appropriate that commissioners worked to perhaps a non-departmental public body or a board of some kind.
<P>

<a name="40504-14_para6"></a>I have concerns about placing so much emphasis&#151;and faith, if you like&#151;in one individual. I have had experience recently&#151;and much in the past&#151;where people appointed to very senior positions have not always turned out to be what one expected. Therefore I believe that the accountability needs to be to the Secretary of State, which may be unpopular with some of my voluntary colleagues. Such accountability will ensure that, should there be difficulties, that person can quickly be held to account; whereas in other circumstances if it comes through a parliamentary discussion, if the matter has to come back to Parliament twice as the amendment appears to imply&#151;I may have misunderstood&#151;it could take a length of time that could bring the institution into disrepute.
<P>

<a name="40504-14_para7"></a>I have seen another organisation where that happened; where the whole organisation was brought into disrepute. While I am on my feet I add that I hope we will find a proper way of consulting children and young people. Can we also say "young people"? Adolescents perpetually find themselves out of the loop, not receiving the general concern and emphasis, and on the whole they do not like to be called children; they like to be called young people. On the whole we are likely to be consulting young people rather than small children, because they are likely to be able to make an assessment and take part in such an appointment system.
<P>

<a name="40504-14_para8"></a>I am sure that we will find a way in which that can happen properly and proportionately, but I have reservations about accountability.

<a name="40504-14_para9"></a>I want to make a more general point. The creation of a Children's Commissioner is a welcome move, for which people have lobbied for a long time. It is the second time in my brief career in your Lordships' House that I have been involved in such a situation. The previous time was over the formation of the General Teaching Council, for which I drew the long or short straw&#151;depending on one's point of view&#151;as the inaugural chair.
<P>

<a name="40504-14_para10"></a>I chaired that organisation for two years and discovered the hard way that if one does not get the detail right in the creation of an organisation, no matter how welcome and acclaimed it might be, it can create impossible problems later. The General Teaching Council has suffered immeasurably from the poor legislation that was allowed to slip through the House six years ago. I shall be on my feet frequently during the next couple of sittings of the Committee to make that point. There are a number of ways in which this legislation could be improved. I welcome it enormously and I hope that I do not make a nuisance of myself. I am extremely keen that the same mistakes are not made twice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-14_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </B>   Like other noble Lords who have spoken I welcome the creation of a commissioner for England and the extension of the concept of the Children's Commissioner. As noble Lords are aware, a Children's Commissioner has already been in place in Wales for some time, so there is an experience to be drawn on. It is based on that that I wish to support Amendments Nos. 3 to 7, to ensure that the England/UK commissioner functions beyond the political arena and to make the commissioner as independent as possible.
<P>

<a name="40504-14_para11"></a>The experience in Wales has demonstrated that the Children's Commissioner needs to be independent. He has challenged the Assembly over its implementation of the Assembly's strategy on child and adolescent mental health. Such strategies are by their nature in large part political because they are often driven by the political background behind their development. The challenge laid was informed by the views of children and young people. That kind of challenge impacts on local and central government and on other agencies for the benefit of children. It is only with independence that such a challenge can be placed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-14_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   May I chime in at this point with an apology for arriving three minutes late and missing the introduction to the debate by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel? I feel a passionate enthusiasm for giving the commissioner security of tenure. By all means let him be responsible or answerable to a Secretary of State or whomever, but let him not be dismissible thereby under any ordinary procedure.
<P>

<a name="40504-14_para12"></a>I have sadly just come from the memorial service for the late Stephen Tumin, who was a great example of what a thorn in the flesh of officialdom an official in such a position can be. Were he not protected by statute I suspect that the commissioner would not long survive confrontation with a government with whom <P>


<a name="column_1043"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1043</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>he disagreed about some fundamental right of children. Therefore I am in support of the principle behind the amendments that give him such security.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-14_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Prys-Davies: </B>   I support the principle of Amendment No. 2. To the best of my knowledge it is not without precedent. Children were involved in the appointment of the Welsh commissioner&#151;no doubt my noble friend can consult with the commissioner for Wales. I believe that the amendment should be supported.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-14_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   This has already been an interesting debate that has ranged across a number of issues that will be tackled in greater depth as we proceed through the Committee stage. The group of amendments is about the appointment of the Children's Commissioner. Amendment No. 1, as the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, so ably set out, specifies the particular experience the commissioner should have. Amendment No. 2, supported across the Committee, will provide for the involvement of children and young people and children's organisations in the appointment of the commissioner. Amendments Nos. 3 to 7, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, and the noble Lord, Lord Lester, will provide for the commissioner to be appointed by and accountable to Parliament rather than to the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="40504-14_para13"></a>I have a great deal of sympathy with the underlying thrust of Amendment No. 1. I believe that the noble Earl is looking for a commissioner who has a real feel for, and understanding of, the position of children and young people&#151;indeed, the noble Earl and I discussed this point earlier today&#151;including, I surmise, those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds; hence, the list that appears in the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40504-14_para14"></a>In principle, I support the idea that the commissioner must win the confidence of young people and children in many different circumstances and convince them that he or she is able to reflect fairly their views and to work on their behalf. For me, the watchword in relation to the individual and the office is "confidence". That means that the officeholder must have a certain set of skills, but I am not convinced that a list of professional skills is required&#151;hence, I do not support the amendment. I have met charismatic psychotherapists, social workers, youth workers and many others who work with children, and I have met many other people who I believe understand how to talk to children who have different knowledge, who come from different backgrounds and who react to adults very differently.
<P>

<a name="40504-14_para15"></a>Therefore, the premise upon which we wish to appoint the commissioner is that that individual will have the ability to win the confidence of children and will know how to listen to them and when to seek advice on how to listen to them and will ensure that children's views, ideas and best interests are taken to the heart of the work of the office. On that basis, and with an assurance that we shall be seeking credibility and approachability together with experience, I hope that the noble Earl will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
<P>


<a name="column_1044"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1044</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40504-14_para16"></a>As for the appointment process, which is raised in Amendment No. 2, it is nice to be able to say "yes". I can confirm to the noble Lord, Lord Rix, and others who are concerned about this issue that it is our intention to involve all children and young people directly in the appointment of the commissioner. That point was made to us by children and young people during the consultation process. The selection process will be in keeping with the code of practice of the Commissioner for Public Appointments.
<P>

<a name="40504-14_para17"></a>We shall also be looking to address the point made by the right reverend Prelate based on the experience of colleagues elsewhere&#151;particularly those in Northern Ireland and in other commissions. Noble Lords may know that we have already sought the views of children's organisations in establishing a children and young people's board within the Department for Education and Skills. We would expect that board to play a role in the appointment of the commissioner and, in that way, the matter of taking into account the views of organisations would be addressed.
<P>

<a name="40504-14_para18"></a>I do not envisage that children's organisations will participate in the selection process of the commissioner for children and young people. As I have already indicated, the commission must take its authenticity, and indeed authority, from children and young people. Therefore, young people&#151;rather than adults, however well meaning, who speak on their behalf&#151;need to be involved in the appointment. I hope that noble Lords will feel content that I have answered that point appropriately and that they will not wish to press Amendment No. 2.
<P>

<a name="40504-14_para19"></a>I know that Amendments Nos. 3 to 7, to which a number of noble Lords, led by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, spoke, are inspired by the wish to see a commissioner who is independent of government. I can assure noble Lords that that is also the Government's intention, and we believe that that can be properly ensured in this part of the Bill. I know that we shall have many discussions on the issue of independence at other stages of our deliberations in Committee. However, we believe that independence will be achieved through the normal procedure of the appointment being made by Her Majesty's Government through the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="40504-14_para20"></a>As noble Lords will be aware, the commissioner will be accountable to the Secretary of State, who is, in turn, ultimately answerable to Parliament for the actions and responsibilities that he undertakes. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, that the Children's Commissioner will head a non-departmental public body. The office will be set up through the normal democratic process. We believe that propriety will be assured by the rules governing public appointments and that that is the right way to approach the appointment. Notwithstanding that, as I have already indicated, during the course of our debates there will be other opportunities to consider properly and fully the extent to which we have ensured that the theme of independence runs throughout the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40504-14_para21"></a>I turn to the suggestion that the appointment be made by Her Majesty the Queen. In practice, the Government will be expected to carry out the <P>


<a name="column_1045"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1045</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>appointment and to operate on Her Majesty's behalf. Therefore, in any event, I am not sure that the amendment would have the effect that the noble Baroness seeks. With the proviso that we are reflecting on the whole issue of independence and shall deliberate and discuss that further during the course of the Bill's proceedings, I hope that the noble Baroness will not press her amendment.

<a name="40504-15_para3"></a><P>

<a name="40504-15_para4"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall be very brief. This is yet another amendment which seeks to ensure that the Children's Commissioner is independent. Its intention is to probe what the Government mean by the words,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and on such conditions (if any)",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-15_para5"></a>
in paragraph 7 of Schedule 1. Those of us who are exercised about the independence, and thereby the credibility, of the Children's Commissioner believe that if the Secretary of State were to impose conditions on the funding of the commissioner, that would prejudice the independence of the office holder. As all politicians know, the power follows the money. Therefore, I am most anxious to hear the Minister's response. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-15_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   I support the amendment, which highlights what, to me, is an unacceptable and unnecessary fetter on the independence of the commissioner. It seems to me to be one thing for the Secretary of State to decide what the commissioner's annual budget should be but quite another for him to dole out the budget with strings attached to it.
<P>

<a name="40504-15_para6"></a>As expressed, the provision in paragraph 7 amounts to a blanket power of direction. One can imagine the Secretary of State wanting to ring-fence money intended to fund, let us say, a formal inquiry, but allowing him to impose conditions on the use of any or all of the commissioner's budget is, I think, over the top. I hope that the Minister can reassure us on that point and, even if she does so, I hope that she will also agree to have another look at the wording.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-15_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   I, too, have added my name to the amendment. On the issue of independence, I believe it is particularly important that nothing in the Bill seems to limit that independence. The matter of security of tenure was raised. These are all aspects which could be used to impose conditions one way or another on the work of the commissioner.
<P>

<a name="40504-15_para7"></a>Obviously this is a probing amendment and it would be interesting if the Minister could tell us the thinking behind inserting into the Bill the phrase that we are <P>


<a name="column_1046"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1046</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>seeking to remove. It seems to go a little too far. A budget for a body or quango such as will be led by the commissioner is set in general terms and, in my view&#151;and certainly from my experience&#151;it should be left to the organisation to spend in the most useful way that it considers appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Puttnam: </B>   I added my name to the amendment because I am fearful of our old enemy "unintended consequences". While I accept that the Bill has been brought before the House by a Government who wish to have a Children's Commissioner, I am very concerned that, 10 or 15 years from now, we may well find ourselves with a government who do not want a Children's Commissioner and who would find this rather open-ended invitation to get rid of the commissioner almost too good to resist. I should very much appreciate it if the Minister could find a way to lose the words in precisely the manner that we have indicated.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-15_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   I am grateful for the opportunity to explain precisely what is in our minds in the wording of the Bill. As noble Lords are aware, the Secretary of State will make regular grant payments for the commissioner, in order for the commissioner to discharge the functions conferred on him or her by the legislation.
<P>

<a name="40504-15_para8"></a>It is a standard condition of payment that the money is spent on functions within the scope of the commissioner's legislative powers. Another example might be that reimbursement of travelling costs would be within agreed rates, which is standard practice. The reason that this wording exists is that it mirrors Schedule 2 paragraph 14 of the Care Standards Act, under which the National Assembly for Wales funds the Welsh commissioner. We have indeed thought to look very carefully at how that works.
<P>

<a name="40504-15_para9"></a>But let me be absolutely clear and stress that there is no intention for the Secretary of State to stipulate how the commissioner should spend the annual grant paid to him, beyond the basic condition that it should be spent on the functions that have been conferred on the commissioner. It will be for the commissioner and not the Secretary of State to determine the priorities, and how the commissioner spends their time and money on different issues.
<P>

<a name="40504-15_para10"></a>As the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said, a condition which it might be reasonable to attach to a particular payment would be if there was a supplementary payment, in order for the commissioner to undertake an inquiry under Clause 4. In that case, of course the Secretary of State would wish the additional money given for that inquiry to be spent on that inquiry. We are taking this power only in order to ensure the appropriate use of public funds. The money must be spent on the functions conferred by Parliament, not at all to limit the commissioner's independence. I hope with that assurance that noble Lords will feel able to withdraw the amendment, particularly as I have <P>


<a name="column_1047"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1047</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>indicated that it mirrors what happened with the Care Standards Act in order to set up the functions of the Welsh commissioner.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-15_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   I do not know that I am entirely reassured by what the noble Baroness said, for the reasons which have already been given&#151;that the intentions of the present Government may not be the intentions of a successor government.
<P>

<a name="40504-15_para11"></a>If the main or only purpose of these words is to see that the commissioner spends his money only on his functions, it would be perfectly possible to put that on the face of the Bill rather than giving an open-ended cheque&#151;an open-ended power&#151;to limit his expenditure to anything that the Secretary of State thinks his expenditure should be limited to. Equally there may be other formulae to deal with the other difficulties that the noble Baroness sees. I hope that this is not a point that we shall lose sight of at a later stage. Indeed, if noble Lords have been thinking about the ways in which that could be dealt with now, they might like to join in at this moment, because that is a matter of some importance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-15_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   If I wish to give a sum of money to someone to do something, I have a contract, and that seems to be the right way in which the Secretary of State should deal with this commissioner if they want them to do some extra work. They would say, "Here, you can have £50,000 if you will do this work. Sign here. All done. Tick. Off you go". To have this wording in the Bill merely to substitute for that, in a rather inadequate way&#151;because after all it hardly specifies anything&#151;opens up all the dangers which have been specified by my noble friend and others who proposed this amendment. The wording is so wide, it could be used for anything. It has no function. The noble Baroness has not outlined a function that cannot be easily replaced in other and safer ways. It really should go.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-15_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   I too am rather concerned by the points that have been raised. I would like to know what there is to prevent the Secretary of State giving money for a particular purpose without putting anything about it on the face of the Bill. The point that has been raised about unintended consequences is very important. I hope that the Minister will be able to give it a little more thought.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-15_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   I will try to give noble Lords more information if I have it, but my understanding&#151;which has clearly been challenged, and if it is wrong then rightly so&#151;is that that is a standard process to ensure that public money is used for the purposes in which it is taken forward, and in this case given to the new commissioner. But if there is strength of feeling in the Committee, I shall look again to see whether that wording does reflect what has happened in previous legislation and have appropriate <P>


<a name="column_1048"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1048</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>correspondence or conversations with noble Lords for whom that is clearly an important issue, to see if we might resolve that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-15_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   Before the Minister finishes, could I clarify something? It seems that we are agreed that the commissioner should spend public money on the commissioner's functions and no other. The noble Baroness suggests that common form requires that the Secretary of State should be able to say, "You shall spend it on this function and not on that function". In other words, the Secretary of State can prioritise the work of the commissioner. That would be the effect of what she is saying. I hope that it is not her intention.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-15_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   It is certainly not my intention and I apologise if that was the effect. I was trying to say that the way in which one would expect public money to be used would be that it is conferred upon the commissioner within the commissioner's defined role, and not to be spent on something outside that role. Within that, it is for the commissioner to determine the priorities and the way in which the money is spent.
<P>

<a name="40504-15_para12"></a>The only additional point I made was that if there were additional resources given for a particular inquiry, noble Lords would expect the Secretary of State to say that money is for the purpose of that inquiry. That would be the only other stipulation. However, as always, if my clarity is less than it should be, I will ensure that I correct that by correspondence and pursue that with noble Lords.

<A NAME="40504-16_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   I am most grateful to the Minister for her efforts to clarify the situation, and particularly for her promise to have a look at whether the concerns of noble Lords can be addressed. I am grateful to all noble Lords who have supported this amendment. I felt that the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, made a very good point about the possibility of a future government using something like that to squeeze out a commissioner that they may not want. I particularly echo the first intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Elton. He reflected exactly what was going through my mind as the Minister spoke; he was quicker to his feet than I was.
<P>

<a name="40504-16_para0"></a>However, I am particularly heartened to hear the Minister rely on the wording of the Care Standards Act, which created the Children's Commissioner for Wales. I hope that later in our discussions she will be relying in a similar way on the Act that gave the Commissioner for Wales his powers and independence.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40504-16_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 9, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 13, 14, 17, 20, 22 and 39.
<P>

<a name="40504-16_para6"></a>We now come to a very important principle that is close to the hearts of many noble Lords. The principle that holds this whole group of amendments together is that children's rights should be enshrined in the powers of the Children's Commissioner. I will briefly go through what these various amendments do.
<P>

<a name="40504-16_para7"></a>Amendment No. 9 is arguably the most critical of all this group. It would change the functions of the commissioner to one of promoting the rights and interests of children. As the Bill currently stands, the general function is so weak that it violates the Paris principles and the whole purpose of a children's commissioner as defined by the United Nations. In addition, the fact that the English commissioner would have a different remit from the commissioner in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, would create a major inequality in the protection afforded to children in England compared to the rest of the UK, and make seamless collaboration between the commissioners and the jurisdictions rather problematic.
<P>

<a name="40504-16_para8"></a>Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 ensure that anyone exercising functions that affect children have regard to their rights as well as their views and interests. In Amendment No. 17, rather than merely "consider" matters relating to the interests of children, the commissioner could review and report on any other matter relating to the rights, views and interests of children, which is a much more robust approach.
<P>

<a name="40504-16_para9"></a>Amendment No. 20 means that the commissioner should indeed be able to make representations to the Secretary of State, but also any matter affecting the rights or welfare of children, and challenge government policy, or solicit government intervention where necessary. We believe that that is part and parcel of being a really powerful champion for children.
<P>

<a name="40504-16_para10"></a>Amendment No. 22 removes any restrictions on the range of things that the Children's Commissioner may consider in relation to children.
<P>

<a name="40504-16_para11"></a>Amendment No. 39 would ensure the Children's Commissioner "must" rather than "may" have regard to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. This absolutely essential change is needed to ensure the proper focus on children's human rights as enshrined in the convention, including the right to freely enjoy those rights without discrimination. We are, after all, supposed to be creating a human rights institution to give life to the rights set out in the convention.
<P>

<a name="40504-16_para12"></a>I very much regret that the Government did not decide to use the UNCRC as their blueprint for a happy, safe and fulfilled childhood. The convention signed by the UK in 1991&#151;and by all but two countries&#151;provides a common vision and language for securing a good childhood for everyone. It gives a detailed strategy for meeting all of children's needs. The fact that it is so widely supported is part of its strength. It does not depend on race, creed, gender or economic circumstances. It is not aspirational. It is a convention to which the UK Government are a party. <P>


<a name="column_1050"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1050</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I should have thought that this Bill, which establishes a children's champion and a new framework of duties and responsibilities in the provision of children's services, would have been an ideal vehicle to enshrine the convention in UK law.
<P>

<a name="40504-16_para13"></a>Many of us working on the Bill have wondered why the Government have proposed such a weak model. At Second Reading the plans for England's commissioner were criticised by noble Lords as "discriminatory". The commissioner was described as "castrated", "a government listening post" and "a public relations consultant". As a former public relations consultant I think that I should take exception to that criticism.
<P>

<a name="40504-16_para14"></a>In an All-Party Parliamentary Group for Children seminar on the commissioners on 20 April, the Government's conception of the Children's Commissioner was characterised by one contributor as "big ears and no teeth". The proposals have been strongly criticised by existing commissioners in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. The president of the European Network of Ombudsmen for Children has written to the Joint Committee on Human Rights explaining that with such limited powers and questionable independence it is unlikely that England's commissioner will be eligible to join the European network. I am sure the Minister would not wish such an indictment.
<P>

<a name="40504-16_para15"></a>Why have the Government put forward such an idiosyncratic and weak model of a Children's Commissioner? I understand the Government's belief is that this is what children have asked for. But do children in England want a commissioner with no powers? The Government's decision to establish a commissioner was announced in the Green Paper Every Child Matters. The document contained little detail on the commissioner&#151;just three paragraphs. There was no reference to children's rights or to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Nevertheless, the promise of a children's champion, independent of government, was widely welcomed.
<P>

<a name="40504-16_para16"></a>The Green Paper did not include any questions about the commissioner. There have been no specialist briefings or consultation events for children in England dedicated to exploring the children's role as, for example, there were in Northern Ireland. It is not surprising, therefore, that children have not expressed too much by way of opinion about the commissioner's powers.
<P>

<a name="40504-16_para17"></a>During consultations children asked for a commissioner with similar aptitudes to the commissioners in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. That did not stop those jurisdictions getting a commissioner with strong powers and independent of government. Children in England have not rejected a commissioner with strong powers. It is simply that discussions with children have so far focused on the commissioner's personal qualities and the issues that children hope the commissioner will work on.
<P>

<a name="40504-16_para18"></a>If presented with the information on other UK commissioners and international standards, it is hard to imagine why children in England would choose the Government's "big ears and no teeth" model. Children in England have everything to gain and nothing to lose <P>


<a name="column_1051"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1051</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>from having a commissioner who listens to them, understands them and has the necessary powers to change the way they are treated and protect their rights.
<P>

<a name="40504-16_para19"></a>The Government seek to justify the commissioner's extremely weak powers by stressing differences in the child population size between England and Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. I agree that the size of England's child population presents a risk of the children's commissioner becoming swamped with formal investigations without safeguards. The potential is there for the commissioner to lose his or her strategic role.
<P>

<a name="40504-16_para20"></a>However, instead of handing over to Ministers the power to determine when and how they can use their legal powers, strict criteria should be written into the legislation for the commissioner to follow. The current proposals suggest that the Government do not believe that the commissioner will act in the children's best interests without close ministerial supervision. That is a fundamental flaw and denies children the independent champion they were promised in the Green Paper.
<P>

<a name="40504-16_para21"></a>All these amendments require children's rights to be enshrined in the powers of the commissioner. I and many of your Lordships believe very strongly that the Government should accept the amendments if they are really determined to give children in England the powerful and independent champion we all want. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40504-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   Perhaps the noble Baroness will answer one simple question. Why in Amendment No. 17 is the word "all" before "children" omitted, and yet in her Amendment No. 23 the word "all" is inserted, which is two lines later?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-16_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   I am most grateful to the noble Lord for the question. I agree with him that the word "all" would be an improvement to the amendment. However, I think that my amendment that inserts "all" would be a catch-all and would refer to all the powers and functions of the commissioner. I hope that that would cover the matter.

<P>
<A NAME="40504-17_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Massey of Darwen: </B>   Perhaps I may also ask the noble Baroness to clarify a matter for me on Amendment No. 9. I declare an interest as the co-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Children. As such, I am of course sympathetic to much of what the noble Baroness has said about children's rights.
<P>

<a name="40504-17_para0"></a>However, I wonder why she wishes to take out "the awareness of the views" of children. A survey by the Children and Young People Unit a couple of years ago sought views on issues such as leisure and enjoyment. I do not have a copy of it here, but there was a fairly wide-ranging seeking of views. If you do not seek views, I wonder how you define what those <P>


<a name="column_1052"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1052</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>rights should be. In other words, who defines the rights if you do not have the views of children to hand? I am just puzzled.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   At Second Reading I tried to draw attention to the fact that in the Bill the Government appear at least&#151;I hope it is no worse than that&#151;to be setting up a commissioner for England with considerably fewer powers, duties and responsibilities than the comparable commissioners in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. That is why I support the general thrust of the amendments.
<P>

<a name="40504-17_para1"></a>I should just like to point out that the wording in Clause 2(2) is really quite feeble, although I agree that it is somewhat balanced by subsection (3). In passing, I would welcome subsection (3)(b), which concerns protection from harm, because I think that gives scope for covering the very great difficulties and problems surrounding children who have been trafficked into this country for purposes of exploitation.
<P>

<a name="40504-17_para2"></a>Given the very real problems and difficulties that have arisen and still arise in England, which were well covered and extremely well brought to light by my noble friend Lord Listowel when he moved Amendment No. 1, I hope that the Government will be able to explain why a less strong measure is appropriate for England compared with the other jurisdictions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-17_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   May I, with the Committee's permission, answer the question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, before we have all forgotten what she asked? Is that in order? She asked why I wanted to delete "awareness of the views" and put in "and safeguarding the rights". That is in the introductory subsection of Clause 2, which talks about the general functions of the commissioner. My intention in laying this amendment was to strengthen the general functions, and to put rights at the heart of it.
<P>

<a name="40504-17_para3"></a>Of course, I agree with her that in doing so the commissioner must gather the views of children. That is absolutely crucial. However, if the noble Baroness looks at my Amendment No. 17, she will see that it covers getting the views of children, as does subsection (4), which involves consulting children and ensuring that they are made aware of his functions. Getting the views of children is covered, and removing it from that bit provides no detriment at all to the view that children's views must be gathered.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   Going back to questioning the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, referred to the apparently weaker powers for the English commissioner compared with the other commissioners. Could she explain that issue in the context of the situation as I understand it, where the English commissioner will be answerable not only for all English issues, but for those Welsh and Scots issues that <P>


<a name="column_1053"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1053</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have not been devolved? Therefore, he has even bigger responsibilities, and one would have thought that he would need larger powers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-17_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Whitaker: </B>   In speaking to an aspect of Amendment No. 17, much of what I say also relates to the other amendments in the group, which I also support.
<P>

<a name="40504-17_para4"></a>This Government like presiding over improvements. They have already notched up many, particularly in matters to do with the lives of children, which has much to do with the part played by my noble friend the Minister. This amendment, which safeguards the independence in action of the Children's Commissioner, should commend itself to the Government as a critical improvement in this part of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40504-17_para5"></a>When I was responsible for the official oversight of the Health and Safety Commission and then the Equal Opportunities Commission, their freedom of action was fundamental to their usefulness to society and hence to the Government. I say "hence to the Government" because the immediate instinct of those who make the first draft of such statutes is to think how much more convenient it would be to have departmental control over the activities of the commission or commissioner in question. I have been there. However, it is necessary to take a longer view.
<P>

<a name="40504-17_para6"></a>The really useful commissioner is the one who can go where the Government, with all their constraints, cannot so easily go; who can bring to bear a narrow and intense focus on a particular issue; who can expose or add together what the machinery of the state has not seen or added together. We are not short of issues that merit that kind of scrutiny.
<P>

<a name="40504-17_para7"></a>Why is it, for instance that the children of Northern Irish Travellers have 10 times the mortality rate of their settled counterparts? There are many other examples. A Children's Commissioner needs a free rein to look into things like this if he or she sees fit. Our society will be the beneficiary, and so, ultimately, will the Government, if they have the courage and the self-respect to do so&#151;I am sure that they have. It is not such a big step, after all.
<P>

<a name="40504-17_para8"></a>I draw my noble friend's attention to the forthcoming report on the Bill by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. I will not read out into the record the evidence that is already on the website from the Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish commissioners. I will just say that the evidence of all three commissioners casts serious doubt on the feasibility of having a UK commissioner with such markedly less independence and fewer powers than they have. Between now and Report stage, I urge my noble friend to take account of their evidence in redrafting the UK commissioner's powers.
<P>

<a name="40504-17_para9"></a>It is normal for the commissioners set up by statute in this country to have the independence to choose what in their appointed field they will concentrate on. I urge the Government to overcome the timidity of the Bill's concept of a commissioner, and create a real children's champion through adopting this amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-17_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   I ask the Minister whether she can help me to tease out what I am finding <P>


<a name="column_1054"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1054</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to be an intellectual conundrum. It seems that rights must be central to a Children's Commissioner. Therefore, I strongly support Amendment No. 17, and the other points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, about including rights in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40504-17_para10"></a>I do not really understand the timidity of the Government about including that. I do understand, as I said on Second Reading and earlier today, that there are some issues about a commissioner in England. There are real issues about 11 million children being represented, and how those children are represented by the commissioner. That makes me believe that this person should take&#151;let us not keep saying "he", it might be a woman&#151;a strategic view of the issues. Only then could the kind of issues that concern me, which I want someone like this to be able to intervene in, be dealt with.
<P>

<a name="40504-17_para11"></a>I am concerned about issues such as ensuring that children in the criminal justice system somehow get noticed; that asylum children get noticed; that trafficked children get noticed; that children lost in hospitals, particularly disabled children, get noticed. If this person is taking an individual view of children's issues, not a strategic view, they will drown in casework. It might well be that they can look at some individual issues, and of course they will have to talk to children to be a real commissioner. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, talked about having some criteria whereby that can take place. However, it needs to be restricted. The English commissioner is different. The countries in Europe that have commissioners are small countries with small populations. This is a new departure in England. I want this person to be truly powerful, and truly powerful means being able to look across the whole piece.
<P>

<a name="40504-17_para12"></a>I also want them to be able to work with others. I have said before that we place too much emphasis on one individual; they must be able to work with all the other children's rights workers in the local authorities, the children's rights director in the Commission for Social Care Inspection, social workers and rights workers in CAFCASS and other organisations. That will be a huge task in itself, pulling together the views and issues that those people will raise with the commissioner on behalf of children. They will be talking to hundreds of children, and the "big ears" need to reflect the hearing of all of that. You can only talk to five children at once, and I do a lot of it. These people can talk to hundreds of children, and presumably the commissioner can gather that.
<P>

<a name="40504-17_para13"></a>In all that, I fail to understand why we are so loath to include the word "rights" in the Bill, which seems so important, in a way that includes that strategic view. I do not think that the two things are necessarily intellectually separated.

<A NAME="40504-17_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   I support these amendments, and I am signatory to at least one of them. The debate emphasises the concern that we all have about the weakness of this commissioner. Eleven million children will be represented, but is there any <P>


<a name="column_1055"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1055</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reason why the powers of the commissioner should be less strong than that of the commissioners of smaller countries? The word "rights" appearing throughout the amendments must show the right way of going about the matter.
<P>

<a name="40504-17_para14"></a>A very valid point was raised about whether we should removed the words "awareness of the views". I signed the amendment myself. It is probably right that those words should remain. The views and rights of children are important for how effectively the role is carried out.
<P>

<a name="40504-17_para15"></a>The most important change I seek is from "may" to "must" concerning the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. It is crucial.

<a name="40504-17_para16"></a>The briefings have been marvellous and detailed. We all give considerable thanks to the noble Baroness and her assistants for the attention we have received. I do not believe that any of us have had a satisfactory answer to the point I raised.

<A NAME="40504-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Puttnam: </B>   I am one of the signatories to Amendments Nos. 9, 13, 14 and 39, the latter referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe.
<P>

<a name="40504-18_para0"></a>I grab the high ground again as the President of UNICEF UK. In the past l8 months I have visited Bosnia, Cambodia and Nigeria, looking into the issue of child trafficking, which the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, referred to just now. I cannot imagine that UNICEF would be effective in those countries were we merely to have regard to the interests of children. It is the ability to talk to governments based on the UNCRC document and the rights of children which allows one to put pressure on governments.
<P>

<a name="40504-18_para1"></a>It is sad to say that a number of the children end up in this country. The notion that we should have less ability to tackle the issues in the United Kingdom than we have in other countries is quite ludicrous.
<P>

<a name="40504-18_para2"></a>I am very proud of the fact that the United Kingdom was one of the drafters of the UNCRC. It is quite absurd that we would not incorporate that on the face of our own legislation. I urge the Minister most strongly to do that. As he is aware, I have had a significant amount of correspondence with the Minister of State in another place. I have received an enormous amount of sympathy and understanding on the issue from the Minister. The issue will not go away. If the Bill becomes law without the provision it will be weak legislation. I do not think it would bring much credit to this country or this House were we to allow it to happen.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-18_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </B>   I concur with the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam. Amendment No. 9 is very important. It is consistent with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and with the important role that children's commissioners play <P>


<a name="column_1056"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1056</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>worldwide in the promotion and monitoring of the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child at national level.
<P>

<a name="40504-18_para3"></a>Amendment No. 17 would ensure that the views and interests of children are represented. It has been said that the Children's Commissioner in England and the United Kingdom is "outcomes based" whereas those already in place in the United Kingdom are "rights based".
<P>

<a name="40504-18_para4"></a>Human rights, as defined in the UN convention, would strengthen the England-UK commissioner, particularly as the Bill itself proposes, that he or she would be working on non-devolved issues as regards the areas already covered by the three commissioners now in place. I fear that without the champion having to work to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the real role will not be achieved in practice.
<P>

<a name="40504-18_para5"></a>Like others, I ask the Minister why the Children's Commissioner could not have an effective strategic role if these amendments were accepted. While the wording of the amendments before us today may not be perfect, the underlying principle is of fundamental importance. Like others, I do not understand why it is not on the face of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-18_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   One matter was quite clear from our Second Reading and that was that most people's idea of what the role and functions of the Children's Commissioner should be was completely at odds with what the Government thought they should be. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, very ably pointed out the inherent contradiction in the Government's position. In one breath they talk about having a children's champion independent of government. That was a phrase which everyone was delighted to read and hear. Yet in creating this champion they are not giving him any of the tools to do the job.
<P>

<a name="40504-18_para6"></a>A great deal is said these days about children's rights. I believe that they most definitely do have rights and that in most situations and for most of the time those rights are defended perfectly satisfactorily by parents. But sometimes that cannot happen. Some children have no parents; others are let down or betrayed by them. Others are detained in custody. There are some children's rights which even good and loving parents are incapable of defending, which are the rights of children as reflected in legislation passing through Parliament.
<P>

<a name="40504-18_para7"></a>In these contexts it is up to public authorities and Parliament to protect the rights of children. That principle has been recognised in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in the form of a Children's Commissioner. Why on earth cannot we also recognise it in England?
<P>

<a name="40504-18_para8"></a>Listening to what children want is obviously an important part of the equation, as the Bill suggests, but it surely cannot be the whole equation. Neither are children's interests the whole story. To be worthy of the name, a children's champion has to look beyond the fulfilment of children's wishes to defending their rights. Children need a champion because very often they are not in a position to defend those rights themselves.
<P>


<a name="column_1057"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1057</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40504-18_para9"></a>The UN convention is not about the wishes and interests of children, but about rights. As the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, pointed out, the UK signed up to it because, not to sound too pompous about it, we believed that it was important for us as a society to make public and binding promises to our children. A Children's Commissioner is perfectly placed to be the guardian of those promises provided of course that he or she is independent. Then if ever the convention's promises appeared to becoming politically inconvenient for a government, a commissioner could ensure that they were adhered to.
<P>

<a name="40504-18_para10"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, said, having an independent person to undertake the process of monitoring, promoting and protecting children's rights is what the convention urges, if not obliges us, to do, backed up by the Paris principles.
<P>

<a name="40504-18_para11"></a>Like other Members of the Committee, I find it baffling that the Government have opted to ignore children's rights in the context of Clause 2. The Minister may be tempted to point us in the direction of the ombudsman. He is concerned with rights, but his job is sorting out specific cases of alleged injustice. I do not believe that he has a general duty towards protecting children's rights; neither is he the guardian of the UN convention. He cannot do what Amendment No. 17 proposes, which is to,
<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-18_para12"></a><P>

<a name="40504-18_para13"></a>I said at Second Reading that it is as though the Government were adopting a "tick-in-a-box" approach to the issue. Once there is someone in place called a Children's Commissioner for the UK or England, no matter how anodyne his powers and duties may be, Ministers will be able to say that they have done what was asked of them. But they are not doing what was asked of them. Bearing in mind that the Government make much of having a listening commissioner, I hope that the Minister will be in listening mode as regards the amendments, which are, in my view, of fundamental importance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-18_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   This has been an important debate and I am grateful to all Members of the Committee who have participated. I recognise the strength of feeling involved in our discussions. I understand entirely the desire of noble Lords to see a strong commissioner working for children, with children, acting in their best interests and rooted firmly in their views. The Government support that ambition. The debate, in a sense, is about how we can arrive at that outcome.
<P>

<a name="40504-18_para14"></a>At this point, I wish to express my thanks to the All-Party Group for Children and to my noble friend Lady Massey for arranging what felt like daily meetings&#151;I believe they were at one point&#151;and for giving me the opportunity to meet other commissioners and their representatives, to hear their views and to discuss with them, formally and informally, some of the issues. We should be proud of our other commissioners. I hope that when there is a commissioner in England he or she will join that august group of people.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40504-18_para15"></a>I should say to my noble friend Lady Whitaker that we will of course take account of what she said about the Committee for Human Rights. I shall of course look at the evidence that has been submitted. I have not yet done so, mainly because of the opportunity I had to talk with the other commissioners.
<P>

<a name="40504-18_para16"></a>We start from the principle that we want to focus the commissioner's work on the outcomes that have been identified in our consultations; the issues that children and young people have said for themselves are important to them. That is the principle behind our beginning to think through the role of our Children's Commissioner. In a sense, we want the Children's Commissioner to face children; to be responsible and responsive to them. As I have indicated, I believe that the commissioner must draw his or her power from the fact that he or she speaks for children, for their aspirations and for their best interests, but on the basis of that knowledge.
<P>

<a name="40504-18_para17"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, asked about the consultation and how we discussed this matter with children. We ranged across a whole set of issues. I am not saying that we asked specific questions on the role of the commissioner, but we discussed the commissioner with children. It may surprise the Committee to learn that the children had a particular interest in being involved in the process of selection of the commissioner. The noble Baroness made an important point about continuing the dialogue on the role of the commissioner. I shall reflect on that and discuss it with my colleagues.
<P>

<a name="40504-18_para18"></a>It is because we started from that principle that we have taken a slightly different direction. We understand and recognise the importance that noble Lords give to this issue and I wish to explore a little further the background. When we carried out our consultations for the Children and Young People's Unit we were keen to set the framework around which we would deliberate and discuss the way in which Every Child Matters would take forward the issues that were presented to it. The Committee will know that the genesis of that came from both the work of the Children and Young People's Unit and the Victoria Climbie inquiry led by the noble Lord, Lord Laming, who is not in his place today.
<P>

<a name="40504-18_para19"></a>We want to make sure that this principle is at the heart of the work of the commissioner, as it should be at the heart of this legislation and at the heart of the work that we do. The outcomes are, in a sense, enshrined in this legislation and represent, as best we can in parliamentary language, what it is we are trying to achieve for children. They are of children, they were designed by children and they are critically important. The Committee will not be surprised that I find it unacceptable to delete those outcomes and that I therefore cannot accept Amendment No. 22.
<P>

<a name="40504-18_para20"></a>I am very concerned that we do not dilute the focus on the outcomes that children themselves have addressed. From the way in which it is framed, we believe that Amendment No. 9 would do that.
<P>

<a name="40504-18_para21"></a>I do not want to play down the importance of the UN convention. We have signed up to it&#151;albeit with the reservations that noble Lords know about&#151;and we believe that no commissioner could take sensible <P>


<a name="column_1059"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1059</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>decisions on what constitutes the interests of children without being aware of its principles and applying them to his work. That is why the Bill ensures that the Children's Commissioner can have regard to the convention when doing so.
<P>

<a name="40504-18_para22"></a>Amendments Nos. 13, 14, 17 and 20 all seek to add a specific reference to "rights". Amendment No. 20 also seeks to add "welfare" to other parts of the commissioner's remit. I have great sympathy with what noble Lords are seeking to achieve but I do not believe the amendments are necessary because, under subsection (7), we expect the commissioner to have regard to the convention in considering what constitutes children's interests. We believe that "rights" are already encompassed within "interests". Noble Lords may disagree but, as far as we are concerned, "rights" are encompassed within "interests". The Committee will also be aware that "welfare" is covered by the five outcomes. So, in that context, we do not believe that we need to refer to it specifically.
<P>

<a name="40504-18_para23"></a>As regards Amendment No. 17, as I have confirmed, the commissioner will have the ability to review any issue that relates to the views and interests of children. Nothing in Clause 2 will prevent the commissioner from issuing ad hoc reports and taking other action. We are trying not to circumscribe the functions under the clause by being too prescriptive in the way in which we design and list the responsibilities of the commissioner. I have already made it clear that he or she may take into account the UNCRC. So our thinking is that children's rights are part of the views and interests that the Children's Commissioner may want to pursue. I am, however, sympathetic to the concerns that underlie the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40504-18_para24"></a>I have made the point that we start from a different principle. I recognise, as the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, said, that there are differences in the way in which we have approached this matter from the other commissioners; it is what makes our debates with them of great interest. We expect the commissioners to work closely together. We believe that by focusing on the outcomes for children we have the correct balance for children's interest. In terms of Amendment No. 17, I said that I have some sympathy for the direction in which noble Lords wish to go, but other amendments, in my view, change the focus of the work of the commissioner in a way that I do not wish to see. On that basis, I hope that the amendments will be withdrawn, although I appreciate that noble Lords may wish to reflect on them further at later stages of our deliberations.
<P>

<a name="40504-18_para25"></a>I said at Second Reading that I would reflect on the issues in regard to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. In particular, I wish to focus on Amendment No. 39. I am a listening Minister. I wish to be clear that I have reflected on the way in which noble Lords have&#151;today and at other times in our debate&#151;powerfully discussed the issue of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and I shall therefore accept Amendment No. 39.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-19_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   In accepting Amendment No. 39 I may have slightly changed the focus of our deliberations. I am trying to signal to the Committee our concern to ensure that rights are a fundamental part of the legislation. I believe I have achieved that. Between now and the next stage of the Bill there will be opportunities to discuss this matter. We believe that the issue of "rights" is covered within the wording of the Bill. I hope that by accepting Amendment No. 39 I have allayed some of the concerns of noble Lords.
<P>

<a name="40504-19_para0"></a>As always, my door is open. I shall be at the beck and call of noble Lords to give further clarification and to discuss ways in which we can work together to achieve my desire. I hope I have made that clear by accepting the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Puttnam: </B>   I thank the Minister for accepting Amendment No. 39. She is not only a listening Minister; she must be an extremely persuasive one. It is very difficult for my colleagues and I on these Benches to table what must appear at times to be hostile amendments. It is enormously encouraging that we are listened to and that we are not treated as either renegades or disloyal for raising what seem to many of us to be extremely obvious points.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Neill of Bladen: </B>   Before the noble Baroness sits down, will she address this point? As I understood her argument, the Children's Commissioner would, in any event, have in mind and be aware of the convention and the rights of children. If that is the case, it totally destroys any argument against including on the face of the Bill, in a most prominent position&#151;Clause 2&#151;this reference to the rights of children. When she rethinks this, will she be good enough to think about the logic of what she has said? Inherent in that logic is that rights are part of the remit of the commissioner and therefore&#151;if she will follow my thinking&#151;ought to be in the forefront, in Clause 2.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-19_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   As the noble Lord will know, I am always willing to rethink. I hope that I have signalled very clearly our position as regards the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Any noble Lord who wants to know what persuaded me has only to read the words of my noble friend Lady David on Second Reading in describing very clearly that a government who signed up to and ratified such a document with all-party support must have regard to it. None the less, it is critical to ensure that when we design legislation we are clear about what we are seeking to achieve in terms of outcomes for children and the role of the commissioner. It is partly a question of balance and partly one of focus. In certain of these <P>


<a name="column_1061"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1061</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendments, it is our view that the focus of the work of the commissioner could change. I began by saying that we had begun our exploration of the role of a commissioner for England from the point where children had indicated they wanted us to be, and that is a focus we would not wish to lose. That would be my starting point for any further discussions and, as I have already indicated, I am always open to discussion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-19_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   Before the noble Baroness sits down, she mentioned the possibility that the work of the commissioner might change. Is it also possible that the United Nations convention might be changed? If so, how would we be affected if we had signed up to it in the way in which the noble Lord, Lord Neill, suggested?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-19_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   It is my understanding that the convention was signed in 1991, and I know of no particular changes. Many in your Lordships' House are more expert than I on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. If I am incorrect I shall of course make sure that noble Lords are aware of any new information. As far as I understand it, the convention is signed and ratified, and remains as is. I know of no other moves or ability for the convention to be altered; if there is, I will of course notify your Lordships.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-19_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   Could the noble Baroness enlarge a little on her reaction to Amendment No. 17? It is pretty standard to have a clause which gives a commissioner the right to publish reports. If, under Clause 2(2)(b), he requires permission to talk to the Secretary of State, surely we need something which gives him permission to talk to the rest of us.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-19_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   There is nothing to stop the commissioner making reports in an ad hoc way in any event. Indeed, the commissioner will have the ability to look systemically at different aspects of what happens with children; we would expect him or her to report on that and to make those reports available.
<P>

<a name="40504-19_para1"></a>I was trying to make the point that I could see within that amendment perhaps more clearly where noble Lords were seeking to develop the argument. However, I thought that we needed to be careful about how we interpreted the way in which the commissioner does his or her work in order to ensure that we do not prescribe it. We are all, in a sense, searching for the same goal&#151;a commissioner who is flexible and able to respond but has a clear remit. What divides us is how we achieve that goal. It is our view that we need to be clear about that flexibility and not prescribe in areas where we think that might constrain the commissioner or deflect him or her from functions which we think are critical. Again, I am very happy to discuss this with noble Lords.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-19_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   Before the noble Baroness sits down, I should like to add one more point about why I am so keen that "rights" is firmly on the face of the Bill. It is connected with the point that <P>


<a name="column_1062"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1062</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the noble Baroness has made on several occasions about where the Government are coming from in listening to children and young people.
<P>

<a name="40504-19_para2"></a>As a generic group, children and young people are about as generic as any group in the population. I talk to a lot of young people; they are as prejudiced or unprejudiced as any other group of people. Many young people have quite a punitive attitude regarding what should happen to others who have confronted the law&#151;until they confront it themselves, of course. They have quite a punitive attitude towards people who come in from the outside. It is terribly important that the commissioner is able to stand up for the rights of minority groups of children. That is why I think the word "rights" is so central to what we are trying to do. Listening to children is as complex as the noble Baroness listening to noble Lords in the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-19_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   May I follow on from that description of children with a comment that is not, I hope, facile, but quite relevant? I remember that as a child, I was acutely aware of my wrongs; I had no idea of what my rights were at all, and I depended on my parents for seeing that I got them. As my noble friend Lord Howe said, we are concerned with the children who have no effective parents or no parents at all to see that they get their rights. That is why the word should be in the Bill and that is why the children have not asked for them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-19_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   The noble Lord and the noble Baroness both referred to particular groups of children. As the Committee goes through its deliberations, there will be plenty of opportunity to talk about particular groups of children whom noble Lords are, rightly, particularly concerned about, as expressed in various amendments and discussions.
<P>

<a name="40504-19_para3"></a>My ambition was that by accepting Amendment No. 39 I stated a principle which noble Lords would greet with, I hope, delight. In a sense it sets the framework for the deliberations of the commissioner.
<P>

<a name="40504-19_para4"></a>I pay tribute to the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, who knows a great deal about talking to children. I agree entirely with what she says about children being representative of the rest of us. However, it is important that the UN convention plays its role within that, and I believe that by changing a very simple word, noble Lords have achieved what they wanted.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-19_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   I am most grateful to the noble Baroness for responding to this group of amendments. In particular, I thank her very much for accepting Amendment No. 39. We are all absolutely delighted that she has been able to accept it on behalf of the Government. It is an important principle; it is a step in the right direction. However, I think my nickname must be Oliver Twist, because we want more.
<P>

<a name="40504-19_para5"></a>I am most grateful to all members of the Committee who have supported this group of amendments with such conviction and passion. I was particularly grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, for pointing out the logic of the Government's refusal to include the "R" word in the other places in the Bill, as I have proposed in this group of amendments. While <P>


<a name="column_1063"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1063</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>we are very grateful to the noble Baroness for accepting Amendment No. 39, I hope that when we return to these issues on Report, as we inevitably will, she will continue to use her powers of persuasion, together with her listening ear, and will be able to accept further amendments on them.
<P>

<a name="40504-19_para6"></a>I was most grateful to the noble Baroness for mentioning that she felt that the Government did not want to circumscribe the powers of the commissioner. That was exactly why I tabled Amendment No. 22. Although I accept that the outcomes are a result of what children said they wanted, because they are set out in a list, they circumscribe the powers of the commissioner and that is why we tabled Amendment No. 22.
<P>

<a name="40504-19_para7"></a>The problem is that if you ask a question, you get certain answers, and the answers you get depend on the questions you ask. The point I was making earlier about consulting children about the powers of the commissioner is that not enough questions have yet been asked of children. Whether there is an opportunity to ask more of those questions between Committee and Report, I do not know, but I think it would be extremely helpful if questions about the specific changes that we want to make to the Bill about children's rights could be run past a group of children and the Minister could hear their responses.
<P>

<a name="40504-19_para8"></a>With gratitude, yet wanting more, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40504-19_para9"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<A NAME="40504-19_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Northbourne </B>   moved Amendment No. 10:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 1, line 8, after "and" insert "best"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-19_para10"></a><P>

<a name="40504-19_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment, I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 40 and 43. Amendments Nos. 10 and 40 relate to the meaning of the words "children's interests". As the Bill is drafted, Part 1 is unclear on the meaning of those two words. In the English language, the word "interests" can be used in two ways&#151;to question what the child is interested in and to describe what is in the child's best interests. I am not being pedantic. Clause 2(2) includes the phrase:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the views and interests of children".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-19_para12"></a>
Views and interests match very well&#151;their views and what they are interested in. However, when we turn the page, we find in subsection (7) a reference to interests in the context of the UN convention, which does not relate to what children are interested in but to what is in the best interests of children.
<P>

<a name="40504-19_para13"></a>This is an important matter because it defines what the Children's Commissioner is for. Is he just a pair of ears to hear what children are saying, as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, suggested, and to represent those views to the Government or to the world, or does he judge not only what different children are thinking&#151;and there will be a great variety of children's views&#151;but what is in their best interests? That is where my Amendment No. 43 comes in. Like the other two amendments, it is a probing <P>


<a name="column_1064"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1064</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment. If it is the job of the commissioner to ascertain the best interests of children as well as what they are interested in, he must also listen to other people who know about children and who are in touch with what is in their best interests in the modern world. I need not insult your Lordships by giving examples of how a child might find some things more interesting than others or that some of the things that he might find interesting might not be in his or her best interests. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-20_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   From these Benches, I support the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, on these three amendments, although my name is attached to Amendment No. 43 in particular. As he says, "best" is a very small word, but it makes a difference. It focuses on the specific interests of the children in the Bill, and there are great advantages in using a familiar term. "In the best interests of the child" is used regularly in Bills and it is a good idea to carry it forward into this Bill as well.
<P>

<a name="40504-20_para0"></a>On Amendment No. 43, I also support the noble Lord in arguing that the Minister has herself said that it is vital that we listen to the voices of children. However, sometimes others are also there to help with those voices&#151;the parents, teachers and doctors who work with them. Sometimes, children cannot express for themselves what they really want. It is therefore helpful if we can include in the Bill the need for the commissioner to take account of the views of other people who work closely with children.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   The noble Lord has pointed out a genuine ambiguity and a simple remedy. If we are not to go to the interpretation clause that is fragmented in this Bill and difficult to find in several parts, I suggest that his remedy is much the best one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-20_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne. Indeed, I am grateful that we had the opportunity earlier today to talk about this matter. "Interests" reflects two different things at the same time. Of course, it is our intention that the provision is about the best interests of children. On making judgments about this, the commissioner will be particularly informed by the UN convention and the rights that children can expect under that, which is very important. However, we do not want to lose sight of the interests of children. I know from consultation with the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, that children are very keen for the commissioner to look at issues such as access to computers and pocket money. It is therefore important that we reflect both meanings. Children have interests that they wish to see reflected in the work of the commissioner.
<P>

<a name="40504-20_para1"></a>Noble Lords can think of many examples, I am sure, of the way in which children reflect their interests&#151;on school councils for example and in other ways. The interests that the teachers or adults believe that the children will take forward are not always the ones that children think are particularly important to them. Therefore, the provision, in a sense, includes both meanings. I have listened to the noble Lord and the noble Lord, Lord Elton, and I suggest to the Committee that I take this matter away to see if more can be done. However, I do not want to lose what <P>


<a name="column_1065"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1065</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>we believe is in the language and the policy intent. It should reflect the best interests of children and children's interests.
<P>

<a name="40504-20_para2"></a>The noble Lord confounded me by adding his Amendment No. 43 which, according to my grouping, I am not yet taking.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-20_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   In her further deliberations, will the Minister consider that there is no such thing as absolute best interests? She and others will accept that there will be a variety of views about what constitutes children's best interests under the groupings in the Amendment No. 43.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-20_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   Indeed, that is why the wording of the legislation is as it is&#151;greater minds than mine have reflected on how to ensure that we capture what we are trying to do. As I have already indicated, the UN convention will form part of the backdrop that will enable the best interests of children to be realised. However, I have promised to reflect on the matter further.
<P>

<a name="40504-20_para3"></a>Amendment No. 43 is specifically, as the noble Lord will know, to consider the accounts and views of others, such as parents, teachers, GPs, youth workers and so forth, who can represent younger children and those less able to represent themselves. There is nothing to stop the commissioner from doing that. Indeed, it would be generally understood that the commissioner would wish to consider the views of adults and organisations working with children. On that basis, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-20_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister and full of hope that we may be able to accommodate the problem to which I have drawn attention. Clearly, it is extremely unsatisfactory to use a word that has two meanings, to employ the word once and expect people to understand that both meanings are implicit in the text. I cannot help feeling that the skills of the department with the English language will enable a slightly clearer wording to be worked out. On the basis that I will also go away and think about the matter, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="40504-20_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Howe </B>   moved Amendment No. 11:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 1, line 9, leave out "the United Kingdom" and insert "England" 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-20_para5"></a><P>

<a name="40504-20_para6"></a>The noble Earl said: In moving this amendment, I shall also speak to a number of amendments that are grouped with it to which my name is variously attached.
<P>

<a name="40504-20_para7"></a>At Second Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, encapsulated what for many of us is one of the Bill's ultimate anomalies. In creating a Children's Commissioner for the United Kingdom rather than just England, the Government are entrenching the administrative divisions arising from devolution in an unnecessary and retrograde way. The devolution settlements for Scotland, Wales and <P>


<a name="column_1066"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1066</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Northern Ireland, as we all know, defined those matters that were to be devolved and those that were reserved to Westminster.
<P>

<a name="40504-20_para8"></a>As a consequence, the direct powers of the Welsh commissioner, for example, are, strictly speaking, confined to devolved matters such as health and social services. He lacks direct powers to act on matters falling under the remit of, say, the Home Office. But so that he can examine and address children's rights and interests in the round, he has the power to raise with the Welsh Assembly any matters of concern relating to non-devolved issues, leaving it to the Assembly to pass those concerns to the appropriate quarter as it wishes. These arrangements have worked quite satisfactorily, as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, told us. Under the Bill, however, it is envisaged that, all of a sudden, a Children's Commissioner for the United Kingdom will muscle in and assume responsibility for those issues relating to children in Wales that are non-devolved. Welsh children will, therefore, find themselves with not one champion but two, working so to speak side by side.
<P>

<a name="40504-20_para9"></a>In a Bill that purports to be child centred above all else, it is odd, to put it at its kindest, that the lines of accountability that the Government are proposing for these two commissioners appear to put legalistic considerations ahead of common sense. Children do not understand devolved and non-devolved powers; they want a simple system. They need to be able to access a single commissioner whom they regard as the champion of their interests across the board. They do not want to be confused by being told that if their complaint or concern relates to a Home Office matter they should talk to one person, and if it relates to a health matter they should talk to someone else. Apart from anything else, many complaints and concerns do not admit of such clear-cut divisions.
<P>

<a name="40504-20_para10"></a>The position for children in the devolved administrations is even more unsatisfactory than that because of the completely differing roles and powers envisaged for the UK commissioner as compared with his three counterparts. If the Government get their way, the UK commissioner will not be taking up the cudgels for Welsh children in at all the same sense as the Welsh commissioner currently does. That is because he will be concerned only with promoting awareness of the views and interests of children. He will not be concerned with safeguarding and promoting their rights and interests, although one must acknowledge that the Government's acceptance of Amendment No. 39 does tilt the situation in the right direction. Nor will the UK commissioner be able to undertake an inquiry into an individual child without the say-so of the Secretary of State. This difference in powers and functions is unsatisfactory enough in relation to children in England; it is doubly unsatisfactory in relation to children in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, because in practice it represents a dilution of the protection they currently enjoy from their own respective commissions.
<P>

<a name="40504-20_para11"></a>There is a simple enough answer to all of this, which is the one that I have proposed in my amendments. It is to say, "Let the three existing commissioners continue to fulfil their functions in their respective <P>


<a name="column_1067"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1067</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>territories. Do not confuse lines of accountability by making the English commissioner responsible for some matters in those territories but not others; but instead make him responsible solely for English children, and alongside that create a duty for all four commissioners to co-operate with one another on matters that affect more than one country, such as child poverty". That way, children will have consistency and simplicity instead of the more confusing and complex arrangements envisaged here.
<P>

<a name="40504-20_para12"></a>While we are about it, what exactly is meant by the phrases "children in Scotland" and "children in Northern Ireland" which occur in subsection (1) of Clause 5? Does "children in Scotland" mean children living in Scotland or children who happen to be in Scotland but who may in fact live in England or somewhere else? Supposing the Scottish commissioner has a concern about children who live in England but who attend a Scottish school, is that a matter for him to pursue or a matter for the English commissioner? Amendment No. 73 is intended as a means of probing the Minister for clarification on this issue. It is not clear to me where it is intended that the jurisdiction of the English commissioner should begin and end.
<P>

<a name="40504-20_para13"></a>I hope that the Minister will be able to see that there are serious issues here emanating directly from the devolution settlements which must be clarified and resolved. I hope that she can be helpful on these matters. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40504-20_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </B>   In speaking to the amendments in this group I should like to add to some of the points so clearly made by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. The England/UK commissioner will be responsible for 11.5 million children in England and another 700,000 children in Wales. These amendments reflect the complex nature of the devolution settlements. I hope that the Minister will see that they aim to work in the spirit of current arrangements to improve things for children in Wales.
<P>

<a name="40504-20_para14"></a>Today there was a debate in a plenary sitting of the Assembly and a Motion was passed unanimously&#151;by 50 votes to nil&#151;stating that the Assembly welcomes the additional powers that the Children Bill gives to the Assembly; rejects the proposal that the English Children's Commissioner should have statutory functions over non-devolved matters in Wales; and calls for the powers of the Children's Commissioner in Wales to be extended over non-devolved matters. That was in this afternoon's debate in the Assembly.
<P>

<a name="40504-20_para15"></a>Amendments Nos. 11 and 63 define England's Children's Commissioner as responsible for England, and allows the other amendments to ensure that children ordinarily resident in Wales go to the Children's Commissioner for Wales. I ask the Minister how Welsh children and the National Assembly for Wales were consulted on the commissioner's change in role as outlined in the Bill. How were they consulted over the significant differences in roles between the Children's Commissioner for Wales and the England/UK counterpart? Perhaps I <P>


<a name="column_1068"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1068</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>may remind the Committee that children in Wales and the National Assembly for Wales were involved in the appointment of the Children's Commissioner for Wales, who is independent of Welsh Assembly government.
<P>

<a name="40504-20_para16"></a>Amendment No. 65 ensures consistency across the UK. Amendments Nos. 71 and 71A have the effect of extending the commissioner's powers across Wales to allow the commissioner to make direct representations either to the Assembly or to the appropriate Minister of the Crown or government department where the matter is non-devolved. Amendment No. 72 provides consistency and fairness across the UK, ensuring communication and consultation on issues for the benefit of all children in the UK irrespective of where they ordinarily live. I appreciate the need for consistency and fairness across the UK. That is vital as the children concerned are moved around the UK and are often known to services by the very nature of their background. They often lack geographical or other security.
<P>

<a name="40504-20_para17"></a>Children cannot be expected to understand the complexity of arrangements. For them, and indeed for staff on the ground, it is much safer to know that all matters pertaining to safeguarding of children ordinarily resident in Wales are the province of the Children's Commissioner for Wales. Experience has shown that a child's issue or complaint frequently involves more than one agency and that it is not possible to separate devolved and non-devolved issues into neat compartments.
<P>

<a name="40504-20_para18"></a>When the child moves to reside in England they should come within the remit of the English counterpart. A small number of Welsh children are in secure units in England. It should be for the Children's Commissioner for Wales and the counterpart in England to sort out their bureaucratic arrangements to ensure that no child is lost to the safeguarding functions of an effective commissioner.
<P>

<a name="40504-20_para19"></a>Until now there has been no UK Children's Commissioner. So, the Children's Commissioner for Wales has developed informal working relationships with the Criminal Records Bureau; with the senior police, who are represented on area child protection committees and have a major role in safeguarding children in Wales; and with the governors of prisons in Wales over children in custody, because, sadly, there are still deaths in custody.
<P>

<a name="40504-20_para20"></a>Great thanks are due to the late Lord Williams of Mostyn whose amendment to the Children's Commissioner for Wales Bill, enacted in 2001, ensures that the Children's Commissioner for Wales can make representations to the Assembly on any matter, whether devolved or non-devolved, that affects the welfare and rights of children in Wales. If he deems it appropriate, he can apparently also make informal representations to UK government on these matters. Although the Wales Office has given reassurances that this can continue, it seems to be a courtesy that allows for his freedom of expression, rather than a formal route regarding issues that could be critically important.
<P>

<a name="40504-20_para21"></a>The England/UK commissioner will be able to consider, research and report on non-devolved matters as they relate to views and interests of children in <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Wales. This means that she or he will need to know the views of Welsh children on any such matter, which will inevitably duplicate with the Children's Commissioner for Wales who will be drawing on the same group of the population for views.
<P>

<a name="40504-20_para22"></a>From the perspective of a troubled 10 year-old, it would seem far simpler for the Children's Commissioner for Wales to ascertain the views of children in Wales on all matters. This is not about the powers of the individual post of Children's Commissioner for Wales; it is about the practical operational aspects of communication on non-devolved matters directly to Westminster. It seems inconceivable that an issue would come to the Home Office without the Children's Commissioner for Wales already knowing about it, especially if the child's language is Welsh. The England/UK Children's Commissioner would need to understand the context within which services are delivered in Wales and the way policies are determined and how they differ from those in England, although I do not see why the Children's Commissioner for Wales cannot report directly to the relevant Secretary of State on non-devolved matters arising in Wales.
<P>

<a name="40504-20_para23"></a>This Bill is built on the fundamental principle of safeguarding children. Let me use a specific example to illustrate this. Take Hillside, the secure unit in Neath, where there could be twin boys from Ystradgynlais who are primarily Welsh-speaking. They come from a family with a history of drug abuse on the part of their mother and her partner. One has been placed there by social services on a care order precipitated by behavioural issues that constitute a potential danger to himself. The other has been sentenced by the magistrates' court for persistent offending and is under the auspices of the youth justice system. If a concern arises regarding their management by the court or regarding a failure of the complaint system within Hillside, child A contacts the Children's Commissioner for Wales Office and the latter may decide to visit or to request information about a perceived failure in the system. If child B, his twin brother, wished to make such contact, he would be told that he should contact the English/UK commissioner, or that the Children's Commissioner for Wales could make representations on his behalf to the Assembly which may or may not choose to refer that on to the Home Office. It does seem inordinately cumbersome and confusing, particularly when the two children are from the very same household.
<P>

<a name="40504-20_para24"></a>If guidance is not co-ordinated, confusion arises and safeguarding fails. Most inquiries into child deaths over the years have repeatedly pointed to failed communication between agencies. In the aftermath of the inquiry of the noble Lord, Lord Laming, child protection committees in Wales, which comprise different agencies concerning devolved and non-devolved matters, received guidance. The police and probation service immediately received Home Office guidance in advance of the Assembly issuing guidance to the devolved agencies in relation to the delivery of Welsh services for children. One of the Children's Commissioner for Wales' roles is to ensure coherence <P>


<a name="column_1070"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1070</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in policy implementation. Clearly, any anomalies in timing or content between Home Office guidance and Assembly guidance leave children vulnerable.
<P>

<a name="40504-20_para25"></a>The devolution settlement was made in 2001 with good intentions but it could not foresee every possible scenario that would arise. Children's services form a good example of where events have now moved beyond the situations then envisaged. The reporting arrangements for the Children's Commissioner for Wales do not undermine the devolution settlement if he can report directly on non-devolved matters to Whitehall. But if we are hamstrung by the terms of his appointment, meaning that he has no role beyond the Assembly remit, the devolution settlement acts as a strait-jacket for coherence in Wales, which is against the Government's intent to make improvements for all.
<P>

<a name="40504-20_para26"></a>The role of the commissioner in Wales was debated in the Assembly in plenary. It was to avoid that confusion that the National Assembly for Wales voted on 5 November 2003 by 55 to nil to call for the strengthening of the powers of the Children's Commissioner for Wales to enhance his role&#151;a debate that was reinforced today. It also welcomed the intention of Westminster to introduce a Children Bill. So why, I ask the Minister, in the light of this unanimous view, have the Government decided to fragment rather than consolidate the role of the Children's Commissioner for Wales on behalf of Welsh children?

<P>
<A NAME="40504-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   I am not sure that I have anything to add, except emphasis, to what has already been said. I shall endeavour to sharpen the issue, if, indeed, it is not sharp enough already.
<P>

<a name="40504-21_para0"></a>There is no doubt that the UK scope of the Children's Commissioner begs the question of his relationship with the children's commissioners not only in Wales, which I am delighted to say we have heard a great deal about, but also with the children's commissioners in Northern Ireland and in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="40504-21_para1"></a>It is true that there is some definition of that relationship in Clause 5, but, as we have heard, some issues are still very unclear and there is substantial concern. For example, it is a major concern for Children in Wales, which spans a number of organisations concerned with children's rights and welfare.
<P>

<a name="40504-21_para2"></a>We know that the commissioners in the devolved administrations are confined in the scope of their operations to devolved matters&#151;that is their preserve. It is not altogether satisfactory because, as the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, said, children's problems often involve non-devolved areas, notably the police and the Home Office as well as devolved areas such as social services, education and health.
<P>

<a name="40504-21_para3"></a>When we established the office of Children's Commissioner for Wales, we were indeed assured that he would be able to make representations to the National Assembly on any matter in any area, devolved or not devolved, and that the Assembly could pursue it with the relevant Secretary of State at the UK level. As far as I am aware, that arrangement still <P>


<a name="column_1071"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1071</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>holds. I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, is right that assurances have been given that it will continue.
<P>

<a name="40504-21_para4"></a>Now we are to have a Children's Commissioner with a UK remit. He is debarred under Clause 5 from concerning himself with devolved matters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but not reserved matters, and so there is some overlap of functions and certainly a great deal of potential for confusion. The key question for me is the following. In future will the Welsh commissioner, for example, refer a matter touching a non-devolved area in Wales to the UK commissioner rather than to the Assembly? That must obviously be one line of approach. I am sure that in practice all the commissioners will work fairly harmoniously together and it may be helpful to the existing commissioners in different parts of the UK to have a fellow commissioner who operates at UK level but does not interfere in their local concerns. There are two sides to that particular coin.
<P>

<a name="40504-21_para5"></a>My noble friend's amendment proposes that the relevant commissioner should be confined to England. That might, indeed, clarify the situation but I am not absolutely certain that it would be wholly advantageous. I see potential benefit in the UK commissioner's umbrella role. After all, if the Welsh commissioner, the Scottish commissioner or the Northern Ireland commissioner see a problem in a non-devolved area, and if they talk about that problem to the UK commissioner, they will at least be talking the same language and I am sure that there will be a greater degree of understanding.
<P>

<a name="40504-21_para6"></a>With regard to the suggestion that the Welsh commissioner should have the authority to examine non-devolved matters, on the same basis as he examines the devolved matters in the devolved areas, the difficulty is obvious. He is an appointee of the Assembly. He is not directly responsible to or appointed by the Secretary of State responsible for those non-devolved areas. However, I am sure that those who have spoken already and others who may speak will support me in saying that the Government should explain the new commissioner's UK role more fully, because there is clearly widespread dissatisfaction. The last thing we want is for children to be discriminated against one way or the other, or to have to suffer the consequence of this administrative mix-up.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   The Bill has come about as a result of various cases where children have fallen between the care that should have been given to them by various authorities. One essential purpose of the Bill is to make sure that that does not happen again, and to clarify lines of responsibility.
<P>

<a name="40504-21_para7"></a>The Welsh commissioner's Bill had its genesis in the Waterhouse report, which was concerned with what had gone on in various establishments in north Wales, some of them very close to where I live. Bryn Estyn comes to mind, but there were other institutions as well where abuse had gone on. For 18 months, Sir Ronald Waterhouse led an inquiry into those problems. One of <P>


<a name="column_1072"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1072</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>his recommendations was that there should be a Children's Commissioner for Wales, to bring together the various agencies concerned with the welfare of children. That was done. It was the first Bill to come before your Lordships' House that was entirely devoted, following devolution, to Welsh matters.
<P>

<a name="40504-21_para8"></a>We had not been debating that Bill very long when it became quite clear that there was an element on the Government's side that was pushing to divide the responsibilities of the Children's Commissioner for Wales, so that the Home Office would not be affected by anything that he did. The argument was that the devolution settlement had taken place, and that we should do nothing to undermine it. I do not think that right. The very expression "devolution settlement" suggests that that is something fixed in stone for ever and a day. The Richard report, which we have just received in Wales, has demonstrated that the devolution settlement is unsatisfactory, and that very significant changes have to be made to it. Therefore, no one should be tied to the devolution settlement.
<P>

<a name="40504-21_para9"></a>There should be no no-go areas for the Children's Commissioner for Wales. We cannot divide the welfare of a child into devolved and non-devolved matters. The implications of the welfare of that child cross those barriers, which are only temporary and artificial and do not go as far as many of us in Wales want.
<P>

<a name="40504-21_para10"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, pointed out, Lord Williams of Mostyn&#151;I always have to call him Gareth Williams&#151;decided that it would be good to give the Welsh commissioner power to look into anything, devolved or non-devolved. The compromise was that, instead of going directly to Ministers in Westminster, anything that had to do with non-devolved matters should be reported by the Welsh commissioner directly to the National Assembly. It would be for it to decide whether to take it up in Whitehall.
<P>

<a name="40504-21_para11"></a>Last week, we had some very helpful discussions with the Government, and I pay tribute to them for the fact that they are prepared to be involved in discussions with all of us who are concerned with the Bill and its Welsh side. We were told in those discussions that, in fact, the Welsh commissioner has been able to approach Whitehall ministries directly. It may horrify some people&#151;that, on non-devolved matters, the Welsh commissioner should arrogate to himself powers that the original statute did not give him&#151;but it is the practice.
<P>

<a name="40504-21_para12"></a>If that is the practice, and if the Welsh commissioner requires statutory authority to approach Whitehall ministries directly&#151;the Home Office in particular, and the social security ministries, which are concerned very directly with the big problem of child poverty in Wales&#151;that is what the amendments seek to provide. The lines of authority and responsibility should be clearly drawn, and we cannot draw them on the basis of what was the devolution settlement some years ago but may not be the devolution settlement in a few years' time, if the Richard report is accepted.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40504-21_para13"></a>Consequently, let us forget about what is devolved and not devolved; let us consider what is in the interests of the children. By passing the amendments, let us recognise that children's problems cross all the boundaries. I hope that the Government will accept the amendments. If they do not and the amendments are pressed at a later stage, I assure them that we will support the amendments entirely.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   I have two very short points in support of what has been said. The first is to ask the Minister, when she thinks about the matter, not to look at it from above. She should not look at it from a government point of view of administrative convenience&#151;of the possibility of an overarching power, to which my noble friend Lord Roberts was attracted. I ask her to look at the matter from below, where the children are. They need one point to go to; they do not want a choice of points.
<P>

<a name="40504-21_para14"></a>The second matter which I would draw to the Minister's attention is that in setting up the Welsh commissioner, the Government provided for the Welsh Assembly to speak on his behalf on non-devolved matters. Therefore the Government are ready and willing to listen to the Welsh Assembly and to give great weight to what it says. Will the noble Baroness please pay great attention to what it said this afternoon, which is exactly in accordance with the amendment that my noble friend is moving from our Front Bench?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-21_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Prys-Davies: </B>   May I, from these Benches, support the amendment? In particular, I wish to reiterate some of the points that have been made by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, and the noble Lords, Lord Roberts of Conwy and Lord Thomas of Gresford.
<P>

<a name="40504-21_para15"></a>I believe that the merits of the amendment were first discussed when the Children's Commissioner for Wales Bill was before Parliament, so the amendment represents a further stage in a long-running campaign to extend the powers of the Welsh commissioner over devolved matters. I hope that that will be acceptable to the Government. Today we have heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, that the Welsh Assembly itself has unanimously called for the Welsh commissioner's powers to be extended over devolved matters.
<P>

<a name="40504-21_para16"></a>I find it difficult to understand why the Government&#151;who I have supported&#151;have persistently refused to extend the remit and powers of the Welsh commissioner to over non-devolved areas of policy. At Second Reading I listened carefully to my noble friend the Minister, who asserted as if it were a fact that this is due to what she described as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the logic of the devolution settlement".&#151;[Official Report, 30/3/04; col. 1210.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-21_para17"></a>
Many of us in Wales do not accept that there is such a logic or that the Government of Wales Act 1998 represents a final settlement that cannot be questioned. Indeed, the Government of Wales Act in no way has affected the power of Parliament to legislate as it sees fit. The principle of the sovereignty of Parliament makes it impossible for Parliament, through one Act, to limit the competence to pass another Act which may be inconsistent with the first <P>


<a name="column_1074"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1074</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Act. The functions of the Children's Commissioner for Wales should be determined by the children's legislation of today.
<P>

<a name="40504-21_para18"></a>I read the evidence of the Welsh commissioner, Mr Peter Clarke, to the Welsh Affairs Select Committee, given on 22 April. I shall not quote from the transcript, because it has not been edited, but I have no doubt that he is seriously concerned over whether this model will work. As I understand it, difficulties can arise in two main areas. First, the existence of two different commissioners, with different remits and powers, will cause genuine difficulties in the minds of children and young people. In addition, there may well be a preliminary issue to be settled&#151;to which the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, referred&#151;regarding whether an issue arises within an area that has been devolved or has been reserved. This can sometimes be a manifestly difficult question which may take time to resolve. Evidence of that is to be found in the report of the Richard commission.
<P>

<a name="40504-21_para19"></a>Unless the amendment is accepted by the Government, the Bill will not work as well as they believe it will. Therefore, I hope that they will give the amendment careful consideration.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-22_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   I am grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken in this debate. As was entirely predictable, it was a debate that carried conviction&#151;and had about it a touch of deja vu, when we recall the debates that we had in this House on the Welsh commissioner; but it is none the worse for that. It also has the irresistible appeal of allowing a short debate on the devolution settlement, however it is described. I will try to be clear, because the last thing that we would wish for at this stage would be to add to what I perceive is confusion about the role of the respective commissioners, particularly from the point of view of children. I take entirely the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Elton, that we must see this matter from the point of view of children and not as if we were administering something to them.
<P>

<a name="40504-22_para0"></a>Essentially what we are doing is to create an English commissioner with the scope to address non-devolved issues across the UK. He will work on behalf of children across the UK in those respects. I am happy to reiterate that he is the equal, and not the superior, of the other commissioners&#151;he is their partner. However, because he has the scope to work across the UK, he will be able to offer the children of the UK additional access to issues that are now reserved. These are extra powers, extra opportunities, and they are new powers that will ensure that he is the ally and the friend of children, as well as of the other commissioners. He is not a competitor; he is not muscling in. I want to reassure noble Lords that there is nothing in this Bill that will reduce, inhibit or compromise the powers of the existing commissioners.
<P>

<a name="40504-22_para1"></a>I want to quote something that has been quoted already&#151;from the evidence that was given to the Select Committee for Welsh Affairs. The Welsh Secretary for Health and Social Services made this absolutely clear when she said&#151;she was pressed very <P>


<a name="column_1075"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1075</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>hard on this point&#151;that the UK commissioner does not take anything away from the role of the Welsh commissioner. She or he will still be able to make representations to the Assembly about any matter affecting the rights or welfare of children in Wales, including non-devolved matters.
<P>

<a name="40504-22_para2"></a>So in relation to the question the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, raised: yes, he will still be able to take issues to the Assembly, and from the Assembly, with the support of the ally that he has in the Health Minister in Wales, to the Secretary of State for Wales. In response to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, who raised the question of his present access to other secretaries of state, I suspect that this is actually an informal arrangement that has grown as the Welsh commissioner has developed his powers. It is extremely important that we are clear that, just as now, he can take up those powers through the Assembly with the Minister's support, but in future he will also be able to call on the UK commissioner, who is there to help him by offering him the extra access to Parliament and across government in terms of non-devolved issues. How much extra benefit that is going to bring, to have formal access to the relevant Secretaries of State. Therefore, as I see it, this is not fragmentation at all. This is bringing extra strength and coherence to what is available for children. I address that point to the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay.
<P>

<a name="40504-22_para3"></a>It has been suggested that children might be confused by having two commissioners. We must resist this idea. It is a false argument. Whether children are confused about where they might go will depend a lot on how the commissioners in the devolved countries present the case themselves. They are expert already at communicating and liaising with children. They would not want to confuse the children in Wales and in Scotland by suggesting that there was a competitive, alternative route, unless they had already been able to talk to those children about what extra benefits that might bring.
<P>

<a name="40504-22_para4"></a>I sincerely believe that we want clear lines of communication. That will depend a great deal on the commissioners in the three other countries offering a seamless service themselves, working closely with the new commissioner, as we intend&#151;I shall come to that later&#151;so that the service offered to children is seamless. There will be no distinctions drawn. This will be a one-stop shop, as it were. This is work in progress, and the arrangements will have to be worked out, but let us not pre-judge this by suggesting that there will be wilful confusion that will somehow disadvantage children. We do not believe that that will be the case at all.
<P>

<a name="40504-22_para5"></a>Let me turn now to the short debate we have had on devolution and the powers of the Welsh commissioner. I take entirely the point noble Lords have made. Indeed, in turning to Amendments Nos. 71 and 71A, I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, on her ingenuity in opening this debate up to the Care Standards Act 2000, which is where it should be.
<P>


<a name="column_1076"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1076</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40504-22_para6"></a>We want to congratulate Peter Clarke on the start he has made, and on his extremely successful efforts to communicate with children and young people and to establish the profile of the commissioner. He is indeed an effective champion for children, but I should say&#151;and I say it in all sincerity&#151;that this is not the place to reopen the debate on the extent of the commissioner's powers in Wales, because it does mean opening the debate about the devolution settlement. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, does not like the term "devolution settlement". Indeed, he is right that the Richard commission is preparing the ground for future debate and that the Welsh Assembly is debating the issue. It is another matter in the development. Let us have that debate, but this is not the context in which to reopen the debate on the powers of the Commissioner for Wales. I took a great deal of comfort from the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, who gave a powerful explanation of why we should not do so. The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, will not therefore be surprised to learn that we cannot accept Amendments Nos. 71 and 71A.
<P>

<a name="40504-22_para7"></a>It will also not surprise Members of the Committee to learn that we are unable to accept Amendment No. 11 and the related Amendments Nos. 63, 65 and 72 because they seek to limit the scope of the commissioner's role in England. We are intent on extending the ability of children in the other countries to access new areas. The powers we have provided, which the amendments would remove, are important and the alternatives proposed would not fill the gap.
<P>

<a name="40504-22_para8"></a>Amendment No. 72 cannot be considered alone&#151;it has to be seen alongside Amendment No. 11 and, to a lesser extent, Amendments Nos. 63 and 65. Amendment No. 72 seeks to create a UK function to replace that which would be removed by the amendment to Clause 2. However, it is not clear whether Members of the Committee moving it want the Children's Commissioner to have a UK-wide role through working with other commissioners or for each to be wholly responsible for his own country. Therefore the amendment is flawed in its wording and, given the scope for confusion, it would not deliver an acceptable alternative. Members of the Committee might therefore want to withdraw it.
<P>

<a name="40504-22_para9"></a>Amendment No. 73 presents another form of confusion. We suspect the intention was that the commissioner should not become involved in the affairs of the devolved regions but in practice the amendment has the opposite effect. I will write to noble Lords on the amendment because it is a difficult and technical issue.
<P>

<a name="40504-22_para10"></a>I turn to the practical aspects that have been addressed by several noble Lords. How will the commissioners work in relation to each other's responsibilities? We have spoken of a memorandum of understanding&#151;and again it is work in progress. I can assure the Committee that we intend the four commissioners to take part in a shared and equal discussion to draw up appropriate protocols.
<P>

<a name="40504-22_para11"></a>It is difficult for us to be drawn into detail because the memorandum of understanding is to be owned by them. It will work if they each sign up to it. They are <P>


<a name="column_1077"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1077</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>independent commissioners and their programmes of work and priorities will grow from what children tell them, just as the noble Lord, Lord Elton, would want. Therefore, we do not see it as our job to tell them what to put in the memorandum of understanding, but we will be able to come back to the House as progress is made.
<P>

<a name="40504-22_para12"></a>In answer to a specific question asked by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, the definition of "children in Scotland" and Ireland is "normally resident" in those countries. The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, asked whether children in Wales were consulted about the new English commissioner. Our consultation was essentially through the Welsh Office, the Welsh Assembly and the Welsh Commissioner. A lot more consultation remains to be done and children in Wales were obviously involved in the consultation document, Every Child Matters. We shall certainly ensure that Welsh children are fully involved at all future stages.
<P>

<a name="40504-22_para13"></a>I want to return to my original theme; the relationship of the UK commissioner to the other devolved commissioners. As I said, we have created an English commissioner with scope across the UK to reflect and assist with issues that are devolved to the other three countries. We believe that they are useful and necessary powers, but I understand from what noble Lords are saying that they may find the language confusing and of concern. We do not believe that it is so, but having listened to the debate we will take it away and see if we could use clearer language to ensure that there is no room for confusion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-22_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </B>   While the Minister is on her feet I wonder if I might probe her a little further on the memorandum of agreement to which she referred. If the English commissioner came to an agreement with the commissioner in Wales and within that memorandum of agreement they wished to have direct lines of communication from Wales to the Home Office, for example, what would be the position with the Bill as it stands?

<A NAME="40504-23_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   A memorandum of agreement is essentially an administrative instrument and could not interfere with the distribution of powers and the way in which they were used.

<A NAME="40504-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   In that case, will the Minister interpret for me and other members what she meant when she said that the Government would come back to the House? At one stage when she was talking about the memoranda of understanding she said that they should grow naturally and she did not doubt that she would be able to come back to the House. Will that be during the passage of the Bill or on some other occasion, and if so, when?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-23_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   We do not have the timetable of the drawing up of any memorandum of agreement at the moment. It is very much work in progress. All I was <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>saying is that as the Bill's passage evolves, if there are things within our scope to come back and tell the House about the development, we certainly will do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I do not expect turf wars between the commissioners for Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England, but close co-operation. However, that is not the point. The importance of the commissioners is their ability to be advocates for children with the relevant Ministries; shall we say, the Home Office? Up to now, the Welsh commissioner has informally been able to take up the cases of individual children with the Home Office and obtain replies from that department.
<P>

<a name="40504-23_para0"></a>If the English commissioner comes in with no remit to take up individual cases, I postulate a system where there is a youth in a young offender institution in Wales who is being abused, either by fellow inmates or by staff. The Children's Commissioner for Wales could today take up that individual case and pursue it with the Home Office, not because of any statutory powers but because that is the practice that has grown up.
<P>

<a name="40504-23_para1"></a>I am sure that the English commissioner would be standing by applauding his efforts if that were to happen, but what would the Home Office reaction be? Would it not say to the Welsh commissioner, "I am sorry, chum, we listened to you before, but now that there is a UK commissioner whose responsibility is for non-devolved matters in Wales, we're going to listen to him. If he doesn't have the power to take up individual cases, tough&#151;we can only look at the situation as a whole"? The individual being abused has thereby lost the championship of the Welsh commissioner and it has not been replaced by the so-called United Kingdom commissioner.
<P>

<a name="40504-23_para2"></a>With the greatest respect to the Minister, of whom we are all fond in Wales and in the Committee, what communication has there been with colleagues in her party who are now in government in Cardiff&#151;I have to make the point that the Welsh commissioner came from the co-operation between the Liberal Democrats and Labour in Wales&#151;who are almost the majority party in the Assembly and who voted 50 to nil against the policy that she is putting forward today? Surely they have some influence on the way in which this Government are thinking here. If they do not, if anything undermines the devolution settlement, it is that this Government will not listen to what Members of their own party are saying in the National Assembly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-23_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   I can assure the noble Lord that we have very close contact with our colleagues in Cardiff. I was speaking to Jane Hutt only hours ago about the fact that the Welsh Assembly had given its full support to the Bill as a whole, and we welcome that. We are mindful of the feelings of the Assembly Members. I simply reiterate that Jane Hutt said very firmly in committee that there would be no change and no loss in the powers of the Welsh commissioner. I can do no more than reinforce that point. The commissioner will be able to go to the Secretary of State for Wales via the Minister, as he does now, with <P>


<a name="column_1079"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1079</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>whom he has informal relationships. However, the routes that are taken and the processes that are applied will be worked out between the commissioners.
<P>

<a name="40504-23_para3"></a>Although I hesitate to advise patience, I believe that during the course of the Bill we shall become clearer on some of these matters. However, I can assure the noble Lord that we are alive to these issues.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-23_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   As a Back Bencher, I am becoming increasingly confused. From what has been said, I am learning that there is a system in Wales which protects children and in which the children's champion has access, informally or formally, to offices with non-devolved functions relating to Wales. I am now told from the Front Bench opposite that, in spite of that, we are to introduce a new element and that the inter-relationship of the two is so symbiotic and complicated that we are not to know, while we are legislating for it, what it will be and we must wait to see how it evolves. I do not think that that is the way to legislate. We should make things simpler and not more difficult and more certain and not more uncertain.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-23_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   I very much hope that our consideration of the Bill is not confused; I do not believe that it is. When we come to debate later clauses, we shall consider the powers of the English commissioner to take up cases. In fact, the English commissioner will not be able to pursue individual cases in the same way as the Welsh commissioner can. That is one difference.
<P>

<a name="40504-23_para4"></a>The question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, concerned the ability of the Welsh commissioner to continue to do the things that he does at present. I have given assurances that that is absolutely the case and that there will be no change in that respect. The UK commissioner will have some additional scope, in terms of access, to represent issues which are now presently reserved. In that case, the relationships will be complementary and supportive. We shall pursue these issues at various stages of the Bill&#151;perhaps in more detail.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-23_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   I am most grateful to all noble Lords who took part in this debate. I was also grateful to the Minister when she said that she would look at the wording highlighted by noble Lords to see whether it could be made a little clearer. However, I am sorry that she resisted the thrust of the argument that I and others attempted to put forward.
<P>

<a name="40504-23_para5"></a>The Government's route here may be logical but I suggest that it is not the only logic. It depends on your starting point. If your starting point is the logic that flows from the devolution settlement, if I may use that phrase, you will end up with the Bill as it now is. If your starting point is the advocacy arrangements that children are likely to find simpler, more understandable and less confusing, then I believe that you end up roughly where I suggested in the amendments that I tabled. The arguments advanced by the Minister are essentially top-down arguments, and that is what I find unappealing about them.
<P>

<a name="40504-23_para6"></a>I do think that there is merit in re-examining the idea of each country having its own commissioner who fully understands the law of that country as well as <P>


<a name="column_1080"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1080</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>its language, culture and demographic characteristics, but the key point is that in each country there should be one person to whom children have easy access and who is in a position to take a holistic view of children's needs. That is the express view of the three current commissioners, who made a joint public statement at the end of March to that effect. The second speech by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, was extremely powerful in that context.
<P>

<a name="40504-23_para7"></a>I worry a little about the term "UK commissioner" because although the Children's Commissioner is described in the Bill as being responsible for children in the United Kingdom, Clause 5 makes it very clear that he will not be concerned with the views and interests of children who fall under the remit of any of the other three commissioners, in relation to devolved matters, nor may he undertake inquiries into any devolved matters. It is therefore a little hard to see how he can be in the fullest sense a UK commissioner.
<P>

<a name="40504-23_para8"></a>But we have explored this subject in some depth. We all have much to reflect on between now and Report and it is time to move on. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40504-23_para9"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-23_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   This might be an advisable time to withdraw, so I suggest that the Committee adjourn until 9.10 p.m.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-23_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Lucas </B>   moved Amendment No. 11A:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 1, line 9, at end insert "(or who are temporarily abroad as a result of the posting abroad of a parent with Her Majesty's Armed Forces or Diplomatic Services)"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-23_para11"></a><P>

<a name="40504-23_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 11A, I shall speak also to my other amendments in the group. These amendments have one thing in common, which is they have nothing whatever to do with each other. This is one of those groupings which is put in occasionally to hurry up the progress of the Committee&#151;particularly after any group that involves the Welsh. Perhaps I may take my amendments in order. So far as concerns the other amendments, I will listen and learn from other speeches.
<P>

<a name="40504-23_para13"></a>Amendment No. 11A concerns principally our Armed Forces. We currently have 25,000 children abroad with the Armed Services. The responsibility for matters relating to those children flows through the Ministry of Defence. Generally, the Ministry of Defence has other things on its mind, particularly when it comes to budgets; and children's matters rate somewhere below cigar lighters for generals. It commonly takes many years for improvements that we make in this House to children's services in the UK generally to filter through to the children of Armed Services personnel who are abroad on active service.
<P>

<a name="40504-23_para14"></a>We should take the opportunity of the Bill to shift that gently in the right direction. I have two amendments on the subject, one at this end of the Bill and the other right at the back end&#151;Amendment No. 247A. Amendment No. 11A would extend the remit of the Children's Commissioner to those children of personnel serving abroad. Obviously, when <P>


<a name="column_1081"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1081</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>they come back to the UK they will be under the commissioner in whose patch they happen to be living. I shall not try to rehearse the arguments of the previous amendment. While the children are abroad they have no one looking after them. We should try and do something about that.
<P>

<a name="40504-23_para15"></a>Amendment No. 18 is my second amendment in the group. It is really cheeky of me putting it in because I have absolutely nothing to teach the noble Baroness on the matter. I have long talked about the need for research and evidence-based policies. The noble Baroness has actually done something about it and has begun to bring that sort of attitude into the DfES, for which I am enormously grateful. The amendment merely raises that flag again and says, "When we are trying to put together policies for children, let us gather evidence and produce a solid evidence base for whatever it is that we are proposing to do. And let us allow and encourage the Children's Commissioner to promote and direct such research".
<P>

<a name="40504-23_para16"></a>My third amendment in the group is Amendment No. 32. It really just picks up an uncertainty that I had about the way in which the Bill was constructed, in that it is clear that the Children's Commissioner will not be in a position to offer advice to individual children. None the less, a lot of individual children are going to contact him. One gets into problems with data protection rights and child protection and so on.
<P>

<a name="40504-23_para17"></a>It is clear to me that whatever we do, it has to be possible for the office of the Children's Commissioner to direct or pass on children who come to him to those who are capable of dealing with individual children. I want to be absolutely sure that he has the powers and rights necessary to effect that passing on. It takes a lot of courage for a child to raise a matter with an adult. If the first time they do that, their voice falls on stony ground, their voice may never be heard again. I want to avoid that if at all possible.
<P>

<a name="40504-23_para18"></a>Amendment No. 41, which is my last amendment in this group, comes back to a discussion that we had on Amendment No. 17. Subject to correction, it is my strong recollection that it is the common practice to lay out in primary legislation how a commissioner, or a similar body, might report. It rather sets the relationship between that body and the Minister and the public at large. At the moment, the commissioner has a right to report to the Secretary of State, but he has no right in the Bill to report to the public. The noble Baroness said that there is nothing to stop him doing that; yes, but there is no right for him to do it. I want the Bill to be clear that the commissioner has the right to go public. He does not have to sit and wait for the Secretary of State. He will not be one of those people who puts a report in to the Secretary of State and two years later it is not published. We have entirely too much of that.
<P>

<a name="40504-23_para19"></a>This will be a commissioner who has a right to be heard. Although there may, out of courtesy and good practice, normally be some advance notice for the Secretary of State, and he might expect to get things a month or two in advance, he should not dictate the publication date. I advance those arguments with the <P>


<a name="column_1082"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1082</B></P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-24_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   I rise to speak to Amendments Nos. 12, 15, 16, 21 and 23 in this group, and to support the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, in particular in his Amendment No. 41. I too am in favour of a commissioner who has a right to be heard.
<P>

<a name="40504-24_para0"></a>The purpose of my amendments is to probe the scope and functions of the Children's Commissioner and the resources available to her or him. For example, how will the work of the commissioner influence government policy across all departments, their related quangos and other policy-making bodies? Will he or she be able to commission or sponsor other organisations to conduct research on his behalf? How influential will the commissioner be in practice? Where the issue concerns the interests of children, will he or she be formally consulted by bodies such as the Commission for Racial Equality, the Learning and Skills Council or the Advertising Standards Authority? How will that work in practice?
<P>

<a name="40504-24_para1"></a>Amendment No. 12 would further strengthen the dreaded "R" word&#151;children's rights&#151;by allowing the commissioner to require anyone exercising functions, or engaged in activities, affecting children to take account of their views and interests. It is all very well the commissioner having to take account of children's views and interests, but it would be good if he or she were able to require other people to do the same. Amendment No. 15 would replace the rather weak provision on considering and researching complaints procedures for children, with the altogether more robust duty to review and report on the effectiveness of advice and advocacy services, complaints procedures, inspection and whistle-blowing arrangements, so far as they relate to children. The same sort of thing applies to the Commissioner for Wales.
<P>

<a name="40504-24_para2"></a>Amendment No. 16 allows the commissioner to participate in matters affecting children on bodies to which he or she is appointed. It seeks to probe the Government's intentions for the commissioner's influence in relation to quangos and other bodies. It will allow the Minister, if she will, to give further clarification of the resources available to the Children's Commissioner.
<P>

<a name="40504-24_para3"></a>If the Government do intend that the commissioner will have influence over the work of such bodies as relate to children, will there be sufficient resources available to make such an involvement manageable? How does the role of the Children's Commissioner in relation to other bodies compare with the functions of other similar bodies such as the General Teaching Council? A key part of its role is to advise government and other education partners on issues affecting the profession, based on teachers' views and expertise.
<P>

<a name="40504-24_para4"></a>Amendment No. 21 is very similar to Amendment No. l8 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. That allows the commissioner to sponsor research by other bodies. But there is again the resource implication. The <P>


<a name="column_1083"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1083</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>proposed funding of the Children's Commissioner is minimal. To be effective both the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and mine would need funding. The resources available would have to be substantially increased.
<P>

<a name="40504-24_para5"></a>Amendment No. 23 was referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Rix, a little earlier and I added the word "all", which relates to "all children". The reason for that was to satisfy the many lobbying groups. We are all very grateful for their help. They wished to insert different kinds of children. When I was presented with such amendments it occurred to me what the Minister was likely to say in reply. I suspected that she would say that the provision would refer to all children and it was not necessary to specify particular groups.
<P>

<a name="40504-24_para6"></a>However, without a pro-active statement on equality in the Bill, disabled children, asylum-seeking children, children in custody, the children of ethnic minorities and Travellers' children, may not benefit fully from the work of the Children's Commissioner. Therefore, it would be very helpful if the noble Baroness would look favourably on inserting the word "all" to send out a message to all groups that every child is included in the measures encapsulated in the Bill. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response to all these amendments and in particular to Amendment No. 23.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, for including the word "all". As she well knows, I represent those with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities. They are included in "all children". I say to the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, that I would be much happier about Amendment No. 41 if it included at the end "in all accessible formats". That would make it available to people with all manner of learning difficulties and disabilities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-24_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   I shall speak briefly to Amendment No. 28. My noble friend Lord Northbourne had to leave early. I shall do my best to make one or two of the points which I am sure he would have made.
<P>

<a name="40504-24_para7"></a>The Children's Commissioner is to be concerned particularly in this area with the views and interests of children. Four or five examples are given. There is a real concern here which is why the amendment has been tabled. One area of a child's life which is not even remotely covered is that in the family. Referring to what was said on a previous occasion, I know that a major concern &#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-24_spnew3"></A><B> A noble Baroness: </B>   That amendment is in the next group.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-24_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   I am so sorry. I shall sit down.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-24_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   I shall speak in particular to Amendment No.19, which is included in this group. Clause 2(2) of the Bill specifies that one of the functions of the Children's Commissioner is to advise the Secretary of State on the views and interests of children. While that is not an objectionable provision in itself&#151;indeed, quite the contrary&#151;it seems not to <P>


<a name="column_1084"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1084</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>go far enough. Surely, the point of having a commissioner whose job it is to represent the views and interests of children, is that he should be able to do so not only to a single Minister but also, where necessary, across all departments of government.
<P>

<a name="40504-24_para8"></a>Any piece of planned-for legislation of any description which looks as though it will impact on the interests of children should be the commissioner's business. He should be consulted on it and have the right to make his views known to whichever department of state happens to be sponsoring it.
<P>

<a name="40504-24_para9"></a>I cannot see anything in the Bill that would enable the commissioner to adopt such a role or give him the right to adopt that role, yet it seems to me to be a role that is absolutely crucial. Who other than the commissioner will there be with a mandate to protect children's interests across government as a whole?
<P>

<a name="40504-24_para10"></a>I hope the Minister will be receptive to this point because, quite apart from the debates we have had on whether or not the commissioner should be concerned with children's rights, there is no earthly reason why he should not have a duty similar to that of his three counterparts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to make recommendations to government as a whole. That should be not only implicit but also spelt out in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40504-24_para11"></a>Turning briefly to Amendment No. 15, perhaps I may ask the Minister for some reassurance on Clause 2(2)(c) which, as she may know, has caused some fluttering in the dovecotes in certain educational circles. The point has been made to me very forcefully that in our schools there are already nationally endorsed procedures in operation for the handling of complaints; on top of those, many procedures exist at school level as well. So we are not therefore looking at a uniform set of arrangements. The power given to the commissioner to review complaints procedures could, if we are not careful, turn into something quite bureaucratic and far reaching. I can quite see why this provision has been included in the Bill, but it is a power that will need to be used with some care if schools are not to find themselves disrupted quite considerably.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-24_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </B>   The amendments in this group are very important. From Amendment No. 12 onwards they seek to strengthen the role of the commissioner. Amendment No. 15 is particularly important for alleged cases of abuse because it would protect children in a children's home, an area of great concern over recent years.
<P>

<a name="40504-24_para12"></a>It is with hesitancy that I seek reassurance that Amendment No. 16 would not undermine the independence of the commissioner, who should be free to go wherever she or he feels appropriate. I am concerned that appointments to bodies might result in a conflict of interest arising at some stage.
<P>

<a name="40504-24_para13"></a>I wish also to ask the Minister how, without the power to research, the audit requirements of the commissioner's office under public scrutiny would be met? Without the power to research, I am concerned that there could be an impedance of accurate data <P>


<a name="column_1085"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1085</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>collection and that the processes of inquiry would need to be expanded beyond the date of their workings of the role.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-24_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, has done the Committee a service by giving the number of children belonging to members of the Armed Forces and diplomatic and consular services who are at any one time serving overseas. In doing so he has added strength to the argument that the words "all children" should be in the Bill. I support his Amendment No. 41, which seeks to give the commissioner the right to publish material on his own initiative. This would helpfully strengthen the role of the commissioner for England or for the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="40504-24_para14"></a>I also support most or all of the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. Amendment No. 12 seeks to introduce the word "require". It seems to me that that would strengthen the role of the commissioner in a useful and practical way.
<P>

<a name="40504-24_para15"></a>Amendment No. 15 relates to independent advocacy. I should mention here a practice that has been going on in Northern Ireland for quite a number of years and to which I have previously spoken, in other contexts, in your Lordships' House. I refer to the provision of independent advocacy services for young people contained for long, short or medium periods in secure establishments. It has worked out very well in practice; the independent lay advocates have been trained by a voluntary organisation in Northern Ireland with which I happen to be connected. I think there is a strong case for learning from that experience in Northern Ireland, and replicating it or introducing it into England and perhaps even other jurisdictions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-24_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   I sympathise with much of the thinking that lies behind the amendments in this interesting group. It is very important that the commissioner is effective in promoting the views and interests of children, consulting as widely as possible and having a broad vision of what constitutes their needs and interests. Noble Lords have raised many different concerns about the coverage and nature of that role which is, in a sense, what binds the amendments together.
<P>

<a name="40504-24_para16"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, has raised an important point in Amendment No. 11A, which would ensure that the provision extends to service families overseas. Amendment No. 23, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, would ensure that the commissioner's role covers all children. There is a separate group of amendments on the role of the commissioner in relation to children with particular needs, to which the noble Baroness alluded. We will no doubt discuss the particular needs of those children on another occasion.
<P>

<a name="40504-24_para17"></a>I begin by assuring the Committee that the commissioner will indeed be the champion of all children, be they the children of service families living abroad, the children of families seeking asylum in the <P>


<a name="column_1086"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1086</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>UK, children who are looked after or those who go to the local school, nearest to where they were born. The commissioner's role will extend to all children. It is my understanding that the Bill's wording encompasses all children, but I will take that away and see whether inserting "all" adds anything to our deliberations, which I believe the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Rix, want me to say. However, noble Lords can rest assured that the wording of the Bill covers all children. There are no exceptions; noble Lords would not wish it otherwise, and neither would I.
<P>

<a name="40504-24_para18"></a>I am also very grateful for the detailed attention that noble Lords have paid to the way in which the commissioner carries out his or her role. Amendment No. 16 states that the commissioner should be able to sit on bodies that affect children&#151;something of concern to the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay&#151;and could be a consultee in inquiries or aspects of work carried out by other organisations or bodies.
<P>

<a name="40504-24_para19"></a>Amendment No. 21, along with Amendment No. 18 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, aims to allow the commissioner to support research and pilot projects. Amendment No. 41, also in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, seeks to ensure that the commissioner can promote discussion and express views across the whole of his or her remit. This relates to Amendment No. 19, to which the noble Earl, Lord Howe, spoke; it seeks assurance that the commissioner will advise and consult with all government departments on matters relating to children.
<P>

<a name="40504-24_para20"></a>I agree with them all. The commissioner should be able to do these things, assuming that this is what children want the commissioner to do. The commissioner's job is to be responsive to and face children in all the work that he or she undertakes. There is nothing to stop the commissioner doing the things that I have identified. I hope that with those reassurances, the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<A NAME="40504-25_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   Before the Minister sits down, will she confirm that were the commissioner to serve on other bodies in his or her capacity as commissioner representing the interests of children, he or she would not be likely to be compromised in any way in terms of conflict of interests, as was suggested by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff? Will the Minister say whether such attendance would be properly resourced by the Government?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-25_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   On the second point, it will be for the commissioner to determine how the resources should be spent. It is quite within the remit of the commissioner that, if he felt that it was important to bring to the attention of the Secretary of State the fact that he wished to perform a function, resources could be discussed. However, it would be wrong of me to commit the Government at this point. It is up to the commissioner to decide whether he wishes to sit on bodies or take part in other ways, and not up to us to constrain or prescribe. However, if <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>there is concern about this matter, perhaps we can explore it outside the Committee to see whether I have understood the noble Baroness's concerns.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-25_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   Perhaps I could add a question? Those who sit on non-departmental bodies and other groups have a primary responsibility towards that group. I would be concerned if the commissioner represented something other than the work of that group. Therefore, I think the matter needs teasing out and thinking through. There could be real conflicts of interest, which, if not thought through, would cause real difficulty, both for the body and for the independence of the commissioner.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-25_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   It is always interesting when an amendment goes in a different direction to the one I presumed. Our view is that the commissioner will make a decision about which bodies to sit on. However, in the light of what has been said, we should either correspond or meet to tease out the issues&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, just said&#151;to be absolutely clear. I hope that that satisfies noble Lords.
<P>

<a name="40504-25_para0"></a>Under the legislation as it stands, the commissioner can do all those things, including issuing reports on subjects and engaging with all government departments outside of the annual report to Parliament. Rather than put them on the face of the Bill, we feel that it is important for the commissioner to be free to respond to children and young people in deciding what to do. The commissioner is free to do those things. Therefore, I hope that those particular amendments can be withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="40504-25_para1"></a>We have already dealt with Amendment No. 43. Turning to Amendment No. 11A, I want to reassure the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, that it is our firm intention that children temporarily living abroad while their parents are on official duty overseas will have access to the commissioner should that be appropriate. Because we have not had time between the tabling of this amendment and this debate, I shall check the legal technicalities of the children's situation. Should it be necessary, the Government will introduce an amendment to ensure that they are properly catered for, as the noble Lord would expect.
<P>

<a name="40504-25_para2"></a>Amendment No. 32 gives me a chance to clarify a little more of the commissioner's role. It is to promote awareness of the views and interests of children, and to make children aware of this function and of how they may communicate with the commissioner. Although it is inevitable that children will get in touch about individual problems, as we have made clear in all of our discussions and statements, we do not want the commissioner to be drawn into such inquiries. That is not an appropriate role in this context. There is no reason why the commissioner should not advise on general sources of help available for different kinds of problem, but we would not want him to have a formal referral role. Our understanding is that the commissioner could already offer general advice, but I am double-checking the position to ensure that that is correct. If there is anything in the existing Bill to prevent the commissioner providing such general advice, the <P>


<a name="column_1088"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1088</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government will introduce a suitable amendment. On that basis, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw Amendments Nos. 11A and 32.
<P>

<a name="40504-25_para3"></a>Amendment No. 12, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, and supported by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, would make sure that the commissioner makes a difference to the way in which services take account of children's views. I share that intention, but it has to be for the services themselves to change. Taking account of children's views will be central to being able to deliver effective services and should be part of performance management processes. It would be wrong for the commissioner to act as another formal inspectorate, which is what would happen, albeit that is not entirely what the noble Baroness planned. That is not to say that the commissioner should not comment on how well this is achieved and approach services, inspectorates and the Government with views on what they need to do to improve. With that reassurance, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw that amendment.
<P>

<a name="40504-25_para4"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 15 would expand on the particular focus that the commissioner will have on ensuring that complaints procedures are accessible to children and young people. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, raised a particular concern which I hope I will address in the course of my comments.
<P>

<a name="40504-25_para5"></a>The intention behind the existing subsection (14)(c) is to reflect the commitment in the Green Paper that complaints processes should be looked at by the commissioner to assess whether they work for all children and young people. Clearly the advice and support available is crucial to this and would be included in what the commissioner would look at in carrying forward this part of the commissioner's remit. There is nothing to stop the commissioner looking at after-services such as statutory advocacy provision; indeed, those might be especially relevant in his specific role in supporting children who have more difficulty in making their voices heard. However, this specific remit is perhaps relevant to particular groups of children. On that basis, we would not wish to see this provision on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40504-25_para6"></a>With those assurances&#151;and, I hope, reassurances to the noble Earl&#151;on the intent behind this part of the function of the commissioner, I hope that noble Lords will feel able to withdraw or not to press their amendments in this group.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-25_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I am very grateful to the noble Baroness for the explanation she has given particularly on Amendment No. 11A. I entirely accept what she said on Amendment No. 18. On Amendment No. 41, I shall go away and check my precedents. I will probably not come back on it when I discover that she is right and I am just being argumentative.
<P>

<a name="40504-25_para7"></a>I have remaining concerns on Amendment No. 32. When an adult rings up one might say, "Sorry, no; it is not for us. Why don't you try so and so?". An adult is well capable of dealing with that sort of advice and, particularly if they are provided with a telephone number, will pick it up again. I think that children are rather <P>


<a name="column_1089"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1089</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>different, particularly children who have any variety of distress, problem or difficulty. It can require a great deal of bravery to make one of these calls. If the first one happens to be to the Children's Commissioner whereas it should have been to Childline, it is very difficult to say to the Children's Commissioner, "No, you cannot take their telephone number. No, you cannot give it to Childline. All you have to say is, 'Don't talk to us. There's a list of other people you might talk to on our website'". I think that that is second best. I know that it is difficult to act as a referral service, and I certainly would not suggest that that be done for adults. However, I think that to drop children back to stage one where they have to summon the courage again and find someone else to approach is not the best we can do.
<P>

<a name="40504-25_para8"></a>I shall certainly return to the issue. I very much hope that the Government will have a chance to think through the matter again. However, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40504-25_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: There is a companion amendment, Amendment No. 26, which does the same thing slightly later in the Bill. Amendment No. 24 tackles Clause 2(3), which lists the things with which the commissioner,

The amendment then provides a list of various matters that we are supposed to care about in relation to children. However, in that list there is absolutely no mention of family.
<P>

<a name="40504-25_para14"></a>I have no particular attachment to the wording; I suspect that the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, in his amendments, has done it better than I have. However, it is astonishing to make a list of things that are important to children and not include family. Family modulates so many of the other things that are in here to begin with. Furthermore, it has an enormous importance on its own&#151;how things are going in the family; how relationships are going in the family; how supportive the family is being of a child. Many of the things that go wrong for children are due to difficulties in the family. Many of the other things that can go wrong for children are best dealt with by support given in the family. It is so crucial and central to a child's wellbeing that I am really quite astonished that we should have got to a point where we can list things that are important to a child's wellbeing and leave out family. I very much hope that this will turn out to have been an oversight. I beg to move.

<P>

<a name="40504-25_para15"></a>It certainly seems fairly odd, if I can put it that way, that this major aspect of a child's life has been left out. Referring to what the noble Lord, Lord Elton, said on <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>an earlier amendment, I rather wonder whether it is because we are concerned, as indeed we are, with those who are disadvantaged and whose rights do not exist within their family and so on. But we need to remember that this Bill is not just about those children; it is surely about all children. The vast majority of children have supportive families. Perhaps the need there is for them to be better supported.
<P>

<a name="40504-25_para16"></a>We need to remember that most of the important things in life&#151;love, security, encouragement, the boundaries that need to be set&#151;also come from within the home. Therefore, it seems a little odd to ignore the views of children on this very important issue in their lives. Perhaps the Minister will be able to explain why this matter has not figured. One begins to wonder whether the right questions were asked if the Government have managed to leave out such an important chunk of the normal child's life. I leave it at that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-26_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Massey of Darwen: </B>   I fully appreciate what this amendment is trying to do. Of course, the family is tremendously important in a child's life. However, it raises the question of what is a family. Some children will not be in a family as many of us would possibly define it. I should like to tease this out some more and consider what we mean by the family. For example, there are children in care and children who are in many different kinds of families. Although I fully understand what the proposers are saying, I should like further definition on the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-26_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Thornton: </B>   My problem with this amendment&#151;I may be misunderstanding its meaning&#151;is that the Bill is concerned with taking into account the views and interests of children. It is not that it excludes the family, but it is about children. What concerns me is that we might be tying ourselves into a situation where we have to take account of the views of children and families when what we really need to do is take account of the views of children.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-26_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   I hope that I may add one very small point. The point that I was trying to make was that it is the children's views of family that seem not to have been included in the things that are relevant to their wellbeing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-26_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   It follows from what the noble Baroness, Lady Massey of Darwen, said that the fact of children not being in a family is equally important. Perhaps we have to find a new way of formulating this whole subsection. But one cannot ignore what may be the biggest factor of all in a child's life when setting out the things that should be taken into account.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-26_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   I have some concerns about the amendment because we are again trying to make the commissioner universally responsible for all things. When children in families want help it is because they are experiencing difficulty. They usually want one to leave their family alone in other circumstances. I should like us to be quite clear what we are saying in the amendment, if we suggest <P>


<a name="column_1091"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1091</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the commissioner should have responsibility for families as well as all the other aspects relating to the welfare of children. We could be really into the nanny state if we make the commissioner responsible for all family life as well as everything else.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-26_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   We on these Benches believe that the best interests of children usually lie within their families. There are a few exceptions to that, which I hope that some measures in the Bill will seek to address. That said, because of the difficulty of referring to "the family", I think that "the welfare of the child", which is referred to in the Bill, might cover the issue. We are all agreed that that welfare lies, on the whole, within the bosom of their family.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-26_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   I should like to add my voice in support of the amendments, particularly those in the name of my noble friend. He is absolutely right in all that he said. Growing up in a loving family is one of the most important benefits that a child can receive for his emotional development and general well-being. I find it strange that there is no mention of family anywhere in the clause.
<P>

<a name="40504-26_para0"></a>By family, I do not think that we mean only parents, although parents are an integral part of what a family is. We also mean brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, grandparents and cousins. For those who live in foster families, it is the foster parents and perhaps their relations. We mean a one-parent family in some cases. Any child who grows up not experiencing the security, example, comradeship and love of his own family has missed out on a very great deal in life. It is not enough to look at the aspects of well-being listed in subsection (3) and try to convince ourselves that such things are somehow subsumed under the headings that we find there; they are not. We need to spell out in terms that a child's family life is a vital and irreplaceable part of his happiness and well-being.
<P>

<a name="40504-26_para1"></a>It worries me sometimes when certain people talk about the best interests of the child being paramount. They do so in a way that appears to assume that one can define a child's best interests in total isolation from the relationship that he has with his parents and family. I had that worry when we were debating the adoption legislation two years ago, and I have it now.
<P>

<a name="40504-26_para2"></a>The public authorities, whose function it is under Clause 6 to improve the well-being of children, should not be allowed to suppose that their objectives can be achieved without reference to a child's place in his or her own family. Everything that they do should be based on the presumption that families do best by being kept together, and that only in extreme circumstances should the removal of a child from his family be contemplated. Only by placing "family" in Clauses 2 and 6 can we be assured that social services, the police, the commissioner and other authorities will be obliged to pay explicit regard to that presumption.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-26_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   May I make a rather wild suggestion at this late hour? Clause 2(3), which is on page 2, states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Children's Commissioner is to be concerned in particular under this section with the views and interests of children so far as relating to the following aspects of their well-being".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-26_para3"></a>
It then lists those aspects in paragraphs (a) to (e). Could we not add, in a paragraph (f), "their relationship with a family"? That would solve the entire problem.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-26_spnew8"></A><B> The Earl of Listowel: </B>   I support my noble friend's amendment. As I said earlier, I am concerned that it is simply too easy to isolate children when one speaks of them and to forget that most of the time they are within some caring context&#151;with an adult or parent caring for them. Government policies on parents and supporting a child poverty strategy are very welcome, but when the financial incentive for parents, even of a child under one, is to go to work rather than to look after the child&#151;although, I believe that that is beginning to change&#151;it is easy to slip into isolating children and forgetting what they are in this context.
<P>

<a name="40504-26_para4"></a>There is a culture in this country that perpetuates the undervaluing of those who provide care&#151;whether they are parents, social workers or foster carers. Compared with the continent, we simply do not do enough to value the people who provide care for children. That is another reason why I shall listen with great interest to the Minister's response, because we need to build that culture of recognising the vital role that parents and carers play for children. I am worried that if we do not include "family" within that, we might be missing an opportunity to build that consensus for valuing more the support for children that is provided by families and other carers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-26_spnew9"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Chester: </B>   I rise briefly to support entirely the intention behind the amendment. I am told that elephants live about as long as we do, but whereas baby elephants, when they are aged four or five, are able to go off into the jungle on their own to fend for themselves, our children are dependent on parents, or whoever is in their place, for three or four, or even, nowadays, five times as long as is the case with elephants.
<P>

<a name="40504-26_para5"></a>Indeed, those patterns of dependency for children and young people are being ever more enhanced&#151;and top-up fees will simply add one more force to that, as has been said. Fundamentally, if we are to look at the wellbeing of children, we have to look at the close network of support that society seeks to provide for them, which, in most cases&#151;and ideally&#151;would involve the family. But the term "family", as has been hinted, embraces both the nuclear family, the immediate parents, and that which we have so often lost in our society, the extended family&#151;the wider network of relations. There is an old African proverb that it takes a village to raise a child.
<P>

<a name="40504-26_para6"></a>The thrust of the Government's proposals for the Children's Commissioner is to give that person a broad, wide-ranging, co-ordinating and overseeing brief; not to try to over-define or tie down but to give that person something of a free hand to look at the overall experience of children in our society and to <P>


<a name="column_1093"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1093</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>help to formulate proposals. That means that the relationship of children to family must be part of the remit. I have my doubts about whether it should be specified as simply one more on a list, for reasons that have been given. But there is no doubt that from these Benches we can support the fundamental thrust of the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-26_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   These are important amendments. Of the two approaches, I slightly favour that set out in Amendment No. 28 and I agree with my noble friend Lord Rix that we need to consider family life insofar as it affects the wellbeing of children. That is not only what we need to consider, but what the commission needs to consider in future. I hope that that approach will go some way toward satisfying my noble friend Lady Howe of Idlicote.
<P>

<a name="40504-26_para7"></a>Earlier in our discussions the Minister talked about the commissioner having a strategic or systemic approach to the children who he has to take into account. We can generally agree that that is the right approach, but I would like to see the commissioner considering family life, because it is the principal source of the love and nurturing that children require if they are to develop into satisfactory, reasonable adults.
<P>

<a name="40504-26_para8"></a>In order to try to help the Minister's consideration of this question, I will recall what was happening 30 years ago, sometimes slightly more, when I and many others were deeply involved in questions of homelessness, housing aid and advice. We defined homelessness not just for single people but for families, in terms of normal family life. We asked ourselves, "Do a given family's living conditions allow them to enjoy normal family life?". If they did not have sufficient living space, they were deprived of normal life and therefore ought to be considered to be homeless, regardless of whatever the statutory definition of homelessness might have been at that time. I offer that to the noble Baroness the Minister, in the hope that it may be helpful.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-26_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   That was a singularly helpful illustration. Looking at the Bill, it seems to me that the process we are now looking at starts in Clause 2(2)(a). The children's commissioner may, in particular, under this section,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"encourage persons exercising functions or engaged in activities affecting children to take account of their views and interests".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-26_para9"></a>
We are talking about their relationship with their family. The commissioner will presumably have lines to the housing authority as well as to the education authority, the Probation Service and others who impact on the family, and will be able to make them aware of what the effect of their proposals may be on the child, as the child sees it. That could be a very helpful dimension. I think my noble friend's amendment is an exceedingly good one. Whether or not it is finessed in the way the noble Lord, Lord Rix, suggests or not, I leave to others to guess.

<A NAME="40504-27_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   I hesitate to prolong this, but I think we recognise that paragraphs (a) to (e) reflect the consultation process which was engaged in before the Bill, and the views of children as they were expressed then. Nevertheless, regarding the phrase "views and interests" of the children, we have already had a question raised on what the word "interest" means: whether we mean their interest&#151;that is, their wishes or ideas&#151;or the best interests, meaning the things that most reflect well upon the lives of children. That point was also made in relation to an amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. Speaking not in a party political sense but personally, I come to a similar conclusion to that of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester; namely, that somewhere in this Bill we need to make it clear&#151;and it may be that it is there already, I can see the Minister looking very speedily through her Bill&#151;that we recognise the enveloping importance of the family and the life of the child.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-27_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   I was looking speedily to make sure that I referred to the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, when I get to that particular section in my notes. I am very grateful to all noble Lords who have participated in this debate&#151;not least the noble Lord, Lord Rix, for coming up with an amendment that was promptly supported in the Committee. That goes beyond the manuscript amendment by my reckoning, but it was none the less an important part.
<P>

<a name="40504-27_para0"></a>The purpose of these amendments is to add "family or family life" to the description of what we mean in the concept of well-being. It is an important concept in this Bill and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, said, we defined it in terms of the outcomes that children and young people told us they wanted to achieve. Our ambition is that a common understanding of outcomes should underpin the work of the commissioner and be a focus for the co-operation arrangements in Clause 6.
<P>

<a name="40504-27_para1"></a>Amendment No. 24 from the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and Amendment No. 28 from the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, fall in Clause 2. Amendment No. 86 from the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and Amendment No. 89 from the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, fall in Clause 6. I entirely sympathise with the concerns of Members of the Committee that we acknowledge the primary importance of families, parents and carers to the outcomes achieved by children. I was only sorry that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, did not mention step-parents. As a step-mother, I take that personally&#151;but I am willing to retract my personal outrage on the basis that I am sure he meant to include them.
<P>

<a name="40504-27_para2"></a>However, I do not believe it is appropriate to amend the definition of "well-being" in this way. It is a direct translation of the outcomes which we set out in the Green Paper, Every Child Matters: being healthy; staying safe; enjoying and achieving; making a positive contribution; and economic well-being. As noble Lords heard me say earlier, that came from the extensive consultation exercise.
<P>

<a name="40504-27_para3"></a>Amendments Nos. 24 and 28 also raise the question of whether the commissioner should consider family, family life or support to families to be within his remit. I can assure noble Lords that it can be. The <P>


<a name="column_1095"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column 1095</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>commissioner will be free to determine the issues in which he takes an interest and this could well include children's views about what should or should not be done to support families and family life. There would be nothing to stop the commissioner from pursuing this as a proper topic for investigation, discussion and debate.
<P>

<a name="40504-27_para4"></a>I turn to Clause 6 and Amendments Nos. 86 and 89. The outcomes are used again here to illustrate the scope and range of areas in which agencies will be co-operating to improve well-being. For the reason I have already given, I do not believe that we should alter the definition of "well-being". However, I agree with noble Lords that families and parents are extremely important in the context of the co-operation duties which are designed to improve services for children and young people.
<P>

<a name="40504-27_para5"></a>Indeed, as I am sure noble Lords will know better than I, support for families and parents is a particularly good example of the kind of work likely to be done better as a result of better co-operation. In particular, the voluntary sector has real expertise in this field. We have also made it clear that parents and families should have a clear say in the way services are delivered.
<P>

<a name="40504-27_para6"></a>We know from our experience with programmes like Sure Start that the involvement of parents and families is critical to the success of much of the innovative work we are taking forward; for example, through our children's centres and extended schools. We will expect local authorities and their partners fully to consult children, young people and their families in developing services. I am happy to confirm that this will be made clear through the guidance associated with Clause 6.
<P>

<a name="40504-27_para7"></a>I hope your Lordships will agree that amending the list of outcomes is not the right approach. However&#151;here I come to the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas&#151;I agree with the right reverent Prelate and other noble Lords that it would be appropriate to put something on the face of the Bill to reflect the importance which the Government and services should place on parents and families. I undertake that the Government will consider how we can do that. I am sure, too, that we will return to this topic in detail when we debate amendments to Clause l6 in particular. In the mean time, with that reassurance as the way forward on this <P>

<A NAME="40504-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   I am grateful to those who have spoken. I am immensely impressed that we should have had such a varied and wide-ranging debate at ten o'clock at night. For all noble Lords to have stayed for it is impressive and I hope that it has impressed itself on the Minister. I believe that it may have done.
<P>

<a name="40504-27_para8"></a>If this Bill leaves this House with the word "family" in it and with real intent in its expression, we will have made a significant improvement. I have no particular affection for sticking it in this list&#151;it is a question of how it lies in the Bill and its overall effect on it.
<P>

<a name="40504-27_para9"></a>I must carry out some research and discover what questions children were asked that they should not mention "family" in the list. Perhaps if it is not somewhere obvious, the Minister could drop me a note. We will doubtless return to the matter again in Committee and on Report, but for now I beg leave to go home to bed.

[The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Baroness Fookes) in the Chair.]
<P>

<a name="40504-27_para21"></a>Clause 72 [Power to require authority to apply for civil enforcement powers]:
<P>

<a name="40504-27_para22"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 72 shall stand part of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-27_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </B>   My noble friend Lord Bradshaw gave notice that we intended to oppose the Question that this clause should stand part of the Bill. I should say at this point that that is not because we have any particular problem with the clause, rather that it provides us with an opportunity to raise the issue of a situation that has developed and which could be addressed in the Bill. I refer to the question of the enforcement of emission standards under clean air legislation.
<P>

<a name="40504-27_para23"></a>The current position is that local authority officers, who are usually environmental health officers, are responsible for testing vehicles and enforcing standards, but they do not have the power to stop vehicles. That must be done by the police with regard to the private car, although officers of the relevant vehicle standards unit can stop lorries and buses. We should like to see this anomaly addressed.
<P>

<a name="40504-27_para24"></a>It is certainly the case that, with reduced police availability to undertake this sort of work, the numbers of vehicles being pulled over is quite low. This situation could well get worse once the Bill is enacted. As we move into the civilianisation of certain areas, it is even less likely that the police will be available to stop vehicles they think are guilty of breaking the clean air legislation. Those are the reasons why we oppose the Question.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-27_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   While I am sympathetic to the idea of emissions testing, I am not sure I am sympathetic to the argument put forward by the noble Baroness. It is my experience that, when an emissions test is undertaken, usually it is sited somewhere most inconvenient for the rest of the traffic. Either it is done during the rush hour or it is set up so that it causes a traffic jam. That happens when the police are there; God knows what would happen if they were not there. The idea seems to be that local authority officials should be able to stop the traffic whenever and wherever they wanted. That would, I think, <P>


<a name="column_GC180"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC180</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>immediately create conflict with the traffic manager and so forth. Strict rules would have to govern the arrangement.
<P>

<a name="40504-27_para25"></a>Unless I can be persuaded otherwise, I am in favour of ensuring that the police are responsible for stopping traffic while local authority officers undertake the emissions tests. We shall otherwise end up with even more snarled-up traffic, which is not the purpose of the Bill.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-28_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   I am in a muddle over this because I had thought that the Vehicle Inspectorate could not stop lorries; the police have to do so. The noble Baroness has put me right on that point.
<P>

<a name="40504-28_para0"></a>Has my noble friend seen the press reports published over the past few days concerning the police's fear that the Bill may reduce the number of policemen allowed on traffic duties to such an extent that it will affect their ability to stop cars and thereby apprehend criminals? There are problems here which need to be addressed. I would have no problem with local authority officials stopping any vehicle if they felt that it was contravening emissions regulations. To be frank, they do not do it at the moment because they cannot do so, and I do not believe that the police do it very much in any case. That is a line that we have taken throughout the Bill. I shall be interested to hear what my noble friend says in response.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-28_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   The role of civil enforcement officers appointed under Clause 73 will be confined to the enforcement of traffic contraventions that are subject to civil enforcement by virtue of Clause 70. There is no question of them being empowered to stop vehicles. Clause 75(4), which deals with the notification of penalty charges, states that regulations may not confer power to stop vehicles.
<P>

<a name="40504-28_para1"></a>Parliament recently concluded that civilians should be allowed to stop vehicles on the road only in very limited circumstances. The issue was considered in connection with the Police Reform Act 2002. Among other things, this gave chiefs of police the ability to authorise certain officials in the Department for Transport to stop vehicles. These officials are in the department's Vehicle and Operator Services Agency, and they can stop vehicles only for the purposes of checking roadworthiness documentation. In theory, VOSA officials could stop vehicles on behalf of local authorities. However, the practical fact of the matter is that they have their own tasks to perform. There would be limited scope for them to assist authorities. Therefore authorities will have to rely on the police to assist with roadside emissions testing.
<P>

<a name="40504-28_para2"></a>My noble friend Lord Berkeley raised the question of reduced police activity due to the Bill. The Bill should not reduce enforcement of criminal activity by the police. Precise allocation of resources is for chief constables. One of the reasons for civil enforcement is that the police do not have the resources to do this properly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-28_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   I thank the Minister for that reply but I think that, to some extent, he is putting his head in the sand. In fact, things are moving apace. Consultation is <P>


<a name="column_GC181"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC181</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>going on with the police authorities about the future role of the police. It is quite clear in that&#151;this emanates from the Prime Minister's office&#151;that the role of the police in traffic enforcement is to be severely curtailed and transferred to local authorities.
<P>

<a name="40504-28_para3"></a>I have no wish to see vehicles stopped where they will cause traffic jams, but, despite the misgivings of the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, there are now devices available that can tell an environmental health officer which vehicles are causing emissions to rise well above statutory limits and therefore ought to be stopped for a full test to be undertaken while the vehicle is halted. There is no reason to halt the vehicle at a point where there will be a traffic jam. The device that picks out the vehicle could be placed where it is most convenient, and the vehicle could then be stopped further along the road where the test can be done without causing congestion.
<P>

<a name="40504-28_para4"></a>I accept, of course, that the purpose of the Bill is to reduce congestion, and one does not wish to add to it. However, the Government have passed clean air legislation and introduced a Bill&#151;I think it is the London Local Authorities Bill, which is in the list of Bills awaiting Royal Assent&#151;which contained a clause that allowed the stopping of vehicles. That clause was deleted because it was opposed by one Member in the House of Commons, and in order to get the Bill through, the Government left the clause out. Furthermore, in some parts of London chiefs of police are telling local authorities that they will not make police constables available for vehicle testing.
<P>

<a name="40504-28_para5"></a>On the one hand, there is an Act that requires a local authority to have a clean air area and to enforce it, and on the other hand there is a set of circumstances that mean that it is extremely unlikely, but not theoretically impossible, to enforce that. Bearing in mind that local authorities get very little money from enforcing Clean Air Act regulations, I press the Minister to reconsider the matter and tell us on Report how he intends that we should enforce this legislation. My submission to the Committee is that we have unenforceable legislation, and the Government are making no provision for enforcement. Indeed, they are introducing more legislation to take the police further away from this area than they are at present.
<P>

<a name="40504-28_para6"></a>Clause 72 agreed to.
<P>

<a name="40504-28_para7"></a>Clause 73 [Civil enforcement officers]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-28_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting </B>   moved Amendment No. 118C:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 44, line 2, leave out "guidance" and insert "guidelines"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-28_para8"></a><P>

<a name="40504-28_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: This government amendment substitutes "guidelines" for "guidance" in Clause 73(3)(a). It provides that enforcing authorities must ensure that civil enforcement officers wear uniforms that accord with guidelines issued by the appropriate national authority.
<P>

<a name="40504-28_para10"></a>Use of the term "guidelines" is intended to reflect the fact that authorities will not have a completely free hand in respect of determining the form of officers' uniforms. The requirements of the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales as to the form of uniforms will amount to a direction to authorities about the form of uniforms rather than merely <P>


<a name="column_GC182"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC182</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>constituting recommendations. The current requirement is that uniforms should identify officers as parking attendants and the authority for which they are working and that uniforms should have unique serial numbers to identify officers.
<P>

<a name="40504-28_para11"></a>The use of the term "guidelines" ties in with the wording of the government amendments to Schedule 9 tabled in response to the report of the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform. It is felt that "guidelines" conveys the stipulations in Clause 73(3)(a) and paragraph 8 of Schedule 9 better than the word "guidance", which has the connotation of simple advice. It is a small amendment. I beg to move.
<P>

<a name="40504-28_para12"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-28_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Astor </B>   moved Amendment No. 119:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 44, line 12, leave out paragraph (b).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-28_para13"></a><P>

<a name="40504-28_para14"></a>The noble Viscount said: This is a probing amendment. I am unclear about how wide is the authority given to a parking attendant by Clause 73(5)(b). The clause refers to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"other road traffic contraventions for which they are the enforcement authority".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-28_para15"></a>
It is not clear why that is not covered in paragraph (a). I should like the Minister to elucidate what that means. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-28_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My name&#151;or a version thereof&#151;is attached to the amendment. My noble friend is probing the Government in order to gain a little more information. We are at a serious point in the Bill. The Committee highlighted the wide concern about the role of these officers and the proliferation of uniformed, perhaps pseudo-police, bodies.
<P>

<a name="40504-28_para16"></a>Clause 73 refers to civil enforcement officers, who can enforce the law as described in this part. It appears that the Government intend that the contracted-out traffic officers&#151;parking attendants, as they are at the moment&#151;will be able to issue notices to motorists in connection with offences that they might have committed.
<P>

<a name="40504-28_para17"></a>My concern is, first, that there would be a proliferation of uniformed pseudo-police bodies and that there would be confusion in the public's mind about who has what power. For example, I do not know what the powers are of the community support officers whom we see on our streets and whether they can stop vehicles. The Minister made it clear that he thought that civilians should be able to stop vehicles only in very limited circumstances. I presume that for this purpose parking attendants are civilians, albeit in uniform.
<P>

<a name="40504-28_para18"></a>I am concerned about the operating practices of many civil parking attendants, particularly in London. I am sure that they are very admirable individuals, but the practices with which they are tasked are predatory and a degree of entrapment is involved. I do not think that these bodies have much to do with controlling parking. Such bodies are tasked with revenue generation more than with ensuring that traffic flow is not affected by illegally parked vehicles.
<P>


<a name="column_GC183"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC183</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40504-28_para19"></a>The Government got themselves into a good deal of hot water about speed cameras, having them placed at points that had little to do with accident black spots and more to do with catching motorists and generating considerable revenue. I am not against contracted-out parking attendants per se; I am against the current low level of control over how officers operate. I fear that, by tasking them to enforce traffic regulations, the Government could open a can of worms that could lead to a diminution of the authority of officers who enforce traffic regulations. I have visions of gangs of attendants on street corners trying to catch motorists turning right where they should not do so, for example. If motorists should not turn right, it is right that those who do should be caught; but if officers are driven to hit targets, I am not sure that motorists will feel fairly treated. We have seen a significant rise in the number of parking tickets issued by such bodies. I am concerned that the same would happen in traffic enforcement and that the authority of the police would be reduced.
<P>

<a name="40504-28_para20"></a>We have been told and given notes to indicate that little discretion should be involved in those offences&#151;that they should be "Yes/No"-type offences. However, the same should apply to parking offences, and we know the enormous amount of correspondence and appeals generated in that field.
<P>

<a name="40504-28_para21"></a>I ask the Minister to give the Committee some comfort that he can see that there is significant concern about the practices operated by parking attendants, particularly in London. I should like to hear how he envisages parking attendants' involvement in issuing penalty charges against motorists who contravene road regulations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-29_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   The noble Viscount, Lord Goschen, has raised some important points. With as controversial an element in the community as parking attendants, it is hardly surprising that such concerns have not been voiced. Parking attendants do an incredibly difficult job. I believe that most of them, most of the time, do it well. I am a motorist and a pedestrian, and I can see that much controversy arises when individual motorists feel that they have been unfairly dealt with when they have contravened the regulations by only a few minutes. Given that parking attendants have generally done a good job for a fair amount of time, it seems sensible that they should be at least part of the corps of people who will have the wider task of enforcement rather than creating afresh an entirely new corps.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-29_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   I am sorry to interrupt the noble Lord. Why is a new corps of any description required? Why can not the police continue to undertake that function?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-29_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   I am sure that the Minister will have a better answer than I do, but I believe that it is on the general ground that such relatively minor matters can be dealt with by people who do not receive the training, get the pay or bear the responsibilities of police officers. There <P>


<a name="column_GC184"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC184</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is a justification for having an extra corps of people who, at the moment, do the job of a parking attendant but could take on additional tasks.
<P>

<a name="40504-29_para0"></a>The Government and the public are concerned about anti-social behaviour generally. Sadly, we do not often see police officers on the streets, so the presence on our streets of somebody in authority with a uniform on is a good idea. I suppose that the guidance to which the Minister referred in respect of the previous amendment will ensure that the uniform they wear will have a different label on it from that worn by parking attendants because they will have those wider responsibilities&#151;so much the better. If their presence has a deterrent influence on anti-social behaviour, that will be a beneficial outcome.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-29_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </B>   The amendment raises some fundamental issues. I must be frank and say that I am struggling to understand the logic of the noble Viscount's argument. I have the highest regard for him, but the logic of his argument defeats me.
<P>

<a name="40504-29_para1"></a>One ought to consider first principles. First, we should consider whether any traffic restrictions anywhere are necessary. I think that we would all agree that we must have restrictions on traffic, whether in the form of parking controls, speed limits, "No right turn" signs or whatever. That brings us to the second point: once we have the restrictions, need we enforce them? Self-evidently, we do; otherwise, people would simply ignore them.
<P>

<a name="40504-29_para2"></a>Once we are agreed on that, the next step is to ask by whom the restrictions should be enforced. One has two choices. There is a wonderful, simple logic in saying that, for the purposes of clarity, there should be one uniformed service that undertakes the whole range of policing tasks, including traffic policing and enforcement. However, the truth is that we do not have enough police officers. They are very skilled, highly trained and cost a lot. There is an argument that it is not a sensible use of highly trained officers' time to use them to enforce "No right turn" signs or parking restrictions. Once we decide that, in the interests of efficiency, such work is not the best use of their time, we must ask ourselves whom we should get to do the job.
<P>

<a name="40504-29_para3"></a>The last point is how such things should be enforced. It is interesting to note that the local authorities who receive most opprobrium for over-zealous enforcement of things such as parking restrictions are, in the main, the most efficient. They were the early outsourcers of services and have developed a market-based approach. I think, for example, of Westminster, which was a pioneer in outsourcing services. It has highly developed systems for subcontracting and uses incentives to get the best value for money for local council tax payers.
<P>

<a name="40504-29_para4"></a>We cannot have it both ways. If we think that that system works for the bins and for cleaning the pavements, we must accept that it will also work for parking. We cannot expect contractors to be highly efficient about pavements and bins but ask them to cut us a bit of slack <P>


<a name="column_GC185"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC185</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>on parking. We cannot have it both ways. We must think carefully, from first principles, while considering the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-29_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   Does the noble Baroness accept what the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, said: that a lot of traffic violations are caused by criminals or people who are the most likely to commit criminal offences? Statistics tend to bear that out. So in fact, having a police officer to police menial left and right turns would be most beneficial, because the chances are that they will also pick up on those criminals. Unfortunately, other enforcement officers would be unable to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-29_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </B>   The noble Viscount&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-29_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   I am not a Viscount.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-29_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </B>   I do apologise. The noble Lord is right and I do not disagree with him, but we live in the real world and there simply are not enough police officers to undertake the work that most people want them to do, even without dealing with right turns, whether or not they involve the criminal fraternity. In theory, I accept the noble Lord's point, but in practice it simply will not happen. Those offences will not be enforced.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-29_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   I am sorry to keep butting in, but perhaps the noble Baroness would accept that since 1997 we have lost 12.5 per cent of our traffic officers. Perhaps we should return to the provision that we had in 1997, so that we would be able to do that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-29_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   This is an interesting discussion. I believe that there is a serious shortage of police officers, but I also believe that, as the noble Baroness said, we live in the real world which will not be changed overnight. My noble friend Lord Borrie mentioned anti-social behaviour. Let us not forget that turning right where a sign says that you cannot or stopping in a yellow box is just as anti-social as other such behaviour. If you are caught doing that, you deserve to be apprehended by whoever.
<P>

<a name="40504-29_para5"></a>It is easy to say that motorists are a separate class of people and that we should let them get away with parking and turning right. Everyone is in the same boat here: if you disobey the law, you deserve to get punished.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-29_spnew10"></A><B> Viscount Simon: </B>   A few random thoughts occur to me about traffic officers and the reduction in their numbers. I would like to return to the numbers that we had on patrol in 1990. Between 1990 and 2000, the number fell by 50 per cent, which is one hell of a lot. Returning to turning right where you should not, yes, that is an offence; yes, a police officer could deal with it; yes, he could detect whether that person had committed any further criminal offences. Police traffic officers generally have very high arrest rates compared with the total for non-traffic offences. That should never be forgotten.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40504-29_para6"></a>Targets, which have already been mentioned, also concern me. I am led to believe that one local authority not far from here gives its traffic wardens, or whatever we call them&#151;parking attendants&#151;a Vauxhall Nova as a prize, one might say, for achieving their targets. I find that incredible. Whether it is true, I do not know, but it has been reported in the newspapers&#151;reputable newspapers at that.
<P>

<a name="40504-29_para7"></a>Civil staff have the power to control turning right, but they have discretion. One point on which I would pick up the noble Viscount concerns speed cameras. If someone is turning right, the civil staff have discretion. The speed camera has no discretion. If you are committing a criminal offence or exceeding the speed limit, it will catch you, full stop.

<A NAME="40504-29_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I have enjoyed listening to the debate; I thought that I might not have to respond. The noble Viscount, Lord Astor, wants elucidation and the noble Viscount, Lord Goschen, wants reassurance. I hope to give both, but would like to say how grateful I was for the contributions from my noble friends Lord Borrie and Lord Berkeley and the noble Baroness, Lady Scott. I agree with everything that they said.
<P>

<a name="40504-29_para8"></a>Clause 73 enables an enforcement authority to appoint civil enforcement officers to undertake the enforcement of traffic contraventions. A civil enforcement officer may be employed either directly by the authority or by a person undertaking enforcement powers pursuant to a contractual arrangement with the authority&#151;which presumably means a contractor.
<P>

<a name="40504-29_para9"></a>When parking regulations made under the Bill are brought into force in a given area, existing parking attendants become civil enforcement officers for the purpose of enforcing parking contraventions by virtue of subsection (5)(a) of Clause 73. By removing paragraph (b) of subsection (5), Amendment No. 119 would prevent enforcing authorities appointing existing parking attendants as civil enforcement officers in relation to other traffic contraventions for which they are the enforcement authority.
<P>

<a name="40504-29_para10"></a>So an authority would have to make new civil enforcement officer appointments&#151;the nightmare scenario&#151;for the purpose of enforcing other traffic contraventions, rather than being able to draw on its pool of existing enforcement staff. That is not an efficient use of an authority's resources, as I think the Committee would agree. The main task of civil enforcement officers will be to issue penalty charges for parking contraventions. However, we wish to enable civil enforcement officers to be given a role that goes beyond enforcing parking contraventions to the enforcement of moving traffic contraventions that are subject to civil enforcement.
<P>

<a name="40504-29_para11"></a>The best current example of this is found under the London Local Authorities and Transport for London Act 2003. A special team of officers enforces the London night-time and weekend lorry ban. We want to ensure that that can continue when regulations made under the Bill to enforce the London lorry ban replace the 2003 Act powers. Depending on what we learn from the pilots to begin in London next month, <P>


<a name="column_GC187"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC187</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>we would not want to rule out civil enforcement officers having a role in enforcing other moving traffic contraventions.
<P>

<a name="40504-29_para12"></a>I agree that if existing parking attendants are to undertake other enforcement duties, it is important that they are properly trained for the task. Responsibility for ensuring proper training will rest with enforcing authorities. But we should not preclude existing parking attendants from taking on other enforcement duties.
<P>

<a name="40504-29_para13"></a>A number of points were raised in the debate to which I shall attempt to reply. The noble Viscount, Lord Goschen, was worried about the proliferation of police-type bodies rushing around, acting entrepreneurially and trying to raise money for the authority. As I said, civil enforcement officers will not be able to stop vehicles. Government Amendment No. 124F will introduce statutory guidance over civil enforcement. That will include matters of training, supervision and such like, to ensure that parking and other enforcement tasks are carried out fairly and, most important, consistently.
<P>

<a name="40504-29_para14"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, was concerned about the ability of contracted-out civil enforcement officers to issue penalty charges and the low level of control over those officers. Contracted-out parking attendants already issue parking penalty charge notices. Existing parking attendants will not be able automatically to enforce other traffic contraventions without being specifically appointed for that purpose by the enforcing authority.
<P>

<a name="40504-29_para15"></a>As I said, I welcome the comment of my noble friend Lord Borrie that most parking attendants are doing a good job in incredibly difficult circumstances&#151;we shall come to further discussion about parking attendants later. We want to bring the performance of all of them up to the highest possible standard. On uniforms, they will be distinguished from the police. The guidelines will make that absolutely clear.
<P>

<a name="40504-29_para16"></a>Finally, the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, is concerned about enforcement by police officers rather than any other type of officer. The Bill does not prevent the police stopping vehicles that are, for example, disobeying a ban on right turns, in the course of which they may pick up some criminals. Why criminals would turn right against a sign I do not know&#151;if I were a smart criminal, I would not.

<A NAME="40504-29_spnew12"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   Before the Minister dismisses the point made by my noble friend, he should note that this is a serious matter. If he were to ask the police about the number of bank robbers who have been picked up because they were driving without their lights on and so forth, they would respond that it is considerable. The Madrid bombers, for example, were picked up by the Spanish police as the result of a motoring offence and it is a great tragedy that they slipped through the net. However, this is an important <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-30_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I did not know that and I am grateful to the noble Viscount. However, the reality is that the police do not have the resources to undertake all the traffic enforcement that is now necessary, a point explained so eloquently by the noble Baroness, Lady Scott. I hope that, with all the information in my response and our lengthy debate before I rose to speak, this amendment can be withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-30_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   Before I reply to the noble Lord, I have one brief question to put to him. Is it the Government's intention that parking wardens will be able to enforce bus lane restrictions?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-30_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I am advised that the answer to that question is no and that most of the enforcement of bus lanes will be done by the use of traffic cameras.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-30_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   Surely it is only logical that a parking warden walking alongside a bus lane who sees a car parked in it should be able to issue a ticket. If he cannot do so, that is ridiculous. He should be able to contribute to the effort to keep traffic moving, which is the whole point of the exercise.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-30_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   We are distinguishing between moving traffic in bus lanes and parked vehicles. At the moment, traffic wardens can of course issue tickets for parked cars, but cannot issue a ticket to a moving vehicle. However, I think that the traffic camera, which we shall discuss in a later amendment, will be extraordinarily valuable in dealing with the problem of bus lane infringements.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-30_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   I am sorry to delay my noble friend. The point reached by a vehicle when half way between moving along and parking is when it has stopped in a bus lane. It may have stopped because the traffic in front has stopped moving. Having done so, he does not then need the police to stop him because he has already stopped moving. Under those circumstances, why should not the warden issue the driver with a ticket?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-30_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   Perhaps I am a little out of my depth, but if you are illegally in a bus lane and not moving along as the result of a traffic jam, you would not imagine that a traffic warden could leap out and issue a ticket just before you move on. That is because the nature of traffic jams means that cars slow down and then move on. One can imagine traffic wardens running along beside the vehicle while trying to write out a ticket.
<P>

<a name="40504-30_para0"></a>We are positing the idea that a car is either moving or not moving and we feel that we have the necessary legal infrastructure in place to deal with both those possibilities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-30_spnew7"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I had thought that my question about bus lanes might be a small elephant trap, but I <P>


<a name="column_GC189"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC189</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>did not realise that the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, would run so satisfactorily headfirst into it. If, as I did this morning, you arrive at Paddington station and then sit right at the front on the top of the No. 36 bus, you have rather a good view. While going down Park Lane, it is clear that at all the places where one can legally turn left, one has to enter and cross the bus lane to do so. There are no gaps in the bus lane. A traffic warden could quite easily stand at one of those junctions and issue hundreds of tickets, saying, "You went into the bus lane". Even more simply, should one bring one's car to your Lordships' House and try to enter via Black Rod's Garden, you find that you have to cross a bus lane to do so. So what a joy it would be for traffic wardens. We know that they watch meters until the very end of the time and pounce. We know that they are incentivised by large bonuses. One can see total chaos. The argument put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, does not stand up at all. It would produce utter chaos.
<P>

<a name="40504-30_para1"></a>This group of amendments is just the beginning of my general rant against traffic wardens. Members of the Committee may detect a theme emerging throughout the afternoon. However, the Minister was somewhat helpful. I am concerned about training. At the end of the day, that is the important thing. All of us want the law enforced but we want it enforced fairly and reasonably. One of the problems in London is that it is not enforced fairly and reasonably. If any noble Lord opposite doubts me, I recommend that he read Kate Hoey's article that appeared in the Evening Standard on Friday. It described the situation brilliantly.
<P>

<a name="40504-30_para2"></a>One of the problems that have aggravated the situation is that the appeals mechanism does not work properly. Adjudicators are allowed to adjudicate on only a very narrow set of terms and circumstances and are not allowed to take other matters into consideration. It makes life incredibly difficult. The other day I had the experience of trying to make an appeal, and it was impossible to get information out of the council in order to make the appeal work. One cannot do it. One cannot find out, apart from a number, who the traffic warden was, and there is no way of getting the council to give evidence to an adjudicator. The system does not work.
<P>

<a name="40504-30_para3"></a>If the system is to work it must command the respect of the motorist. That is the most important thing. Justice must be seen to be done. That is what we are all trying to do. The Minister was helpful in his reply but he has just started the process. If we are to involve traffic wardens in "moving traffic contraventions" we must ensure that training and guidance are given. We will return to that matter on a later amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-30_spnew8"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   I get the sense that my noble friend is about to withdraw his amendment, but, before he does that, I have a question to ask the Minister and one comment to make to the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, whose kind words I reciprocate with interest.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-30_spnew9"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I thought that she was referring to me.

<a name="40504-30_para4"></a>The noble Baroness might be sore if she were stopped in her car for speeding&#151;I am sure that she speeds regularly, because only about 0.25 per cent of motorists do not&#151;while travelling at 31 miles per hour in a 30 miles per hour zone, by a policeman who was financially incentivised to stop as many people as possible and got £20 for each motorist caught for travelling at over 30 miles per hour. That is my point. Over-aggressive, over-zealous enforcement causes a problem. If civilian officers doing what was previously the work of the police are financially incentivised to catch every person possible, regardless of whether it is a serious matter, it will lead to problems. My question to the Minister flows from that: will such civil enforcement officers be permitted to be financially incentivised to issue penalty notices?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-30_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I shall try to answer two of the questions asked. I gather that there is an essential legal difference between driving across a bus lane and driving down a bus lane. On the question of the incentivisation of parking attendants, I gather that this is a matter for discussion between local authorities and the contractors. That answer suggests to me that they will be incentivised to do their job effectively.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-30_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   Before the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, intercedes again, perhaps I may draw on some practical experience. First, parking attendants employed by my local authority are under the control of a retired police officer. He trains them to police standards. Secondly, when the local authority increased the hours worked by parking attendants to encompass the evening, the number of thefts from cars, which was a very serious number of offences, dropped dramatically. Parking attendants are in touch with a base station by radio that is, in turn, in touch with the police. Any observations of any sort of criminality are reported immediately to the police, who come and take action accordingly.
<P>

<a name="40504-30_para5"></a>So there is not just a downside. There are a lot more pairs of eyes and boots walking around the streets than there were previously, keeping down disorderly behaviour, thefts from motor cars, damage to motor cars and other things that equally irritate the motorist. That shows that this policy is beneficial and necessary at a time when there is a shortage of police officers.
<P>

<a name="40504-30_para6"></a>I am a member of a police authority. It takes a year to train a policeman, with a further two years in which he is abstracted from duty regularly to complete that training. However, we can train a parking attendant in about eight weeks. We also have to recruit people to a high standard of youth and fitness as policemen or policewomen, whereas parking attendants can be much older. They can be physically disabled and <P>


<a name="column_GC191"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>otherwise useful. I am not saying that they should not conform to a standard, but the doors would be opened to a much wider range of participants.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-30_spnew13"></A><B> Viscount Simon: </B>   The noble Lord mentioned eight weeks' training. I understand that in certain areas of the country, training can be for as little as four weeks, but mostly six weeks.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-30_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   It may be.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-30_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I do not want this to turn into a question-and-answer session, but I should like to tell the noble Viscount, Lord Goschen, that the British Parking Association is preparing some model contracts, which we hope will prevent those problems. We acknowledge that there are problems of inappropriate financial incentives.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-30_spnew16"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I should bring the debate on this amendment to a close. I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, says. However, I hope that he will accept also that there are problems, particularly in London. Indeed, those problems have now been admitted by Westminster council, which is to have a period of reassessing and retraining. We will turn to that later.
<P>

<a name="40504-30_para7"></a>The problems are training and flexibility. If we find that traffic wardens are using their powers just to catch people&#151;for example, if there is an argument about whether a driver crossed a bus lane or whether he entered it in order to turn left, and so forth&#151;it will not work. We will then end up in a bigger mess than we are in at the moment. It is very important that we get it right. We shall return to that theme as we get further into this part of the Bill. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 44, line 29, leave out paragraph (c).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-31_para9"></a><P>

<a name="40504-31_para10"></a>The noble Viscount said: This is a probing amendment to find out the meaning of subsection (2)(c). Noble Lords will see from paragraph (a) that regulations may provide for notification of a penalty charge to be given in respect of a stationary vehicle,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"by a notice affixed to the vehicle",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-31_para11"></a>
usually on the windscreen. We understand that. Paragraph (b) says that notification may be given to the person in charge of the vehicle. That is fairly simple. However, paragraph (c) says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in such other manner as may be specified by the regulations".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-31_para12"></a>
What examples can the Government give of what they have in mind? Will notification be posted, after the number-plate of the vehicle has been checked out? Is there some other method? What do the Government mean by that paragraph? What things are they considering? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-31_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   Section 66 of the Road Traffic Act 1991 provides for parking penalty charge notices to be either fixed to the vehicle or handed to the person appearing to be in charge of it. In that case, the notices are issued by patrolling parking attendants where they find vehicles to be parked unlawfully.
<P>

<a name="40504-31_para13"></a>London authorities have acquired the additional power to serve parking penalty charge notices on the basis of information provided by a camera. That requires the penalty charge notice to be served by post. London authorities have also acquired the power to serve a parking penalty charge notice by post where a parking attendant is prevented from issuing it in accordance with Section 66 of the 1991 Act. We want authorities outside London to have the same powers as the London authorities to serve a parking penalty charge notice by post and to use cameras for the detection of parking contraventions. We will use the regulation-making powers in paragraph (c) to that effect. The removal of paragraph (c) from subsection (2) of Clause 75, as proposed by Amendment No. 120, would prevent us doing that.
<P>

<a name="40504-31_para14"></a>Parking attendants do a difficult job, and we should support them in their task. A UNISON survey of traffic wardens and parking attendants, carried out in 2001, revealed that 90 per cent of the 800 respondents had been <P>


<a name="column_GC193"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC193</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>subject to verbal or physical abuse in the previous 12 months. I am told that, in one case, an authority contemplated issuing its attendants with stab-proof vests. So, it is important that we should do all that we can to help parking attendants who might find themselves in threatening situations. They can, of course, be trained to handle such confrontations, but, in the last analysis, where a parking attendant is seeking to serve a penalty charge notice and is prevented from doing so because of threats, it is helpful to have the ability to issue the penalty charge notice by post.
<P>

<a name="40504-31_para15"></a>That is the reason for the clause, and I invite the noble Viscount to withdraw his amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "OBSCURED REGISTRATION MARK
<br>
 Where it appears that an offence has been committed under section 43 of the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994 (c. 22) (obscured registration mark) and which inhibits the duties of a civil enforcement officer, the officer may take such steps necessary to identify the vehicle."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40504-31_para19"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment seeks clarification from the Government on an issue that has been brought to our attention; namely, that it is becoming a practice in certain parts of London for motorcyclists, in particular those from delivery firms, deliberately to cover up their number plates, using covers to do so. It appears that wardens, who have the power to issue notices, are unable to do so because they cannot ascertain the vehicle registration number and do not have the necessary powers to remove any covers to the number. Can the Government clarify the position because it is certainly relevant to other parts of the legislation? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-31_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   Obscuration of a vehicle registration plate is an offence by virtue of Section 43 of the Vehicle Excise Registration Act 1994. Prosecution is a matter for the police. A fine of up to £1,000 may be imposed on conviction. Civil enforcement of traffic contraventions depends on obtaining the vehicle registration details so that owners can be traced through the DVLA record.
<P>

<a name="40504-31_para20"></a>We are aware of press reports from last year&#151;indeed, I have to say that a friend has done this&#151;of motorcycle couriers in London seeking to avoid parking penalty charges by covering their number plates. We understand from those reports that London authorities had advised parking attendants not to remove covers to determine vehicle registration details, fearing a vehicle owner could bring an action against them for trespass or damage. The most recent information we have is that these London authorities are now taking a more sensible view and parking attendants in London are removing covers to obtain registration details.

<a name="40504-31_para26"></a>
I understand that cars can be clamped and, sometimes, subsequently lifted and moved. However, why do they need to be clamped once they reach a car pound? Presumably they are being kept in a secure area. Or, in this case, can the car be moved to an area that is not secure? Why is this provision necessary?
<P>

<a name="40504-31_para27"></a>The amendment also gives me an opportunity to ask the Government about their views on unregulated clamping, that which is carried out on so-called private land. As we have seen, motorists have been caught out when parking in, say, a shop car park where no clear sign is displayed stating that the area is not public property. Cars are clamped by the local cowboy clampers and the motorists almost blackmailed with exorbitant charges to have their cars released. Do the Government think that this should happen? Do they believe that when people leave their cars for important reasons, they should suddenly be held hostage as the result of such behaviour? I can think of no other situation in which one's private property is held to ransom, as it were, on rather dubious grounds.
<P>

<a name="40504-31_para28"></a>The problem is that there is no recourse. The long-suffering motorist has to pay and then he has to sue the clamping firm that did it, which turns out to be, as we have read in the press, the kind of outfit that has no known address and no proper directors. The motorist is stuck. I wonder whether this might be an opportunity for the Minister to consider the issue and say what the Government's view is. Although on this side of the House we have not put down an amendment on the subject yet, it is something that we will be considering. We would welcome an opportunity to discuss it with the Minister. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40504-31_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   Clause 76 will allow regulations to be made enabling the wheel clamping of vehicles which are unlawfully parked in civil enforcement areas. These powers are not new. Clause 76 replaces existing provisions in Sections 69 and 70 and parts of Section 77 of the Road Traffic Act 1991. As well as the <P>


<a name="column_GC195"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC195</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>penalty charge incurred for the parking contravention, the regulations may provide for the payment of a clamp release fee and any other unpaid penalty charges in respect of the vehicle. Clearly in the latter case it will be necessary to establish that the current owner is responsible for any unpaid penalty charges.
<P>

<a name="40504-31_para29"></a>Amendment No. 122 would prevent regulations being made that would enable an unlawfully parked vehicle to be moved from the place where it was found to another place and to be clamped there. I have to say that when I first read the speaking notes my reaction was precisely the same as that of the noble Viscount, Lord Astor. Admittedly this would probably happen on very rare occasions but the power has been included in the Bill for completeness. The power may be used in a situation where clamping a vehicle in the location where it was found would simply cause a continuing obstruction and where there was no pound to which to remove it. The vehicle would be removed to another part of the road, where it did not cause an obstruction, and clamped. I gather that this is a hypothetical case rather than something that is based on the reality of everyday motoring life.
<P>

<a name="40504-31_para30"></a>The regulations will not compel enforcement authorities to immobilise unlawfully parked vehicles. They will provide enforcement authorities with an additional measure to deter unlawful parking, if they decide to use it. Immobilisation is a useful tool for dealing with people who persistently park wrongly or who habitually refuse to pay penalty charges and cannot be traced through the DVLA keeper record.
<P>

<a name="40504-31_para31"></a>The noble Viscount raised the question of clamping on private land. I think that he started by saying, "If somebody with excellent reasons" had to park on private land. It would be interesting to know what those excellent reasons might be.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-32_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   They might think that it is not private land, that it is a public space&#151;for example, the parking area of a shop.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-32_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   In my experience, it is made absolutely clear that it is a private place. If one goes to a supermarket, it is made absolutely clear that the parking facilities there are for people who are using the supermarket. If a member of the public goes in, parks his car, goes off to the beach for the day and comes back and finds that he is clamped, I think that is perfectly reasonable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-32_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   Is the Minister aware that there have been many examples of traps set by people who own a small piece of land near shops where notices saying that cars may be clamped are obscured by a large hedge or other such feature with the deliberate intention of catching vehicles, clamping them and getting exorbitant release fees? It has been very well documented, even if the Minister is not aware of it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-32_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I am not aware of that, but I shall brief myself on the matter before Report. I have eight paragraphs on the Government's attitude to clamping on private land. It would probably be best to have a meeting before Report so <P>


<a name="column_GC196"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC196</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that we could go through them. I hope that I can satisfy the noble Viscount that we have a reasonably enlightened policy.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-32_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. Perhaps he would be kind enough to outline in writing the essence of the eight paragraphs, as that would help us to have a meaningful meeting. My noble friend Lord Goschen raises an important point. I accept what he says about well-regulated, well-organised supermarkets and such places, but some motorists have parked in places where they clearly thought that parking was permitted and whereupon they have been held to ransom. Cases vary and include young mothers taking their children to the local surgery. There have been some terrible cases, so we must consider the matter carefully.
<P>

<a name="40504-32_para0"></a>I will be able to accept the Minister's response to my amendment if he can give me one assurance. He said that in exceptional circumstances a local authority would have the power to clamp a car for whatever reason it decided, to take it not to a pound but elsewhere in the street or to a side street so that it was not an obstruction, and clamp it again. I understand that. I am not sure why the local authority would not take the vehicle to a pound, but perhaps it would have good reason. If that happened, when the unfortunate motorist returned to the street he would not find his car, because it would have been moved and clamped. Can we be assured in regulations or guidance that, when a motorist rings up a local authority to ask where his car is, it will not say, "I am very sorry, it is not in the pound"? A sensible approach is needed. Will the Minister consider that? Given that the costs mount every time a motorist does not get his car unclamped, a sensible process is needed whereby he can discover where the car is, if it is not in the pound, and can telephone to get it unclamped. I would be grateful to receive an answer now, but will be happy if the Minister wants to write to me before Report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-32_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I have an answer now; whether the noble Viscount will be happy with it is another matter. A car is illegally parked; it is causing an obstruction. The parking attendant, only in liaison with the police, can arrange for the vehicle to be moved to a safer place, where it would not cause an obstruction, and to be clamped. As it is done in association with the police, they will have a record of it for the, in my view not unfortunate, motorist who returns after having parked his or her car on a triple yellow line or wherever. We are talking about parking in a dangerous place, from where the vehicle must be removed to prevent an accident. The returning motorist will have to telephone the police to find out what has happened to his car; he will be told where it is; and, having paid the unclamping fee, he can collect it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-32_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   The Minister makes an important point. It is all very well to discuss the situation in the abstract and to say that a car will be moved elsewhere only if it causes a dangerous obstruction. However, as we all know from previous circumstances, once the Bill becomes an Act, everybody will use the maximum power that they have in the minimum of circumstances. That is why it is <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-32_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting </B>   moved Amendment No. 122A:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 45, line 49, leave out "if"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-32_para2"></a><P>

<a name="40504-32_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: Subsection (5) of clause 76 re-enacts Section 70 of the Road Traffic Act 1991, which restricts the clamping of vehicles in designated parking places. If a period of less than 15 minutes has elapsed since the expiry of the period of parking paid for, the vehicle may not be clamped.
<P>

<a name="40504-32_para4"></a>It has been drawn to our attention by the Chief Parking Adjudicator for London that there is an anomaly in the present Section 70 of the Road Traffic Act 1991, which has been carried through into subsection (5). Sometimes a driver may buy, but fail to display as required, a ticket to show that he has paid to park his vehicle in a pay and display bay. By failing to display the ticket, he incurs a penalty charge and the vehicle may subsequently be clamped. However, if the vehicle is clamped before 15 minutes after the time paid for has elapsed, the clamping is rendered unlawful by the present drafting of Section 70. In authorising the clamping the parking attendant could not have known that less than 15 minutes had elapsed because the ticket was not displayed. Nevertheless, if the driver proves this by subsequently producing the ticket that was not properly displayed, adjudicators have to order the refund of the declamping fee. In effect, the local authority bears the risk of the driver not displaying his ticket as required. That is the purport of the clause as it is now.
<P>

<a name="40504-32_para5"></a>The effect of the amendments is to make clamping lawful when a pay and display ticket is not shown as required, even though less than 15 minutes has not elapsed beyond the period of parking paid for. I hope that that is clear and straightforward. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-32_spnew8"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I am afraid that I am going to disappoint the Minister and not agree with the amendments. It seems to me that justice should basically mean that one is innocent until proven guilty. These amendments do not do that. There are many streets and squares in London where one can park and be prepared to go and find one's ticket and then find quite a few machines that simply do not work. Either they are broken or they gobble one's money and do not give one a ticket or for some reason one cannot get to them. If we pass the amendment, while one is in the process of looking for a machine, someone may come along and clamp one's car. It seems entirely reasonable that if one parks somewhere, one should not be able to be clamped within 15 minutes. Why should the motorist have to go and prove later on, after all the expense and inconvenience, that it is the fault of the local authority? We know that it is almost impossible ever to get local authorities to agree that they are at fault. In today's Evening Standard there is <P>


<a name="column_GC198"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC198</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>an article that says that in Marylebone one can get booked in 60 seconds. In this case, one will get clamped in 60 seconds. I am not yet persuaded by the legislation, because the onus should be that one is not clamped.
<P>

<a name="40504-32_para6"></a>Clamping is a serious inconvenience to those who suffer it. I accept what the Minister says about strategic roads and dangerous places, and so on. However, he must accept that the majority of clamping takes place where the majority of wardens are most active&#151;at meters, and places like that. To give them such a carte blanche power will simply increase the amount of clamping that goes on. I want parking wardens to deal with important aspects. I support the principle of having them, providing that they are well trained and organised and that they deal with the important routes in London to get the traffic flowing.
<P>

<a name="40504-32_para7"></a>I am not convinced by the amendment. I am happy to have discussions with the Government between now and Report, and perhaps they will be able to convince me. However, it is not an amendment to which I could agree today.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-32_spnew9"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   There may be few, perhaps, but they may be specific circumstances, in which my noble friend's arguments might well apply&#151;for example, if one had to walk a considerable distance to find a machine that worked for pay and display. The article to which he referred showed what can happen. The noble Baroness, Lady Scott, took the opportunity to talk about the real world, and what happens with local authorities and motorists. However, in the real world, people do feel that the clamping and ticketing regime is overly aggressive. I see the circumstances that my noble friend explained, and join him in being reluctant to accept the amendments at this stage. Perhaps the Minister will want to withdraw them and re-present them later.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-32_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I have actually been in a position when, having parked my car and gone off to get my ticket, I found two machines that were out of action. Then, having walked for about quarter of a mile, I found that I had a parking ticket when I came back to the car. I phoned the council immediately, told them about the situation and the ticket was withdrawn. The incident was inconvenient in that it required me to make a phone call, but the council was incredibly apologetic about the fact that I was in an area where two out of the three machines were not working.
<P>

<a name="40504-32_para8"></a>We are dealing with cases in which a ticket has been bought but not displayed. When ticket machines are not working, representations can be made to the authority to cancel any penalty or clamping charge. The problem with parking attendants is that we all have our own stories. I have found them very reasonable and helpful. Of course, they have done me when I have parked illegally&#151;but we always remember only the bad cases. The one awful thing that happened to me once, although it was not really awful, was that I was ticketed outside my house in London at <P>

However, we forget about the enormously important job that they do and the number of times when it is a fair cop, when they have done people for illegal parking.
<P>

<a name="40504-32_para9"></a>The issue is extraordinarily emotive and ultimately, as individuals, we shall have to beg to disagree with each other, while the Government do their best to introduce rational and comprehensible regulations that we can all understand.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-33_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   The Minister gave a very valid exposition of what happened to him. However, the point is that in those circumstances, when he got a ticket, he had a mobile telephone, was able to ring up and was able to get it cancelled. If this amendment goes through, under those very same circumstances, the car would be clamped. That is the difference. It might be the car of someone who did not have a mobile telephone; it might be the car of someone collecting a child from school, for example. In those circumstances, I do not believe that the car should be clamped immediately, as would happen under the Minister's amendment. That is a theme that I shall follow shortly, under the next amendment. In circumstances such as I described, it is entirely reasonable that the car should not be clamped for 15 minutes.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40504-33_para3"></a>The noble Viscount said: This amendment is in a similar vein to our previous discussion, so I can be brief. Again, it concerns clamping. I feel strongly that clamps should not be fitted immediately after a ticket has been issued. That is wrong. That happened to me <P>


<a name="column_GC200"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC200</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the other day. I got a ticket and, bang, two minutes later, a clamp appeared just as I was going to get the keys of the car to move it. I accept that I should have got the ticket, but it seemed to me that clamping was being done rather gleefully as a money-raising exercise, not to benefit sensible parking policy.
<P>

<a name="40504-33_para4"></a>There are plenty of reasons why people occasionally run just over the time on their meter. In that case, it seems fair that they get a ticket, but the idea of being immediately clamped does not make sense. We are talking about traffic movement. One is often held up in the street by a clamping lorry going past in a residential area. I accept what any Member of the Committee says about clamping in streets that are important thoroughfares, but we must have a sensible policy. My amendment is intended to introduce a degree of sense to the clamping issue. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-33_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   I support my noble friend, Viscount Astor&#151;I say that just in case anyone else gets our names muddled up, as they frequently have. The Evening Standard article headlined, "Booked in 60 seconds", shows clearly that a ticket can be issued&#151;in this case, by a parking warden&#151;within a minute or three, five, nine, 10 or 14 minutes. However, as the Minister pointed out, while doing his best to put a ticket on his car, he had to walk a quarter of a mile. I am sure that he is very fit and probably scampered down the pavement in a few minutes, but if he was not I hope that he would accept that it could have taken him four or five minutes to do that. However, having been ticketed in less than four or five minutes, he could be clamped straight afterwards. I suggest that that is too unfair and that one has to give a little more leeway. Otherwise, without doing anything wrong and while trying their best, people may be clamped.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-33_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   Briefly, I support my noble friend. We must consider what clamping is for and whether it makes the problem worse. If we are really concerned about the movement of traffic and if we stick a large metal triangle on the corner of a vehicle, it will not go anywhere very quickly. That is about punishment and raising revenue. I support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-33_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   I add only that it is a deterrent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-33_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   Immobilisation is an additional measure over and above the penalty charge used by some enforcing authorities to deter unlawful parking. I underline the words, "unlawful parking". We are not talking about cars that are lawfully parked, but where the driver, unless he is deficient in some way, realises that he is unlawfully parked and is taking a risk in so doing. I have done it and got away with that risk and I am sure that other members of the Committee have done the same but we are talking about unlawful parking. That is the context that we must keep in mind. It is a useful tool to have in places such as central London where parking space is at a premium.
<P>

<a name="40504-33_para5"></a>Clause 76(5) exempts from immobilisation vehicles displaying a current disabled person's badge&#151;a blue badge. It also exempts from immobilisation vehicles <P>


<a name="column_GC201"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC201</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>where a parking charge has been paid and fewer than 15 minutes have elapsed since the end of the period paid for. So, someone who parks in an authorised parking space has 15 minutes' grace. The exemptions effectively re-enact Section 20 of the Road Traffic Act 1991.
<P>

<a name="40504-33_para6"></a>People who park in a paid-for parking place may overstay their time. Although that is a contravention for which a penalty charge may be issued, it is appropriate to allow a short period of grace before the additional measure of immobilisation is brought into play. It is not possible, for clear reasons, to allow a period of grace where somebody knowingly parks where restrictions are in force. So, someone who has parked in a parking space will have 15 minutes' grace over their parking time. If they have parked illegally, taking a risk or not realising that they were parking on a yellow line, they will not get that period of grace.
<P>

<a name="40504-33_para7"></a>Amendment No. 122D would generally prohibit the immobilisation of a vehicle until 15 minutes after a penalty charge notice for a parking contravention had been issued. The prohibition would apply to overstaying in a paid-for parking place and to other contraventions, such as parking on yellow lines during the hours of restriction. The amendment would override the 15-minute grace period already provided for in subsection (5) in respect of paid-for parking places. If, for example, the penalty charge notice were issued immediately after the initial 15-minute grace period, the grace period would be extended to half an hour. We cannot accept that, nor can we accept that someone should be given a period of grace from having their vehicle immobilised, if they knowingly park unlawfully in the first place.
<P>

<a name="40504-33_para8"></a>I hope that, with that explanation, the noble Viscount will withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-33_spnew9"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I shall read the Minister's argument with care, although I am not sure that I fully accept it. I am not sure that the drafting of my amendment is correct. As the Minister said, it might take away the 15-minute grace period.
<P>

<a name="40504-33_para9"></a>The point of principle that I was trying to establish is important. If someone has overstayed on a parking meter, they might, as the noble Lord said, get a 15-minute grace period, after which they will get a ticket. The Minister said that there should be a short period, but he could not define it. That seems unfair. We do not know whether the period is five minutes, 10 minutes or another quarter of an hour.
<P>

<a name="40504-33_para10"></a>We must make the provision reasonable. A ticket for overstaying on a meter is quite expensive for the average motorist. If he has used up his extra 15 minutes' grace and got a ticket, he will be clamped immediately. That seems wrong. It is unfair enforcement. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, said that it might be a deterrent. We could go as far as we wanted with deterrence; we could take cars off the street or take the wheels off. We could do anything that we wanted, but we must be sensible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-33_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   I tried to make my intervention short. I made it entirely because somebody had said that all it was was a punishment. The measure is not intended <P>


<a name="column_GC202"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC202</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to punish anyone; it is intended to prevent congestion, including congestion caused by illegal parking. It appears as a penalty or punishment in the Bill, but the reason for it is not directly to punish someone for having done something, it is to prevent someone committing the illegality in the first place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-33_spnew11"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   There is always an interesting link between deterrence and punishment. That is a separate debate that we were wise not to get into too fully this afternoon. My point is that it is wrong for someone to be clamped immediately after being issued with a ticket, without having a chance to move. My amendment would allow a reasonable time, ensuring that there was still a deterrent for the motorist, while giving him or her a reasonable opportunity to move the car, if, for whatever reason, they came back late to the meter. Does the Minister wish to intervene?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-33_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I wish to intervene because I think that it is important that we go over the process. A car is parked and the time expires. A ticket can be given immediately. The grace period of 15 minutes is between the ticket being issued and the clamping vehicle arriving. There is no 15 minutes' grace between the expiration of the parking meter and the issuing of the ticket, as I think the noble Viscount felt. The ticket can be issued immediately.

<P>
<A NAME="40504-34_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   I gave the Minister notice that I wish to raise issues surrounding road humps on the Question of whether the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40504-34_para0"></a>There is growing evidence that road humps are having a negative impact on response times for emergency services. Emergency vehicles are forced to slow down to a crawl in order to negotiate humps safely and in cases of severe injury they may have to opt for a longer alternative route in order to avoid humps altogether. The head of the London Ambulance Service has called for a review of speed humps, saying that they put patients' lives in danger because emergency response times are effected. The chairman of the London Ambulance Service has stated that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"For every life saved through road traffic calming more are lost because of ambulance delays".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>

<FONT SIZE=3>
In October 2002, Mark Singleton, team leader of the London Ambulance Service, unequivocally stated that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"speed humps slow ambulances down, damage the vehicles, and worsen the ride for patients".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-34_para2"></a>
Research by the Fire Department in Portland, Oregon, USA, showed that a fire engine is delayed by up to 10 seconds per hump. Road humps cause a significant cost in repair bills for emergency vehicles damaged while traversing humps. This is not helped by the apparent lack of consistency across the country in the dimensions of speed humps. Repeatedly traversing humps causes long-term damage to vehicle components.
<P>

<a name="40504-34_para3"></a>Damage to suspension and shock absorbers seriously impacts on a vehicle's stopping distance. Shock absorbers are key in ensuring that vehicles are able to stop efficiently. Safety humps can cause immediate damage to the bodywork of large vehicles with low ground clearance, such as buses.
<P>

<a name="40504-34_para4"></a>A speed hump in Coronation Street, Birmingham, had to be rebuilt after numerous double-decker buses suffered damaged bodywork. Even the suspension on my late father's car collapsed. According to the garage when it repaired the suspension, the collapse was due to speed humps. There can be a lot of damage to vehicles.
<P>

<a name="40504-34_para5"></a>A report published by the London Assembly's Transport Committee on 15 April 2004 stated that speed humps can prove a hazard to vehicles, local residents and emergency services. It revealed that damage worth £7,500 was caused to Metropolitan Police vehicles by going over humps. Emergency services were concerned about the slow response times to incidents that the report revealed. The report said that Transport for London should ensure that emergency services' views are taken into account before money is allocated for humps. It also called for studies on the level of noise generated by humps, following residents' complaints of noise from vehicles going over them.
<P>

<a name="40504-34_para6"></a>The London Borough of Barnet has embarked upon a policy of removal of all 1,000 road humps. This in turn has prompted Transport for London to withhold £1.5 million in transport grants until it has "investigated the policy further". Can the Minister answer the following two questions? Can he give an assurance that it is within the powers of Transport for London to withhold that money, and on what grounds it is to do so? Will he ask Transport for London when it will reach its decision?
<P>

<a name="40504-34_para7"></a>It is clear that road humps should not be viewed as a panacea to all our road safety problems. Instead, they should be considered as just one of a range of measures to improve road safety. Other options should be explored, such as tackling bottlenecks at junctions and making main roads less congested. In order that motorists do not try to avoid tackling bottlenecks at junctions by rat-running down the local residential <P>


<a name="column_GC204"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC204</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>roads, perhaps the main roads could be improved. Then we could take the bumps out of all those residential roads.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-34_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   Is the issue of road humps anything to do with the clause that we are debating? It does not seem to bear much relation to the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, may know better, but I have tabled several amendments and the Public Bill Office has been meticulous in refusing anything that deviates slightly from the title of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-34_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   We had a brief meeting after the last Sitting with the officials in the Public Bill Office and the Minister's officials, when it was agreed that this was a sensible place briefly to discuss the issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-34_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   I acknowledge the fact that the noble Lord has had such a discussion. I shall only say that I have been very harshly treated by the Public Bill Office.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-34_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   Regulation 3 of the 1999 road hump regulations requires highway authorities to consult all the emergency services before the installation of any road hump. The Highways Act 1980 and the regulations made under that Act explicitly require a highway authority to consult the relevant chief officer of police and representatives of the emergency services before reducing road humps.
<P>

<a name="40504-34_para8"></a>Consultation allows the emergency services and highway authorities to work in partnership to ensure safer roads and satisfy the needs of the emergency services. Of course, the views of such bodies should be listened to. However, any suggestion that the emergency services should have a veto on a proposed traffic-calming scheme could undermine an authority's duty of care to all road users in ensuring that vehicle speeds are kept down, especially in urban areas, around schools and on residential estates. The purpose of road humps is to reduce vehicle speeds, so that death and injury are kept to an absolute minimum.
<P>

<a name="40504-34_para9"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, raised a query about TfL's proposed withholding of a grant to Barnet. TfL has the power to provide grants to London boroughs under Section 159 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999. However, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the specific case, as it really is a matter for TfL and Barnet. I understand that discussions are continuing between them about the treatment of road humps.
<P>

<a name="40504-34_para10"></a>I hope that, given that explanation, the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-34_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   I am grateful for all that the Minister has said. He will be glad to know that I am not really going to get in a hump over this. I am also grateful that he was able to answer part of the question that I asked in the latter part of my speech.
<P>

<a name="40504-34_para11"></a>The point that we were getting at was that the emergency services would give approval. We feel that that is quite important. Just being listened to does not mean that the judgment is being made by those who <P>


<a name="column_GC205"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC205</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>know best&#151;because it is their vehicles that are used rather than the authorities'. After all, the chairman of the London Ambulance Service has said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"For every life saved through traffic calming, more are lost because of ambulance delays".

<P>
<P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="40504-34_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   Is the noble Lord aware that road safety organisations dispute very bitterly the assertion of the chief of the London Ambulance Service? They point out that there may be a series of reasons for which ambulances are delayed in reaching victims and that road humps may constitute just a small proportion of them. If there were more ambulances serving smaller areas, they would obviously get there more quickly.
<P>

<a name="40504-34_para12"></a>The experience of residents in many streets where road humps have been involved is that traffic is slowed down, resulting in fewer accidents. For example, in my street in south London, where humps have been installed, there are no longer collisions between moving vehicles and parked cars. Previously, when vehicles sped through in the absence of humps, there was at least one collision a week and it was only a matter of time before there was a serious pedestrian injury. Humps save lives, and the evidence does not support the suggestion that lives are being lost because emergency vehicles are slowed down.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-34_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord. I shall not dispute his point. I am sure that he shall hold the same view when he is in an ambulance being rushed to hospital with a bad back injury.
<P>

<a name="40504-34_para13"></a>Clause 76 agreed to.
<P>

<a name="40504-34_para14"></a>Clause 77 [Representations and appeals]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-34_spnew8"></A><B> Viscount Astor </B>   moved Amendment No. 123:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 46, line 24, leave out "may" and insert "shall"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-34_para15"></a><P>

<a name="40504-34_para16"></a>The noble Viscount said: This is about the Lord Chancellor making provision by regulations. In the usual parliamentary language, the Bill states that he,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"may make provision by regulations".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-34_para17"></a>
My amendment would change "may" to "shall". It is a probing amendment so that the Minister can say that he will make regulations. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-34_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   The powers in Clause 77, like the regulation-making powers elsewhere in Part 6, are enabling. They are therefore couched in permissive terms: the Lord Chancellor "may" make regulations. The amendment would compel the Lord Chancellor to make such regulations by substituting "shall". We believe that that is unnecessary.
<P>

<a name="40504-34_para18"></a>Enabling representations to be made to enforcement authorities and appeals to independent adjudicators is an essential element of the overall civil enforcement process. Such provision is already made in the Road Traffic Act 1991 and related adjudicating regulations. I can therefore assure the Committee that there is no question of regulations enabling representations and appeals not being made under Clause 77 in bringing into force the powers in Part 6.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40504-34_para19"></a>Obviously, the theoretical discretion to make regulations is constrained by requirements of natural justice and human rights, not least the right to ensure the fair determination of a person's civil rights. However, introducing an explicit duty to the legislation produces some awkward, if somewhat theoretical, questions regarding the extent of the duty on the Lord Chancellor and what would happen, for example, if a future administration were to decide against making regulations to enable immobilisation but the Lord Chancellor still had an obligation to make regulations in respect of somebody appealing against having been clamped.
<P>

<a name="40504-34_para20"></a>I hope that the noble Viscount's amendment was probing, and that my explanation answered his questions. I invite him to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40504-35_para2"></a>Clause 78 [Adjudicators]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-35_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Astor </B>   moved Amendment No. 123A:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 47, line 26, after "functions," insert "or if it is proven that he has failed to act in a reasonable manner"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-35_para3"></a><P>

<a name="40504-35_para4"></a>The noble Viscount said: The amendment covers what I believe to be an important issue. It would insert a test of reasonableness into the actions of an adjudicator as set out in Clause 78. I am not sure whether my amendment is either correctly worded or in the right place, but I want the Minister to address the principle.
<P>

<a name="40504-35_para5"></a>There are two issues behind the amendment. First, there have been many complaints by those who have gone to adjudication that they have not succeeded because of technical reasons. That is neither fair nor appropriate. Indeed, there have now also been complaints from the adjudicators themselves that they have not been able to take certain circumstances into account because of the narrowness of the scope within which they can consider an appeal. So the pressure is coming from both ends.
<P>

<a name="40504-35_para6"></a>It will get worse unless we do something about it because, as we heard earlier this afternoon, the Bill will give wardens much wider powers&#151;they will cover moving vehicles as well as just stationary vehicles. I am sure that there will be as great an emphasis on their handing out as many tickets as they can to get their bonus&#151;the car referred to by the noble Viscount, Lord Simon. So it is important that the adjudication system is seen to be fair. At present, there are concerns on both sides.
<P>


<a name="column_GC207"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC207</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40504-35_para7"></a>If the Minister would like a simple example, at the end of January and the beginning of February, traffic wardens placed notices on cars that had been abandoned because of the snow. They had been abandoned because the police had said that the road was blocked. The local authority had not cleared the road; the road was blocked; so the cars were abandoned. The next morning, before anyone could come to rescue his car, along came the traffic wardens and placed parking tickets on them all.
<P>

<a name="40504-35_para8"></a>Because of the technical points that applied, the adjudicator was not allowed to say that that was unreasonable because it did not fall within his remit. That is clearly unfair. As I said, if we are going to give traffic wardens greater powers over moving vehicles, we must ensure that everything works so that there is some respect in the system and the law is kept. They must be well trained; the provision must be sensibly enacted; and there must be a sensible appeals procedure. The amendment is an attempt to introduce a form of reasonableness. At present, an adjudicator is not allowed to take into consideration matters that would normally be considered in a court system. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-35_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   The noble Viscount did not say so specifically, but his amendment would insert those words in a subsection dealing with the grounds on which an adjudicator can be removed. The words in the clause as drafted employ what is a fairly common form in relation to judicial or quasi-judicial appointments: namely, that they can be removed for misconduct or unfitness. On the face of it, although the noble Viscount did not talk to this effect, under the amendment the adjudicator could also be removed if it was proved that he had failed to act in a reasonable manner. If I may say so, that seems quite inappropriate because the whole point of having adjudicators at all&#151;this corresponds with what is required by the European Convention on Human Rights&#151;is but they are independent people, independent of traffic wardens and so on.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-35_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I started by saying that I was not sure whether my amendment was in the right place and that it was the principle of the adjudicator acting in a reasonable manner when considering cases about which I was asking the Minister. I of course apologise to the Committee if the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, thinks that it is in the wrong place. I am sure that he is right&#151;I defer to his expert judgment&#151;but I still want an answer from the Government on the principle of how adjudicators can act in a sensible and reasonable manner when dealing with the cases that come before them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-35_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   I have no doubt that my noble friend, with the broad advice that he is bound to have received, will be able to deal with the substance of what the noble Viscount said, but I am quite sure that the amendment is in the wrong place and it would be quite <P>


<a name="column_GC208"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC208</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>contrary to the independence of the adjudicator, which is so important, for him to be removed for any other reason than misconduct or unfitness.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-35_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Borrie for providing a precis of some lengthy speaking notes and making the very point that I wished to make on behalf of the Government.
<P>

<a name="40504-35_para9"></a>The adjudicator's role is to determine the facts of the case. Mitigating circumstances are for local authorities to consider. We will ensure that mitigation is covered in statutory guidance.
<P>

<a name="40504-35_para10"></a>The noble Viscount may be interested in the following points. If an appellant or enforcing authority is not satisfied with the outcome of a review, they may seek judicial review. Here is the killer: in the past 11 years, leave has been given on four occasions for judicial review of parking adjudicators' decisions. In the same period, around 40 million parking penalty charge notices have been issued by local authorities, of which more than 30 million were issued by London authorities. That does not suggest to us that adjudicators have been acting unreasonably.
<P>

<a name="40504-35_para11"></a>It is important that adjudicators be properly qualified for the role that they perform. They should also have security of office in order to protect their independence. Clause 78(2) provides that an adjudicator,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"must have a 5-year general qualification (within the meaning of section 71 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990)",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-35_para12"></a>
and that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"on the expiry of a term of appointment an adjudicator is eligible for re-appointment".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-35_para13"></a>
That reappointment is not subject to anyone's deciding that they have behaved reasonably. With that explanation, I hope that the noble Viscount will withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-35_spnew8"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   The only part of the Minister's argument that I found utterly unconvincing were the remarks about judicial review. The idea of someone taking a parking matter to judicial review is ridiculous. Judicial review is outside the scope of 99.9 per cent of people in this country. It is incredibly expensive and very difficult. Indeed, it would be a disaster if such a review happened because it would prove that we had got it wrong.
<P>

<a name="40504-35_para14"></a>The Minister said that he felt that, by and large, the adjudicators had not acted unreasonably. I am sure that that is the case, but it was not the basis of my argument. My concern is the narrowness of the points that must be taken into account when looking at a case. Obviously, I must study the Minister's remarks, but he said that the local authority could show mitigating circumstances. My understanding is that that is fine. However, the local authority is not the problem; it is the individual motorist trying to make the appeal who is unable to put forward sensible and reasonable mitigating circumstances of which the adjudicator is allowed to take account. My point is that adjudicators are not necessarily allowed to look at the full circumstances surrounding the case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-35_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Scott of Needham Market </B>   moved Amendment No. 124:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 50, line 30, leave out sub-paragraph (i).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-35_para22"></a><P>

<a name="40504-35_para23"></a>The noble Baroness said: Clause 82 deals with the issue of double parking, and the prohibition of it. The amendment relates to subsection (5)(a)(i), which refers to an exemption being made for the undertaking of,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any building operation, demolition or excavation".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-35_para24"></a><P>

<a name="40504-35_para25"></a>I seek clarification from the Minister as to what undertaking an operation means. It sounds perfectly obvious on the face of it, but one can imagine that on a bank holiday, for example, operations may cease for a four-day period. Would that count as operations taking place? We are talking about that sort of issue, and the length of time that one can reasonably be said to be undertaking work. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-35_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   The amendment would prohibit any vehicle from undertaking any building operation, demolition or excavation while double parking. It seems sensible to me, and I support it. When the vehicle has been used for the day, it seems reasonable that it could be parked off the road somewhere so that it does not add to congestion.
<P>

<a name="40504-35_para26"></a>I point, too, to subsection (4)(c), which refers to the delivery and collection of goods and to other vehicles being loaded in a sensible way, whereby a vehicle that is so parked for those reasons must not be there for more than 20 minutes. Perhaps construction vehicles should come under the same regulation.
<P>

<a name="40504-35_para27"></a>I wish to ask about another matter, which is nothing to do with this amendment. Subsection (3) says that the,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-36_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   The clause is an example of extending a civil enforcement power to deal with the problem of double parking currently available in London to authorities outside London. Clause 82 is based on Section 5 of the London Local Authorities <P>


<a name="column_GC210"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC210</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Act 1995 as amended by Section 6 of the London Local Authorities Act 2000. It takes into account practical considerations and includes a number of exceptions from the prohibition.
<P>

<a name="40504-36_para0"></a>Subsection (5) exempts vehicles engaged in various operations. It includes vehicles being used in connection with the undertaking of any building operation, demolition or excavation. The amendment would remove this particular exemption, which we would find very difficult to accept. Clearly, where vehicles are engaged in building or similar operations, they may need to be able to park immediately adjacent to the site where the works are being carried out. For example, in the case of a mobile crane operation, if another vehicle was already parked adjacent to the site, it might not be possible to park the crane vehicle within 50 centimetres of the edge of the carriageway.
<P>

<a name="40504-36_para1"></a>The exceptions provided for in subsection (5) do not give unlimited licence to double park. I draw the Committee's attention to the caveats in paragraphs (b) and (c). If a vehicle was simply left parked more than 50 centimetres from the edge of the carriageway and none of the activities covered by subsection (5) was apparent, it would be open to an enforcement officer to issue a penalty charge.
<P>

<a name="40504-36_para2"></a>How do we define operations? Operations must happen at the time. It would not cover vehicles parked during a bank holiday while no works were being carried out. I hope that the noble Baroness accepts our argument and concedes that the exceptions that we are offering are legitimate.

I accept absolutely that there are times when double-parking would be necessary. As I made clear to the Committee, I tabled the amendment only for clarification on the question of how exactly it would be determined that operations were going on.
<P>

<a name="40504-36_para3"></a>While I intend to withdraw my amendment, I hope that at the end of proceedings the Minister will consult further with his officials to ensure that the sort of situation where operations cease for a long weekend, and so forth, are covered in the Bill. Otherwise, life might be a little difficult. I beg leave to withdraw.

<A NAME="40504-36_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Berkeley </B>   moved Amendment No. 124A:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 51, line 11, leave out "in Greater London"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-36_para7"></a><P>

<a name="40504-36_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: In speaking to Amendment No. 124A, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 124B to 124E in the group. Subsections (1) and (9) of Clause 83 create a prohibition enforceable as if it were imposed by order under Section 6 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act. It would prohibit parking on the carriageway adjacent to a dropped kerb created for the purpose of assisting pedestrians to cross the road or to assist vehicles to enter or leave the road across a footway or verge, which I suppose would also include <P>


<a name="column_GC211"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC211</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a bus lane. However, it is not apparent why it is proposed to limit this power to Greater London. It would be very good if it could be applied nationwide.
<P>

<a name="40504-36_para9"></a>Clause 83 is very important. I shall therefore suggest some improvements to make it even better. I believe that the clause should be extended to cover obstructions at three types of crossings. The first type of crossing that it should cover is a raised crossing, whether provided for just pedestrians or for pedestrians and cyclists as a kind of dual crossing. The second type is gaps that have been left for the passage of cyclists at points where movement on highways has been stopped by other classes of vehicles. I certainly notice that when trying to cycle through those gaps where people park so close, if the handlebars did not have rubber on them, the cars might get scratched; so it would be very nice if cars were not parked there. The third type that should be covered is dropped kerbs provided for joining or leaving cycle tracks.
<P>

<a name="40504-36_para10"></a>I also believe that this section should cover parking within, say, 10 metres of a junction except in an authorised parking space. That would give legal effect to the advice already given under Rule 217 of the Highway Code. This proposal is probably of greater significance to pedestrians than to cyclists. Nevertheless, parking close to junctions obscures the sight lines of pedestrians and other carriageway users. It is therefore a safety hazard to all road users. This group of amendments is designed to improve an already excellent clause. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-36_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   I support the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley. I am sure that, for once, he will be glad of that. As I have previously pointed out to Members of the Committee, I am in favour of amendments that take greater account of the perils and frustrations that two-wheelers face in our everyday pedalling and motorcycling life. Furthermore, many noble Lords will know that the RNIB strongly welcomes the broad thrust of this clause because of the help that dropped kerbs can provide in making the pavement accessible to the blind and partially-sighted.
<P>

<a name="40504-36_para11"></a>Clause 83(3) states that the,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"exception does not apply in the case of a shared driveway".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-36_para12"></a>
Of course, it would be frustrating and antisocial if one's neighbour, in parking his car, blocked the entrance to one's house. However, if an exception can apply when the owner of a single property gives his consent, surely the same should apply when the occupier of residences that share a driveway both consent to parking on a dropped kerb by their driveway.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-36_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   We welcome the praise for Clause 83 from my noble friend. It will provide new powers to prohibit parking at dropped footways conferred on London authorities by Section 14 of the London Local Authorities and Transport for London Act 2003.
<P>

<a name="40504-36_para13"></a>While we do not wish to take away the power that London authorities have so recently gained, our preference is not to extend these new and untested powers to authorities outside London. There could be practical problems in relation to enforcement of <P>


<a name="column_GC212"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC212</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>dropped footways giving access to off-road parking for residents. Therefore, we would not wish to accept Amendment No. 124A.
<P>

<a name="40504-36_para14"></a>Given that it is essentially an untested power, we would be reluctant to amend Clause 83 in the way proposed in Amendments Nos. 124B to 124E. We are particularly concerned about Amendment No. 124E, which would prohibit the parking of a vehicle within 10 metres of a junction with another road. Rule 217 of the Highway Code stipulates that drivers should not park vehicles on a road where they would endanger, inconvenience or obstruct pedestrians or other road users. One of the examples given is parking,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"opposite or within 10 metres (32 feet) of a junction, except in an authorised parking place".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-36_para15"></a><P>

<a name="40504-36_para16"></a>That rule has featured in editions of the Highway Code since 1978. It does not have the force of law, but can be introduced by a traffic regulation order which can prohibit parking at a junction and provide for that prohibition to be indicated by yellow lines.
<P>

<a name="40504-36_para17"></a>There are severe parking pressures in some urban residential roads. Parking nearer than 10 metres to a junction may not cause danger, inconvenience or obstruction to pedestrians in such cases. So we are reluctant to have an absolute legal prohibition on parking near all junctions as proposed.
<P>

<a name="40504-36_para18"></a>Our preference would be to leave the judgment on whether a legal ban is required to the local traffic authority, which has the powers to make the necessary traffic regulation order. They are the people best placed to judge the needs and circumstances of particular cases. I therefore invite my noble friend to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-36_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   Before my noble friend replies, I should like to ask him whether he believes that not only are perils faced by two-wheelers&#151;I think those were the words used by the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick&#151;but perils are also caused by two-wheelers to pedestrians.
<P>

<a name="40504-36_para19"></a>What is missing from the contribution made by my noble friend and, indeed, in the speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, in favour of cyclists is any admission that pedestrians' lives are put at risk as a result of the antisocial behaviour of cyclists, particularly at pedestrian crossings. There has been an attempt, not 50 yards from where we are sitting today, to enforce the red lights on the pedestrian crossing outside the Palace of Westminster. Every so often, cyclists are stopped, warned and sometimes fined, but the practice has resumed again. One takes one's life in one's hands when crossing the pedestrian crossing when it shows green for pedestrians if cyclists are coming along. They ignore the pedestrians; they ignore the lights; and they expect people to get out of the way. That is unreasonable and dangerous.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-36_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   I am genuinely grateful to my noble friend Lord Faulkner for that contribution. We discussed it briefly at a previous sitting of the Committee. I was challenged on whether I thought that cyclists should obey the law. Clearly, they should. I am a cyclist, but I have very nearly been knocked <P>


<a name="column_GC213"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC213</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>down outside the House by cyclists not obeying the red lights. Of course, currently, I do not think that anyone can stop a cyclist except a policeman because he or she is on a moving vehicle. I am sure that my noble friend will correct me if I am wrong. Cyclists riding on pavements are also a problem.
<P>

<a name="40504-36_para20"></a>There is in addition a road safety issue. I hear what my noble friend the Minister says about Amendment No. 124E, which might need to be looked at again. As regards being able to get on and off cycle lanes and raised pedestrian or pedestrian and cycle crossings, there is an argument for saying, "Well, at least let us try the system outside London and let us try to make it work in London".
<P>

<a name="40504-36_para21"></a>I shall study carefully what my noble friend has said. I may wish to take it a little further but, in the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40504-36_para22"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<A NAME="40504-37_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting </B>   moved Amendment No. 124F:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Before Clause 84, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504-37_para0"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "GUIDANCE TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES
<br>
(1) The appropriate national authority may publish guidance to local authorities about any matter relating to their functions in connection with the civil enforcement of traffic contraventions.
<br>
(2) In exercising those functions a local authority must have regard to any such guidance."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40504-37_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: In bringing forward this new clause we are fulfilling a commitment made in another place. The new clause will place on a statutory basis guidance issued by the appropriate national authority to local authorities exercising civil enforcement functions. In exercising those functions, the clause requires that a local authority must have regard to any such guidance.
<P>

<a name="40504-37_para2"></a>We are concerned with guidance being issued in connection with powers conferred in regulations made under the Bill. The London Local Authorities and Transport for London Act is a local Act of Parliament that was promoted by the London authorities. One of its provisions enables civil enforcement of a number of moving traffic contraventions. Those provisions will be repealed in due course by London regulations to be made under the provisions of Part 6 of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40504-37_para3"></a>So far as guidance on enforcement of moving traffic contraventions is concerned, we will be learning from the London experience when the new powers are piloted starting in June. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-37_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for this amendment, which follows pressure in another place from my honourable friends. They started to fight back on behalf of the honest British motorist who was being unfairly persecuted. Indeed, it has had some effect. The other day, a body no less than Westminster council admitted that its wardens had been too harsh on motorists: the regime was too strict. The councillor in charge of parking pledged to consider forcing the <P>


<a name="column_GC214"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC214</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>contractor to stop rewarding staff with bonuses and trophies when they issued two more tickets in an hour and to have a sensible policy.
<P>

<a name="40504-37_para4"></a>Of course, one must be tempered when one sees that in the noble Lord's department, the Minister, Kim Howells, has decided to battle the site again. At the weekend, he said that the best way to get drivers to use public transport is to try to tax them out of their cars in the same way as the authorities have tried to tax people off cigarettes. There is not much help for the motorist.
<P>

<a name="40504-37_para5"></a>This is an important amendment. We have all seen things happen that should not have happened. There was the famous case in London when the managing director of the YouGov organisation was involved in an accident. His scooter was wrecked. As he was being carried to the ambulance, a warden came along and plonked a ticket on his scooter. Clearly, that should not happen. But I go back to the problem that it is incredibly difficult to bring proper appeals and to work through the adjudication system.
<P>

<a name="40504-37_para6"></a>The Government have said that they will issue guidance. It is important to ask that we are made clear on that. It would also help me as regards earlier amendments on adjudication. Can the Minister tell us when we will see any draft guidance? What is the Government's timetable on that? When the guidance is issued, in the case of appeals, will the adjudicator be able to refer to the guidance when looking at cases? I presume that that will be the case. I should be grateful for the Minister's assurance. I go back to saying that we are all in favour of getting traffic moving and of sensible, reasonable measures taken by local authorities based on the ideal of interpreting the rule of law and the will of local residents, rather than financially rewarding those who are carrying out the process, often in a rather arbitrary way.
<P>

<a name="40504-37_para7"></a>So I welcome the amendment and hope that the Minister will be able to answer my questions.

<P>
<A NAME="40504-37_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Viscount for his welcome for the amendment. Guidance will be developed alongside regulations during the forthcoming 12 months. It will be prepared with consultation, as will many other aspects of the Bill. We hope that the draft regulations will be ready in 2005 for public discussion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-37_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   Would the Minister answer my point about adjudication and whether adjudicators will look to the guidance when they interpret a case?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-37_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   We will be considering what adjudicators can take into account when reaching their decisions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-37_spnew5"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   That is helpful as far as it goes, but only increases my concern that adjudicators should act in a reasonable manner and be able to take the full circumstances into consideration. We will clearly have to consider that on Report.

 "APPLICATION OF SURPLUS INCOME FROM SAFETY CAMERA ENFORCEMENT
<br>
(1) Section 38 of the Vehicles (Crime) Act 2001 (c. 3) (unified power for Secretary of State to fund speed cameras etc) is amended as follows.
<br>

"(6) The relevant national authority may make regulations to permit in specified circumstances income from the enforcement of offences under subsection (2), over and above that required to cover expenditure on the operation of a scheme, to be used in connection with the provision by the relevant local traffic authority of local transport facilities, including road safety measures.""
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40504-37_para21"></a>The noble Viscount said: This is a simple amendment that inserts a new clause about surplus income. It might be popular with the motorist if he realised that the surplus income, whether from speed cameras or traffic light enforcement, would go towards improving local road safety. I wonder what the Minister thinks about that issue. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-37_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </B>   I support this amendment. Indeed, it is very similar to one that I moved during the passage of the Transport Act. At that time we said that unless revenues were hypothecated to local road safety measures in some way the netting off scheme, under which local authorities and the police can form partnerships and keep surplus income, might be perceived as being done to raise revenue. In a Cassandra-like fashion, which gives me no pleasure&#151;well, just a bit&#151;I feel proved right. I am very happy to support this amendment and, <P>


<a name="column_GC216"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC216</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with my tongue only slightly in my cheek, I ask the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, who is a co-signatory to it, whether road safety measures include humps?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-37_spnew10"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   My noble friend Lord Astor has done the Government a great service by tabling this amendment. It will give the Minister an opportunity to make clear the Government's position on revenues raised from safety camera enforcement, if "safety camera", is not over-stressing the term.
<P>

<a name="40504-37_para22"></a>Clearly, there is a significant perception on the roads that, in many cases, these cameras are designed to raise revenue. The Minister needs an opportunity to tell the Committee exactly what happens to those funds and whether they might be used to help road safety schemes. We could also have had similar amendments down about other areas of the Bill where revenue is raised, such as parking attendants issuing fines for road traffic events. There is a real problem there and we need some clarity and transparency from the Government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-37_spnew11"></A><B> The Earl of Erroll: </B>   I support this amendment. I know that PACTS and various people were trying to drive down the numbers killed and seriously injured through safety measures such as speed cameras, but they are beginning to hit the bottom level that can be done by those measures. I understand that most serious accidents happen at a few hundred known accident black spots. A very sensible use of money would be to improve road safety and survivability on certain stretches of road that are known to be bad.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-37_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   The police, local highway authorities and magistrates courts, working together in safety camera partnerships, are strongly encouraged to use safety cameras where there is an identified problem of speed-related collisions. "Safety cameras" is the term that covers speed cameras and traffic signal cameras. This ensures that the partnerships are not tempted to place cameras simply to raise revenue. It would add little value to road safety to have widespread deployment of cameras for reasons other than identified speeding and accident problems. There has been, and continues to be, a considerable amount of coverage in the media about speed cameras. Much of this is misjudged and unhelpful in the attempt to reduce the numbers of people killed or seriously injured on our roads.
<P>

<a name="40504-37_para23"></a>The main charge levelled against speed cameras is that they are deployed in order to raise money for the police, local authorities or the Government. That is wrong on all counts. But it is vital to be sensitive to public concerns in order to maintain respect for the policy and, ultimately, for the law. We must therefore ensure that the legislation that covers what can be done with fines, ensures that there is no incentive for the various public bodies to place cameras for any purpose other than to slow down traffic and reduce road accidents. That is what the present legislation in the Vehicles (Crime) Act 2001 does. Under this legislation, the Secretary of State may make payments to cover the approved costs, but nothing more, of the police, local highway authorities and magistrates courts engaged in speed and traffic signal camera enforcement as safety camera partnerships.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40504-37_para24"></a>Amendment No. 124J would open up the possibility of surplus incomes from fines going to local authorities to spend on local transport and road safety measures. That risks undermining the focussing of safety cameras on reducing accidents and casualties. It should be noted that cameras do not and should not provide a reliable funding stream. The success of cameras is measured on casualty reduction and that can only result from drivers slowing down to the legal limit when passing the camera site. Thus, the best cameras attract no fines.
<P>

<a name="40504-37_para25"></a>I also remind Members of the Committee that there are alternative funding sources available to local authorities to use for other road safety measures or to spend on improving local transport provision. There is no need to alter the existing legislation on camera funding to seek to use those funds.
<P>

<a name="40504-37_para26"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Goschen, asked for a transparent statement on safety cameras. I hope that he will agree that that is precisely what I have done in the past minute or so. In the light of this explanation, I hope that the noble Lord will be willing therefore to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-38_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   The fact is that while there are funds available for road safety schemes, there are insufficient funds available to deal with the traffic road safety issues referred to by the noble Earl, Lord Errol. In fact, most local authorities have a long list of schemes that they can afford, under which they draw a line each year. They are in the position where, having an acknowledged list of road safety schemes, of which there are many, there are insufficient funds to pay for them. Yet, those paying speed fines know, ultimately, if we are honest, that the money goes to the consolidated fund; in other words, to the Treasury&#151;that large maw that is beneath us all.
<P>

<a name="40504-38_para0"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to make the whole system more acceptable to people. That should be the aim. It would be clearly understood by people if the money went towards the removal of accident black spots, of which there are so many. For example, I was on the A303 at the weekend. There must be 100 places on that road alone that need attention, where there are three-lane carriageways which are virtual death traps and are not being attended to. The Government are missing a trick in making funds available to deal with road safety rather than the money just going into the Treasury.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-38_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Simon: </B>   My noble friend briefly referred to people reducing speed when approaching speed cameras. Does that mean that he endorses people breaking the speed limit?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-38_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   No, of course I do not. I said that one of the benefits of a speed camera was that a motorist would reduce speed when approaching that camera, which underlines the importance of the camera in keeping road speeds down to the level set by the local <P>


<a name="column_GC218"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC218</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>authority or the national authorities. So it is very beneficial. As I said, the crucial point is that a speed camera that picks up no one speeding is successful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-38_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   With respect to my noble friend, he has not quite answered the question. Of course, if a speed camera does not catch anyone, everyone is travelling at or below the speed limit. If they have slowed down, surely that is an argument for having more speed cameras in different places that are not painted bright yellow so that people do not know when they will get caught. They might stick to the speed limit all the time where it applies and even more lives might be saved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-38_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My small amendment seems to have sparked a brief debate. I have to say that the Minister gave a clear explanation of the Government's policy. I wish that that was reflected in what actually happens; namely, that cameras are placed everywhere they are needed&#151;for example, at accident black spots&#151;and that they are not, as so often happens, placed in areas where they have clearly been placed for revenue generation. We all know of sites where a 50 mile an hour limit suddenly drops to 40 miles per hour and then up to 50 again. You know that the camera is sited to catch the unwary motorist who fails to notice that, along a perfectly normal stretch of road, the speed limit has suddenly altered. Due to public pressure, this is slowly changing, but much more needs to be done, as my noble friend pointed out.
<P>

<a name="40504-38_para1"></a>It is clear that we shall not get much further in terms of the financial provisions, but it has been interesting to listen to the Minister's view of departmental policy on this. I only wish that that policy could be successfully implemented to make it work better than it does. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40504-38_para4"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment seeks to introduce the concept of variable speed limits in response to weather conditions on motorways while raising the maximum speed limit to 80 miles per hour, thereby ensuring the most expeditious, effective and efficient use of our motorway network. I am aware that there are statistics that oppose the raising of speed limits. No doubt powerful and convincing material can be brought to bear on both sides of the argument.
<P>

<a name="40504-38_para5"></a>The aim of the amendment is to achieve a simple and straightforward system of speed limits. It should not be branded as a cavalier approach to road safety when in fact it is quite the opposite. Edmund King, executive director of the RAC Foundation, has argued that there should be a review of speed limits and that <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>travelling at 80 miles an hour in a modern car on a good road surface at a proper distance from the car in front is perfectly safe.
<P>

<a name="40504-38_para6"></a>We all believe that low speed limits need to be imposed where vulnerable pedestrians are concentrated, such as close to a school, in densely populated residential areas and near the homes of the elderly. It is also sensible to keep the maximum speed limit down to, say, 60 miles per hour in bad weather when rain and ice increase braking distances and visibility is impaired.
<P>

<a name="40504-38_para7"></a>The limit of 70 miles per hour on motorways was introduced at a time when most vehicles had drum brakes and there was an oil crisis. Since then, braking, steering and suspension systems have developed substantially, allowing drivers to brake more rapidly, safely and effectively. Technological advances mean that motorists can travel more safely at higher speeds. Increased engine and aerodynamic efficiency, higher gearing and modern tyre technology allow sustained driving at speeds well above 70 miles per hour. Indeed, in carrying out their duties, the police may well exceed the limit, even doubling it. I believe that the noble Viscount, Lord Simon, indicated that on a previous day in Committee.
<P>

<a name="40504-38_para8"></a>New developments in car technology allow the average motorist consistently to deploy full stopping abilities while retaining control and steering. Should we not move away from the idea that we need to reduce the speed of cars at all costs to increase safety on our motorways? It is a strange notion, given that at the same time we accept the need to increase the speed of buses, trains, planes and boats. If we accept the safety argument about speed for cars, then should they not travel slower than 70 miles per hour?
<P>

<a name="40504-38_para9"></a>Concerns have been raised about the environmental impact of raising speed limits. The increased emissions resulting from such a small change are not likely to be significant. New cars have improved dramatically in the amount of toxic pollutants released in emission gases. Ambient levels of these pollutants are already well below the WHO guideline levels. At almost all times at practically every monitored site, emissions have been projected to fall by 60 to 80 per cent from their 1990 levels by 2010, despite the growing volume of traffic.
<P>

<a name="40504-38_para10"></a>Traffic contributes to only one-quarter of airborne particulates, most of which are produced by large diesel engines in buses and heavy goods vehicles, which would not be affected by a change in the speed limit. For example, a bus emits 120 times as many particulates as a car. Research from the University of Kyoto has shown that 3-nitrobenzanthrone, a very powerful carcinogen, is emitted from diesel bus exhausts when the engine is under load. Cars are much more polluting when they are jammed bumper to bumper in our cities than they are when travelling expeditiously on motorways. Indeed, the Association of British Drivers has shown that an increase in the motorway speed limit to 80 miles per hour would save approximately 11 million vehicle hours per year for cars and 1.5 million hours for light goods vehicles. This would be a good way of reducing congestion on our roads.

<P>

<a name="40504-38_para11"></a>The notion of variable speed limits on our motorways is not new and has been used in the past on particular stretches of road, such as the M25, due to poor weather conditions or weight of traffic. While the Department for Transport has said that the idea had previously been rejected on road safety grounds, it has also made clear that it will be kept under review. On 13 April the Birmingham Post highlighted the Department for Transport's pilot of a system of variable speed limits on a 10-mile stretch of the M42 south of Birmingham.
<P>

<a name="40504-38_para12"></a>It has been pointed out in another place that an estimated 19 per cent of those who travel on motorways do so at speeds in excess of 80 miles per hour, while perhaps 50 per cent exceed 70 miles per hour. The law must be enforced, but it must also enjoy public support. The question is one of achieving a balance. Rather than holding on to the existing 70 miles per hour limit on motorways, which so many see as arbitrary and not worthy of their attention, we should set realistic limits, thus achieving compliance with limits that genuinely matter. The amendment would allow us to stop criminalising drivers who travel on our motorways at safe speeds. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-38_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   That was one of the most extraordinary speeches that I have ever heard from a member of the party that claims to be the party of law and order. The noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, has argued that since so many people are breaking the law, rather than enforce it, the law should be changed so as to make the infringement legal. That is an absolutely baffling proposition.
<P>

<a name="40504-38_para13"></a>I agree with certain bits of what he said, such as the remark that in bad weather speed limits should be lowered. There is also a case for saying that speed limits on motorways could be slightly higher, as in France, where the speed limit on motorways is 130 kilometres per hour and thus closer to 80 miles per hour. However, the difference between driving on French motorways and driving on British ones is that, with few exceptions, the majority of drivers in France keep fairly close to the 130 kilometres per hour limit or, in bad weather, a limit of 110 kilometres per hour.
<P>

<a name="40504-38_para14"></a>The difficulty over here is that, because the law is not being enforced, the number of motorists who observe the 70 mile per hour limit is small. Quite frequently I drive between London and Oxford on the M40. Last Saturday I noticed that the number of motorists who passed me while I was travelling at a fairly sedate 71 or 72 miles per hour was very large.

<A NAME="40504-39_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   So the noble Lord admits that he was breaking the law as regards the speed limit.

<P>

<a name="40504-39_para0"></a>The other point which the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, has omitted to make is that in countries where raising the speed limit has been tried, such as in the United States of America, it has led to a <P>


<a name="column_GC221"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC221</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>very dramatic and alarming increase in road casualty figures. If we were to follow his advice and increase speed limits, two things would happen.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-39_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   I would be grateful if the noble Lord could give me that information, especially that which gives details of the increase in accidents on motorways and the increase on smaller roads.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-39_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   I am sure that my colleagues at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents will be delighted to provide me with the brief that would allow me to answer the question put by the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick. I shall write to him on that in the next few days.
<P>

<a name="40504-39_para1"></a>As I have said, two things would happen. The first is that there would be more accidents, more deaths and more injuries. Secondly, the number of people who would observe the new higher limit of 80 miles per hour would probably be no greater than the number observing the 70 miles per hour limit. The norm would simply be pushed up. Instead of having people going past at 85 miles per hour, they would travel at 95 miles per hour. I think that this is a very dangerous amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-39_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   I certainly support what my noble friend Lord Faulkner has said. A few myths need to be exploded, the first of which is that increasing speed limits would increase road capacity. All traffic engineers know that, on a motorway, the highest capacity is achieved at something between 30 and 50 miles per hour. The faster the speed, the less capacity is available because the distance between cars must be increased. A greater stopping distance must be provided for.
<P>

<a name="40504-39_para2"></a>My noble friend mentioned the speed limits in France. As he said, the limits are enforced and there are lower limits when it rains. The limits are also enforced by checking the time taken to travel between toll booths. If a motorist arrives quicker than the time taken at the legal limit, he is heavily fined on the spot.
<P>

<a name="40504-39_para3"></a>However, my noble friend hit the nail on the head when talking about enforcement. In my experience, which is that of driving on motorways mostly at the weekends, if I am driving as I usually do at 70 miles per hour or less I overtake very few cars, they nearly all overtake me. I do not see any enforcement, except at roadworks, when speed cameras and flashing signs are in evidence.
<P>

<a name="40504-39_para4"></a>We discussed earlier the reduction in the number of traffic police, if we can call them that. Fewer and fewer police are enforcing the rules. If someone is driving at 100 miles per hour, occasionally you see a police car going after them, but apart from that there is very little enforcement, and there will probably be even less in the future as the provisions of this Bill are put in place. I agree with my noble friend that raising the speed limit will encourage people who drive at 90 miles an hour now to drive at over 100 miles per hour.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40504-39_para5"></a>The proposal should be met with the strongest opposition. I think that it would be a complete disaster from every aspect, not only as regards capacity, but also in terms of road accidents.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-39_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Erroll: </B>   I start by pointing out to the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of Worcester, that if we did not change our laws in line with public thinking, we would still have the same draconian laws of blasphemy that were in force a couple of hundred years ago, along with many other provisions that would look quite silly if they were on the statute book. Life changes, as do people's attitudes. Sometimes the law has to be brought into line with what the public are doing.
<P>

<a name="40504-39_para6"></a>I want to deal with the point made about capacity, mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley. I think that we are talking about motorways that are clear, open and not overloaded with traffic, when a variable speed limit might apply, as is the case on the M25. You are not worried about capacity on a clear, open motorway. The noble Lord's argument about how to pack more cars into the slow-moving traffic queue that is the M25 is perfectly true, but it does not apply to a fast and freely moving motorway.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-39_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Earl for giving way. The point I sought to make was in response to the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, who said that one of the reasons for increasing the maximum speed limit is in order to increase capacity. I wanted to make the opposite point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-39_spnew7"></A><B> The Earl of Erroll: </B>   Yes, on a heavily crowded motorway, more cars can travel nose to tail if the speed is reduced. I accept that. But in general, with normal traffic flows and no jam conditions, many cars can travel along at the normal distance of three or four car lengths at a perfectly safe speed, thus getting more cars down the motorway.
<P>

<a name="40504-39_para7"></a>I want to address the road safety aspect. As the killed and seriously injured figures have dropped as a result of action against drink driving, speeding in dangerous circumstances and so forth, something else has been highlighted as a major danger: fatigue. The slower the speeds at which motorists undertake long journeys on motorways, the more fatigued they become and they make more errors, resulting in more accidents. That is a recognised problem. I raised this with a senior police officer at a PACTS meeting. He was very pro speed cameras, but he accepted that there might well be a case for allowing higher speeds on motorways in order to reduce the fatigue factor, although he hedged his opinion with a lot of ifs and buts.
<P>

<a name="40504-39_para8"></a>Motorways are designed to accommodate higher driving speeds in safety. If journey times on longer routes can be reduced, people will be fresher and there will be fewer accidents. While I am a great supporter of the use of electronic communications, we still need to meet each other face to face. It remains essential to drive long distances for business purposes. Trains often do not get you to your destination on time. Although 20 per cent more journeys are being undertaken by train than was the case pre-privatisation, the trouble is that more people are <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>trying to travel around the country. That could be because we have fewer factory workers in fixed places and more service industry workers who need to move around. I shall not go into that.
<P>

<a name="40504-39_para9"></a>A large business can afford to say to its workers, "Take the night off because you will be driving for more than four hours. Come back tomorrow". But someone running an SME does not have the budget for that, and people have to drive very long distances. In my business, I know someone who is driving to Truro and back tomorrow.

<A NAME="40504-39_spnew9"></A><B> The Earl of Erroll: </B>   He will start in the Reading area and travel all the way to Truro and back. He must do so in order to secure a contract. If that person could knock half an hour off his journey either way, it would make a significant difference to his levels of tiredness. I see this as a safety measure.

<A NAME="40504-39_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   Can I ask the noble Earl a question? I do not know whether his colleague is travelling on business or pleasure, but if he is travelling on business, in future he will have to comply with the working time directive. That would limit the number of hours that he can be at work or drive in one day.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-39_spnew11"></A><B> The Earl of Erroll: </B>   It is his own choice. He is a director of a company and I am not sure whether the working time directive applies to him. I do not think that he is worried about it. Moreover, small businesses have to survive. Ultimately, small businesses become the growth enterprises of the future, producing the taxpayers who will pay the taxes that allow politicians and civil servants to try to make this country a better place in which they can live and work. Unless such businesses are nurtured and allowed to grow, there will be no taxpayers to pay the politicians.
<P>

<a name="40504-39_para10"></a>I want to make a point about the highway controllers. They must be sensible about signalling. One becomes fed up with driving along a motorway flagging a top speed of 50 miles per hour. Five miles later, the signs still say the same. As long as the signalling is used sensibly, it would be a useful safety measure. I wholeheartedly support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-39_spnew12"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   This is one of those issues where the moral high ground should be left entirely neutral. We all share the same objective of seeking to ensure that traffic flows more easily while at the same time reducing the number of deaths and serious injuries on our roads. The noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, began by castigating my noble friend Lord Rotherwick. He went on to admit that he regularly breaks the law in his own motorway use, leading no doubt to a headline tomorrow along the lines of, "Safety chief ignores law: admission in House of Lords".
<P>

<a name="40504-39_para11"></a>The simple fact is that the law is in disrepute. People do not obey motorway speed limits. Indeed, I do not think that people see it as an offence to drive at 85 miles per hour. Most traffic in the right-hand lane of a <P>


<a name="column_GC224"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC224</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reasonably clear motorway will be travelling at 85 miles an hour, or possibly more. So we have a problem because some speed limits are quite rightly enforced very vigorously with the support of speed cameras, such as 30 miles an hour outside schools and so forth. On the other hand, as the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, pointed out, speed limits are not enforced on our motorways unless one is travelling at grossly over the limit. There is an acknowledgement between the police and motorists that, in good weather, the speed limit is around 85 miles per hour.
<P>

<a name="40504-39_para12"></a>What we are considering is whether this should be admitted to be the case and the law changed to reflect it, along with better enforcement, or whether there should be better enforcement of the 70 mile an hour limit, if that is really what is desired. I know that the Government tend not to put speed cameras on motorways, whereas they could have gantries of them generating vast numbers of speeding fines. But that is not what happens at the moment. It is an area in which the police use considerable discretion. On the other hand, it would be unsatisfactory in principle to have a law that very few people obeyed. I disagree with the argument put forward by the noble Lord that we should never listen to what the public is doing or adjust the law to reflect public behaviour. That is not the case. Things have changed considerably.
<P>

<a name="40504-39_para13"></a>The technology arguments put forward by my noble friend Lord Rotherwick are valid. A Morris Minor travelling at 70 miles per hour 30 years ago was at the edge of its performance; its braking performance was very poor. A BMW doing 100 miles per hour today can stop very quickly.

<P>
<A NAME="40504-40_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Viscount for giving way. Is there a point at which he believes that the law would be enforced? If the limit were increased to 80 miles per hour, would he favour it being rigorously enforced at that level, or would he allow motorists to set a new safe limit for themselves of 90, 95 or 100 miles per hour?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-40_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   The noble Lord puts his finger on the exact point that we are arguing about. A rigorously enforced higher limit would create a more satisfactory situation than does a lower limit that everyone, including the noble Lord, ignores. The latter results in a situation where gross amounts of public law breaking are permitted, with the police studiously ignoring hundreds of thousands of offences every day. That is not a satisfactory situation. The noble Lord argues for a "looking the other way" policy, which is not necessarily the best approach.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-40_spnew2"></A><B> Viscount Simon: </B>   The noble Viscount is right that technological advances have taken place; we all know the advances that have taken place in recent years. However, one advance that has not taken place is that of the human being, who is still exactly the same. He will still not look at a correct distance from the car in front&#151;

<B>4 May 2004 : Column GC225</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>120 miles per hour? Technology has developed apace, and I am sure that the noble Lord's new car now has airbags, which would provide considerably greater safety. In the days of old, if a driver crashed a Morris Minor the engine went straight through the compartment and the steering wheel straight through the driver. We have moved on from those days.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-40_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Simon: </B>   I agree with the noble Lord that there are airbags and other safety measures. However, if a driver crashed into a brick wall at 70 miles per hour, he would be killed full stop, irrespective of what he was driving.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-40_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   I am sorry. I ask the noble Viscount to reflect on cars on racetracks. They travel into brick walls at 120 miles per hour and the driver survives.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-40_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Simon: </B>   They are constructed completely differently from cars on the road. I reiterate that if a driver crashed his car into a brick wall at 70 miles per hour, he would be killed in about seventh-tenths of a second, so far as I remember. You would not know much about it. If a driver does not look at the correct braking distance or the traffic conditions far ahead, he will not see when vehicles half a mile ahead on the motorway brake and he will suddenly have to brake very rapidly. I do not agree with the proposal to increase the speed limit to 80 miles per hour. As has been said, everyone already drives at 85 or 90 miles per hour, or whatever it happens to be. Consequently, the speed limit of 70 miles per hour should stay.
<P>

<a name="40504-40_para0"></a>The amendment also refers to warning signs, which can be altered to give an advisory speed limit. They are only advisory speed limits. I agree that it would be a very good idea to make them mandatory. Oddly enough, I have thought about the matter in the past. Warning signs have two flashing lights on the top and two on the bottom to indicate the advisory speed limit. If the lights were changed to blue to make the speed limit mandatory, it would work.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-40_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   The first line of my speaking note says that the issue of whether to raise the motorway speed limit to 80 miles per hour has been the subject of much debate. Emotionally, I agree with my noble friend Lord Faulkner of Worcester about the issue. I drove back from Oxford on Friday, and the traffic stream was going at 80 miles per hour. When I pointed that out to the officials, they made the obvious argument that, if the limit were changed to 80 miles per hour, everybody would go at 90. I take the point that the crucial thing is not the car or the technology but the driver&#151;or, perhaps, a combination of both.
<P>

<a name="40504-40_para1"></a>Motorways have a good safety record and compare favourably with other types of road, as I shall demonstrate. Any increase in the speed limit could jeopardise that already good record. The noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, said that there was evidence to support both sides of the argument, but the evidence that we have from America shows that there was an increase of up to 38 per cent in the fatal accident rate following an increase in speed limits on motorways.

<P>

<a name="40504-40_para2"></a>In 2002&#151;the most recent year for which we have UK figures&#151;there were 224 fatalities on our motorways. That equates to 6.5 per cent of the deaths on our roads. We would prefer there to be no deaths, but that figure is low in comparison with built-up roads&#151;39.9 per cent&#151;and non-built-up rural roads, where 53.6 per cent of the total of 3,431 people were killed in 2002. That is an extraordinary statistic. In a way, it pushes my attention away from motorways onto the real problem that we have on rural roads. That is why the Government's road safety strategy includes a commitment to improving rural road safety through better speed management and driver information on rural roads. We have already introduced guidance to local highway authorities on introducing vehicle-activated warning signs and the introduction of 30 mph speed limits in villages.
<P>

<a name="40504-40_para3"></a>The motorway speed limit, introduced in 1965, has been the subject of review on more than one occasion. The last review was carried out in 2001. The review looked at the possible effects of increasing the motorway speed limit to 80 mph. It concluded that raising the motorway speed limit would create too great a risk of increasing accidents and casualties.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-40_spnew8"></A><B> The Earl of Erroll: </B>   I do not understand how just raising the legal limit to the speed that people actually drive at will cause any increase in casualties. People already drive at that speed or more. Why, if it were made legal to drive at that speed, would the number of casualties increase? Do people suddenly go mad, once they are driving inside the speed limit?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-40_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   If it is established that 70 miles per hour is the optimum speed for minimising casualties&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-40_spnew10"></A><B> The Earl of Erroll: </B>   That would be the 90th percentile, in which case, as various road safety studies have established, the limit should be 85 miles per hour.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-40_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   If the noble Earl would kindly allow me to answer his question, he could come back to me. The argument that the Government make would, I think, be made by any reasonable person. Currently, there is a 70 miles per hour speed limit on a motorway, and everybody&#151;everybody apart from my noble friend&#151;drives at 80 or 85 mph. The contention is that, if we raise the speed limit to 80 miles per hour, people will drive not at 80 miles per hour&#151;there is no evidence that they would&#151;but at 90 or 95 miles per hour. Need I say that the chances are that someone driving at 95 miles per hour will be involved in an accident? They would be travelling at one hell of a speed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-40_spnew12"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   If one accepts the Minister's argument about people driving at 90 mph, the obvious answer is to use the speed cameras that have been introduced on motorways. That would be easy, and we would ensure that all those who currently drive at 80 miles per hour could do so legally&#151;they would not be doing anything that they had not been doing for a long time&#151;and that anybody driving faster than that would be caught on the camera.

The last review of the motorway speed limit concluded that to raise the motorway limit would risk increasing accidents and casualties; result in higher emissions of CO2 and oxides of nitrogen; and generate more noise.
<P>

<a name="40504-40_para5"></a>There is already a power for the Secretary of State to bring regulations before Parliament for debate to change the speed limits on our roads. That power is contained in Section 86 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. Also, Sections 17 and 84 of that Act provide for orders to be made so that speed limit changes can be made in circumstances detailed in such orders. To date, the power to introduce variable speed limits has been used only on the M25, although we intend to use it in a new scheme on the M42.
<P>

<a name="40504-40_para6"></a>However, the fact that existing legislation provides that flexibility does not necessarily mean that it is sensible to use it. Also, the necessary infrastructure is not in place to cover the complete motorway network if variable speed limit controls were to be applied nationally. That returns us to the point about the development of new technology. As it develops, variable speed limit controls may become a real possibility.
<P>

<a name="40504-40_para7"></a>Reducing speed limits during bad weather may have its attractions. However, a number of issues would need to be resolved before we could give it serious consideration. Defining what is bad weather and determining the appropriate speed limit needs more consideration and there may not be a simple solution. For example, what lower limit would be appropriate and for what conditions? That is not a practical proposition now and does not require new legislation. I concede that it may be something that we would want to review in future under existing legislation.
<P>

<a name="40504-40_para8"></a>We have had a full debate. We are not going to agree, but I hope that the noble Lord will be prepared to withdraw the amendment.

I was sad not to hear from the Liberal Democrats. In the other place, their Front Bench spokesman seemed warmly to welcome the idea. He said that he saw nothing wrong in principle with the possibility of raising speed limits to 80 miles an hour. It was a pity that we did not hear that argument here.

<a name="40504-41_para0"></a>I am sorry that this emotive subject got the noble Lords, Lord Berkeley and Lord Faulkner and the noble Viscount, Lord Simon, up and running. I can only say that I view them somewhat as the red flag brigade. They were probably better off behind a red flag when motor cars only went at five miles an hour and no one wanted to raise the speed limit. I have to tell them that things have moved on since then.
<P>

<a name="40504-41_para1"></a>I also venture to point out that Germany has much higher speed limits. If we consider the populations of France and Germany compared to ours&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-41_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   If the noble Lord considers accident figures in Germany, he will see that they are immensely worse than ours. That is partly due to the excessive speeds at which people drive. I was quite convinced by the arguments of the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham. Our spokesman in the other place, whom I would not want to denigrate, represents a constituency in the north of Scotland where the population on the road is rather less than it is on roads such as the M40, the M5 and the M4, with which we are much more familiar. In my experience, I see no argument whatever for raising the speed limit.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-41_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   I am so glad that at long last we have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw. It is in keeping with the Liberal Democrats to say one thing at one end of the Corridor and another at the other. It may be that this is another Midlothian question that we should be considering.
<P>

<a name="40504-41_para2"></a>In Germany, where the speed limit is 150 kilometres per hour, we do not find all the cars driving at more than 150 kilometres an hour. In fact, the majority of them drive more slowly. If, as the noble Lord, Lord Evans, says, the USA comparison shows that raising speed limits increases accident rates by 38 per cent, maybe we should reduce our limit to 60 miles an hour on the expectation that people will drive at only 70 and lives will be saved.
<P>

<a name="40504-41_para3"></a>To return to capacity, what the noble Lord says about it is interesting, but the whole point of raising speed limits is that it would save 11 million vehicle hours per year for cars alone. That would mean that there would be fewer cars on the motorway at any one time. Conversely, every time one, unfortunately, drives past a crash, the speed of cars is reduced from a freely moving column of cars and the traffic comes virtually to a grinding halt. After the crash site, cars go back up to their previous speeds and the motorway returns to a freely flowing highway. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40504-41_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: I hope that this will not be such an emotive subject; I would not want there to be any serious injuries or heart attacks in the Grand Committee, but, boldly, I shall continue.
<P>

<a name="40504-41_para7"></a>The amendment would allow us to strike a better balance than we currently achieve and to maximise bus lane capacity without hindering public transport. Sadly, it has become somewhat of a familiar sight to see a third of the road space in one direction taken up by an empty bus lane with the other lanes rammed and heaving with cars and multi-person transport. In another place, the Government argued that this is a centralising measure that damages local autonomy and limits the flexibility of local authorities. It is certainly not. However, we want to redress the balance.
<P>

<a name="40504-41_para8"></a>Currently, the guidance seems to dissuade local authorities from embracing such a scheme. Page 15 of the local transport note, Keeping Buses Moving, suggests that there can be no general case for allowing high-occupancy vehicles to use bus lanes other than in special situations. The first bus lanes were introduced in this country several decades ago and have not served to tackle congestion as they were envisaged to do. Although local authorities must be free to develop their own anti-congestion strategies, including the idea of high-occupancy bus lanes in the Bill would provide an important addition to the array of policies to maximise existing road use.
<P>

<a name="40504-41_para9"></a>The policy of allowing motorcycles in bus lanes&#151;I am sure that every Member of the Committee expected me to address this point&#151;has been piloted successfully in nine cities across the country, including Bristol, Reading, Swindon, Bath and Birmingham, so why not London? Even the Government recognises the advantages of the lower environmental impact of motorcycles for single use transport. Allowing motorcycles to use bus lanes will not hinder the passage of buses. Why do we not allow motorcycles in bus lanes in London, but do allow it on the M4? Allowing those vehicles to use bus lanes would be a cost-effective way of maximising road use, tackling congestion and empowering road users with the choice of using safer bus lanes, without denigrating public transport.
<P>

<a name="40504-41_para10"></a>Importantly, it would allow the poor motorcyclist to use a safer, non-congested part of the road. We have already heard about the vulnerability of motorcyclists, who are 30 times more likely to be killed than car users. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-41_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   I have no problem with allowing motorcycles or taxis to use bus lanes. In London and presumably elsewhere, taxis already do so. I am not nearly so happy with the idea of pedal cycles or invalid vehicles using them, if by invalid vehicles is meant the low-powered sort that are not much more powerful than a motorised wheelchair.

<P>

<a name="40504-41_para11"></a>Normally, in London&#151;I speak only from London experience with regard to bus lanes&#151;the drivers of taxis and buses that have been held up in traffic jams take advantage of reaching a bus lane to put their foot down and make up for lost time, travelling at or very near the maximum speed allowed, which is 30 miles per hour. It is not a good idea, in principle or practice, to mix vehicles travelling at 25 or 30 miles per hour with those travelling at 10 or 15 miles per hour. I know that a 27-gear bicycle may go a little faster than 15 miles per hour, but it would still not go as fast as a bus or taxi. It is dangerous to have people travelling at such different speeds competing for a narrow, limited road space.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-41_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   I am a little surprised at the proposal to include motorcyclists in bus lanes in cities. The one effect of doing that would be to terrify the life out of cyclists, who at present are allowed to use the inside of bus lanes. If they had motorcyclists coming up on their inside or outside, my suspicion is that the life of a cyclist in a bus lane would be very endangered.
<P>

<a name="40504-41_para12"></a>I see no evidence that motorcyclists are held up by traffic congestion. They are already very good at getting through traffic; indeed, it is one of the great selling points of motorised two-wheeled transport that it can get through congestion. I cannot see the benefit of bringing them into bus lanes, but I can see the disadvantage in terms of what would happen to cyclists.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-41_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   The benefit is that there might be fewer motorcyclists killed&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-41_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Faulkner of Worcester: </B>   And more cyclists.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-41_spnew8"></A><B> Viscount Goschen: </B>   I would be interested in the noble Lord's statistics of motorcycle accidents compared to bicycle accidents, if he has them, because he has based his argument on that comparison. My personal experience as a motorcyclist is that motorcyclists and cyclists share the brotherhood of the two wheels and get on very well. If I were a cyclist, I would much rather have a small and nimble motorcyclist come alongside than a bus, which is eight feet wide.
<P>

<a name="40504-41_para13"></a>I do not understand why motorcycles are not allowed to use bus lanes; I believe that it would be a good thing. There may be some extremely strong reasons why they should not, but I have not heard any, although the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, has raised the issue once or twice at Question Time over the years. I hear what my noble friend said about the fact that motorcyclists are allowed to use the bus lane on the M4. That seems to work perfectly satisfactorily, so I do not see why the same principle should not be applied in the cities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-41_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I start by stating the obvious: the purpose of designating bus lanes is to give priority to buses over other classes of traffic. The more that other motorised vehicles are allowed to use them as a statutory right, the more their purpose becomes devalued.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40504-41_para14"></a>Proposed new Clause 6 is unnecessary in relation to cyclists, as they already have a right to use with-flow bus lanes&#151;that is to say, bus lanes such as the one outside this House&#151;where buses are going in the same direction as other traffic. The Secretary of State's consent would be required if a local authority wished to exclude cycles, but that is rarely requested and so rarely given. A small number of bus lanes may exclude cycles for safety reasons&#151;for example, where cyclists are encouraged to use a parallel cycle track rather than a narrow bus lane.
<P>

<a name="40504-41_para15"></a>As for motorcycles, taxis and invalid carriages, local authorities have powers to allow other vehicles to use bus lanes if they consider that it would be desirable. We believe, however, that it should be left to the discretion of local authorities to decide whether any other classes of motorised traffic should be allowed to use any of their bus lanes, taking into account their local transport plans and the specific objectives in creating particular bus lanes. I am sure that Members of the Committee will be delighted to hear that that cannot be done effectively by central government.
<P>

<a name="40504-41_para16"></a>Guidance on bus lanes is contained in Local Transport Note 1/97, Keeping Buses Moving, which acknowledges that there are circumstances where it will be appropriate and desirable to allow other vehicles to use bus lanes and gives guidance on assessing the effects on buses and other road users. In conclusion, this amendment is not necessary in relation to cyclists and would undermine the effectiveness of bus lanes by removing the right of local authorities to decide which other vehicles, if any, should be allowed to use bus lanes.
<P>

<a name="40504-41_para17"></a>The question of motorcycles in the M4 bus lanes was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, and the noble Viscount, Lord Goschen. The concern about motorcycles in bus lanes is the safety of cyclists and pedestrians. There are no cyclists&#151;and, I hope, no pedestrians&#151;on the M4 corridor. That is why motorcyclists are allowed to use it.
<P>

<a name="40504-41_para18"></a>With that explanation, I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw the amendment.

I was not aware that they were allowed to use bus lanes, and I have very rarely seen them use them. So many bus lanes are narrow and do not really have room for a pedal cycle and a bus side by side; although not all of them fall into that category, most do. Are pedal cyclists allowed by statute to use all bus lanes everywhere in the country?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-42_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   I beg your pardon, I mean the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner. However, I think that he misses the point. We do have motorcyclists already in the traffic, but it is a dangerous area&#151;that is perhaps why we have 30 times more accidents. The whole point of our proposal is to try to take motorcyclists to a less vulnerable area, into the bus lane. Perhaps he will join me one morning coming along the Embankment, where he would find numerous motorcyclists overtaking bicyclists. I have yet to see a cyclist jump out of his seat with fright at a motorcycle going past. Equally, I have travelled along the Embankment on both a cycle and a motorcycle, and I have the feeling that we do not frighten each other.
<P>

<a name="40504-42_para0"></a>I would be grateful if the noble Lord would look out for the statistics on the number of motorcycle accidents with bicyclists in London, to see whether there really is a confrontation and whether motorcyclists really only have accidents with cars.

<a name="40504-42_para5"></a>The purpose of this amendment is simply to achieve consistency between the wording to be inserted into the 1970 Act in relation to the form of the badge and that used in Section 117 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40504-42_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment seeks to add to the catalogue of items on which surplus income from parking places can be spent. It gives the opportunity to spend some of that surplus income on road safety schemes, as well as road improvements, environmental improvements and the other items in Clause 91. Its purpose is to secure more funding for road safety, to prevent conflicts with other local authority budget areas and to make clear that road safety is an important priority. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-42_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   Clause 91 gives effect to commitments we made in our local government White Paper, Strong Local Leadership&#151;Quality Public Services. It will allow authorities to spend surplus parking fine income on environmental improvements and enable high performing authorities to be given total freedom on how to spend such surpluses. It does this by amending Section 55(4)(d) of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. At present, once the need for off-street parking has been considered, spending of any surplus is restricted to the funding of highway improvements or the provision of public passenger transport services. The new paragraph (iv) inserted by Clause 91 will enable surplus income to be spent on environmental improvements. The new paragraph (v) will allow regulations to be made prescribing authorities complete freedom to spend surpluses for any purposes for which they may lawfully incur expenditure.
<P>

<a name="40504-42_para11"></a>The amendment would add improvement of road safety and reduction of road casualties to the purposes for which surplus parking income may be used. We believe this to be unnecessary. Our reason for taking that view is that we consider that safety improvements are already covered by highway improvements. Section 55(4A) of the 1984 Act defines a highway improvement project as meaning a project connected with the carrying out of any operation which constitutes an improvement within the Highways Act 1980. Section 329 of that Act defines "improvement" as meaning anything done under powers conferred by Part V of the Act. This enables an authority to carry out any work for the improvement of a road. There are specific provisions in Part V that enable construction of cycle tracks; provision of footpaths, safety rails and barriers to safeguard persons using a road; provision of refuges to protect pedestrians crossing a road and construction of subways under, or footbridges over, roads. Part V also covers alteration of widths and levels of roads, prevention of obstruction of view at corners, installation of road humps and construction of traffic calming works.
<P>

<a name="40504-42_para12"></a>In the light of that explanation, I hope that the noble Lord will agree that what he seeks by his amendment is already covered by the ability of authorities to spend surplus parking income on highway improvements. I therefore invite him to withdraw his amendment.

 In section 121A of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 (c. 27) (definition of local traffic authority), after subsection (5) there is inserted&#151;
<br>
"(5A) Under sections 1, 9, 14 and 22, the relevant National Parks Authority or officially appointed warden of the local authority shall be the local traffic authority for the purposes of controlling traffic by way of a traffic regulation order on any unclassified county road and any road being a footpath, bridleway or restricted byway within the relevant National Park.""
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40504-42_para16"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment was drafted after some discussion with the Public Bill Office. I am sure that it is not correctly drafted but it had to be tabled in time. The object of moving it is to draw from the Minister some indication of the attitude of the Government. The use of what are, in effect, paths or rights of way within national parks, or national trails or footpaths, bridleways and byways open to all traffic, is a matter of great contention between those who enjoy the peace and tranquillity of the countryside and those who use four-wheel drive vehicles, two-wheelers and quadbikes. This amendment seeks to make officers of a local authority civil enforcement officers in respect of traffic regulation orders that have been obtained by a local authority. I know very well that at present these orders are being sought on a seasonal basis between October and May to stop the worst damage that is being incurred by country paths and rights of way. The whole issue appears to turn on whether these paths are roads within the meaning of various acts. Those Acts include various Road Traffic Acts, the Countryside and Rights of Way Act and other Acts. If they are roads, they come within the scope of the Bill and if traffic regulation orders are promoted by local authorities then the question of the enforcement of those traffic regulation orders becomes a matter for the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40504-42_para17"></a>The off-roaders, motorcyclists and people who ride quadbikes argue that they are roads and they base the claims that they are putting forward for consideration under the CROW Act on the basis that they are roads. Enforcement, as we have heard in other cases that we have discussed today, depends on the police, although they will almost certainly not be available to carry out the enforcement required. Therefore my amendment provides that the local authority&#151; I accept that this would have to apply to places that were within a special parking area&#151;could designate certain civilian enforcement officers, who were in fact countryside wardens, to impose fixed penalty fines on vehicles breaching the traffic regulation orders on these rights of way.
<P>

<a name="40504-42_para18"></a>I draw attention to the fact that the national parks are not traffic authorities able to promote traffic regulation orders. There is some overlap between the national park authority and the local authority. Even so, if the local authority promoted the traffic regulation orders within the national park, they would need to be enforced. The local authority or the local chief of police could designate the people employed by the national parks authority as civil enforcement <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>officers within the scope of the Bill. Within the past year, we have strengthened considerably the hand of the Secretary of State in the enforcement of rights of way, but we have not gone far in so doing. To the extent that we rely on the police, we shall wait a very long time. My object in moving this amendment is to probe the Government on how they intend to enforce traffic regulation orders and whether there is a case for the extension of civil enforcement to these officers. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40504-43_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   Part 2 of Schedule 8 provides for the designation of civil enforcement areas outside Greater London. The enforcement authority in the case of parking places is the local authority responsible for their provision or designation. The enforcement authority for other parking contraventions and for bus lane and moving traffic contraventions is the local authority in whose area the contravention is committed, that is the county council, unitary council or metropolitan district council, which are also the highway and traffic authorities. So enforcement within the areas of national parks will be the responsibility of the relevant local authority. Provided that an area of a park has been designated as a civil enforcement area for the particular class of contravention, such enforcement can be carried out in the park. For example, if it has been designated as a civil enforcement area for moving traffic contraventions, the authority will be able to enforce vehicle prohibitions and weight limits on minor unclassified roads.

<a name="40504-43_para0"></a>It is not the purpose of Part 6 to change the definition of highway or traffic authority, which is what the new clause seems to be aimed at. Nor is Part 6 intended to provide a vehicle for revising the systems for making traffic regulation orders under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984.
<P>

<a name="40504-43_para1"></a>The 2002 review of national park authorities recommended that further consideration be given to whether they should become statutorily responsible for rights of way and sought further views. In the light of responses to the review, Ministers concluded that they did not see a change in legal responsibilities as necessary or helpful.
<P>

<a name="40504-43_para2"></a>The Government continue to believe that it is not necessary for the national park authorities to have statutory responsibilities for rights of way. We believe that the current arrangements work reasonably well. National park authorities can already have informal delegation arrangements with the agreement of the local highway authorities.

<a name="40504-43_para3"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, raises the question of what are roads. Footpaths, bridleways and restricted bridleways are roads, so traffic regulation orders can be made to limit or restrict the use of those ways. They can be subject to civil enforcement provided for in the Bill. The noble Lord also asked whether it was possible for national park authority wardens to enforce traffic regulation orders. There is no reason why a local authority could not appoint a warden as a civil enforcement officer to act on its behalf.
<P>

<a name="40504-43_para4"></a>In the light of that explanation, I hope that the noble Lord will be able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="40504-43_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bradshaw: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that answer. As I understand the answer, the way is open, if a local authority has special parking area status, to appoint civil enforcement officers&#151;we knew that. In addition, however, those people could enforce traffic regulation orders in a national park or elsewhere in the authority's area, and the authority could appoint as a civil enforcement officer the warden employed by a national park authority, if it so wished. On that understanding, I am more than happy to withdraw the amendment and beg leave to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504-43_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos): </B>  My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State has made the following Ministerial Statement.
<P>

<a name="40504-43_para21"></a>I have placed copies of the Northern Ireland Prison Service's corporate and business plan for 2004&#150;07 in the Libraries of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="40504-43_para22"></a>The corporate and business plan contains key performance targets I have set for the service for 2004&#150;05. These are:
<P>

<a name="40504-43_para23"></a>1. No escape for top and high-risk prisoners.
<P>

<a name="40504-43_para24"></a>2. No more than three escapes per 1,000 medium and low-risk prisoners.
<P>

<a name="40504-43_para25"></a>3. The number of staff assaulted by prisoners is less than a ratio of five per 100 prisoners.
<P>

<a name="40504-43_para26"></a>4. The number of prisoners assaulted by prisoners is less than a ratio of six per 100 prisoners.
<P>

<a name="40504-43_para27"></a>5. An average of at least 18 hours' constructive activity per week for each sentenced prisoner.
<P>

<a name="40504-43_para28"></a>6. An average of at least nine hours' constructive activity per week for each remand prisoner.

<P>

<a name="40504-43_para29"></a>7. To ensure 82.5 per cent of prisoners serving six months or more are working to a resettlement plan and that 95 per cent of lifers work to a resettlement plan, including preparation of the plan, in the first six months from sentence.
<P>

<a name="40504-43_para30"></a>8. Deliver at least 85 per cent of the planned training days associated with the agreed corporate training priorities.
<P>

<a name="40504-43_para31"></a>9. Reduce the rate of absenteeism to an annual average of no more than 19 days per head.
<P>

<a name="40504-43_para32"></a>10. Lay the annual report and audited accounts before Parliament prior to the summer Recess.
<P>

<a name="40504-43_para33"></a>11. Ensure the average cost per prisoner place does not exceed the target to be agreed with HM Treasury.
<P>

<a name="40504-43_para34"></a>The Government have committed substantial resource to implementing the Steele report, so that staff remain in full control. This does not mean any reduction in the need to tackle the other costs which make for an excessively high cost per prisoner place.

<P>

<a name="40504-43_para35"></a>Also, in light of developments following the Steele report, and to support the development of partnerships with a wider range of statutory and voluntary agencies beyond the criminal justice system, I have agreed some adjustments to the service's statement of purpose, which now reads as follows:

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Northern Ireland Prison Service, through our staff, serves the community by keeping in secure, safe and humane custody those committed by the courts; by working with prisoners and with other organisations seeks to reduce the risk of reoffending; and in so doing aims to protect the public and to contribute to peace and stability in Northern Ireland."</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<A NAME="40504-43_spmin1"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees  (Lord Brabazon of Tara): </B>  The resolution of the House of 20 July 1994 provided for the rate of motor mileage allowance to be uprated annually on 1 April in line with the increase in the retail prices index over the previous 12 months to March.
<P>

<a name="40504-43_para36"></a>Accordingly, with effect from 1 April 2004, the rate of motor mileage allowance was increased from 56.1 pence to 57.6 pence for the first 20,000 miles for the period to 31 March 2005. Further mileage in this period is now payable at the rate of 26.6 pence per mile (increased from 25.9 pence per mile).

<P>

<a name="40504-43_para37"></a>The resolution of the House of 20 May 1998 provided for the rate of the bicycle allowance to be uprated annually on 1 April in line with the increase in the retail prices index over the previous 12 months to March.

<A NAME="40504-43_spmin2"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence  (Lord Bach): </B>  My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Ivor Caplin) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.

<P>

<a name="40504-43_para39"></a>Our Armed Forces have an enviable reputation throughout the world for their professional delivery of operational military capability in a vast spectrum of roles. These range from war fighting to the complex and often subtle requirements of peace support operations and counter-terrorism; besides turning their hand, as they have done in recent years, to providing support to the civil community assisting with firefighting, flood relief and the foot and mouth outbreak. Most who come across Service personnel acknowledge that they have sound essential military skills and operate within an ethos that differs from that generally found within the sphere of civilian employment. Yet those who join the Services are not fundamentally different from the rest of society. What turns a young man or woman into a Service person, capable of taking on successfully the variety of challenging roles which our country demands of them, is the training and education undertaken by Servicemen and women throughout their careers.
<P>

<a name="40504-43_para40"></a>The Ministry of Defence is one of the largest providers of training and education to the 16-plus age group in the UK. The initial training delivered to new recruits is geared to provide them with the essential skills and knowledge to be capable of operating effectively in often unpredictable, violent, dangerous and stressful environments from the outset of their careers. The MoD seeks to develop each individual to his or her maximum potential. Service personnel are given training and education to improve upon their latent ability. Some who join may lack basic skills while others have graduate qualifications. The scope <P>


<a name="column_WS47"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column WS47</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and scale of the training and education provision is considerable, and spans the whole length of a career in the Armed Forces. Not only does this help to recruit and retain people, but, equally importantly, when Service personnel return to civilian employment, they take with them skills of value to society.
<P>

<a name="40504-43_para41"></a>I am therefore pleased to announce that today I have placed in the Library of the House a policy paper, entitled <i>Individual Training and Education in the Armed Forces</i>. The paper provides information on the MoD's wide spectrum of training and education and explains the skills agenda to which this operates. At its core lies the fundamental requirement to prepare Servicemen and women to deliver operational capability. It includes insights into the key stages of initial training and the training environment, and highlights the MoD's determination to remain at the forefront of developing skills for the 21st century.

<P>

<a name="40504-44_para4"></a>To achieve 90 per cent of all Service personnel in dental risk categories A and B by 31 March 2005.

<P>

<a name="40504-44_para5"></a>Key Target 3: Treatment Needs


<P>

<a name="40504-44_para6"></a>To reduce the treatment needs index for each Service to the following: RN at or below 375; Army at or below 600; RAF at or below 375 by 31 March 2005.
<P>

<a name="40504-44_para7"></a>Key Target 4: Military Training



<P>

<a name="40504-44_para8"></a>To ensure that 80 per cent of all DDA personnel, whose medical category permits, achieve their Service's annual mandatory individual military training.

<P>

<a name="40504-44_para9"></a>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury and I are pleased to present to Parliament the annual report of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister for 2004. It sets out the achievements of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.

<a name="40504-44_para10"></a>The aim of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is to create sustainable communities&#151;places where people want to live. It is about revitalising communities, delivering sustainable economic growth, revitalising areas of neglect, improving the quality of local environment and protecting the countryside.
<P>

<a name="40504-44_para11"></a>This, our second annual report, details an impressive array of achievements in every area of our work. We are driving up the quality and supply of housing, speeding up the planning system, reducing the incidence of rough sleeping and the number of homeless families in B&B accommodation, improving our public spaces and giving people a bigger say in what happens in their regions. We are delivering strong, effective local government services and devolving power to local neighbourhoods. We are also renewing and regenerating neighbourhoods particularly in our most deprived areas and reducing social exclusion.
<P>

<a name="40504-44_para12"></a>But we must not be complacent and we know that more remains to be done. We will therefore continue to work hard to deliver our aim of creating sustainable communities that provide a better quality of life, now and in future generations.

<A NAME="40504-44_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rooker: </B>   My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
<P>

<a name="40504-44_para13"></a>I am pleased to announce today the significant achievement against the Government's bed and breakfast reduction target that, by March 2004, local authorities should ensure that no homeless family with children should have to live in a bed and breakfast hotel except in an emergency, and even then for no longer than six weeks.
<P>

<a name="40504-44_para14"></a>Figures collected by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister show a 99.3 per cent reduction in the number of homeless families with children living in bed and breakfast hotels for longer than six weeks, and who were placed there by a local housing authority as a discharge of a homelessness duty, over the two years since March 2002 when the target was set. Local authorities reported a total of only 26 families with children in B&B in excess of six weeks as of 31 March compared to an estimated 3,500 to 4,000 homeless families with children placed long-term in bed and breakfast hotels in March 2002. This reduction reflects the excellent achievement of local authorities working with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. A total of 328, or 95 per cent, of local authorities met the bed and breakfast target.
<P>

<a name="40504-44_para15"></a>In London, where the highest concentrations of homelessness exist and where the highest number of families had been accommodated in bed and breakfast hotels, there were no homeless families who had been in B&B for longer than six weeks on 31 March.
<P>

<a name="40504-44_para16"></a>Figures collected also show that the total number of homeless families with children in B&B was reduced by 88 per cent from an estimated 6,730 in March 2002 <P>


<a name="column_WS49"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column WS49</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to 780 in March 2004. This is the first sustained reduction in total use of bed and breakfast to house homeless families for over a decade.

<P>

<a name="40504-44_para17"></a>The table below shows the breakdown of bed and breakfast figures for March 2004 for the sixteen local authorities that failed to meet the target.

<P>

We will also continue to work with stakeholders on tackling and preventing wider homelessness problems more effectively.

<a name="40504-44_para23"></a>The services concerned are: BBC Three; BBC Four; Cbeebies; CBBC; 1Xtra; BBC Asian Network; BBC Five Live Sports Extra; BBC 6 Music; and BBC 7. I have also published today the BBC's submission on these services, an electronic copy of which is available in the Libraries of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="40504-44_para24"></a>I have announced previously my intention to appoint one reviewer for the digital television channels and one for the digital radio channels. I am pleased to be able to confirm the appointment of Patrick Barwise to the former position and Tim Gardam to the latter.

<a name="40504-44_para25"></a>The reviews will begin immediately and will run concurrently. In accordance with the conditions that I laid down when giving my approval for the BBC to develop these new digital services, both reviews will include both a period of public consultation and a market impact study. I have asked both reviewers to submit their reports to me by the end of August 2004.

<A NAME="40504-45_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </B>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
<P>

<a name="40504-45_para0"></a>The Department of Trade and Industry has transformed its services to businesses by listening to the needs and priorities of business people.
<P>

<a name="40504-45_para1"></a>I am today launching a one-stop website for business. Businesslink.gov.uk will act as a gateway for information and support from across government.

<P>

<a name="40504-45_para2"></a>The new DTI-sponsored site removes the confusing array of advice about government services that up to now has confronted businesses&#151;particularly small businesses. Businesslink.gov is the result of a successful collaboration involving a wide range of government departments and agencies: the DTI, HM Treasury, the Office of the e-Envoy, the Small Business Service, the Inland Revenue, HM Customs and Excise, the Health and Safety Executive, the Department for Education and Skills, the Environment Agency, ACAS and Companies House.
<P>

<a name="40504-45_para3"></a>For the first time ever one site provides quick and easy online access for firms needing information about funding and services provided by departments and agencies, including advice on starting up a business, taxation, employing people and health and safety.
<P>

<a name="40504-45_para4"></a>Services include opportunities for businesses to register for e-filing with Customs and Excise, the Inland Revenue and Companies House in one go as <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>well as a filter to help users to identify which licences they need to trade.
<P>

<a name="40504-45_para5"></a>Advice is provided in clear language on issues which businesses have identified as important and relevant to their needs. It is supported by practical tools to achieve results and therefore reduce the time that businesses have to spend on regulations and other matters.
<P>

<a name="40504-45_para6"></a>Work has now largely been completed on the radical restructuring of the DTI's business support to create products that promote enterprise innovation and best practice to meet customer need for a streamlined range of products that are easy to access.
<P>

<a name="40504-45_para7"></a>Four of these new products were released in 2003: grant for research and development, knowledge transfer partnerships, grant for investigating an innovative idea and the small firms loan guarantee.

<P>

<a name="40504-45_para8"></a>Five new support products became available to businesses during April this year. These are: collaborative research and development, knowledge transfer networks, access to best business practice, support to implement best business practice and selective finance for investment in England.
<P>

<a name="40504-45_para9"></a>Small and medium-sized businesses will be able to access these products through Business Link. Larger corporates and business organisations can access them through the DTI while the regional development agencies will deliver products which deal with specific regional issues. Detailed information about all these products is available to businesses through the business support directory available on Businesslink.gov.
<P>

<a name="40504-45_para10"></a>In the development of these products I have been advised by an expert investment committee that includes and is chaired by independent business members. The committee will ensure that the impact of DTI products is thoroughly evaluated and that there is a clear economic rationale for the support we provide.
<P>

<a name="40504-45_para11"></a>The closure of business support schemes that the DTI has funded in the past is progressing as quickly as possible but at a pace which meets outstanding commitments.

<P>
<UL>Why the Northern Ireland Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure stopped the Ulster-Scots Agency's policy of targeting social need by removing the appropriate section of its budget for the year 2004.[HL2194]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504w01_spmin0"></A><B> The Lord President of the Council  (Baroness Amos):</B>  The approved budget for 2004 for the Ulster-Scots Agency is &#163;1,704,000. This gives an increase of &#163;164,000 (10.65 per cent), on the approved budget for 2003. The budget was calculated on the basis of the 2003 budget with amounts due to inflation and the cost of additional staff. This is in line with the care and maintenance mode in which North/South bodies are operating. The Ulster-Scots Agency's policy of targeting social need is ongoing and the approved budget for 2004 should not impact detrimentally on this. Targeting social need is a cross-cutting theme that should be reflected throughout the agency's programme of work.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504w01_wqn6"></A><B> Lord Jopling  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Further to the Written Answer by the Lord Bach on 20 April (WA 24), why the reserve standard award for the mobilised members of the Reserve Forces has not been changed since 1997; and whether they will update it forthwith, with retrospective effect to the beginning of the 2003 Iraq conflict.[HL2499]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504w01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Bach:  </B>  The regulations for the Reservist's standard award are set out in SI 1997/309. Although the banded ceilings relating to that award were prescribed in 1997, they have continued to meet the needs of the vast majority of Reservists who have made claims for financial assistance under the regulations. Furthermore, those Reservists who believe that they would suffer hardship if they receive only the standard award are able to claim an additional hardship award. There is no ceiling for a hardship award. Reservists who are dissatisfied with the payments they receive from the Ministry of Defence may appeal to a Reserve Forces appeal tribunal. Of the 10,000 Reservists that have been called out since January 2003, only eight have submitted appeals regarding their financial awards. Of those eight, two were resolved to the Reservists' satisfaction before the date of the appeal hearing, two were found in favour of the Service authorities, one is ongoing and three have yet to be heard.
<P>

<a name="40504w01_para7"></a>Notwithstanding that the current regulations have satisfied the needs of the great majority of Reservists, we recognise that the current system is both time-consuming to administer and perceived to be intrusive by Reservists. Also, we recognise that the banded ceilings are being eroded by pay awards. We are therefore planning to introduce new regulations, but there is no intention or need to make them retrospective.

<A NAME="40504w01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bach:  </B>  NATO has recently announced its preferred solution to meet the requirements for a NATO-owned and operated core alliance ground surveillance (AGS) system. NATO has decided to pursue the transatlantic industrial proposed system (TIPS) option proposed by a consortium led by EADS and Northrop Grumman. The TIPS option is based on a mixed fleet of manned aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). NATO AGS work is now focused on taking the TIPS option through to contract award in spring 2005.
<P>

<a name="40504w01_para8"></a>The UK participated in the recently completed definition phase. While we shall not be a funding partner in future phases of the core AGS programme, we will contribute advice and guidance to ensure that the required interoperability with the ASTOR system is achieved. The UK will be offering ASTOR as a national contribution to the overall NATO AGS capability, to complement the core AGS system when the latter enters service.

The effective transmission of data across the Bowman networks is a function of the size of the data file and the bandwidth available at the time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504w02_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions   (Baroness Hollis of Heigham): </B>  We estimate that, as a result of reducing the limited price indexation cap from 5 per cent to 2.5 per cent, the average pensioner will face a reduction in their total income over retirement of less than 2 per cent. We do not therefore expect a significant increase in the number of pensioners eligible for income-related benefits.

<A NAME="40504w02_wqn5"></A><B> Lord Morris of Manchester </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504w02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   We estimate that, as a result of reducing the limited price indexation cap from 5 per cent to 2.5 per cent, the average pensioner will face a reduction in their total income over retirement of less than 2 per cent. As those affected will already have additional provision for their retirement from their occupational pensions, it is unlikely the measure will have any measurable impact on people aged over 80. Moreover, other measures in the Bill, such as the Pension Protection Fund, should help all pensioners by offering protection against the more significant losses of retirement income that may result from employer insolvency.

In this way, it is hoped that possible savings made elsewhere through simplification measures will contribute to reducing the effect of the PPF levy on business overall.

<a name="40504w02_para2"></a>As explained in PQ/04/2442, the requirement to pay the levy will fall on the trustees of the scheme, who will be left to judge how the levy charge could then be shared as they see fit among employers and employees as one of the overall pension costs. Therefore, if any extra resources are required, they may be shared fairly between both the employer and active members.
<P>

<a name="40504w02_para3"></a>The Government want to take action to increase member protection without overburdening levy payers, which is why care is being taken to calculate the levy in the fairest possible way and minimise the burden on schemes.

<P>
<A NAME="40504w03_wqn4"></A><B> Lord Marlesford </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>When the efficiency of the administration of community service punishment was last reviewed and which government agency is responsible for the matter.[HL2296]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504w03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   The government agency responsible for reviewing the efficiency of the administration of community punishment is Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Probation. Community punishment schemes in all 42 areas of the National Probation Service were reviewed as part of the performance inspection programme between 1999 and 2002. These inspections addressed the achievement of national and local targets, compliance with national standards, the organisation, nature and quality of the work undertaken by offenders and the satisfaction of those who benefited from that work.
<P>

<a name="40504w03_para6"></a>The currrent inspection programme is the effective supervision inspection which began in June 2003 and will eventually cover all 42 areas. This will focus on management arrangements in community punishment units, along with assessment of offenders and the suitability of work placements.
<P>

<a name="40504w03_para7"></a>Additionally, since the development of the enhanced community punishment scheme in 2003, the National Probation Directorate has developed a framework to assess how effectively this has been implemented in probation areas. A rigorous post-implementation review is currently underway with very encouraging results. Once the implementation phase is completed, areas will undertake an annual audit of their enhanced community punishment provision to ensure that quality is maintained.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504w03_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   Litter clearance is a suitable activity for offenders sentenced to community punishment and has always formed a proportion of the unpaid work&#151;currently standing at 7 million hours each year&#151;performed by offenders on community punishment orders. It provides punishment of offenders in combination with reparation to the community.
<P>

<a name="40504w03_para8"></a>The enhanced community punishment scheme which was introduced in October 2003, and is now operational in all 42 areas which make up the National Probation Service, is designed in such a way that it also <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>has a rehabilitative effect and the potential to reduce the likelihood of reconviction.
<P>

<a name="40504w03_para9"></a>Research indicates that certain qualities or features of placements appear to increase the rehabilitative impact of community punishment and the introduction of enhanced community punishment obliged local probation areas to re-evaluate all existing placements with a view to their capacity:
<P>

<a name="40504w03_para10"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>to provide demanding, purposeful work which the offender and the people who benefit from it see as a worthwhile contribution to the community;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504w03_para11"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>to ensure contact between the offender and the members of the community who benefit from the work;

<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504w03_para12"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>to provide opportunties for the offender to learn new practical and thinking skills, particularly in relation to employment; and
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>to comply with health and safety requirements.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40504w03_para14"></a>Where existing placements have not matched these criteria, it has usually been possible for areas to work with and support beneficiaries to ensure that the requirements can be met.
<P>

<a name="40504w03_para15"></a>The type of activity undertaken is much less important than whether the placement provides challenging and demanding work for the offender, enabling them to develop skills which will improve their prospects in the job market. As long as the beneficiary and the probation area work in partnership, it should be possible to provide a quality placement through a well run litter clearance scheme. Suffolk Probation Area, for example, is currently undertaking litter clearance on a number of beaches as well as for local councils. A number of their staff are currently working towards a City and Guilds qualification which is a legal requirement for the supervision of litter clearance on highways and this should enable them to expand their activities further.

There may also be individuals whose circumstances are such that they qualify for leave under our published policies on humanitarian protection or discretionary leave.

<a name="40504w04_para0"></a>If an asylum or human rights application is refused, there will be a right of appeal to the independent appellate authorities against that decision. Should a claim be refused and any appeal be unsuccessful that means that, for that individual, return to Zimbabwe would be safe. Although we are not, in the wider context of the Government's position on Zimbabwe, generally enforcing returns of such individuals at this time, we consider it entirely reasonable to expect them to leave voluntarily. It would not be appropriate in those circumstances to grant them leave to remain in the United Kingdom.

<P>
<UL>Why, in terms of passports, there are differences between British citizens and British subjects; what the differences are; and whether any changes are envisaged.[HL2486]<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504w05_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal:  </B>  Citizenship is a matter of law, which is determined by the facts of a person's date and place of birth, those of their parents and the application of the provisions of the relevant legislation.
<P>

<a name="40504w05_para0"></a>The British Nationality Status of Aliens Act 1914 determined in law that all persons born in the United Kingdom and Crown's dominions would hold the status of British subject.
<P>

<a name="40504w05_para1"></a>The British Nationality Act 1948 introduced the concept of citizenship and determined which British subjects would become a British subject, citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies (BSUKC). The Act came into force on 1 January 1949, and provided for all persons born in the United Kingdom and Colonies to become BSUKC by birth. Those born in a foreign or Commonwealth country who had a father born in the United Kingdom or existing colony would become BSUKC by descent. Other British subjects with a close connection with an independent Commonwealth country became British subjects, citizens of . . . (the Commonwealth country).
<P>

<a name="40504w05_para2"></a>The status of British subject was retained by a small number of British subjects. In particular Irish citizens born before 1 January 1949 could elect to remain British subjects. British subjects born in British India before 1 January 1949 who did not become citizens of India also remained British subjects on 1 January 1949.
<P>

<a name="40504w05_para3"></a>The British Nationality Act 1981 provided for BSUKCs who had the right of abode in the United Kingdom to become British citizens on 1 January 1983. It also retained the status of British subject for those who remained British subjects on 1 January 1949.
<P>

<a name="40504w05_para4"></a>British subject status only applies to those born before 1 January 1949 and cannot be passed to further generations by descent, as is the case with British citizenship. The status will fail to exist when the last British subject is deceased.
<P>

<a name="40504w05_para5"></a>All British passports are issued in the same format and are only distinguishable by the status shown on the personal details page, or in some cases where the passport holder is not a European national for passport purposes by the absence of "European Union" on the front cover.
<P>

<a name="40504w05_para6"></a>The major difference between the status British citizen and British subject is that British citizens are able to travel freely within the European Union whereas British subjects who are not European nationals for passport purposes, may need to obtain visas prior to travel. Individuals holding "British Subject" passports may be required by the immigration laws of the receiving country to obtain visas prior to travel. This is not a matter over which the British Government have any authority to intervene. The UK Passport Service therefore recommends that all travellers check with the travel agent or the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country they intend to visit if a visa is required.
<P>

<a name="40504w05_para7"></a>There are no changes envisaged.

<P>
<UL>How many Immigration Act detainees were held in HM Prison Maghaberry at the most recent date; whether any were children or juveniles; how many were awaiting deportation; and whether their regime (akin to that of prisoners on the enhanced regime) would be improved if they were treated as remand prisoners.[HL2451]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504w05_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal:  </B>  As at 27 December 2003 (the latest available date for which data are available) fewer than five individuals recorded as having sought asylum were detained at HMP Maghaberry, all of whom were adult males.
<P>

<a name="40504w05_para8"></a>It is not possible to identify how many of these persons were awaiting deportation.
<P>

<a name="40504w05_para10"></a>Information on the number of people detained as at 27 March 2004 will be published on the Home Office website (www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration1. html) on 25 May 2004.

<P>
<UL>What is their assessment of the significance of the current situation in Afghanistan in their action against Al'Qaeda; and in this context, what are they now doing, together with their allies, to limit the power of the warlords and to increase aid and assistance for civil reconstruction.[HL2445]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40504w05_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </B>  As a result of our efforts with the US and others in Afghanistan, that country is no longer a safe haven for Al'Qaeda (AQ). It is not always easy to distinguish AQ elements from other groups hostile to the current political process in Afghanistan. Extremists are undoubtedly attempting to establish bases there from which to operate, but successful military operations conducted by the coalition and units of the Afghan national army (ANA) are preventing them doing so. <P>


<a name="column_WA113"></a>

<B>4 May 2004 : Column WA113</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>AQ operations worldwide have suffered disruption. AQ leadership is dispersed and operating under increasingly difficult conditions. Many key operatives and planners have been detained.
<P>

<a name="40504w05_para11"></a>The US-led coalition and NATO have now deployed a total of 12 provincial reconstruction teams (PRTs) to help to extend the authority of central government at the expense of regional power-holders. The UK-led PRT in Mazar-e-Sharif helped to broker a ceasefire between two regional commanders in October 2003 and more recently played a key role in preventing factional unrest developing in Faryab Province, where a second UK-led PRT is now being established. The new PRT is already working with ANA and Afghan national police units sent to the area by President Karzai. PRTs have had a demonstrably beneficial effect on security in the areas they cover and this in turn helps to facilitate reconstruction.
<P>

<a name="40504w05_para12"></a>On 1 March 2004 my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development announced in his Written Statement (Official Report, Column 74WS) an increase of the UK's commitment, from &#163;200 million over five years to at least &#163;500 million over the same period. This funding is to support a range of reconstruction work, support for conflict prevention, and the counter-narcotics effort. A booklet outlining DfID's programme in Afghanistan has been placed in the Library of the House. International donors demonstrated their commitment to Afghanistan at the Berlin conference held on 31 March to 1 April 2004 by pledging 8.2 billion dollars of assistance over the next three years. This represents two-thirds of Afghanistan's requirements over this period. We hope that the full requirement will be met through more money becoming available from donors that were only able to make one-year pledges in Berlin.

But the situation in Darfur is very different to that of Rwanda in 1994.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
