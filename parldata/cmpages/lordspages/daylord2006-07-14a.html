to give the usual advice about times. For the three debates today we
have more than 30 speakers; if the maximum time for Back-Bench
contributions were limited to 10 minutes, then we should finish by well
before five o&#146;clock, which is a bit later than we would normally
finish. That is the guidance for today&#151;a maximum of 10 minutes

Wakeham</b> rose to move That this
Housetakes note of the report of the Economic Affairs
Committee on the Economics of Climate Change (2nd Report, HL Paper
12).</p><p><a name="06071457000012"></a>The noble Lord said: My
Lords, I am delighted to be able to introduce this debate. It is more
than a year ago since our report was published, on the eve of the last
G8 summit at Gleneagles. Since then we have had the opportunity in this
House to discuss climate change in the debate on 10 November, which was
initiated by the noble Lord, Lord May. But eight months later, the
subject remains, of course, as topical as
ever.</p><p><a name="06071457000013"></a>Like all
economic affairs reports, this one is evidence-based and non-party
political. And once again, the report has been agreed by all Members of
the committee. My first thanks are to my colleagues on the committee
for collectively making it possible for us to deal in a dispassionate
and, I hope, effective way with so sensitive and difficult an
issue.</p><p><a name="06071457000014"></a>I also want to say a
particular word of appreciation for the work of the late Professor
David Pearce, our specialist adviser. David Pearce was one of the
founding fathers of environmental economics in this country. His
international reputation was reflected in the lifetime achievement
award ofthe European Association of Environmental and Resource
Economists, which he received in June last year, only weeks before the
publication of our report. He was a truly outstanding adviser to the
committee, and our report would certainly not have been produced
without him. So his sudden and early death, only a month after our
report was published, is a terrible loss, not only to his family and
friends but to the world of environmental
economists.</p><p><a name="06071457000015"></a>I also wish to say
how much we appreciated the work of our Clerk and his advisers on the
team. They were a great help to us.</p><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_902"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 902</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071457000016"></a>The report received considerable
publicitywhen it was published. Some of this reflected the
international political context at the time. Climate change was central
to the G8 agenda at Gleneagles, and the report appeared just as the
world leaders were gathering. But I believe its reception also owed
much to the fact that it was addressing the economic aspects of the
subject. Many distinguished economists were working on climate change,
and we took evidence from a number of them, but it is usually their
scientific colleagues who receive the lion&#146;s share of media
attention.</p><p><a name="06071457000017"></a>Perhaps as a result
of the relatively fresh perspective that I believe we were able to
bring to the subject, most of the publicity received by our report on
publication was very positive. Of course, there were critics too,
although it subsequently emerged that some of them had not actually
read the report when first pronouncing on it. When some later got round
to doing so, one or two even acknowledged that they might have
misjudged it.</p><p><a name="06071457000018"></a>However, the
Government&#146;s response, when it eventually emerged, was very
disappointing&#151;grudging in tone and generally negative on
substance. I wrote in February to the then Secretary of State, Margaret
Beckett, and to other Ministers, including the Prime Minister, to
express our disappointment at the Government&#146;s response. I noted
that the response negativity was all the more surprising when it
appeared increasingly that in important aspects, the
Government&#146;s thinking is close to the views set out in the
committee&#146;s report.</p><p><a name="06071457000019"></a>I
referred then to the Prime Minister&#146;s comments at the Clinton
summit in New York in September and on subsequent occasions, which
indicated a rather radical change in direction for the Government. The
Prime Minister noted that he was changing his thinking on climate
change and that there was a need for &#147;brutal honesty&#148;
about the politics of how we deal with it.</p><p><a name="06071457000020"></a>On Kyoto, the Prime Minister noted that
there,</p><ul><a name="06071457000506"></a>&#147;is a
disagreement...It&#146;s not going to be
resolved&#148;.</ul><a name="06071457000466"></a>He also
said:<ul><a name="06071457000492"></a>&#147;I don&#146;t
think people are going&#151;at least in the short term&#151;to
start negotiating
another...Kyoto&#148;.</ul><a name="06071457000467"></a>All
this was entirely in line with the thinking of the
committee.<p><a name="06071457000021"></a>The energy review
published this week appears to be the work of Jekyll and Hyde. On the
one hand, there is a recognition that nuclear power must play a part in
Britain&#146;s energy supply mix. This realism is
welcome&#151;indeed, long overdue&#151;but I fear it will take a
number of years before there is a significant increase in nuclear
generation. On the other hand, the shortcomings of the 2003 review,
including in particular what we felt was the utter lack of realism
about the role of renewables, has unfortunately been carried over into
the recent review. However, I am always optimistic, and I hope that the
noble Lord, Lord Rooker, whom I have known and admired for more than 30
years, since we entered the House of Commons on the same day, will
produce a more measured, realistic and positive response from the 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_903"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 903</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government that is more consistent with the realism of the Prime
Minister than with some of the fantasies of the old
Defra.</p><p><a name="06071457000022"></a>On the central point of
our report, the Government did immediately follow the advice of the
committee. Given the importance and complexity of the issues involved,
we were very clear that the Treasury needed to play a much more
extensive role on climate change within government, so we were
delighted that within days of publication of our report, the Chancellor
announced the review of the economics of climate change to be led by
Sir Nick Stern. That was the correct thing for the Government to do and
we congratulate them on their action. The committee has been following
Sir Nick Stern's review with interest and we very much look forward to
his report.</p><p><a name="06071457000023"></a>I am hopeful that
the Stern review will readily endorse many of the committee's
conclusions and recommendations. For instance, there is a risk that
international negotiations will not secure large-scale and effective
action on mitigation. The Stern review might take a more sanguine view
of the risk than we did. But there is clearly some risk. We therefore
want to see a more balanced approach to the relative merits of
adaptation and mitigation, with far more attention paid to adaptation
measures.</p><p><a name="06071457000024"></a>Another key
recommendation in our report, which I feel confident the Stern review
will go along with, is the need for a far stronger focus on technology
and research and development. That does not, in our view, mean a little
more of what is being done now. It means a step change to a research
and development effort into carbon-free and low carbon energy sources
of an altogether different magnitude. In our report, we suggested that
the US Apollo programme to put a man on the moon provided a precedent
for the sort of extraordinary effort and priority that is needed. On
that point, the recent energy review is disappointing. I see no
evidence that the Government are committed to an effort on the scale of
what is required on that
front.</p><p><a name="06071457000025"></a>As I have already said, I
hope that the Sternreview will follow the Prime Minister as
well as the committee in taking a &#147;brutally&#148;&#151;the
Prime Minister&#146;s word&#151;realistic view of the prospects for
effective emissions controls. But, in any case, the committee outlined
concerns about the workingsof the relevant international body,
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. There is perhaps room
for debate about the significance and full implications of the
shortcomings in the IPCC process. However, the IPCC has an exceptional,
largely unquestioned, authority in this area&#151;perhaps
unparalleled in United Nations agencies working in other fields. In
such a situation, what seems indisputable is the need for an
organisation and a process whose procedures, objectivity and balance
are not only beyond question, but are seen to be beyond question. For
all the fine work done by the IPCC, to which I pay tribute, I fear that
that is not the present position.</p><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_904"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 904</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071457000026"></a>Finally, I refer the House to the concerns
that the committee expressed that UK energy and climate policy appeared
to be based on some very dubious assumptions about the roles of
renewable energy and energy efficiency. We also pressed for a proper
carbon tax to replace the present climate change levy, and we urged the
maintenance of as wide an energy portfolio as possible, with the
retention of nuclear power. On that last point, the energy review is,
as I have said, encouraging.</p><p><a name="06071457000027"></a>Although it is right
that renewable energy and energy efficiency are given priority, it is
disappointing not to find in the review much more realism about what
they can be expected to achieve. Also disappointing is the lack of
commitment to the introduction of a carbon tax. Some very distinguished
speakers are taking part in this debate, which I am delighted about.
Iam very much looking forward to hearing all the
contributions, including the maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord
Teverson. I beg to move.</p><p><a name="06071457000028"></a>Moved,
That this House takes note of the report of the Economic Affairs
Committee on the Economics of Climate Change (2nd Report, HL Paper
12).&#151;(<I>Lord
Wakeham.</I>)</p><h5><a name="06071457000522"></a>11.17
am</h5><p><a name="06071457000029"></a><b><a name="06071457000560"></a>Lord
Giddens:</b> My Lords, I first congratulate the noble
Lord, Lord Wakeham, and his committee on their report, which bears
evidence of a great deal of thought and work. At least, it is a bit
different to see something from a gaggle of economists writing on
environmental issues. It is said that one advantage of being an
economist is that you get to write about money without ever having to
make any. I am pleased to see that this report is eminently practical
in its implications.</p><p><a name="06071457000030"></a>In our
society today&#151;indeed, throughout the world&#151;we are having
to deal with the ripple of two types of intersecting shock. One is
certainly climate change shock. For a long while, climate change seemed
to many people to be a kind of abstract thing for the future&#151;a
possibility that was continuously disputed within certain sectors of
the scientific community. Although I gather that some sceptics will
speak later, having looked at the literature extensively for the past
four or five years, I do not see how it is possible to hold that
position any longer. Climate change is in the here and now. When a city
in the richest country in the world can be overwhelmed by flooding
within 24 hours, it is an indication that something is different in the
world. Of course, we do not know whether what happened in New Orleans
was influenced by climate change. But most of the models of climate
change centre on the Caribbean as a source of major perturbations in
world weather patterns.</p><p><a name="06071457000031"></a>Energy
price shock is just as important. It plainly intersects with climate
change shock because some of the solutions to the two clearly overlap.
One can see the difference today even from a year ago in the report,
which is quite muted on the theme of energy, but most people now agree
that energy pricing looks set to increase and that many of the risks
that we face in the world, including the risk of terrorism, overlap 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_905"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 905</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with these other two types of shock. Most noble Lords will know that
there was a terrorist attack on one of the major oil installations in
the Middle East about a year ago. That attack failed, but it could have
taken out about one-tenth of the world energy supply in one single
attack, so we are dealing with an overlapping range of risks
here.</p><p><a name="06071457000032"></a>I find a lot in the report
that I agree with. It is right to say that economics should be brought
into the centre of debates about climate change and that the Treasury
should play an important role alongside those arms of government that
specialise in dealing with the environment. I am pleased to see that at
least some progress has been made in that direction. I believe that it
is right to put stress on technology and research and development, and
what the report calls a &#147;Kyoto plus&#148;. We all know that
Kyoto is inadequate, partly because the Americans have not signed up to
it and because it covers only part of the world and, as we all know,
even if it were fully signed up to, it would get nowhere near to
resolving the issues that we face with climate
change.</p><p><a name="06071457000033"></a>It is also right to say
that every nation must have diverse energy sources and that nuclear
power must be part of that mix&#151;although even the advocates of
nuclear power recognise that there are major problems with it. It is a
long-term solution, and some of the crises involved have become
short-term crises, especially around energy supplies. Having looked at
this issue in detail recently in relation to European legislation, with
which I was involved, there are major problems in setting up a scenario
in which the private sector would be able to play the major role in
financing new nuclear power stations. We should all watch closely the
experiment in Finland, with that country&#146;s new nuclear power
station.</p><p><a name="06071457000034"></a>However, there are
three critical comments that I should like to make about the report.
First, I am a bit puzzled by the fact that it does not mention the
theme of ecological modernisation. That is perhaps the dominant theme
of the relationship between economics and the environment and has been
prominent in the literature for at least the past 10 to 15 years. The
idea is controversial, but it proposes that there are many
circumstances in which environmentally friendly technologies are also
more efficient than those which are not environmentally friendly or not
environmentally neutral, and that environmentally sophisticated
technologies might in principle have bigger markets than those which
are less sophisticated or polluting. Of course, you can supplement
those things with a range of energy taxes to make them more saleable
and marketable in local and global
markets.</p><p><a name="06071457000035"></a>Let us consider the
example of the Toyota motor car company. Toyota has recently overtaken
General Motors to be the largest car manufacturer in the world. There
are many reasons for this: Toyotas do not break down very often, as
anyone who has owned one knows. But most analysts agree that it is also
because Toyota is by far the most advanced manufacturer of
environmentally friendly cars, especially hybrid cars such as the
Toyota Prius. Toyota is also creating some very interesting
innovations, well 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_906"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 906</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>beyond the Prius. The next generation of Prius motor car, which is due
out in a year and a half&#146;s time, is reckoned to do more than 100
miles to the gallon and in other ways to be more environmentally
friendly than most cars on the
road.</p><p><a name="06071457000036"></a>In the report, the
economics of the environment seem to be discussed almost wholly in
terms of brute cost. It mentions the IEA estimate, which the noble Lord
also mentioned; but one needs a much more sophisticated analysis than
that of the net costs of the intersection between new technological
innovation, global technological innovation and the costs of sustaining
more environmentally friendly policies. That also has relevance for
competitiveness because the Japanese are well ahead of the Europeans
and Americans in some of these markets. If you go to California the
Toyota hybrid cars are the most sought-after cars&#151;there is a
three-year waiting list for them there; so they are eminently
marketable.</p><p><a name="06071457000037"></a>My second comment
would be that we should put increasing emphasis on lifestyle change.
The report says something to the effect that action to tackle climate
change must be &#147;potentially life-changing&#148;; but there
does not seem to be much development of that in the report. We cannot
face up to the dual challenge of climate change shock and energy shock
without lifestyle change. There are many areas here in which there is a
win-win situation. We know, for example, that congestion charging has
been successful in London. It certainly has an environmental impact and
an impact on energy use. I fully support the Mayor&#146;s intention
to increase the congestion charge for the most environmentally
unfriendly vehicles.</p><p><a name="06071457000038"></a>What we
have to do is to rescue environmentalism from the hold of the Green
movement, partly because the Green imagery is all wrong. You cannot go
back to nature; there is no such thing as &#147;nature&#148;, in a
sense, because technology is now so much involved with the natural
world. Many things that we have to deal with are no longer directly
natural. But also the Green movement tends to be hostile to science,
and science and technology have to be at the front line in our attempts
to cope with the influence of the dual agenda of
shocks.</p><p><a name="06071457000039"></a>It is interesting to
look at those countries thatare in the vanguard. In Sweden,
for example, the Government have declared that there will be a
fossil-free economy by 2020. That is not a long time ahead. One reason
for that is that Sweden, unlike most other industrial countries, took
action in the first oil crisis of the 1970s. So, too, did Japan, where
consumption of oil has remained stable over the past 30 years even
though the Japanese economy has grown by three times. If you look at
the statistics, even the best performing European countries do not get
close to that figure.</p><p><a name="06071457000040"></a>My third
point is that not only economics are relevant to climate change and
fuel change shock. The other social sciences are also relevant, such as
sociology and psychology, because we are dealing with different risk
situations from the past. We are dealing today with what I call
new-style risks. Old-style risks are those that you can measure, as you
do in an insurance company. Every time you step into 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_907"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 907</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a car, I can tell you what your chance is of being injured in an
accident, but you cannot do that for new-style risks. Climate change is
a manifestly obvious version of a new-style risk, but so are avian flu
and the many things that now threaten us. In Britain we have been used
to living on a fairly benign island, but catastrophic risk is something
that every country has to face, and I am not sure that the UK is
sufficiently mobilised to do
that.</p><p><a name="06071457000041"></a>In conclusion, there is a
range of studies, onwhich I am sure other noble Lords will
speak, onthe intersection between competitiveness and
environmental innovation. Among the best I know of are those by Michael
Porter and his colleagues at Harvard, which show that the introduction
of environmentally friendly technologies is at least neutral in respect
of economic competitiveness in most
situations.</p><h5><a name="06071457000523"></a>11.28
am</h5><p><a name="06071457000042"></a><b><a name="06071457000561"></a>Lord
Vallance of Tummel:</b> My Lords, as a newcomer to
the Select Committee on Economic Affairs at the time when it prepared
its report, I approached the subject of climate change with some
diffidence. That is not to say that I had no interest, either past or
present. My present interest is as a member of the supervisory board of
Siemens AG, a leading supplier of power generation plant and automotive
equipment, among other things. My past interest was as a member of the
board of the Mobil corporation, now part of ExxonMobil. Any lingering
scepticism I may have had in that latter capacity about the gravity of
the threat of climate change and the significance of greenhouse gas
emissions has since gone. I believe that this is one of the greatest
challenges to face us of all time, that the case for scientific action
is made, and that the paramount issue now is what action to
take.</p><p><a name="06071457000043"></a>It is here that my
scepticism kicks back in. In choosing lines of action we must not miss
the wood for the trees. We need to accept that the best that the UK can
do of itself in controlling carbon emissions is to be
exemplary&#151;thoroughly desirable, but quite insufficient. Even if
we cut the UK&#146;s CO2 emissions to zero, there would be
no measurable impact on global temperature in the foreseeable future.
Only Europe as a whole can make a dent in the problem. The totality of
those who ratified the Kyoto Protocol&#151;the Kyoto
club&#151;could make only a rather bigger dent. What we have is a
manifestly global problem and it can be tackled effectively only on a
global scale. The bulk of greenhouse gas emissions&#151;and a growing
proportion&#151;comes from the developing countries together with the
United States. If they are not party to the solution, there will be no
solution.</p><p><a name="06071457000044"></a>So, if we think we
can lean heavily on the Kyoto club&#146;s carbon emissions trading
schemes to provide a global solution to the problem, we are mistaken.
Even if the current defects in the architecture of such schemes can be
remedied, we cannot bank on persuading the developing world and the US
to subject themselves to that level of discipline, certainly not in
time to be effective. That is not to say that I 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_908"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 908</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>am advocating the abandonment of a European emissions trading scheme; I
am simply pointing out that, were it entirely successful, it would
still be inadequate, and that consequently it would not be sensible to
push it to the point of impairing the competitiveness of European
industry. We also have to accept that we are not going to suppress an
ever-increasing global demand for energy. It is wishful thinking to
suppose that any scheme, no matter how elegant, has the power to halt
the economic growth of, say, China or India, let alone induce the
necessary behavioural change across the globe in time.</p><p><a name="06071457000045"></a>Face up to those facts and the issue
becomesquite stark. We have to find the means of
meetinga growing demand for energy, and indeed transportation,
without emitting vast amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere or
creating other environmental disasters.</p><p><a name="06071457000046"></a>In short, the key issue is technological.
Technology and industry got us into this fix and it is for technology
and industry to get us out of it. If we can accelerate&#151;and
acceleration is the key point&#151;the provision, at scale, of
competitively priced, environmentally friendly alternatives to fossil
fuels or effective carbon capture, the problem will fade away. Remove
the externalities and the market can be left to take care of itself.
There is every reason to believe that technology will be able to meet
that challenge. We also have a wide range of potential options to
pursue: carbon capture, of course, as well as photovoltaics, hydrogen
cells&#151;you name it. The problem is not one of technological
options but one of time. We need to bring forward solutions at scale,
but to do that we need a massive boost in our efforts to address the
technological and cost issues. That in turn means finding and applying
sufficient financial and other resources to do the job.</p><p><a name="06071457000047"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, mentioned
the analogy of the moon shot as a means of marshalling the resources
needed to speed up development of technologies. I think that a closer
parallel would be that of an arms race. If we could provoke the
equivalent of an arms race in the context of combating global warming,
we would stand the very best chance of getting the right results in
time. After all, if vast public resources can be found to accelerate
technologies capable of destroying the world, surely it is not beyond
the wit of man to devise the means of accelerating technologies capable
of saving the world. </p><p><a name="06071457000048"></a>Where
would the financial and technological resources come from? Here the
members of the Kyoto club do have the resources to go it alone. They
have the scientific base, the engineering capability and the economic
strength not only to participate in such an environmental arms race but
to get out in front. In our report, we urge the Government to take a
leadin exploring alternative &#147;architectures&#148; for
future protocols, based perhaps on agreements on technology and its
diffusion. More experienced minds than mine will, I hope, take this
forward, but perhaps I can make a few tentative suggestions.</p><p><a name="06071457000049"></a>First, reach agreement among the Kyoto
club members to levy a straightforward carbon tax ineach of
their countries. Secondly, agree to the 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_909"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 909</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>hypothecation of the proceeds of that tax, in whole or in part, into a
fund devoted to the accelerationof the development of
competitively priced, environmentally friendly technologies for both
power generation and transportation. The fund will be managed by
representatives of the Kyoto club: Europe, Japan and so on.
Incidentally, I believe that people would understand and accept such a
tax. It would be levied not in an attempt to change our behaviour,
which most of us tend to resent, or to offer us the moral comfort of
donning an environmental hair-shirt, but simply to finance practical
solutions to a problem that affects us all. Thirdly, do not specify the
technologies to be used&#151;governmental bodies nearly always get
that wrong. Just set out the desired outputs, cost parameters and
timescales and leave it to industry to take it from there.</p><p><a name="06071457000050"></a>Finally&#151;and here is the sting in
the tail&#151;place the development contracts solely within the
member countries of the Kyoto club. The resulting European-Japanese
industrial axis would be sufficient to trigger our environmental arms
race. The United States would have to follow suit; to do otherwise
would be to risk being overtaken in the next generation of both power
generation and transportation technologies. Neither is something that
the Americans could really contemplate.</p><p><a name="06071457000051"></a>I appreciate that such an approach may
seem too radical, too direct or just too simplistic, but I make no
apologies for it. If ever there was an issue demanding radical and
direct action, this is it. We must not let our understandable
preoccupation with getting things right in the UK and the European
Union lure us into thinking that that is all we must do. This is a
global issue that demands global solutions. The Kyoto club has tried
persuasion and leadership by example in emissions trading schemes, but
it all has the makings of too little, too late. Now is the time for
direct and focused intervention in the market and the application of
financial and technological resources on a scale commensurate with the
environmental threat. It is also an initiative where the UK Government
might take the lead.</p><h5><a name="06071457000524"></a>11.37

to Climate Change Capital and a variety of other bodies concerned with
energy policy, climate change, investment and risk management. I, too,
am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, for the opportunity to
discuss the report of his committee. The report is very wide-ranging
and I shall have time to touch on only a few aspects.</p><p><a name="06071457000053"></a>Modern civilisation has developed and
prospered during a 5,000-year period of relatively stable and benign
climate, and we have built a costly infrastructure of modern western
society to fit those conditions. The rapid changes in climate that we
are now experiencing will make many parts of that infrastructure
inappropriate or insufficient and we shall have to do our best to
adapt. That we do for ourselves. For our children and our
grandchildren, we must at the same time tackle the causes of climate 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_910"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 910</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>change and find energy sources&#151;as I think all the previous
speakers have said&#151;that do not depend on fossil fuels. That is
something that we shall have to do anyway within some decades as oil
and gas become scarcer and more expensive.</p><p><a name="06071457000054"></a>It is therefore timely that we should
consider the costs of these changes and what provision should be made
for adapting to the new circumstances and for mitigating the causes of
climate change. Both of those depend on the science, but the science of
complex natural systems is particularly challenging. There is rarely,
if ever, complete certainty and total understanding. I feel that the
committee struggledin its efforts to come to terms with that.
It ispretty meaningless to state, along with the US
Administration, that the science is uncertain. Science is about
uncertainty. It is not a matter of whether everything is known; it is a
matter of whether enough is known to answer a particular question with
a reasonable degree of confidence, and that may be a matter of
experience and judgment. If that question is whether anthropogenic
climate change is happening and is a threat to the planet, science
gives an unequivocal affirmative. What is uncertain is how, when, where
and how severely the consequences will be
felt.</p><p><a name="06071457000055"></a>In the year since the
report was written, the situation has become both clearer and more
worrying. It looks as if 2005 was the hottest year since records have
been kept, and that the two most recent decades have been the hottest
certainly for 400 and possibly for 1,100 years. More worrying still is
that, as is now recognised, the great masses of polar ice that help to
keep the earth cool are being affected by rapid break-up processes that
were not previously thought to be important. This is work in progress,
but the implications are that both sea level and temperature rise may
be faster than previously thought. Frankly, to assert, as some continue
to do, that this is simply natural variation in the earth&#146;s
climate, when these changes are quantitatively and qualitatively
predicted from our history of burning fossil fuels, seems to me
perverse.</p><p><a name="06071457000056"></a>The Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change, which comes in for some scathing criticism in
the committee&#146;s report, is a truly remarkable body. It is
remarkable because it is unique in the history of science&#151;more
than 2,000 scientists from a wide range of disciplines and more than
100 countries collaborate in an attempt to analyse and understand the
complexities of our climate. The process is not perfect, but the
results are astonishing. The panel issues periodic progress reports.
The one that the committee considered and criticised was published in
2001, reflecting work done largely in the 1990s. Some of the concerns
that the committee lists in its conclusions had already been
answered&#151;for example, probability analyses of future
temperatures, which had been available for some time. The committee
quite rightly raises the question of political interference with the
IPCC, but the report reads&#151;perhaps this is not the
intention&#151;as if the fault rests solely with the IPCC. The
greater responsibility is carried by Governments that fund the IPCC and
without whose approval reports cannot be issued.</p>

of a different inquiry, your Lordships&#146; Select Committee on
Science and Technology received evidence that one of the largest
corporations in the world had written to the White House urging that
the appointment of a senior IPCC scientist of whom it did not approve
should be blocked. When interviewed by our committee, the company did
not deny this and was unable to give an explanation. I think everyone
would agree that this is
unacceptable.</p><p><a name="06071457000058"></a>The committee is
right when it urges that more attention be given to adaptation to the
likely effects of climate change. As more than one witness pointed out,
both adaptation to climate change and mitigation of its causes become
more affordable if we make the necessary changes as part of the regular
cycle of infrastructure renewal. Things have to be renewed anyway and,
if we do so with this in mind, it need not necessarily be more
expensive. Much of our infrastructure is renewed every 30 to 40 years
and potential costs could be avoided by acting now. The Association of
British Insurers makes the same point in its paper<I> Financial Risks
of Climate Change</I>. The vulnerability of flood defences, water
resources and transport and energy infrastructure all have to be
reconsidered.</p><p><a name="06071457000059"></a>Although our
domestic agenda is important, the international agenda is more so. I am
afraid that I totally reject the committee&#146;s disparagement of
the Kyoto agreement. Self-evidently, Kyoto will of itself do relatively
little to achieve emissions reductions, as, indeed, the noble Lord,
Lord Vallance of Tummel, pointed out, but this is the first unique and
essential step to what follows in
2012.</p><p><a name="06071457000060"></a>That said, success or
otherwise in controlling greenhouse gas emissions will not be
determined in the UK, or in Europe, or in North America, but, as has
already been pointed out, in the developing countries, particularly
India and China. China is commissioning a large coal-fired power
station every five days; its priority is to meet its burgeoning
industrial energy needs and to mitigate the energy poverty that
pervades the western two-thirds of the country. Capturing and storing
the CO2 from these power stations is essential but is
currently seen as too expensive. It follows that success in controlling
global emissions will depend on the extent to which the west is able to
support the developing countries in achieving their industrial
revolutions more cleanly than we did ours. Improved technology is part
of the story, but it will also take
money.</p><h5><a name="06071457000525"></a>11.46

curate&#146;s egg, and I know a bit about curates and their
eggs.</p><p><a name="06071457000063"></a>In the very first sentence
of the report&#146;s introduction the words of the
Government&#146;s Chief Scientific Adviser are repeated. He said
that,</p><ul><a name="06071457000507"></a>&#147;climate change
is the most severe problem that we are facing
today&#148;.</ul><a name="06071457000468"></a>Then as I
read it, the report seemed almost to play down the seriousness of the
problem: it does so as much in its tone as in its content. The very
first page of the report
states:<ul><a name="06071457000493"></a>&#147;UK energy and
climate policy appears to be based on dubious
assumptions&#148;.</ul><a name="06071457000469"></a>The
report
continues:<ul><a name="06071457000494"></a>&#147;If&#148;&#151;</ul><a name="06071457000470"></a>we
should note the word
&#147;if&#148;&#151;<ul><a name="06071457000508"></a>&#147;climate
change is as serious as most scientists
claim&#148;.</ul><a name="06071457000471"></a>But to be
fair, at least the report goes on to say that the action required to
tackle climate change
will,<ul><a name="06071457000509"></a>&#147;have to be
serious and potentially
life-changing&#148;.</ul><a name="06071457000472"></a>It
will certainly have to be serious. I believe that it will have to be
not just potentially life-changing, but, as the noble Lord, Lord
Giddens, has said, it will have to be for real. I find it surprising
that we do not have more mention of the fact that reduction in
emissions will have to play a key part in every aspect of our
lives.<p><a name="06071457000064"></a>It is good that the
report casts a critical eye over some of the more hyped-up claims about
climate change, yet I wonder whether it has not given too much weight
to a minority of scientific opinion, to such an extent that its
perspectives have become a bit skewed. Why, for example, was so little
evidence taken from the scientists on the IPCC? I wonder again whether
too pessimistic a view has been taken&#151;but I suppose that is what
economists tend to do&#151;about the will and capacity of human
societies to do something about climate change. I wonder too whether
the committee ignored what has come to be called the tipping
effect&#151;the time when growing human awareness and increased
understanding of the impact of our behaviour leads to a tipping over
into significant action.</p><p><a name="06071457000065"></a>All
around the world people have begun to realise the seriousness of the
situation that we have made for ourselves. All around the world people
have begun to recognise that we have to begin to live differently, that
we have to make different decisions about how we are to live our lives,
and so do our legislators.</p><p><a name="06071457000066"></a>I had
hoped that the committee would have taken more account of the Royal
Society&#146;s work, and thatof all the science academies of
the G8 countries, together with China, India and Brazil, which make it
crystal clear that climate change is real, is caused by human
activities and has the most serious consequences. So what should we be
doing? There is, of course, no single answer to the magnitude of the
problem, rather a wide range of activities needs to be
undertaken.</p><p><a name="06071457000067"></a>First, we can adapt
to some change&#151;that is where the report is strong. Secondly, we
can reduce inputs of carbon dioxide by reducing wasteful consumption. 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_913"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 913</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Thirdly, we can capture some of the carbon dioxide released by burning
fossil fuels; and fourthly, we need to move to the various forms of
renewable energy that do not put greenhouse gases into the
atmosphere.</p><p><a name="06071457000068"></a>The committee makes
a strong case for adaptation. Faced with the issues of climate change,
it states that we need to give greater recognition to the need to
adapt. That argument appeals to that in human nature which wants to
invent new technologies, which wants to do everything it can to ensure
that the lifestyle that we have come to enjoy is not threatened, and
certainly is not changed. The trouble is that it is the strong and
wealthy societies and the strong and wealthy within those societies who
are those most capable of adapting. Once again, it will be the poor and
the weak who will suffer the
consequences.</p><p><a name="06071457000069"></a>We all know that
climate change will affect the poorer nations the most and that climate
change is likely to result in an even greater economic divide between
the richer and the poorer nations. One of my fears is that adaptation
alone will be less a solution and more a postponement of the problem.
One thing that is urgently needed is an estimation of the cost of
adaptation for any scenario worse than the minimum one. I am surprised
that, as economists, the committee has not encouraged that to be done.
Furthermore, unless I am very much mistaken, the report did not take
any evidence from the world of insurance. The people in that industry
are the ones who know about the costs of
risks.</p><p><a name="06071457000070"></a>Adaptation alone will
never be enough to tackle the impacts of climate change. Rather, we
need to tackle the root cause of the problem, which is the behaviour of
humankind. To continue to adapt in the face of rising emissions is
largely futile. We cannot ignore the causes any longer and deal only
with the effects. We are going to have to recognise that climate change
is a limit to our present lifestyles and ultimately to our greed. It is
not simply another challenge to our present patterns of consumption
which we need to find ways to
overcome.</p><p><a name="06071457000071"></a>As we all know, the
consequences of global warming will not go away. Reduction of emissions
must be part of our response, as has investment in renewables, which is
crucial. I welcome, too, the committee&#146;s suggestion that carbon
tax should replace the climate change levy for the reasons given by the
committee. And I say with some reluctance that I have come to agree
with the committee that the nuclear option will have to be pursued. But
I would make a plea that nuclear fusion, which offers one of the few
options of large-scale emission-free production, needs actively to be
pursued, researched and resourced&#151;not least the present work
being carried out at Culham.</p><p><a name="06071457000072"></a>The
future of God&#146;s Earth is at stake here. In a universe in which I
believe every part is created, known and loved by God and which has
been entrusted to us as a gift for our responsible care and
stewardship, every part&#151;not just our own little
part&#151;matters. The simple test, as has already been mentioned, is
whether we can leave this Earth a better place for our children and our
children&#146;s children.</p><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_914"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 914</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071457000073"></a>A little while back I paid a visit to
Botswana, where we have a link with that diocese. I was taught a lot
there, not least an African insight that suggests that we are not the
masters of nature, but we are all part of it. We are all part of it. To
meet the challenges of climate change, whether they are economic,
scientific, social, spiritual, national or international, will take
courage, commitment and the ability to think about not only ourselves,
but to think about others and to act for others, including generations
yet to come. We can best do that by laying aside all private interests,
prejudices and partial affections. That is what we pray daily for in
this House. So, I pray that, both as individuals and as a nation, we
have the resolve todo

Macdonald of Tradeston:</b> My Lords, I declare an
interest as an adviser to Macquarie Bank, which manages and invests in
infrastructure and utilities, including renewable energy. As a Member
of your Lordships&#146; Select Committee on Economic
Affairs,I pay tribute to the canny and economical chairmanship
of the noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, which certainly restricted our
emission levels and brought us to a unanimous
conclusion.</p><p><a name="06071457000075"></a>Our report, <I>The
Economics of Climate Change</I>, was published almost exactly one year
ago and since then the debate has moved on. Our report has contributed
in part to the progress made since. While, last July, we welcomed the
Government&#146;s recognition of the central role of economics in
considering climate change, we further argued that the Treasury should
broaden the scope of its interests in aspects of climate change and
that, in our view, it should look at those issues that demanded more
attention. Our report asked that the public be told more clearly about
the likely costs and benefits of climate change control and that there
will undoubtedly be winners in some countries and losers in others. We
also argued that if climate change is as serious as most scientists
claim, that was all the more reason to be frank and realistic about the
economic impact on individuals and
countries.</p><p><a name="06071457000076"></a>Public attitudes may
be more environmentally aware, but people should know the costs of
controlling and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and of moving away
from our carbon-based economy. Our committee felt that scientific
research, political policy and public debate were still overly focused
on mitigation of greenhouse gases to the detriment of efforts to
understand the relative costs and benefits of adapting our societies to
what might well be the inevitability of climate change that is already
underway. Mitigation and adaptation are not mutually exclusive by any
means, but both are costly. Surely, then, the rigorous analysis of
their competing priorities across government would best be conducted by
the Chancellor and the
Treasury.</p><p><a name="06071457000077"></a>Our report had, of
course, many other conclusions and recommendations, most of which other
noble Lords will touch upon. That may explain why it took the
Government four months to produce their official response. That
response&#151;like others I confess to 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_915"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 915</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>having had a hand in while in government&#151;hadall the
traditional characteristics of departmental defensiveness. But it was
ever thus; and, anyway, by the time the response appeared, the dogs had
barked and the caravan was moving on. More important was the fact that
our Select Committee report anticipated, as the noble Lord, Lord
Wakeham, said, the Prime Minister&#146;s statement last summer that
the international community should move beyond the limitations of the
Kyoto process and explore a wider, more radical range of
options.</p><p><a name="06071457000078"></a>Again, last summer,
following our call forTreasury leadership, within weeks, an
inquiry into the economics of climate change was announced under the
leadership of the head of the Government Economic Service, Sir Nicholas
Stern, reporting to the Chancellor and the Prime Minister. The Stern
review has been active for almost a year and is expected to report
later this year. It has already published useful discussion papers
asking what the economics of climate change are. Our report concluded
that some issues were still clouded by scientific uncertainty, as has
been mentioned. However, the Stern review&#146;s interim conclusions
are interesting. They are that climate change is a serious and urgent
issue which has already had significant impact; that uncertainties may
remain about the nature and scale of longer term impacts, but some
risks are more serious than at first appeared; that the problem is
global, as are its cause and consequences; that impacts will be uneven
and that the poorest countries may suffer the most, as has been noted.
The Stern report states also that the current pathway of emissions is
unsustainable and that we must therefore go far beyond the actions
currently agreed if we are to stabilise greenhouse
gases.</p><p><a name="06071457000079"></a>In other concerns that
perhaps echo more closely our Select Committee&#146;s report, Sir
Nicholas also underlined that the economic challenges are complex and
that effective collaboration must be based on shared incentives and
effective institutions. He said that effective action requires an
understanding of how the mitigation of greenhouse gases may affect
economic growth and that, importantly, and as our committee noted, an
equitable international response must include action on both adaptation
and mitigation. These are not choices. If climate change is inevitable
over the next 30 years, some adaptation is essential. Naturally, Sir
Nicholas also concluded that a combination of policies, institutions
and regulations are required, along with clear, long-term incentives
for the private sector and for developing countries. Obviously, there
is much there on which we can agree with Sir Nicholas, who has stressed
the,</p><ul><a name="06071457000510"></a>&#147;need to have a
deep understanding of the economics of this complex
problem&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06071457000080"></a>Meanwhile, I
welcome the other government initiatives that also address some of the
concerns expressed in our report. This week, we have had the energy
review from the Department of Trade and Industry with far-reaching
proposals to ensure energy security and to counter the threat of
climate change. Our Select Committee report argued for the retention of
nuclear power. The energy review confirms that 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_916"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 916</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>nuclear, as a low-carbon energy source, has a vital role to play and
promises that the market will be given a clear basis for the necessary
private investment in new nuclear power
stations.</p><p><a name="06071457000081"></a>The Economic Affairs
Committee also saw as a positive result&#151;I am sure that many
noble Lords will be thankful for this&#151;the fact that there is a
balanced approach in the energy review. The noble Lord, Lord Wakeham,
expressed disappointment about the lack of realism surrounding the
projections on renewable energy. That is certainly something to be
argued about, but the review proposes increasing the output from
renewable energy fivefold to 20 per cent, with new technologies also
encouraged and new opportunities for smaller, decentralised energy
sources. So we look forward to a more detailed explanation of how the
difficulties in these areas will be overcome.</p><p><a name="06071457000082"></a>In addition, there will be a big push on
energy efficiency. Inefficient electrical goods will be phased out,
with potentially enormous gains. A remarkable7 per cent of
household electricity can be consumed just by leaving products on
standby. A further hope is that coal can be cleaned up and that carbon
can be captured and stored safely in our old North Sea oilfields. We
are promised that planning permissions will be accelerated, but we were
promised that in the past and so we shall see. Let us hope that the
inescapable consultations will also be
accelerated.</p><p><a name="06071457000083"></a>We must now await
the promised White Paper on energy at around the turn of the year,
along with the Stern review on the economics of climate change. If both
now come to their expected conclusions, I believe that this House,
through its Questions, debates and committee reports, will have played
a useful part in shaping both energy and climate change policies in
more productive, parallel courses. As the noble Lord, Lord Vallance,
and others have said, those original contributions continue. I trust
that we have also played our part in getting Her Majesty's Treasury
more fully engaged in co-ordinating and leading government policy on
climate
change.</p><h5><a name="06071457000527"></a>12.03

my noble friend's tribute to the late Professor Pearce, our special

swimming against the tide. That is a slightly slower process, so I
apologise in advance to noble Lords if I take a little
longer.</p><p><a name="06071457000085"></a>I start with what is
indisputable, or at least what is generally accepted as fact. During
the 20th century as a whole, the atmospheric level of carbon dioxide
increased by around 30 per cent. There are natural sources of carbon
dioxide, but it is likely that the increase was due overwhelmingly to
man&#151;that is, it was anthropogenic. At the same time, there was a
warming, but it is surprising how small the increase in temperature
was. Over the 20th century as a whole, 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_917"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 917</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the average mean global temperature rose by two-thirds of a degree
centigrade. If the temperature tomorrow is two-thirds of a degree
centigrade different from the temperature today, I wonder how many
noble Lords will notice it. I am talking about a difference from one
day to the next as compared with a two-thirds of a degree increase in
temperature over the century as a whole.</p><p><a name="06071457000086"></a>Unlike the emissions of carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere, that increase has not been a steady process; it has
come in fits and starts. I shall give the broad figures, which are
generally accepted, so I do not need to take much time over them.
Before 1915, there was no change at all; between 1915 and 1945, there
was a considerable spurt; between 1945 and 1975, there was a slight
cooling&#151;indeed, at that time Professor Lovelock and others were
saying that this was the precursor of a further ice age; and, from 1975
to 2000, there was another spurt of roughly the same magnitude as the
first. We know that there is natural variation in the climate as well,
so how much of that second spurt was due to natural variation in the
climate and how much was due to carbon dioxide emissions and their
anthropogenic greenhouse effect? Of course, no one knows. The
Government's response to our report states that the Met Office
considers that more than 50 per cent of warming in recent decades is
attributable to anthropogenic sources of greenhouse gases. Let us
assume that the Met Office's best guess is right and that more than
half the 0.4 per cent increase during those decades&#151;in other
words, about a quarter of a degree centigrade&#151;was due to carbon
dioxide. That is the 20th
century.</p><p><a name="06071457000087"></a>I turn to the 21st
century. I hate to differ fromsuch an eminent scientist as the
noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, but the Hadley Centre chart shows that there
has been no further increase in global temperatures since 2000. I make
nothing of that because no one knows what will happen in the future,
but the warmest year is still 1998. So global warming has not yet
happened to any significant extent, and yet one hears all the time that
any unusual or television-worthy event&#151;from Katrina
downwards&#151;must be due to global warming. But, again, that is not
the view of the experts. The experts on tropical storms set up an
international panel, which included the tropical storm expert for the
Met Office. The panel
reported:</p><ul><a name="06071457000495"></a>&#147;The main
conclusion we came to was that none of these high-impact tropical
cyclones could be specifically attributed to global
warming&#148;.</ul><a name="06071457000473"></a>That is not
surprising, because there is hardly any global warming
anyway.<p><a name="06071457000088"></a>Why has the 30 per
cent rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide had so little greenhouse
effect? I am not a scientist, but it is not so curious when one recalls
that the greenhouse effect is overwhelmingly a product of water vapour,
whether in the form of clouds or otherwise. Again, experts differ in
their views, but that accounts for between 75 and 95 per cent of the
greenhouse effect. It is perfectly true that carbon dioxide is the
biggest single component of the other5 to 25 per cent. That
puts the matter into perspective.</p><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_918"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 918</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071457000089"></a>Going off at a slight tangent, I should
add that it also puts into perspective the view that is constantly put
outside this place that carbon dioxide is a form of pollution. We have
not heard that said here and I would not expect noble Lords to use
those words. Carbon dioxide is no more a form of pollution than are
clouds of water vapour. Carbon dioxide is a life force; plants require
it to flourish. Indeed, the more carbon dioxide there is in the
atmosphere, thebetter the development of plant life, which is
notaltogether a bad thing. Incidentally, the process of
photosynthesis is more efficient with a greater degree of carbon
dioxide, so plants need to extract less water from the
soil.</p><p><a name="06071457000090"></a>The past is clear and the
argument turns to the future. As our report says, the IPCC, which is
well known to this House, has a number of scenarios that suggest that
over this century the temperature might rise between 1 per cent and 6
per cent. As we point out in our report, that is based partly on
demographic and economic assumptions that are highly implausible and
which are not in any way central. In other words, there is a
considerable upward bias on the basis of those assumptions on the
economic side. That is what generates the amount of carbon dioxide
projected in the scenarios.</p><p><a name="06071457000091"></a>Then, of course, there are the computer
models, which develop temperature increases based on a particular
increase in the amount of carbon dioxide. As can be seen from reading
the literature, that science is quite clearly not at all settled. In
particular, the science of clouds is not settled and, as any climate
scientist will tell you, that is the most difficult and intractable
form of climate science to understand. What is the interaction between
carbon dioxide and clouds of water vapour? That is extremely uncertain
and critical. If what is put into the computer models is mistaken, the
outcome in temperature projections will be
mistaken.</p><p><a name="06071457000092"></a>Many
scientists&#151;I agree that they are a minority&#151;differ from
the scientists in the IPCC and the scientists at the Hadley Centre. For
example, only last April, 60 or so scientists wrote a letter to the
Canadian Prime Minister
saying,</p><ul><a name="06071457000496"></a>&#147;Observational
evidence does not support today's computer climate models, so there is
little reason to trust model predictions of the
future&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06071457000093"></a>Faced with this
uncertainty, what should we do? Some people like to rely on the
precautionary principle: because anything might happen, we must spend
anything in order to prevent it. I have come to believe that, most
importantly, the precautionary principle needs to be applied to the
precautionary principle itself, otherwise we shall find ourselves doing
very stupid things in its
name.</p><p><a name="06071457000094"></a>Certainly Kyoto is not the
answer. With the best will in the world, it is impossible to believe
that it is. It is recognised on all sides that it is totally
ineffectual in reducing carbon dioxide emissions or in reducing
temperatures. However, those who support it claim that it is a first
step to much more rigorous and tougher agreements of this kind. That is
pie in the sky. 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_919"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 919</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It is pretty clear that even that step will not be met by 2012, so the
idea that there is to be a tougher one is unrealistic to say the
least.</p><p><a name="06071457000095"></a>More important, the
United States refuses to be part of that process and the big developing
countries&#151;the big emitters&#151;such as China, India and
Brazil have no constraints under Kyoto and will not accept any
constraint under a future Kyoto. The developing countries have a very
good argument. They say, &#147;You in the developed world became rich
on the basis of cheap carbon-based energy and now it is our turn to do
so. Why shouldn't we?&#148; They also say, &#147;You have caused
this 30 per cent increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, so it is
your responsibility to mitigate it if that is what you wish to
do&#148;. The terms in which they put that argument at a United
Nations climate change conference last May is interesting. Mr Prodipto
Ghosh, the permanent secretary of the Indian environment ministry,
said:</p><ul><a name="06071457000497"></a>&#147;Removal of
poverty is the greater immediate imperative&#148;,</ul><a name="06071457000474"></a>than action against global warming.
That is their choice. Far from global warming being a threat to the
poor, it is the measures to mitigate it in those countries that are a
threat to the alleviation of poverty. That is absolutely fundamental
and everyone has to understand and recognise that. Those countries are
going ahead as fast as they can.
<p><a name="06071457000096"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, mentioned
the massive Chinese coal-fired power station programme: one new power
station every five days for seven years. As a result of that, in the
next 20 years, China will have overtaken the United States as the
biggest single emitter of carbon dioxide. China will not undertake the
huge expense of retro-fitting carbon capture and storage to stop those
emissions. What will happen? Western taxpayers certainly will not pay
the Chinese&#151;that is also pie in the sky&#151;to undertake such
a huge programme. Western countries are being timid enough in raising
funds to meet their own Kyoto targets, which are much less. The costs
involved are very
substantial.</p><p><a name="06071457000097"></a>The Kyoto principle
is to raise the price of carbon-based energy to the level where
non-carbon-based energy becomes economic. But that means that, as this
process takes place, energy-intensive industries and processes in
Europe will increasingly migrate to China or India, as the textile
industry has done, to take advantage of cheaper energy there. We will
meet our targets all right, but nothing will happen about global
emissions; they will just come from China and India rather than from
Europe. No wonder the Economic and Social Committee of the European
Union warned last April that Kyoto could seriously damage the European
economy, and prohibitively
so,</p><ul><a name="06071457000511"></a>&#147;without having
any tangible effect on climate
change&#148;,</ul><a name="06071457000475"></a>especially
if big emitters such as America, China and India are not brought
in.<p><a name="06071457000098"></a>This week&#146;s
government energy policy conclusions need to be seen in that context.
The nuclear optionis presented in two terms: security of
supply and helping in the battle against climate change. On security of
supply, I shall quote the words of Adam Smith, which will be well known
to your Lordships.</p><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_920"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 920</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071457000099"></a><b><a name="06071457000566"></a>Lord

Government&#146;s energy White Paper to say that, although the

option given that it is necessary to have full back-up conventional
power for when the wind is not blowing. Electricity supply must be on
tap all the time and electricity cannot be stored in large quantities
except at prohibitive cost. That makes the cost completely prohibitive.
Anybody favouring wind power as opposed to nuclear is wholly
irrational.</p><p><a name="06071457000104"></a>In conclusion, the
only way forward is what we have suggested in our report: adaptation.
It is hubristic to imagine that we can change the climate. Adaptation
is something we can and will do. It means that we meet the warming
problem whether it is natural or the result of carbon dioxide
emissions. It means that we can pocket the real benefits of climate
change while mitigating the cost.</p><p><a name="06071457000105"></a>The more I see of this issue, the more it
seems <I>The</I><I>Da Vinci Code</I> of environmentalism. It is a
great story and a phenomenal bestseller. There is a grain of truth, but
a mountain of
nonsense.</p><h5><a name="06071457000528"></a>12.21

us all.</p><p><a name="06071457000107"></a>One of the most
important things the report does is to encapsulate and summarise some
of the challenges and statistics we must confront. Every year, we are
putting some 7 billion tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere. Over the
last few hundred years, we have already increased carbon from 280 to
380 parts per million, with a target of 550 by the year 2100. That,
even by those standards, will raise temperatures by 2.5 degrees
centigrade by 2300. One of the key points of the report is the time
lag; not the time lag of normal economic systems, but a stock of carbon
that will last for 200 years. Our actions today affect not just our
grandchildren, so often cited in environmental discourses, but future
generations well beyond that.</p>

<p><a name="06071457000108"></a>I
am aware that it is easy for there to be a doomsday scenario in
environmental debates, which is perhaps exaggerated and might scare us
away from 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_921"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 921</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>any action. Indeed, there have been a number of successes in meeting UK
carbon targets in the past, primarily due to gas-fired power stations.
Germany also met its targets, partly through conversion of power
stations, but also through the collapse of heavy industry in the former
East Germany. Our track record is not good.</p><p><a name="06071457000109"></a>When I saw the title of this report,
<I>The Economics of Climate Change</I>, I looked particularly at the
bill. What was the cost to us, as a planet, of global warming? Indeed,
the report quotes two figures: in net present values, one is $2
trillion, and the worst case scenario is $17 trillion&#151;some 50
per cent of current global GDP. Those figures are themselves quite
astonishing, yet the report manages to downgrade that risk to saying
that, over a 50-year period, it might represent only 1.3 per cent of
global GDP per annum. That almost leads us to the thought that this
problem might therefore be quite manageable.</p><p><a name="06071457000110"></a>Those estimates are risky. I shall talk
about where the report has highlighted important instances of danger,
but not pursued them&#151;specifically, the non-linear and
irreversible effects of global warming. Most of them are listed in the
report. Ocean circulation particularly affects the north Atlantic;
there is little scientific evidence at the moment, but a case could be
persuasive. Yet we know that if the Gulf Stream was not there, that
would decrease temperatures not by the two-thirds of a degree we have
had so far this century, but by some eight degrees centigrade. We would
all feel that considerably. It is around the ice caps of Greenland and
Antarctica, and the permafrost, particularly in the northern climes of
Canada and the Russian Federation, where we would then have a methane
loss which would have a double-whammy effect on global
warming.</p><p><a name="06071457000111"></a>Not specifically
listed as a non-linear, irreversible event, though mentioned in the
report, is biodiversity. Biodiversity is literally a treasure house of
our planet. There are clearly already signs that species are having to
change range, with extinctions due to certain species being crowded out
by others. Much of that is currently local, but it will become regional
and global. We already have dying coral reefs, and a number of bird
species have disappeared. I admit that predicting and taking strong
action on these unpredictable events is difficult, but they are the
largest impacts and something which we cannot ignore. Nor are they
costed in this report.</p><p><a name="06071457000112"></a>I
emphasise the fundamental argument of adaptation versus mitigation. The
report says that there should clearly be more emphasis on adaptation.
That is true; there must be adaptation activity, but it is a dangerous
route to champion too strongly. It is tempting, because it seems a more
manageable way forward and does not totally rely on global
co-operation, so it is easier. However, the strategy clearly benefits
rich countries and is unattainable to those of lower incomes.</p><p><a name="06071457000113"></a>I notice that the economic analysis of
the report laid a lot of stress, as did the IPCC, on the convergence of
developing and non-developed economies. While that might be true, there
is going to 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_922"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 922</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be huge diversity within that convergence. That will clearly not be the
case in Africa and much of south Asia, particularly countries such as
Bangladesh. These areas will not be able to afford a strategy of
adaptation well into the future. I question whether adaptation is an
effective strategy for us as developed economies. Yes, we can build
high walls that will keep out the sea, but I doubt that they will be
high enough to keep out migrating destitute populations or migrating
species posing a threat to our own ecosystems, let alone prevent our
own species migrating elsewhere. Least of all will they be effective as
walls against a crumbling economy in the developing world which, under
our global trading systems, will inevitably affect us as
well.</p><p><a name="06071457000114"></a>It is not just rich
countries that will find that there is no dilemma. I come from the
south-west. It is clear that, even in developing economies, we must
make choices about where we adapt. If there is a choice between
protecting London, the tube system and our financial centres, and
keeping the waters out of the Isles of Scilly or the main railway line
across the south Devon coast&#151;even last year it cost &#163;9
million to keep it in operation&#151;it will be stark. As the noble
Lord, Lord Giddens, rightly pointed out, in New Orleans we had an
example of the richest, most successful economy in the world utterly
failing to adapt sufficiently to a short-term measure. The cost to
rebuild and protect New Orleans is estimated at&#163;35
billion.</p><p><a name="06071457000115"></a>The report mentions a
document with a seductive title about the social costs of carbon, which
tries to add up the costs arising from damage by global warming. All
sorts of figures can be arrived at, but they are not social
costs&#151;they are costs in human life and land, particularly in
areas such as Bangladesh where a one-metre rise in sea level would put
17.5 per cent of the country under water and displace35
million people. The phrase &#147;the social cost of carbon&#148; is
a euphemism equivalent to &#147;friendly fire&#148; and
&#147;ethnic
cleansing&#148;.</p><h5><a name="06071457000529"></a>12.30

context is one of uncertainty&#148;,</ul><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_923"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 923</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><a name="06071457000476"></a>the committee aligned itself
uncomfortably closely with lobby groups that use such rhetoric to
oppose efforts to tackle climate
change.<p><a name="06071457000118"></a>Of course, there are
uncertainties in the science but they should not obscure the compelling
consensus that climate change is a serious issue. Rising greenhouse gas
concentrations in the atmosphere are already warming our world and
making our oceans more acidic. The cumulative evidence has been
documented in scientific papers by many thousands&#151;the
overwhelming majority&#151;of independent
researchers.</p><p><a name="06071457000119"></a>Even within the
past year, the evidence has hardened. A discrepancy between temperature
measurements on the ground and in the atmosphere has been resolved, and
the evidence that the world is now warmer than at any time in the past
four centuries&#151;the &#147;hockey stick&#148; graph&#151;has
been firmed up by a reanalysis by the National Academy of Sciences,
which pointed out that it was just one of several lines of
evidence.</p><p><a name="06071457000120"></a>But the most important
datum is entirely unambiguous. There is more carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere today than there has been for at least half a million years:
the level has been rising at about0.5 per cent per year. Even
if no more CO2 were emitted at all, there is so much inertia
in the climate system that the warming could continue for
decades.</p><p><a name="06071457000121"></a>Not all the impacts of
climate change will be negative, though the benefits to crop yields due
to rising CO2 have recently been questioned. But the higher
the greenhouse gas level climbs, the bigger the adverse effect will
become and, still more disquietingly, the greater will be the chance of
something grave and irreversible: the melting of the Greenland icecap,
the quenching of the Gulf Stream and so forth.</p><p><a name="06071457000122"></a>The IPCC explored a variety of
demographicand technological projections, and we expect
improvements in future reports. Despite all the uncertainties, warming
looms as a serious global problem for a wide range of plausible
scenarios. The impending warming is threateningly disruptive because it
will happen much more rapidly than naturally occurring climate changes
in the historical past and will be too fast for human populations and
the natural environment to adjust to it. Indeed, some species are
struggling to cope with the climate change that has already occurred.
The CO2 concentration is now about 380 parts per million. If
we go on as usual, it will rise to 550 parts per million&#151;twice
the pre-industrial level&#151;within about 50 years. Whether that
level is enough to trigger catastrophic changes, we just do not
know.</p><p><a name="06071457000123"></a>The committee&#146;s
report noted
that,</p><ul><a name="06071457000513"></a>&#147;many of the
adverse effects of warming can be offset by
adaptation&#148;,</ul><a name="06071457000477"></a>but,
as the White Paper published this week by DfID cogently emphasises, the
most vulnerable people are in Africa, Bangladesh and similar countries
and they are the least able to adapt. If we continue business as usual,
we will end up with vast areas of the world where no human populations
could comfortably live,

metres. The international response needs to be a combination of
adaptation and mitigation with the economic burdens equitably
shared.<p><a name="06071457000124"></a>According to Sir
Nicholas Stern, the intricate economics of climate change is a subject
that needs,</p><ul><a name="06071457000514"></a>&#147;all the
economics you ever learnt - and
more&#148;.</ul><a name="06071457000478"></a>We eagerly
await the report Sir Nicholas is currently preparing, which may well
have a different slant from the report we are debating today. I hope,
in particular, that the Stern review will consider the costs and
benefits of seeking international agreement for a challenging but
attainable CO2 ceiling, such as a limit of 550 parts per
million.<p><a name="06071457000125"></a>As the noble Lord,
Lord Vallance, reminded us, the UK directly contributes just 2 per cent
of the world&#146;s emissions. But the Prime Minister&#146;s
effective leadership at Gleneagles last year shows that we have some
leverage over the G8, and the wealthy countries, themselves the
greatest emitters, have the means and the obligation to take the lead.
At St Petersburg this weekend, energy security will be high on the
agenda.</p><p><a name="06071457000126"></a>As input to the St
Petersburg meeting, the Royal Society has joined the science academies
of the other G8 nations, plus those of China, India, Brazil and South
Africa, to reiterate concerns about global warming and to urge two
things: first, greater international efforts to promote, by appropriate
policies and economic instruments, acceptably clean fossil fuel,
nuclear and the near-market renewable technologies. Secondly, they urge
investment in a wider range of exciting prospects that still seem
futuristic. There is a substantial worldwide R&amp;D programme into
nuclear fusion, even though payback time may be 50 years ahead, but
there are other equally challenging and exciting technologies, such as
harnessing photosynthesis more efficiently, where the current worldwide
R&amp; D is disproportionately
small.</p><p><a name="06071457000127"></a>Here, the UK can exert
special leverage; indeed, we have a special opportunity because our
nation punches well above its weight in climate research and in science
and innovation generally. Recent government initiatives to promote
public/private partnerships in energy research are welcome, as is
Defra&#146;s plan to establish an office of climate
change.</p><p><a name="06071457000128"></a>But should we not we go
further, and declare as a national priority the spearheading of the
innovation and technology the world needs if the immense challenge of
climate change is to be tackled? That will be a step change, as the
noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, described it. Doing that would have an
important bonus: channelling the idealism and commitment of young
people towards a high-profile scientific goal would itself be of great
educational benefit to the
nation.</p><p><a name="06071457000129"></a>Scientists who study the
Earth realise that our planet's history spans millions of centuries,
but even in that perspective, there is something
special&#151;unique&#151;about our century. It is the first in
which one species&#151;ours&#151;can ravage the entire biosphere
and jeopardise life&#146;s long-term future. Most of us have more
constricted time horizons than geologists, but all of us in this

owe to centuries past. History will judge us harshly if, in our
stewardship of the planet, we discount too heavily what might happen 50
or 100 years hence. That is why we need a more sophisticated focus on
the economic challenge of climate
change.</p><h5><a name="06071457000530"></a>12.40

nonsense. Plenty of people from the Middle Ages would now be shuffling
their feet with embarrassment, having argued convincingly that the Sun
went round the Earth because you can see it doing so. They would be
embarrassed to discover that the reverse was true. In the same way, the
precautionary principle can be overdone, but it is so important here
because all the evidence suggests to me that climate change is
happening and is driven, at least in large part, by human activity. We
should therefore adopt the precautionary principle and try to address
it. As several noble Lords have made clear, the big advantage of doing
so is that, as the report says, if done well, it can be economically
advantageous. That is an important point that we must all
address.</p><p><a name="06071457000132"></a>Although I do not
intend to speak primarily about aviation today, I will mention it, so I
ought to declare an interest as campaign director of Future Heathrow. I
want to focus on the growing public awareness of the issue of climate
change&#151;what the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Newcastle
called the tipping point of awareness. He is right. The public are
increasingly willing to consider it as a serious problem. Like my noble
friend Lord Giddens, I am somewhat critical of some of the green
movement. I do not want to be too critical because, over the years, it
has done a very good job, but I stopped supporting a couple of groups
over the Brent Spar incident, when they resisted the sinking of the oil
rig in the North Sea. They got the science wrong and, more importantly,
as my noble friend said, seemed not to acknowledge that science and
technology provide a large part of the answer to the
problem.</p><p><a name="06071457000133"></a>The other reason that I
am critical is that the green movement has a tendency to try to make
people feel guilty about flying, driving or whatever. Guilt is a
singularly bad way to try to change people's behaviour for a
generalised problem of this type. It

house or you will go to prison&#148; is a perfectly good guilt
complex to instil. But changing how people behave generally is much
more difficult. What works is to make information about what we can do
in all our walks of life much more readily available. In other words,
this is not something just for Government, just for aviation, just for
motor vehicles, or whatever; it is for all of us in all walks of life
in everything that we do and
say.</p><p><a name="06071457000134"></a>I want to spend a little
time on that. My message would be the classic one of <I>The</I><I>Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Galaxy</I>: &#147;Don&#146;t
panic&#148;. If the evidence from science was so strong that global
warming was accelerating to the point where it was irreversible and
catastrophic for life on this planet, I have no doubt that we would
have to take action so drastic as to change the nature of civilisation
and life as we have known it for hundreds of years. We would then go
back to a pre-industrial society and heaven knows what the world would
look like. It is not sensible to do that or even to talk about doing
that unless the evidence is so strong that we have only a very short
time to react.</p><p><a name="06071457000135"></a>Evidence at the
moment suggests that if we take the right action, we can deal with the
problem. It involves a combination of science and technology together
with changing people&#146;s attitudes and behaviour. I shall give a
few examples, because this is where I want more assistance, including
from the green movement.</p><p><a name="06071457000136"></a>I
remember being in the studio of a well known, well respected radio
programme. I was not there to talk about climate change&#151;I was
dealing with other political matters which, from time to time, come to
pass&#151;but climate change was being discussed. There was a lot of
emphasis on what the Government should do, what certain industries
should do and so on. The discussion was taking place in an office at
least one-third the size of a football field, brilliantly lit with good
light from natural sources&#151;the windows. There were about six
people working there because it was about 7 am. Every light was on in
that office, yet the discussion concerned climate
change.</p><p><a name="06071457000137"></a>Lest noble Lords think
that I am picking on one particular media programme&#151;I am
certainly not, because I have a lot of respect for that
programme&#151;I say that if we look around this House of Lords, we
should say, &#147;Hang on a minute, are we doing as much as we
could?&#148;. Noble Lords may have seen me late at night scrabbling
around behind 19th-century oak panels looking for light switches
precisely because I think that we need to do more.</p><p><a name="06071457000138"></a>One thing that is not well
known&#151;this is where the green movement can do more to inform
people&#151;is that you can buy your electricity from renewable
sources from most of the big producers. Old buildings of this type are
ideally placed to do just that. Modern buildings can be built to much
higher standards, so energy use can be low. That cannot be done so
easily in older buildings such as this, but their electricity can be
bought from renewable sources. I do that in my home. It is more
expensive, but it pushes up the investment in renewables. That is
another area where I 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_927"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 927</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should have liked there to have been more in the report. I want more
information to be made available about what people can do with
microgeneration. That is another area that should be developed. Many
houses, blocks of flats and other places in Britain could be supplied
either by wind or solar power to a large part, and feed energy back
into the grid. The way forward on that is for the Government to change
planning regulations and encourage it through local authorities. There
is a lot more that we can
do.</p><p><a name="06071457000139"></a>What does not
help&#151;here I touch on aviation&#151;is if people run around
saying, &#147;You must not fly; you are going to fry the
planet&#148;. In fact, the most modern aircraft are not dissimilar in
their carbon footprint per passenger mile to a family car. We are not
far from the point where we can say that it is more environmentally
responsible to fly to a destination in Europe than to drive there. Here
we get into the psychology. If the green movement argues that we must
all stop flying, people will not respond. They may feel guilty, but
they will still do it, just as they may feel guilty hopping into their
car to drive the kids to school and worry about whether they are frying
the planet. It will not actually change their behaviour. Behaviour
change is what we want and there are many other ways of doing
that.</p><p><a name="06071457000140"></a>Greenpeace, Friends of the
Earth, the Woodland Trust and others recently spent a large amount of
money on adverts in national papers basically saying, &#147;There are
too many aeroplanes flying&#148;. That is not a sensible response. It
also has a dramatic effect: if you say, &#147;We are going to bear
down on some of the drivers of high technology and science&#148;, you
will produce the opposite effect of what you want, in terms of the
changes we need in society. That, incidentally, is why I think those
organisations are wrong on nuclear power. Although nuclear power is not
what we would use in an ideal world, it is necessary for dealing with
the serious situation we have.</p><p><a name="06071457000141"></a>My message on this issue is to all of us,
myself and everyone else, not to individual industries. We should not
pick on aviation, the car industry or the media. &#147;Big
Brother&#148; probably produces more CO2 than many other
programmes, and I could make a good case for saying it is not
necessary, but if people want to watch it I do not want to stop them. I
want to ensure we reduce the carbon imprint overall, and the way to do
that is to recognise, whether in our personal lives, our
workplaces&#151;like your Lordships&#146; House&#151;or in
industry as a whole, that we can deal with this problem. However, we
will not do so with a panicked reaction that tries to take us back to a
pre-industrial phase. For a country such as Britain, which led the
Industrial Revolution and the science-based revolution, it would be a
terrible mistake.</p><h5><a name="06071457000531"></a>12.51

Earl of Selborne:</b> My Lords, like other speakers I
start by congratulating my noble friend Lord Wakeham on the report and
on the manner in which he has introduced the debate today. My noble
friend gave a helpful two-paragraph summary of the 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_928"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 928</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>report in the <I>House Magazine</I> supplement on House of Lords
Committees. He said that it raises serious concerns, and this is just
one: the preoccupation in international negotiations with setting
emission targets and the failure to give sufficient attention to
alternative approaches. That brings us neatly to the key issue, which
has already resonated around this debate: to what extent can we rely on
adaptation, and to what extent are international negotiations about
setting emissions likely to fail or be relevant?</p><p><a name="06071457000143"></a>The report calls for a balance. I think,
particularly having heard the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Lawson,
that that is clearly a case for more reliance on adaptation, and more
reliance on adaptation than would be wise. Paragraph 2 of the report
correctly warns us that the science of human-induced warming remains
uncertain. That uncertainty dictates caution and taking out of
insurance against the worst risks. I agree; this is all about risk
assessment and what isthe necessary insurance. The United
Kingdom Government, and other Governments, have a responsibility on
behalf of present and future generations to determine what insurance is
appropriate, and to take the best advice on what the worst risks might
be and the order of probability. It should then be possible to
determine what insurance is the most appropriate, and indeed what is
most equitable, between generations, between developed and developing
countries and between affluent communities and the
impoverished.</p><p><a name="06071457000144"></a>There is
impressive agreement on the scientific advice. The noble Lord, Lord
Oxburgh, acknowledged that it is a remarkable phenomenon to have this
number of independent scientists working for the IPCC come up with the
sort of results they have achieved. The report notes that majorities do
not necessarily embody the truth, but that the major associations of
scientists have adopted similar positions. It would be reasonable to
expect that we treat with care and caution any recommendations coming
out of the IPCC with clearer judgments on the probabilities of the
projected temperature increases.</p><p><a name="06071457000145"></a>The report calls for the IPCC to pay more
attention to those dissenting scientists who do not accept the
scientific consensus, and claims there are weaknesses in the way the
scientific community, and the IPCC in particular, treats the impact of
climate change. It calls for a more balanced approach. Yet the
committee states in paragraph 4 that it decided to restrict the scope
of its investigation to certain aspects of the economics of climate
change. I find that rather modest aspiration difficult to reconcile
with the sweeping judgments on the IPCC, its scientific conclusions and
its process of operation.</p><p><a name="06071457000146"></a>I
will mention just one risk that is referred to several times in the
report, and for which a judgment by international Governments has to be
made on what insurance, if any, is appropriate. It was mentioned in the
excellent maiden speech by the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, and is
referred to in paragraph 38 of the report under the heading
&#147;Large scale one-off changes&#148;. The paragraph draws
attention to the reversal or shutdown of the Atlantic 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_929"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 929</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>thermohaline circulation, known to us, somewhat inaccurately, as the
Gulf Stream. The probability of a shutdown is not yet known, but the
report acknowledges that it might happen after the next 100
years or so. The trigger could be the melting of the Greenland ice
sheet, which has been variously calculated as likely to happen when
temperatures increase by at least two degrees centigrade over
pre-industrial levels.</p><p><a name="06071457000147"></a>Since
the report was published last year, Professor Bryden and his team at
the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton published in
<I>Nature</I>, on21 December 2005, measurements of the
strength of the meridional overturning circulation, which seems to have
weakened by about 30 per cent in the past decade or so. Such a slowdown
has been predictedby some climate models, and I believe these
measurements are evidence that the models could be right. If
circulation were switched off we would seea change in
temperature in north-west Europe happening relatively quickly, and the
consequences would be very far-reaching. More measurements will be
needed over the next decade or more to say with greater certainty if
changes observed from 1957 to 2004 represent actual long-term changes
in the meridional overturning circulation.</p><p><a name="06071457000148"></a>In paragraph 40 the report acknowledges
that these risks are being monitored, and says there is a balance to be
struck. The report always comes back to this word
&#147;balance&#148;, which I believe is code for saying
&#147;more reliance on adaptation&#148;. I would say there is a
decision to be made based on the scientific evidence which is
consistent with these models. Do we continue to try and adapt, or do we
mediate? How on earth do you adapt to turning off the Gulf Stream? That
is not something for which there is any method of adaptation. We have
to recognise that there is a risk of a major shift in our global
climate through disrupting thermohaline circulation, or THC, as it is
referred to in the report. It has happened before, possibly more than
once since the last ice age, and at least one of the events was a
direct result of the Earth becoming warmer.</p><p><a name="06071457000149"></a>The United Kingdom Government are right
to be preoccupied with setting emission targets. The message from the
debate today must be clear and unequivocal: we cannot rely solely on
adaptation and alternative approaches as the main strategy for managing
climate change. That is not a realistic option in the light of the
scientific evidence available to us today. We must continue to try and
set emission targets at the international level, recognising, for all
the reasons set out in the debate today, how difficult that will be.
The noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, reminded us that we need to recognise
that the energy requirements of China and India will be the key to
trying to achieve international emission targets, which are certainly a
challenge.</p><h5><a name="06071457000532"></a>12.58

Taverne:</b> My Lords, I too add my tribute to the
maiden speech made by my noble friend Lord Teverson. I thought it was a
major contribution to the discussion.</p><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_930"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 930</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071457000151"></a>One or two speakers have suggested that,
although they generally agree with the House of Lords report on the
economic effects of climate change, it struck the wrong tone&#151;the
balance was not quite right. I take rather a different view, because
discussions on environmental issues tend to suffer from hyperbole. I
shall give an example: the question of nuclear power, which could play
a major role in dealing with climate change. Greenpeace, which seems to
regard the risk of radiation from nuclear power as a risk almost as
great, or as great, as that from global warming, said recently that the
outfall from Chernobyl would be more than 100,000 deaths. I have
argued, in this House and in print, that the dangers of radiation are
greatly exaggerated, that the linear no-threshold theory on which most
of the prognostications were based is not supported by evidence, and
that small doses of radiation seem to be helpful or
beneficial.</p><p><a name="06071457000152"></a>I do not know how
many noble Lords saw the &#147;Horizon&#148; programme last night,
which was an unusually good television programme on science. It
produced convincing evidence that the number of deaths to be expected
as a result of Chernobyl&#151; which has generally been around 4,000,
not 100,000&#151;was greatly overestimated. It showed that people
living in areas of high natural radiation are less likely to suffer
from cancer; that the linear no-threshold theory is mistaken and not
supported by the evidence; and that evidence from animals examined in
the Chernobyl area indicates that small doses of radiation can protect
against the risk of cancer. I mention that because it shows that we
must judge conventional wisdom, particularly alarmist prognostications,
by evidence and not hype. To echo what the noble Lords, Lord Soley and
Lord Giddens, said, scare stories spread by Greenpeace and Friends of
the Earth must be treated with great caution. Generally, they do more
harm than good. As the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, said, the
environmental movement should be rescued from some of the green
activists.</p><p><a name="06071457000153"></a>That brings me to
climate change. I was a sceptic about climate change because I remember
the confident warnings when we were thought to be facing a new ice age.
But I became convinced not only that global warming was happening, but
also that there was a very significant anthropogenic element. I read
through most of volume 1 of the report from the International Panel on
Climate Change. Incidentally, it is a formidable volume which I have
had out of the Library for more than one and a half years. Unlike most
publications one borrows, there has been no request for its return; so,
clearly, no one else has bothered to read
it.</p>

<p><a name="06071457000154"></a>It convinced me because it
was a very balanced report that does not deny uncertainties and some
conflict in the evidence. Take, for example, the melting of the ice
caps and the retreat of the glaciers. The rise in ocean levels is
regarded as one of the most serious consequences of global warming. A
great deal of panic is created because we are always shown the pictures
of the ice caps by the West Antarctic Peninsula falling into the sea
and the melting of the Greenland ice caps. The report points out that
in the Antarctic continent the ice is thickening with a small
decreasing effect on ocean levels.</p><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_931"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 931</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071457000155"></a>Recently, I read in the report by Sir
Nicholas Stern that we must take the collapse of Greenland ice
seriously, which is caused because at the heart of Greenland the ice is
thickening through precipitation and is pushing the fringes into the
sea. At the present rate, he said, sea levels will rise by 0.05
millimetres per year, which is 0.5 centimetres in 100 years. The IPCC
report estimates that the main effect will be from the warming of the
oceans. Even then it estimates the actual sea rise levels as between 11
and 77 centimetres. That is serious because the rise will be very
different in different parts of the world. It could be catastrophic for
some people living in the delta areas of the world, but it is not
necessarily catastrophic overall. We could, for example, provide aid to
Bangladesh to enable it to take the kind of defensive measures which
the Dutch have taken. Incidentally, its estimate of sea rise levels was
somewhat less than that in the second assessment of the IPCC.</p><p><a name="06071457000156"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Selborne, mentioned
the disturbing findings by Professor Bryden. But we also heard
evidence, in the hearings in the committee on water management, from
one of the experts of the Hadley Centre who said that it had not made
the Hadley Centre change its basic estimate that there was a very small
risk of something very serious happening. One cannot discount that
risk, but there are many places where the Gulf Stream has to be
measured. It is obviously disturbing that it has slowed down in one
place, but in other places, it may have accelerated. The speed of the
Gulf Stream changes.</p><p><a name="06071457000157"></a>Storms are
most frequently mentioned. In its scientific report&#151;there is a
slightly different emphasis in the political report&#151;the IPCC
stated:</p><ul><a name="06071457000498"></a>&#147;Recent analyses
of changes in severe local weather (e.g., tornadoes, thunderstorm days,
and hail) in a few selected regions do not provide compelling evidence
to suggest long-term changes&#148;.</ul><a name="06071457000479"></a>I mention that because the
IPCC&#146;s scientific section acknowledges these uncertainties, but
it still comes to the firm conclusion that global warming is manmade,
which is one of the reasons why I find the report convincing.
Certainly, the evidence since that report was published suggests that
the fourth assessment in 2007 will be more pessimistic than the third,
because a number of recent developments suggest that the danger is
greater and has strengthened the case that global warming is
happening.<p><a name="06071457000158"></a>I thought that the
House of Lords report was a breath of fresh air because it was much
more balanced. It came to the conclusion that we cannot look towards
Kyoto, which does not include the nations whose actions will be of
vital importance. As the noble Lord, Lord Vallance, said, it concludes
that in the end the answer must come from technology and creating the
right framework for technological development. It will not necessarily
come only from technology. Maybe a major part will be played by changes
in lifestyle. I do not think that lifestyles will never change. We have
changed attitudes towards drinking and driving and there are ways in
which people change their attitudes. But I do not altogether place as
much hope on this as the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Newcastle
because I do not see

will change their lifestyles. India, China and the other developing
nations will not renounce economic growth. To ask people to change
their lifestyle fundamentally will not have the effect that we
need.</p><p><a name="06071457000159"></a>We do not need imbalance
in reporting, exaggeration which is not justified by the evidence and,
above all, constant predictions of catastrophe. That approach will
undermine the credibility of the threat. It will induce a mood of
fatalism. If we are doomed anyway, the attitude is likely to be
&#147;Well, let&#146;s make hay while the sun shines. Let&#146;s

Beaumont of Whitley:</b> My Lords, I have of course
read the report of the Lords committee and most of the evidence, and I
am staggered by Members&#146; erudition, for which I express the
usual gratitude. In my youth, I took a degree in agriculture, with
agricultural economics as a special subject. It now dawns on me that it
was the economics paper which ensured that I got only a fourth class
degree, a phenomenon which some noble Lords may remember existed in
those days. Although the subject of my speech falls fairly and squarely
within the title of the report, I will concentrate on agriculture,
which on the whole has been neglected in this
debate.</p><p><a name="06071457000161"></a>The other day, some of
your Lordships were present at the gathering which listened to
Vice-President Al Gore&#146;s speech. For many noble Lords, as for
me, little that he said was new. However, there was one statement which
was new to me, which sent me scurrying to your Lordships&#146;
Library to ask our splendid research staff to find substantiation for
it. At first, they could not, but eventually they got hold of a copy of
the Vice-President&#146;s book, <I>An Inconvenient Truth</I>, and
found that the statement was fully substantiated in the text. On page
121, it states that in the United States and elsewhere soil moisture
evaporation increases dramatically with higher temperatures and that
unless we act dramatically to contain global warming pollution, one at
least of the great bread baskets of the world will disappear within the
next 10 years. That spells out catastrophe to us in these overcrowded
islands, for which we as Parliament are responsible.</p><p><a name="06071457000162"></a>Since about 1951, economics&#151;that
dismal science&#151;has told us that it was perfectly all right to
rely on imports to feed our people and in the course of doing so to
allow the small farming industry of this country to disappear and farms
to get ever larger, following the rule that we achieved optimum outputs
per pound invested in large units. We could forget about food security,
that principle which kept us alive during the
1940s.</p><p><a name="06071457000163"></a>Today we have think about
it again since imported food is going to become less available, and as
it does so, a great deal more expensive. The economicsof
global warming will dictate that we measure profitability not in terms
of outputs of capital but in the total amount of food we can produce.
We will find, as we have found before, that that comes from

little earlier in the debate.</p><p><a name="06071457000164"></a>If
our grandchildren are not going to starve&#151;and if that sounds
overly dramatic, let us remember how close we came to it in the early
1940s&#151;we will have to look after our soil, our small farms and
our skilled labour. Some noble Lords may have seen a fascinating series
of programmes shown recently on TV about introducing black youths to
farming in Devon. We are going to need all those who have a gift for
farming, and it is not all that long since a great number of the
population did have that gift. I remember when in the course of
persuading the Church of England that I was a fit person to become a
clergyman, I was involved with a troop of Boy Scouts in Hackney, many
of whom were the sons of my mother&#146;s Girl Guides from when she
was Guide Commissioner for North London. I came across one boy who had
a real gift for growing things and a deep feeling for nature, but I was
able to do nothing to stop him going into a factory making
lavatory-paper rolls.</p><p><a name="06071457000165"></a>We are
going to have to use all our resources to feed ourselves, and
incidentally it will mean saying goodbye to those rather good schemes,
popularin your Lordships&#146; House and which I have
enthusiastically supported over a period of time, for biofuels. When it
comes to the crunch we will need all the fertile soil available for the
growing of food. If I have to choose between consuming diesel and
consuming potatoes, I will choose potatoes every
time.</p><p><a name="06071457000166"></a>Much the most important
function of government is to protect the population from harms, and by
far the most fundamental of those harms is hunger. It is for that
reason that I urge that this debate and others like it should bring
about a complete revolution in our agricultural policy in this
country.</p><h5><a name="06071457000534"></a>1.13

profession.</p><p><a name="06071457000168"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Lawson, said in his conclusion that much of the concern about global
warming was a &#147;mountain of nonsense&#148;, so I must begin
with four remarks about the science of climate change before turning to
the way forward. First, there is of course a scientific consensus today
that manmade emissions are raising world temperature and will continue
to do so at an alarming rate unless action is taken. The consensus
includes all but a very few climatologists. However, what is much more
significant for us is that it is supported by our own Royal Society and
by the American Academy of Sciences. I do not really see how
non-scientists can take a different view from those bodies unless we
want to question their motivation. These bodies are not composed
primarily of climatologists, who might 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_934"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 934</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>want to exaggerate the importance of their subject, but of those best
placed to appraise the work of climatologists&#151;and of course they
are bodies whose reputations are on the line if they give rise to
alarms that prove
false.</p><p><a name="06071457000169"></a>Secondly, the scientific
evidence is not in the form sometimes suggested <I>post hoc propter
hoc</I>. It begins with the basic science which shows that increased
greenhouse gases would, other things being equal, increase temperature.
Only then does it visit the historical record and explain the evolution
of the earth&#146;s temperature from the Ice Age to the present day
using basic science to make the
links.</p><p><a name="06071457000170"></a>Thirdly, a key feature of
the science is the very long lags in the system, which help to explain
some of the paradoxes referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Lawson. I do
not know whether noble Lords realise it, but the greenhouse gases we
are producing today will remain in the atmosphere for an average of
almost 150 years&#151;until 2150&#151;and the effect on temperature
will be still further delayed by roughly another 50 years
after the build-up of greenhouse gases, so today we are contributing to
the world&#146;s temperature in 2200. Given that science, it is
absurd to say that we should wait and see. The argument is untenable
when the effects are so long delayed. It is interesting to note that,
as the scientific evidence accumulates and the models become more
firmly based and powerful in their explanation of all the different
phenomena referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, some American
economists who at one time advocated a &#147;wait and see&#148;
approach are increasingly abandoning that
position.</p><p><a name="06071457000171"></a>Finally, the science
is in one sense uncertain, but in another it is certain&#151;a point
made by the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh. It is uncertain exactly by how
much the temperature will rise but it is virtually certain that it will
rise substantially. I should like to give noble Lords some figures
because not everyone understands why it is almost certain that that
will happen. If greenhouse gases stabilise at 550 parts per million,
the temperature would eventually rise by between 2.5 and 5.3 degrees
centigrade above the pre-industrial level. Those are limits with a 90
per cent probability according to the forecasts of the Met
Office&#146;s world-famous Hadley Centre. To give an idea of the
scale of the change, even the lower of those figures would have some
devastating effects, which I shall come to, but the higher figure is as
big as the difference between the temperature today and what it was in
the Ice Age; it is not a tiny change as suggested earlier in the
debate. Nor do these estimates allow for any of a number of major
discontinuous risks, such as the melting of the Arctic permafrost,
which would have an even more dramatic
impact.</p><p><a name="06071457000172"></a>That is the scenario at
550 parts per million, but how likely is it that greenhouses gases will
reach that figure? It is virtually certain unless we change course
almost immediately. Again, I am going to bore noble Lords with some
numbers because they are important and help to put these arguments out
in the open. At present we have 425 parts per million. At the current
rate of emissions, greenhouse gas concentrations are rising by two
parts per million per year. We can all do 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_935"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 935</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the arithmetic to calculate how long it will take to get from 425 ppm to
550 ppm&#151;we will get there well before the end of the century,
and even then the concentrations would continue to rise. That is the
scenario if emissions were to remain at their present rate&#151;if
China and India do not grow and if no one else increases emissions.
Even with no increase in emissions, it is a horrifying prospect. But no
one expects emissions to remain constant. A typical forecast suggests
that they will grow by 2 per cent a year, and we know how that will
accumulate.</p><p><a name="06071457000173"></a>The committee had to
consider many different controversies on the assumptions about economic
growth that go into the forecast, and of course we need the best
estimates for that. But noble Lords can see from the simple arithmetic
with which I have bored them that it is not that important how fast
economic growth in the future is; all it does is to slightly affect the
date on which the awful thing arrives. It does not affect the
fundamental structure of the problem in any way at all; it is a
diversion.</p><p><a name="06071457000174"></a>Unfortunately, it is
not easy to forecast the economic effects of any given temperature and
our committee rightly stresses that much more work is needed on that.
But all analyses agree that higher temperatures will cause more
variable weather&#151;more droughts, more floods and more hurricanes.
It takes only a 10 per cent change in the Indian monsoon to cause a
drought or a flood. As many people have said, the main groups affected
by global warming will be the poorest people in Africa and Asia. The
effects of the inevitable global warming are almost certain to cancel
out any level of aid which is likely to come about, at least in terms
of economic development; AIDS control is a different
matter.</p><p><a name="06071457000175"></a>We should of course
discuss the possibilities of adaptation. There will certainly have to
be a great deal of adaptation in the coming years, given what is
already inevitable. But, as the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh,
said&#151;this is a very important point&#151;the world&#146;s
temperature has been fairly stable for most of recorded history, and
the whole pattern of human life and human settlement is adapted to that
temperature. To adapt to a much higher temperature may well require the
migration of billions of people, with all the political and social
problems that we know migration involves. Migration is a central issue,
in a sense, in the adaptation debate. It could make sense to accept
that migration only if the cost of avoiding it were also very
large&#151;but I do not believe that it
is.</p><p><a name="06071457000176"></a>That brings me, finally, to
the way forward. I support very much the splendid speech of the noble
Lord, Lord Vallance. The obvious solution is to meet our energy needs
without the release of carbon. Very interesting evidence originated
from the International Energy Agency on the cost of making photovoltaic
energy, biomass and carbon sequestration competitive in price with gas
and oil. The estimate was that to get these technologies to that point
there would have to be a major effort of basic and applied research.
This would not be undertaken by the private sector&#151;certainly not
the basic science because the results could not be captured by any one
company&#151;so there would have to be a charge on the public of the
world. 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_936"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 936</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The scale would be 2 per cent of one year&#146;s world GDP. This
compares, for example, with the moon shot, which was 2.5 per cent of
one year&#146;s GDP in the United States at the time. If you take 2
per cent of one year&#146;s GDP and spread it over 20 years, that is
0.1 per cent of world GDP, which is not a large amount to spend on
saving the planet.</p><p><a name="06071457000177"></a>I support the
way in which the noble Lord, Lord Vallance, recommended that should be
organised. As has been said many times, the Treasury has taken up our
recommendation. I think the Stern inquiry is going along the right
lines. Radical proposals are needed because of what is happening at
this moment and its long-term effects. In particular, it is time we had
an international technology treaty aimed at stabilising, in the end,
the world temperature at the one we have got used to, which means
cutting carbon emissions by
two-thirds.</p><h5><a name="06071457000535"></a>1.24

Tanlaw:</b> My Lords, like many other speakers who
have entered the debate, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Wakeham,
and his erudite committee on the time they have spent and the work they
have done. It is a little discourteous that that very important report
remained so long gathering dust on a shelf. It is slightly out of date,
which is its only weakness, and it is a great pity that it was not
debated earlier.</p><p><a name="06071457000179"></a>I am not really
qualified to take part in this debate. Like the noble Lord, Lord
Beaumont of Whitley, I got a very poor degree&#151;it was in medieval
history rather than agriculture&#151;when we were at Cambridge
together. My only claim to fame, as I have said before, is that I was
an early whistleblower on the greenhouse effect some 30 years ago. But
I have had a Damascus road conversion in regard to climate change which
is based on the report before us. Having read it, it appears to me that
the climate does not change but it changes; it has changed and will no
doubt change again in the future. Therefore I wonder whethera
more accurate title for the report would not be<I>The
Economics of Climate Changes</I> rather than <I>The Economics of
Climate Change</I>.</p><p><a name="06071457000180"></a>Ask any
meteorologist and they will say that every day is meteorologically
different. No one day is the same as the last; the wind, the clouds,
the pressure and the temperature will always be slightly different. So
it is with climate. It is well known that the Milankovitch cycles, the
procession of equinoxes and the variations of the Earth&#146;s tilt
have been the main contributors to major climatic changes in the
distant past. More recently, as shown in the hockey-stick graph before
us, the climate has apparently been stable for the past 1,000 years and
then changes with a sudden rise in temperature in the northern
hemisphere. This upward turn has given the graph its title, because of
its outline.</p><p><a name="06071457000181"></a>But the question I
ask is: is it historically true? There may be a problem with this graph
in that it seems to have become the sacred mandala of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and is, in effect, the basis
of all eco-fundamentalism. It has been strongly criticised by
scientists who are outside the loop of the IPCC and who have given
written or 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_937"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 937</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>oral evidence in the report. These include Professor Ross McKitrick, at
page 262, and Professor Richard Lindzen, at pages 45 and 49. Having
read their evidence, I have a feeling that the hockey-stick graph could
be fatally flawed but, like most members of the general public, I am
not qualified to say so. If it is flawed, the whole question of the
reports on the effects of global warming is put in some
doubt.</p><p><a name="06071457000182"></a>I received a letter from
my long-standing friend,Dr Michael Cole, a distinguished
doctor of science from Cambridge, who has advised me as a non-scientist
how one might approach this anomaly. I shall try to encapsulate his
advice, which I consider to be quite fair and helpful to this
controversial debate, which is far from one-sided. The critics of the
global warming theory propounded by the IPCC are dismissed as a small
number of people who do not know what they are talking about. Thousands
of scientists connected with the IPCC are unanimous in perceiving the
manmade disaster lying ahead, so it is very difficult&#151;certainly
as a non-scientist&#151;to say anything against it. But this may not
be the case at all because its critics include a large number of well
respected scientists in major world-class institutions. The main thing
that they have in common is that they are not funded by or connected
with the IPCC.</p><p><a name="06071457000183"></a>In the report,
the global warming protagonists make two important claims. The first is
that the current increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide is causing the
current climate to go through an unprecedented warm period, reaching
the highest temperature for a millennium, and that this will inevitably
lead to a serious catastrophe in global warming. This has been repeated
time and again by other speakers. The second claim, based on computer
models, is that dangerously high temperatures will lead to damaging
weather conditions in a few decades
ahead.</p><p><a name="06071457000184"></a>But a brief look at
medieval history&#151;I am trying to remember some of it&#151;shows
that between 900 and 1300 AD the climate was considerably warmer than
at present. Why is it that the Viking farmers were able to farm part of
Greenland, so named because it was, presumably, green? Why is it that
the ocean east of Greenland towards Iceland was largely free of ice and
routinely navigated, as was the ocean to the west of Greenland towards
Baffin Island? Why is it that in England, successful vineyards were in
production as far north as Northumberland? When I look out of the
window of my house in Scotland, I see signs of cultivation on the
northern face of hilltops which are 600 feet to 900 feet above sea
level. Why is tree level in the Alps 200 metres above the current
level?</p><p><a name="06071457000185"></a>This warm period was
known as the medieval warm period. From the middle of the 14th<sup></sup>century, the climate cooled abruptly, causing widespread crop
failure in Europe and Greenland and the Greenland farms to be covered
in permanent ice. The old sea passages to Iceland and Baffin Island
became impassable because of the ice. The cool period, which lasted
until the mid-19th century, has been known as the mini-Ice Age. We are
now seeing a recovery from 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_938"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 938</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this period, according to the scientists I read, and may be heading
towards temperatures which existed in the medieval optimum.</p><p><a name="06071457000186"></a>There is nothing new or startling about
the current rise in temperature. The IPCC&#146;s first report on
global warming produced a graph of temperature versus time, clearly
showing temperatures in the medieval warm period climbing to levels
higher than those we are experiencing today. There was no hockey stick
in that graph then. I speak as an ordinary member of the public trying
to read the report; why did the IPCC&#146;s third report produce a
different graph of temperature versus time, showing a more or less flat
temperature between 1000 BC and 1850 AD, followed by a steep rise
thereafter, thus coming to be known as the hockey-stick graph? This
graph has been strongly criticised by Professor Ross McKitrick, as I
have already said. If the graph is wrong, so is everything else, and
there may not be a crisis. I am sure there is a very simple answer to
this question, and I would like to hear
it.</p><p><a name="06071457000187"></a>There is another problem,
which I hope the economists will not take amiss. The projections of
carbon dioxide in global temperature are based on computer models.
There is a difference between economists and stockbrokers. Economists
deal with computer models and graphs, and look to the future;
stockbrokers deal with the market forces of the day. Why are
stockbrokers richer than economists? It is because they are working
with the real facts of the reality of the day-to-day market, while
economists use projections. Even the smallest variation in a projection
that takes place in the years ahead completely unbalances it.</p><p><a name="06071457000188"></a>Who are the beneficiaries of the Kyoto
mitigation policies? Nobody has said. The earth might
be&#151;although I am not so sure that it will be&#151;but so are
the ministries, bureaucracies, consultants and quangos. A number of
speakers have said how many such policies have to be produced because
people are so worried about what is happening. That is why I think that
mitigation has a lot of self-interest; a lot of the areas involved are
government-connected.</p><p><a name="06071457000189"></a>The noble
Lord, Lord Soley, rightly referred to the guilt complex. The
eco-mullahs will turn up in the form of Ministers, advising us that we
should not go over 60 miles an hour on the motorway because we are
adding to carbon emissions. I came here in a car which is powered by
the equivalent of 500 horses&#151;one would have done. I do not feel
guilty about it, but it will not be long before I do. And I will
certainly be taxed on it, if the Mayor of London has anything to do
with it, because my car has a big engine. These are small things. Why
should not people travel on economy jets to their destinations? Why
should they be made to feel guilty? This is what will
happen.</p><p><a name="06071457000190"></a>I will not
be convinced about this until the hockey-stick graph has been explained
to me. Are our temperatures higher or lower than those in the medieval
warm period? If they are lower, let us, asthe noble Lord, Lord
Taverne, implied, lie back and enjoy
it.</p><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_939"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 939</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="06071457000536"></a>1.34

has chaired the Economic Affairs Committee over a fair period and we
all appreciate the way in which he has, with little difficulty,
obtained the necessary consensus. The noble Lord, Lord Lawson, began
his speech by saying that he would be swimming against the tide; I will
limit myself to paddling against
it.</p><p><a name="06071457000192"></a>Looking into the
future of climate change can obviously be very speculative, but I find
the way in which some of the forecasts anticipate the situation 100
years from now almost absurd. In 1850, probably the most important
concern involved the depletion of coal, on which industry and the
world&#146;s economic future depended. Much future assessment was
based on the depletion of the most important energy that was available
and practical. Disasters were widely predicted. No one could anticipate
the various fuels that would subsequently become
available&#151;nuclear, gas and oil&#151;and the situation today is
similar.</p><p><a name="06071457000193"></a>We cannot make
assumptions about energy availability and its use at the end of the
century. There is so much unknown in the century ahead. To make
suggestions about such a long-term future may be acceptable, but the
dogmatism that has been poured into the argument is not. We can
certainly look ahead to the next 30 years. That is a sensible time
period, and the dependency on oil over that time is unquestionably a
matter that we have to
consider.</p><p><a name="06071457000194"></a>In his evidence to the
committee, Professor Colin Robinson said, on page 2 of the
report,</p><ul><a name="06071457000515"></a>&#147;past
experience suggests that once a consensus emerges and passes into the
conventional wisdom&#151;as the climate change consensus has
done&#151;it is difficult to dislodge by the normal processes of
scientific
challenge&#148;.</ul><a name="06071457000480"></a>He goes
on:<ul><a name="06071457000499"></a>&#147;The scientific
establishment comes to depend on research grants which are most easily
obtained if research projects appear to deal with accepted problems.
Consultants gear their efforts to advise on these same issues. The
media constantly run stories that appear to reinforce the consensus.
For all these reasons, the consensus is highly resistant to
change&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06071457000195"></a>That consensus
needs examining. What concerns me are the measures that we are
proposing to take to deal with the problem of the heating of our
planet. In Britain, we are responsible for between 2 per cent and 3 per
cent. China, India and the USA are the energy problem
countries&#151;China and India in particular will increasingly be
responsible for global warming. Compared with these countries, our 2.7
per cent is an insignificant amount. While we must of course try to
reduce it, other countries must face up to their
responsibilities.</p><p><a name="06071457000196"></a>One aspect of
global warming concerns the melting of the Antarctic ice cap. Sea
levels are expected to rise and low-lying countries will be affected.
That is undoubtedly a world problem, but it needs to be addressed
substantially by the major polluting countries themselves. They have
the problem at their doorstep. Meanwhile, I hope that the IPCC will
deal with the questions that have been raised about the emissions
scenario and will conduct the reappraisal that our report recommends.
It has 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_940"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 940</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>assumed 3 per cent as the annual rate of economic growth over the next
100 years and further assumed a convergence of the economies of all
countries over that period. I find it quite ridiculous to make these
assumptions over such a long period ahead. The IPCC needs to improve
the way in which it makes it future estimates and it should make its
estimates over a more sensible time period. That is a weakness that we
express in our report. Of course, it is right that we take an
international view of these problems, but since we are much less
affected by it, if at all, we should express our views and take the
minor role in assisting in dealing with the
situation.</p><p><a name="06071457000197"></a>One important matter
raised in our report is whether the damage from climate change is
likely to be more in the developing than in the developed countries.
The Nordhaus estimate, which we mention in our report, is that for a
2.5 degree centigrade rise in world warming, world GNP could decline by
1.5 per cent to 2 per cent, but in Africa the figure could be4
per cent and in India 5 per cent. That shows that the damage is not
evenly spread and that the developing countries generally tend to lose
more than the developed countries. The question following from that is
why we are at the forefront of pressing for action on climate change
when the problem for Britain is so much less than it is for other
countries. Obviously, we must play a part in helping to deal with world
problems, but when so many in the countries most affected appear almost
indifferent to the problems that will affect them most, our role should
not be the dominant one.</p>

<p><a name="06071457000198"></a>The
further question that we have to ask is whether the costs of warming
control is in a number of cases greater than the benefits of dealing
with the problem. One might look at this matter differently: it is not
out of the question that we in Britain could actually benefit from
global warming. One scenario might be that the north of England and
Scotland acquire a climate similar to that of the south of England,
with the south of England acquiring a Mediterranean climate. I
personally am very happy with the climate that we now have, but
possible changes could be perfectly acceptable and in the eyes of many
could even be an advantage. What troubles me is that we who have less
to lose than so many other countries should anticipate spending so much
more than some of those countries that have far more to
lose.</p><h5><a name="06071457000537"></a>1.41

misinterpreted as suggesting that the threat of climate change is less
significant than commonly believed and that the need for early action
is therefore less. That risk arises in respect of several elements of
the report&#146;s analysis but, as we are time-constrained today, I
shall focus on only one area of
analysis.</p><p><a name="06071457000201"></a>The report questions
the robustness of the economic assumptions that underpin the
IPCC&#146;s emission scenarios. It makes two specific criticisms.
First, it says that the IPCC was wrong to use market exchange rate
measures of GDP growth rather than purchasing power parity measures.
Secondly, it says that it was politically constrained from including
scenarios in which the developing world or particular parts of it were
unsuccessful in achieving convergence towards developed world living
standards.</p><p><a name="06071457000202"></a>The first criticism
is entirely justified. The market exchange rate approach is simply
wrong and the PPP approach correct. The percentage of respected
economists who say otherwise is as small as the percentage of respected
scientists who deny that human-induced climate change is occurring. The
second criticism is also valid. Almost no economist would assume a
common rate of convergence across all developing economies. Many would
suggest that the best current assumption is that some parts of the
developing world&#151;China and other Asian countries in
particular&#151;may be achieving historically rapid rates of growth
and convergence, while others, including several African states, are
sadly not yet on any clear convergence path at all. These are important
methodological points and, although it does not follow that better
methodology will necessarily produce materially lower estimates of
economic growth, emissions or concentrations than those in the IPCC
scenarios, there is a danger that the casual reader, or the reader
searching for reasons to justify a policy of inaction, will slip to
that conclusion.</p><p><a name="06071457000203"></a>The market
exchange rate versus PPP distinction is important but, as the report
itself makes clear in table 3, the impact on concentration levels
likely to pertain in 2100 is fairly slight. The illustration given
shows an adjustment in one predicted concentration level, on one
scenario, from 731 parts per million to 678, which in terms of possible
long-term climate effects is no more than a shift from the absolutely
disastrous to the very slightly less disastrous. More important, it is
not clear that slipping to more differentiated and realistic approaches
to convergence and growth will produce lower growth rates, since if
current growth assumptions look rather optimistic for Africa, they may
well be too pessimistic for China, India and other Asian
countries.</p><p><a name="06071457000204"></a>The IPCC scenarios
assume that world GDP will grow somewhere between 2.2 per cent per
annum and 3 per cent per annum in the 110 years between 1990 and 2100,
but the IMF's latest world economic outlook database figures, which are
correctly weighted on a PPP basis, show that global growth is now
running at 4.9 per cent per annum. The combination of the past 15 years
of historical experience, which are facts, and the IMF&#146;s
forecast for 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_942"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 942</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the next six years&#151;and it is pretty good at medium-term
forecasts, so the figures are fairly good&#151;suggests that the
average over the years 1990 to 2011 will be 3.9 per cent per annum. So
for 21 years at least, almost one-fifth of the entire forecast period,
we are likely to be running well above the upper end of the IPCC
forecast range. While the report quotes a Treasury official as
suggesting that sustaining a global growth rate of 3 per cent over a
century is unprecedented, it somewhat oddly does that precisely two
inches away from a table&#151;table 1 on page 36, drawn from
Professor Madison&#151;that illustrates that the average global
growth rate throughout the 20th century was, in fact, 3 per
cent.</p><p><a name="06071457000205"></a>Future global growth
forecasts are highly uncertain, but one of the central economic facts
of the past 15 years is that the increased integration of the global
economy&#151;the great power of the global free-market
system&#151;is unleashing, at least for a time, a major acceleration
of growth in developing Asian economies which account for more than 40
per cent of the world's population. Once we allow for that
phenomenon&#151;which was rather strangely unreferred to in a report
to do with the economic input into climate change&#151;it is quite
possible that the more robust methodologies for which the report
rightly argues will suggest estimates for 21st-century growth at least
within the 2.2 per cent to 3 per cent range and possibly even above
it.</p><p><a name="06071457000206"></a>So it is really not the
case, as the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, suggested, that the global growth
forecasts in the IPCC are clearly biased upwards. I find it difficult
to understand how he can stress at one point in his speech the rapid
pace at which China is growing and building coal power stations and the
fact that it may rapidly become the world's biggest emitter, but then
assert in the same speech that we know that the IPCC forecasts are
biased upwards.</p><p><a name="06071457000207"></a><b><a name="06071457000580"></a>Lord
Lawson of Blaby:</b> My Lords, perhaps I may
intervene as the noble Lord has mentioned me by name, twice I think.
What concerned me most was that, whereas the energy intensity of growth
in the world in recent years has steadily diminished, the IPCC economic
forecasts show that that will be reversed and that energy intensity
will increase&#151;according to those forecasts. That makes an
enormous difference in carbon dioxide
emissions.</p><p><a name="06071457000208"></a><b><a name="06071457000581"></a>Lord
Turner of Ecchinswell:</b> My Lords, I agree entirely
with the noble Lord that, in addition to growth rate, it is important
to consider the issue of the carbon intensity of growth. However, he
very deliberately drew attention to the fact that Chinese growth is
being driven by coal power rather than gas power. One of the key
drivers of the increasing carbon efficiency of growth&#151;of falling
carbon emissions relative to growth over the past 20 years in the
developed world&#151;has been the increasing use of gas. But if China
is growing rapidly, and powering itself extensively through coal, we
may well see a major growth spurt that is very carbon intensive. The
noble Lord seemed to deploy a debating technique whereby, to argue that
Kyoto is completely ineffective, 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_943"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 943</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>he drew attention to China&#146;s rapid growth, but then, to argue
that the IPCC emission forecasts are too high, he simply ignored
it.</p><p><a name="06071457000209"></a>As the noble Lords, Lord
Oxburgh and Lord Rees of Ludlow, stressed, there are uncertainties in
the details of climate change science, but extremely high
probabilities, bordering on certainty, that the scale of global warming
could be significant and harmful if concentration levels of greenhouse
gases rise even to the IPCC&#146;s middle scenarios, let alone to its
high scenarios.</p><p><a name="06071457000210"></a>A similar
situation applies to the economics. There are uncertainties and it is
important continually to improve forecast methodologies and the clarity
of communication. But if the global market economy is even reasonably
successful in delivering widening prosperity across an increasing
proportion of the developing world&#151;an outcome that we should
surely desire in human terms, and which at present, at least for some
regions of the world, looks extremely likely&#151;it is almost
certain that, unless we take deliberate countervailing action,
concentration levels of greenhouse gases will rise to at least
pre-industrial levels, and to levels not seen for hundreds of
thousands, and possibly millions, of years. It is vital that that near
certainty remains clear to people even as we note important
uncertainties in the
detail.</p><h5><a name="06071457000538"></a>1.51
pm</h5><p><a name="06071457000211"></a><b><a name="06071457000582"></a>Baroness
Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> My Lords, it is hard
to think of a debate that it is more of a privilege to listen to. I
warmly thank the noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, for giving us the
opportunity to debate this issue and to listen to such thought
provoking speeches.</p><p><a name="06071457000212"></a>I
congratulate my noble friend Lord Teverson on his maiden speech. He is
a tremendous addition to the Liberal Democrat Benches, with his
experience in economics, politics and finance. As we have heard, he is
a very passionate exponent of the issues that will face us in the
future.</p><p><a name="06071457000213"></a>We all might have
expected the G8 summit to put climate change at the top of its agenda,
but yet again it has been overtaken by tragic events which it will no
doubt have to spend much time debating instead. Although it may still
touch on climate change, its fate is never to be the urgent issue of
the day. Politicians will continue to struggle with that. That is why
the remark of the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, was so important. Kyoto is
not an end in itself, but it is a unique first essential step along the
path of some international agreement on dealing with this threat. Of
course, it is imperfect in its current form and I have no doubt that it
will not be perfect in its post-2012 form, but it is very much a first
step and a statement that the world wants to take action. That is why
it is so important that the developing world states that it will join
in that, and that it is concernedabout
it.</p><p><a name="06071457000214"></a>Some interesting issues have
been raised; for example, whether the green movement is hostile to
science. That is like asking whether scientists are hostile to the
environment. It is a non-question. I am 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_944"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 944</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sure that some green activists might be regarded as Luddites because of
their life style changes, but many people in the green movement are
busy developing cutting edge technology, among them many eminent
scientists, of whom it certainly could not be said that they were
hostile to science. It is a very unfortunate path to
pursue.</p><p><a name="06071457000215"></a>The committee&#146;s
evidence is excellent and makes interesting reading. As one would
expect, it reveals varied opinions, and interesting, thought provoking
questions were asked. As I have said, the debate today has been
excellent, but I join other speakers in expressing a certain
disappointment about the report. Others have mentioned the tone of the
report, but perhaps I could be slightly more forthright in saying that
one of the weaknesses of the report is that it started out with an
assumption which it then set out to prove.</p><p><a name="06071457000216"></a>Professor Colin Robinson was quoted by
the noble Lord, Lord Sheldon. At the start of the evidence volume,
Professor Robinson makes the point that economists are not qualified to
comment in detail on the methods used by scientists to model climate
change. But the tone of the report is set by his comment that those who
call for substantial action
are,</p><ul><a name="06071457000516"></a>&#147;alarmist
observers, like doomsters of earlier
times&#148;.</ul><a name="06071457000481"></a>That sets
the tone for the report, which spends an undue amount of time
questioning the intricacies of the modelling and the scenarios behind
some of the predictions of the IPCC.
<p><a name="06071457000217"></a>I could not better the analysis of the
noble Lord, Lord Turner, and I certainly would not wish to try. I will
read his speech in <I>Hansard</I>. He encapsulatedfar more
eloquently than I would many of my reservations about the assumptions
that had been made about the IPCC. Other noble Lords, including the
noble Lord, Lord Rees of Ludlow, said that the very questioning and
wishing for certainty in scenarios that are of their very nature
uncertain is unrealistic.</p><p><a name="06071457000218"></a>Those
of us who opened the report with anticipation felt that because the
committee was so over-determined to pursue that one issue at
length&#151;whether the IPCC was too politicised&#151;it was to the
loss of other issues that were not explored. Noble Lords have mentioned
some of them. My noble friend Lord Vallance made a particularly
powerful speech about the technologies and the potential behind them. I
would have expected the committee to spend two or three chapters on the
optimism reflected in his speech about those possibilities, rather than
one chapter.</p><p><a name="06071457000219"></a>The noble Lord,
Lord Giddens, mentioned lifestyle change, which was perhaps slightly
outside the remit of the committee. Nevertheless, the willingness of
people, given the potential, to change their lifestyle and to adapt is
worth exploring. It is cynical to say that people want to carry on
regardless. Many surveys have shown that when confronted with choices,
one of the most important things to people is their children&#146;s
future. After all, that is what people are striving for, that is what
people are educating their children for, and this is about the sort of
inheritance that people want their children to have. When confronted
with the 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_945"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 945</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>scenario that warming may produce, people would be very willing to
change their lifestyle. It is simply about having the tools to enable
them to do so.</p><p><a name="06071457000220"></a>The committee had
some strong evidence fromthe Royal Society, which outlined 12
misleading arguments that it refuted at length and in detail in its
evidence. Nevertheless, those misleading arguments have been advanced
again today. The noble Lord, Lord Sheldon, mentioned a cosier, warmer
climate; the very thing that the Royal Society refutes on page 302 of
its evidence. Paragraphs 149 to 155 of the report seem to reproduce
those misleading arguments. I wonder whether the committee had really
taken to heart the evidence given by the Royal Society, which explained
why those arguments were wrong.</p><p><a name="06071457000221"></a>However, I would not want to leave that
point without saying that the report had some particular strengths. For
example, paragraph 180 on adaptation becoming the norm of policy
thinking was very important. Paragraph 181, which talked of a carbon
tax replacing the climate change levy as the way forward, and paragraph
182, which again emphasised innovation regarding climate change, were
also important.</p><p><a name="06071457000222"></a>Before this
debate I asked myself whether at this point we would be able to ask if
the committee had moved on in its thinking from last year. A number of
speeches&#151;those of the noble Lords, Lord Layard and Lord
Vallance, in particular&#151;indicated that times had changed and
Members of the committee have said that a year has passed. We now have
the Stern review which is able to build on the committee&#146;s work.
It was not clear whether the Stern review happened because of this
report and whether the Treasury was pushed into such a review, but that
is not important.</p><p><a name="06071457000223"></a>I hope that
the Stern review will concentrate on the issue of mitigation or
adaptation. Of course it is not a choice; it is a bit like asking,
&#147;Do we need food or sleep&#148;? Clearly, we need global
mitigation action. In our reaction, that of the developed world, we
will not be the first countries to suffer catastrophic effects, but
that does not mean that in the short term we should not worry about the
catastrophic effects on others and, in the long term, the catastrophic
effects on the developing world will mean catastrophic effects on us,
as my noble friend Lord Teverson so dramatically described when he
talked about migration.</p><p><a name="06071457000224"></a>Many
noble Lords mentioned the predictions about warming as measured by the
air. The noble Earl, Lord Selborne, mentioned the work of the National
Oceanography Centre, Southampton. The Plymouth Marine Laboratory has
been carrying out some extremely interesting work regarding the deep
oceans. Even if you argue this way or that about warming in the
atmosphere, what is happening in the deep oceans should give us all
great cause for concern, because it takes far more to warm a small
amount in the deep ocean than it does in the atmosphere. The deep
oceans are a real indicator of the extent of the problem, according to
the information given to me by the laboratory.</p><p><a name="06071457000225"></a>The debate today has been extremely
illuminating. The noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, said that the report was
evidence-based and not party-political. I would 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_946"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 946</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>gently say to him that there is no excuse for the sort of
party-political propaganda in the box on page 61, which claims that the
1992 targets were achieved largely by electricity privatisation
introduced by the Conservative Government. It could equally be argued
that the targets were achieved by the &#147;dash for gas&#148;,
which depleted our gas stocks, so that we now rely increasingly on gas
from abroad, and shut down the coal industry at a time when we should
have been investing in the very clean coal technologies that would be
taking us forward now.</p><p><a name="06071457000226"></a>As my
noble friend Lord Teverson said, the reports of your Lordships&#146;
House are held in high regard. It would be unfortunate if they became
party-political or anything less than evidence-based. This House has a
reputation for an extremely high standard of report, which I for one
would be anxious for it to maintain. We can be in absolutely no doubt
about the quality of the debate today, and I very much look forward to
reading it.</p><h5><a name="06071457000539"></a>2.04
pm</h5><p><a name="06071457000227"></a><b><a name="06071457000583"></a>Lord
Dixon-Smith:</b> My Lords, I begin by expressing my
thanks to the Economic Affairs Committee for its immense amount of hard
work, under the chairmanship of my noble friend Lord Wakeham, in
producing this report. I add my thanks to my noble friend for
introducing it.</p><p><a name="06071457000228"></a>One of the great
virtues of the committee reports of this House is that they are
subsequently submitted quite literally to Peer review, which is very
much what we are indulging ourselves in today. That is rather
important. If I were to make a suggestion about the future treatment of
this report, it would be that the <I>Hansard</I> record of this debate
should be attached within the cover of its future editions. That would
be immensely worth while.</p><p><a name="06071457000229"></a>It is
now more than 12 months since the report was published and what a year
it has been. We had a major energy crisis last winter; we have seen the
price of a barrel of oil double on the world markets; and we have had
commensurately large increases in all other energy prices. We have also
seen the arrival of the European Emissions Trading Scheme, which was
supposed to put a proper cost on carbon emissions. Its failure to do so
does not reduce the significance of its arrival but it does mean that
some fairly rapid revision work needs to be done to ensure that it
becomes an effective mechanism. One effect of that failure has been
that carbon certificates have been cheap and, because of that, in last
winter&#146;s electricity generation we used more coal than we were
accustomed to do and yet again&#151;surprise, surprise&#151;our
carbon dioxide emissions have
risen.</p><p><a name="06071457000230"></a>We have another energy
review, which, rightly, keeps open all the options for energy supply in
the future. That is immensely welcome. I wish that I could feel a
little more confident about detecting within that review the urgency
for change which the situation now requires. There is talk of a White
Paper in the autumn but there is no mention of legislation, and some of
the proposals in it will be dealt with in the spending review of 2008.
That is beginning to press out the decision-making mechanism.</p><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_947"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 947</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071457000231"></a>In the mean time, energy security has
becomea much higher-profile matter for all countries,
particularly the United States. Beneficially, the relative cost of
green energy is rapidly moving in a favourable direction so that, now,
onshore wind is competitive, biofuels are likely to be competitive
within less than a decade, and so on. Twelve months ago, who would have
imagined such a script? I almost feel the ghost of Harold Macmillan
standing behind me whispering over my shoulder, &#147;Events, dear
boy, events&#148;.</p><p><a name="06071457000232"></a>The report
deals with the relationship between two highly controversial matters.
The first is global warming. One had only to listen to the
&#147;Today&#148; programme on Thursday, 6 July, when Professor
Lovelock was discussing the issue with some of his contemporaries, who
equally believe in global warming, to realise that the subject, even
for those who are totally convinced that warming is happening, is
highly controversial. That is important.</p><p><a name="06071457000233"></a>The other part of the debate is the
economic effect. The economy has been controversial throughout my whole
public life, even when we did not have this problem. With such a
recipe, and looking over a seriously long timescale such as the next
century&#151;or perhaps even longer, because the implications for
mankind go further than that&#151;it would be remarkable if strong
views were not expressed and, indeed, if there were not a strong degree
of dissension. To me, the remarkable thing is that the IPCC, which
brings together so many scientists from so many different nations, has
arrived at a consensus. But it has, and that gives particular integrity
to its recommendations.</p><p><a name="06071457000234"></a>For me,
the significance of the report is that it calls for more and better
focused research both from the IPCC and on the economic front,
particularly with the involvement of the Treasury. My noble friend Lord
Wakeham mentioned that in his introduction and the noble Lord, Lord
Macdonald of Tradeston, noted that the Stern review is going on. That
has to be welcomed.</p><p><a name="06071457000235"></a>We must also
recognise that the pool of relevant knowledge continues to expand and
to develop. I can give two examples. First, on 30 June this year an
article appeared in the American magazine <I>Science. </I>It is
surprising how much good and relevant research is done on the subject
in the United States of America when, in international circles, it has
such an impossibly bad reputation in this area. The article was
entitled &#147;Food for Thought: Lower-Than-Expected Crop Yield
Stimulation with Rising CO2 Concentrations&#148;. That
reported on the difference between experiments that were done 10 or 15
years ago and more recent experiments which have been carried out with
more appropriate technology. A significant aspect used to calculate
food production capacity in future environmental concentrations of
CO2 has been somewhat eroded. I put it no higher than that.
I have remarked before in this House that, in any event, there is
insufficient land to produce both food and energy for
mankind.</p><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_948"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 948</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071457000236"></a>The second aspect&#151;I shall not go
into any further detail&#151;is the temperature hockey stick with
which the noble Lord, Lord Rees of Ludlow, has dealt with greater
expertise and knowledge than I possibly could. It is worth noting that
the latest research report, undertaken on behalf of the United States
Congress, interestingly enough, largely vindicates the
researchers&#146; work&#151;Professor Mann et al&#146;s hockey
stick graph, first published in 1998. It
concludes:</p><ul><a name="06071457000500"></a>&#147;Based on the
analyses presented in the original papers by Mann et al. and this newer
supporting evidence, the committee finds it plausible that the Northern
Hemisphere was warmer during the last few decades of the 20th century
than during any comparable period over the preceding
millennium&#148;.</ul><a name="06071457000482"></a>That
needs to be stated. It is no criticism of the committee that it
reported as it did, because that was the state of knowledge when the
report was written. We all need to be aware that knowledge is
developing constantly and that, from time to time, some research will
prove to be uncomfortable to us all, whatever our views. That is the
nature of the difficulty that we
face.<p><a name="06071457000237"></a>We are not dealing with
one or two hockey sticks&#151;the one I have just mentioned and the
hockey stick that deals with carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere&#151;but four hockey sticks all pointing in the same
direction. The other two hockey sticks are the rapid increase in the
human population and the rapid increase in industrial and economic
growth. When four hockey sticks are all going the same way, perhaps we
need to take note.</p><p><a name="06071457000238"></a>We must take
account of and somehow explain what is already happening around the
world. Arctic temperatures are well up and Arctic ice, as has been
said, is diminishing. The Greenland ice cap is retreating. I draw
attention to a slightly different point in the Antarctic from the ice
problem: in the western Antarctic a small increase in water temperature
is putting at risk the future of krill, the basic food for so many
species of fish in that part of the world that support a large
industry.</p><p><a name="06071457000239"></a>Only
last week, the <I>Sunday Times</I> reported that the Eiger glacier is
now 140 feet lower at its top, below the north face of the Eiger, than
it was a little over 100 years ago. That is a local matter.
Kilimanjaro used to have permanent snow cap but has now almost lost it.
In my industry, the northern limits of crops such as maize, sunflower
and soya creep inexorably to higher latitudes. This is an adaptation
reality. Of course, mankind has the capacity to change what and where
we cultivate. But that raises a slightly different question: whether
the natural fauna and flora have the same flexibility. When migration
routes for birds are set over millennia of experience, when they are
dependent on particular foods being available in particular locations,
they do not have the luxury that we do. I fear is that the extinction
rate is likely to increase.</p><p><a name="06071457000240"></a>The
Association of British Insurers, which really must do a good risk
assessment, sent an interesting brief in which it projected what is
likely to happen to its industry and the volume and costs of the
economic impact of climate change. It makes the point that, if future
levels of carbon dioxide are at the lower end of the projected range,
the increase in damage might be reduced by up to 70 per cent. If ever
there was an

the sea overtops the Thames Barrier before we take action to ensure
that it cannot do so.</p><p><a name="06071457000241"></a>This is
yet another report on global warming, an issue on which we have had
some very interesting debates in this House over the last year. The
report is another in what I expect to be a succession on the subject. I
am grateful to all have who contributed to this debate and look forward
to the Minister&#146;s reply.</p><h5><a name="06071457000540"></a>2.17

Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
(Lord Rooker):</b> My Lords, we have had a
fascinating debate, but, with my time limit, I am not going to be able
to do justice to all 20 speeches. At the outset, however, I must
congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, on his maiden speech. He
came to the House with a good track record, and he has certainly shown
how seriously he takes this issue. As I was watching names being added
to the list through the week, I thought that, with all the new Peers
coming in, this would be an opportunity for lots of them to make their
maiden speeches. I was surprised that we only got one, but the speech
was incredibly valuable and I congratulate the noble Lord on it on
behalf of the House.</p><p><a name="06071457000243"></a>Before I
get into my set piece, I shall mention a couple of preliminary points
so that I do not forget them. On Stern, which I will mention, we will
have the report, and the Government will publish an energy White Paper
following on from the energy review, by the end of the year. Remarks
were also made, which I appreciate, about the setting up of the office
of climate change, which we want to be a shared resource across the
Government.</p><p><a name="06071457000244"></a>I shall not get
involved in the arguments that have gone around the House regarding the
green movement. The fact of the matter is that, when scientists are
conducting experiments to discover possible changes in the environment,
and when those studies are interfered with by those who do not want to
know what the results are so that proper results cannot be obtained,
that undermines everything else that the green movement says. If you
want to use science to discover the effects, destroying the experiments
is not a good idea.</p><p><a name="06071457000245"></a>I do not
know the reasons for the delay in the debate on the report, but I
understand that deeper waters&#151;not a good phrase&#151;have
flowed on this. There have been important developments in our
understanding of climate change in the 18 months since the Economic
Affairs Committee began its inquiry into the economics of climate
change. Significant progress has also been made in the national and
international policy framework to address the climate change threat,
and I will address some of those points.</p><p><a name="06071457000246"></a>The vast majority of scientific evidence
continues to corroborate the scientific consensus that human activities
currently represent the major influence on global climate change.
Arguments disputing the science have been found to be indefensible in
some ways and some apparent inconsistencies are still to

be greater than we previously thought. For noble Lords who want to
spend some more time on that, I assume that this book, <I>Avoiding
Dangerous Climate Change, </I>is in the Library. It
containsthe papers of the Defra-sponsored international
symposium on the stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations that
took place at the Met Office in Exeter between 1 and 3 February 2005.
It is published by Cambridge University Press and is a large and rather
heavy volume. If it is not in the Library, I will make sure that a copy
is placed there. The latest science suggests that the risks could be
greater than we previously thought.</p>

<p><a name="06071457000247"></a>There were references to increases in
temperature. Something is happening, and whatever one argues about 100
years or 30 years or whatever happened in other ages, it is a fact
that, of the hottest 10 years ever recorded, nine occurred in the past
10 years.</p><p><a name="06071457000248"></a>There was
considerable reference to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
and, by and large, there was a good degree of support, as well as some
criticism; it was also criticised in the committee&#146;s report. The
Government&#146;s view is that the IPCC has performed and continues
to perform its role in a balanced and objective manner. There is no
comparable scientific assessment process in terms of scope, depth and
international representation. The Government therefore fully support
the work of the panel and are confident that the forthcoming fourth
assessment report, which is due in 2007, will make yet another
contribution to our understanding of climate
change.</p><p><a name="06071457000249"></a>A number of
speakers&#151;I shall not mention names, as that would not be
fair&#151;queried the growth figures underpinning the IPCC&#146;s
emissions scenarios. This is a technical issue, but it is relevant to
the debate. The IPCC will be assessing the academic literature on
scenarios in its next assessment report, which is due out next year. It
will be encouraging the scientific community to do more work on
developing emissions scenarios. While the exact path of future
emissions will depend on many factors, it is clear that, without
concerted policy action, emissions will continue to rise in this
century. At current rates of growth, we are likely to see by the middle
of this century at least a doubling of concentrations relative to
pre-industrial levels. That level of climate change would have
wide-ranging impacts on societies and economies far beyond what has
been discussed today.</p><p><a name="06071457000250"></a>On the
other hand, the majority of the economic literature concludes that
stabilising concentrations of greenhouse gases at safe levels would not
involve unacceptable costs, provided that the right policies are in
place, existing technologies are developed and deployed and sufficient
time is allowed for the transition to a low-carbon economy.</p><p><a name="06071457000251"></a>Uncertainty is no excuse for inaction.
The risks that we face and the balance of costs of action and inaction
are not symmetrical. On the one side, we are faced with the risks of
large, irreversible damage costs. On the other side is the demanding
but achievable and, we believe, ultimately affordable

unavoidable levels of climate
change.</p><p><a name="06071457000252"></a>Just after the
reshuffle, I visited a Defra laboratory&#151;the Centre for
Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science, which is based in
Lowestoft, although most of its work is done around the world&#151;to
pick up on what the scientists had been doing to measure what has
happened recently in the oceans. As good, communicative scientists,
they are always trying to give examples that mean things to people,
rather than just trotting out statistics. They pointed out to me that
the data-run models over the past 30 years show that approximately
18,000 cubic kilometres of fresh water has been lost from the Arctic
Ocean&#151;that includes the whole area, not just the ice. They were
considering how to explain that to people, because it is a huge
concept. It is basicallythe equivalent of France covered in
water by up to35 metres. They said that the scientists who had
put that example together were clearly not wine fanatics but had done
so to illustrate the amount of fresh water that has come into the
oceans during the past 30 years. So movements are under way that we
must take account of.</p><p><a name="06071457000253"></a>Society
has not only a rationale but a duty to act to reduce emissions and to
adapt to unavoidable levels of climate change. Several noble Lords
mentioned adaptation versus mitigation. There is not time to go into
great detail, but the answer to the question whether adaptation to
unavoidable climate change should receive more attention as part of the
policy response is yes. The Government recognise the importance of
choosing the appropriate policy response to climate change, including
the balance of mitigation to prevent the worst risks from climate
change and adaptation to unavoidable climate change.</p><p><a name="06071457000254"></a>The UK is leading internationally in
developing a coherent and robust adaptation framework, which we hope
will set out a rational structure for the roles and activities of
different organisations. Those range from central Government down to
individual actors. It is about allowing people, as well as Governments,
the facility to see how their individual actions can make a
contribution. If the connection is not made, people will not change
their activities. They must see a connection between their lifestyle
changes and the greater good of everyone. There is no doubt that saving
energy is a major contribution to reducing climate change and we must
do more on that, as the energy review has made clear.</p><p><a name="06071457000255"></a>My background briefing notes do not make
it clear whether the Stern review was set up as a result of the
committee&#146;s report. It came just afterwards. There has been
criticism of the Treasury, which is an important engine of finance. It
is crucial that we create new markets, a new businesses and a new
energy to effect change. The Government cannot impose that; we need the
market mechanism to play a role. The Stern review was set up to give a
deeper understanding of the economics of this complex issue.</p><p><a name="06071457000256"></a>We are confident that the review, which
was launched in 2005, will provide a solid analysis of the 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_952"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 952</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>challenges around climate change and a basis for good policy-making at
national and international levels. The past 18 months have seen
unparalleled international action and agreement on climate change and
energy, especially during the UK presidencies of the European Union and
the G8. We secured several important agreements: the need for urgent
action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; the Gleneagles plan of
action; and the strengthening of the Kyoto protocol in Montreal with
the adoption of the Marrakech
accords.</p><p><a name="06071457000257"></a>Notwithstanding the two
issues that the noble Baroness raised, at the G8 summit this weekend
the Prime Minister will continue to press for urgent action and
movement on his two key priorities for climate change. They are, first,
international agreement and consensus on a long-term stabilisation goal
to limit emissions and ultimately further temperature rise and,
secondly, to start seeking agreement on a post-2012 framework that the
major players&#151;the United States, China, India and the European
Union&#151;buy into and which is underpinned by the stabilisation
goal. We are encouraging debate in various forums and forging
partnerships with key countries such as India and China.</p><p><a name="06071457000258"></a>There have been several references to
China and India, which will be the generators of a lot of emissions in
years to come. Why should they pull back from economic change? Because
of advances in technology, we have an opportunity to assist those
nations to make their economic progress not as damaging as it would
have been if we did not have those technologies. We have already
launched an initiative to create and develop near-zero emissions from
coal using carbon capture and storage technologies, which could be used
in China. There could be a demonstration by 2020. Having more
coal-fired power stations is not a disastrous scenario if we can use
that technology, which we can develop based on our own
experience.</p><p><a name="06071457000259"></a>Engaging the United
States will continue to be essential. The US is actively seeking
alternative multilateral approaches to move beyond the disagreements
over the Kyoto Protocol. That is obvious and well known. The focus on
research and development and technology alone, although essential, will
not suffice; we think that it must be coupled with an attempt to
resolve the externality of emissions that inhibit the innovation
process. We therefore think that a carbon price is important. Prices
will only be developed through scarcity, so targets have an important
role to play in driving emission reductions. We think that that is
essential to cost-effective solutions, such as the cap-and-trade
system.</p><p><a name="06071457000260"></a>There have been some
references to the EU emissions trading scheme, on whose progress after
its first year we made a Statement just a few weeks ago. Europe is a
key progressive force internationally, and the successful launch of the
trading scheme has indeed helped to drive climate change up the agenda
of business and the wider community by giving carbon emissions a
commercial value. The results of 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_953"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 953</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the first year, published in May, show that the scheme has got off to a
good start. The infrastructure is functioning well and forms a sound
basis on which to build for the future. As I said, when we made our
Statement, the scheme had only been going for a year. There is still
tweaking and other work to do.</p><p><a name="06071457000261"></a>The United Kingdom announced at the end
of June that we would build on phase 1 of the emissions trading scheme
by setting an emissions cap for phase 2 of 238 million allowances,
which represents a saving of 8 million tonnes of carbon each year. The
United Kingdom is urging the Commission to improve the enforcement of
tough caps and the priorities forthe review of the scheme
post-phase 2, announced in the energy review earlier this week, show
our clear commitment to making the scheme
work.</p><p><a name="06071457000262"></a>On domestic action, it is
pointed out, fairly, that we are responsible for only 2 per cent of the
world&#146;s emissions, but the fact is that we started the
industrial revolution and perhaps in a way started pollution in this
phase of the world&#146;s history. However, that means that we have
experience to work from. We have technology and wherewithal that we can
use for the advantage of everyone else&#151;and for our own economic
advantage, if we are clever about it.</p><p><a name="06071457000263"></a>We have to do things internationally. Our
credibility will rely on what we are doing on the home front. We have
to lead in creating a low-carbon economy. If we can do that, we are
more likely to be listened to on the international front. We do not
think that this will be at the expense of our economic and social
objectives. If the challenge of climate change is to be met, all parts
of British society will have to play their part. If we get the message
and see the role that we can play, the small changes in behaviour that
we make as individuals&#151;whether that is switching off electrical
appliances rather than leaving them on standby, as was discussed
earlier this week, or making the right choice of those appliances in
the first place&#151;can make a tremendous difference to energy use
in this country. We have to set ambitious long-term goals, though, and
the Government can therefore play a critical role in enabling a
low-carbon economy.</p><p><a name="06071457000264"></a>The energy
review that we published earlier this week contains ambitious proposals
for getting us on course to achieving real progress in emission
reductions by 2020 and remaining on the right path to achieving our
domestic goal of a 60 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions by
2050. Overall, the package of measures in the energy review could
deliver between 19 million and 25 million tonnes of carbon savings by
2020. These would be achieved through several levers, including new
measures for the transport sector, which are long overdue; the removal
of barriers to distributed generation and new nuclear; measures to
support renewable electricity; and a big push on energy efficiency. All
those have a roleto
play.</p><p><a name="06071457000265"></a>I know that your
Lordships&#146; House will come back to this issue and probably spend
more time on it than the other place will. With the range of expertise
in this House, this is an ideal place for a mature and considered
debate on climate change. The next years 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_954"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 954</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will be crucial in defining the response of the economy and society to
changes in climate in our country and the rest of the globe. The
Government have already contributed to shaping the European and
international agendas on climate change, including multilateral
agreements, emissions trading and initiatives on energy efficiency. We
must push on faster and further and it is essential that we continue
this momentum to encourage global action on climate change. Without
that, we are in real trouble.</p><p><a name="06071457000266"></a>I
would not want to give a view that had not been expressed in your
Lordships&#146; House, but two or three speeches seemed to suggest
that we might have to give up the ghost and make hay while the sun
shines. Well, we want the sun to carry on shining; we want to carry on
making hay; and we want to have progress. But that will mean concerted
action and going with the science, taking some bold decisions on
changes in society and our economy&#151;there is no question about
that&#151;and not believing that the Government can do it all. It is
Parliament&#146;s job to get the message across to individuals and
businesses on how they can play their role. If individuals can see how
playing a role is important, they will do it and will end up doing the
job for us all, because we are all in this
together.</p><h5><a name="06071457000541"></a>2.37

Persons (Independent Living) Bill
[HL]</h3><h5><a name="06071457000542"></a>2.39
pm</h5><p><a name="06071457000271"></a><b><a name="06071457000586"></a>Lord
Ashley of Stoke:</b> My Lords, I beg to move that
this Bill be now read a second time. Its purpose is literally to
transform the lives of Britain&#146;s 11 million disabled people from
those of frustration to those of 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_955"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 955</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>fulfilment. By providing a legislative framework for rights to
independent living, it is both an idealistic and a practical
proposition. I have worked closely with the Disability Rights
Commission, which is splendidly led by Bert Massie, and with Caroline
Ellis and her colleagues. They have worked extraordinarily hard to make
the Bill a success. I warmly appreciate their wise counsel and
assistance. I am also delighted with the excellent report from the
Prime Minister&#146;s Strategy Unit, <I>Improving the Life Chances of
Disabled People</I>, and its support for independent living. This gives
the Government a fine opportunity to implement many of its
recommendations, strongly commended by the Prime
Minister.</p><p><a name="06071457000272"></a>Disabled people
historically have been regarded as second-class or even third-class
citizens. As the Prime Minister has said, one in five British adults is
disabled and they can find themselves cut off from the opportunities
others enjoy. Disabled people are more likely to live in poverty, to
have fewer educational opportunities and to experience prejudice and
abuse. Most have low expectations. Only 50 per cent of disabled people
of working age are in employment compared with 80 per cent of the
non-disabled. That one-fifth of our population is, incredibly, an
underclass. We need to elevate our objective from providing subsistence
to comprehensive rights of equality and
independence.</p><p><a name="06071457000273"></a>Support for
disabled people is fragmented, resulting in confusion and stress.
Deserving people are being denied proper support. In fact, 70 per cent
of our councils now offer services only to people whose needs are
judged substantial or critical, so that the social security net is full
of holes and those who should be included are inevitably excluded. The
rights they have are strictly limited. Rights to services mainly mean
help with being washed and fed rather than comprehensive rights which
enable independence. For example, there are no positive rights in
existing legislation to enable disabled people to choose where they
live and no legal protection against them being forced to live in
institutional care against their wishes, which is scandalous. There is
no legal entitlement to advocacy except in limited circumstances, nor
to communication support, both of which are crucial. There are no
rights of support to cover a disabled person who moves to a different
part of the country. They have to start all over again and negotiate a
new care package from scratch. Think of all the stress and frustration
involved. People with mental health problems have no right to
assessment or support for their mental health needs. The notorious
postcode lottery blights provision of services all over the country. It
is luck rather than judgment as to who actually gets what. Fancy that,
in the year 2006. It is a question of pure luck.</p><p><a name="06071457000274"></a>Advances made over the past few years
with legislation have been helpful, but limited and piecemeal. It is
now time to dispense with this <I>ad hoc</I> approach and adopt a
master plan which guarantees&#151;yes, guarantees&#151;genuine
independent living for disabled people, and we should underpin civil
rights with entitlements to practical support. Disabled people have as
strong a claim to a normal 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_956"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 956</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>life as anyone else, and this Bill seeks to provide basic rights which
have long eluded them. It seeks a change in attitude, in culture, in
practice and in the law. The key objective is that disabled people of
all ages should have the same freedoms, choice, dignity and control as
all other citizens at home, at work and in the community. This means
that they must be provided with practical assistance and support to
participate in society and to live an ordinary life. That is not a lot
to ask, but it is absolutely
crucial.</p><p><a name="06071457000275"></a>The basic premise for
action, confirmed by members of the Independent Living Movement, is
that disabled people need two vital things: personal assistance and
accessibility. The stark alternatives are to be a burden on their
families or live in an institution. If we are serious about enabling
independent living, we simply have to provide those vital necessities.
Under the Bill the Secretary of State will be required to draw up a
strategic plan for independent living, and to promote and pursue it.
Each local authority and National Health Service body will have to do
likewise. The local authority will be required to compile a record of
all disabled people in its area so that we know exactly who is
disabled, what their disabilities are and where they live.</p><p><a name="06071457000276"></a>The Bill will place a duty on local
authorities and National Health Service bodies to co-operate between
themselves and key partners to provide the means of independent living.
It will require them to pool funds wherever necessary to deliver the
duties in the Bill. This will avoid the multiple assessments, delays
and fragmentation that occur at present. There are significant economic
benefits to be gained from
this.</p><p><a name="06071457000277"></a>The Bill provides a clear
right to a comprehensive assessment of disabled people&#146;s
requirements for assistance and support. This right to a
self-assessment of their requirements is an absolutely crucial part of
the Bill and will ensure that any support given to disabled people is
what they want, rather than their having to wait for the local
authority to give them what it thinks they ought to have. So far,
disabled people have been expected to fit into services, but the Bill
provides that services should be personalised after assessment and
therefore suit the person. It also provides that disabled people should
be empowered to determine where they live and who they live
with&#151;another crucial point. This ensures that no one can be
obliged to live in an institution against their will. If and when the
Bill becomes an Act, it will be unlawful to force anyone into an
institution against their
will.</p><p><a name="06071457000278"></a>The authorities will have
to identify all the disabled people in their area and maintain a
register. They will have to provide a wide range of assistance, such as
communication aids and other forms of helpful equipment and technology,
independent advocacy and practical assistance in the home and
elsewhere.</p><p><a name="06071457000279"></a>There will be a new
system of individualised budgets. The present range of different
funding streams to help with personal care, support, equipment and
adaptations will be brought together. Disabled people will be able to
use their individual budgets, in the form of cash or services or a
mixture 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_957"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 957</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of both, to spend as they wish on housing, equipment, personal
assistance, transport or whatever they desire.</p><p><a name="06071457000280"></a>A crucial part of the Bill is that
regulations will be made specifying minimum outcomes. This is designed
to prevent any authority wriggling out of its responsibilities. The
minimum outcome is a crucial part of the Bill and regulations will be
made so that there is no doubt where the responsibility
lies.</p><p><a name="06071457000281"></a>Of course, these changes
will have to be paid for. On the other hand, we should not lose sight
of the very important economic benefits of investing in independent
living. As people become independent and return to work, they will be
earning from employment and, as they pay taxes, there will be savings
on the social security budget. There will also be a reduction in the
demand for health and social services as people become active and get
back to work, so there will be a transformation in people&#146;s
attitudes towards the costs.</p><p><a name="06071457000282"></a>The
Bill creates a disability housing service. Each local authority will
have to compile a list of accessible properties and a record of
disabled people requiring such properties, and then provide a matching
service. The terrible shortfall of accessible housing will no longer be
a bugbear because people will be able to be fitted to properties
through this matching service. All new dwellings of whatever type will
have to meet minimum standards of access. This will result in a huge
cost-saving for local authorities by avoiding the heavy costs of later
adaptations.</p><p><a name="06071457000283"></a>Together, these
reforms will dramatically enhance the life chances of disabled people
and their families and reduce waste and inefficiency. The Bill will
also promote opportunities for carers to create a truly sustainable
approach for independent living.</p><p><a name="06071457000284"></a>I hope that today I have planted a seed
in Parliament that will be transformed into a mighty piece of
legislation, giving to Britain&#146;s disabled people the freedom and
independence they cherish and which they have been denied for too long.
The Bill is a blueprint for the future, but the time to embrace it is
now. In the long, slow march of disabled people to freedom and
independence, they have made limited progress. They desperately need a
drastic change in tempo if they are to approach their ultimate
objective. This Bill is the key that opens the way for them to
equality, independence, freedom and dignity. It is a great vision. Let
us make it a reality.</p><p><a name="06071457000285"></a>Moved,
That the Bill be now read a second time.&#151;(<I>Lord Ashley of
Stoke.</I>)</p><h5><a name="06071457000543"></a>2.50
pm</h5><p><a name="06071457000286"></a><b><a name="06071457000587"></a>Lord
Clement-Jones:</b> My Lords, it is a great pleasure
and privilege to follow the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, in speaking on the
Bill. I preface my remarks by saying what a visionary and important
Bill it is. As in previous years, he is leading where others, and I
hope the Government, will surely follow. I want to explain briefly why
I believe that this is such an important Bill.</p><p><a name="06071457000287"></a>First, I declare an interest. I am the
chairman of trustees of an education charity for profoundly 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_958"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 958</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>autistic children which runs a school in Haringey. That will form the
core of my remarks today. I am also the vice-chairman of the All-Party
Group on Autism, which the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, addressed on
Wednesday. I did not realise at the time that he was putting forward
his Bill today, but I was so impressed by what he had to say, as was
the audience, that I felt compelled to come along to express my support
for it.</p><p><a name="06071457000288"></a>The Bill is so important
for our children at the school because currently we have about 40
children in its primary-school element; gradually, however, we are
filling up a secondary school, which will be equivalent in number. We
have 10 secondary schoolchildren; over time, as we build new facilities
with the help of Futurebuilders and many major donors, which we hope
will be completed in 2008, we will have a school of 80 profoundly
autistic children&#151;40 in the secondary school and 40 in the
primary school.</p><p><a name="06071457000289"></a>One of the big
challenges for us as those children enter the secondary school is the
curriculum. What are we teaching them? Essentially, in the years as
they move towards adulthood, we will be teaching them life
schools&#151;the skills which will enable them to live independently,
as far as possible, in the community. We are developing a curriculum
suitable for their needs, but life skills and independent living are
crucial. That is our challenge and it is faced by huge and growing
numbers of children across the
country.</p><p><a name="06071457000290"></a>In her study, reported
in the <I>Lancet, </I>Professor Gillian Baird of Guy&#146;s and St
Thomas&#146; NHS Foundation Trust confirmed what we have long
suspected. The incidence of children with conditions on the autistic
spectrum are very high&#151;one in 100. That means that in the future
we will be facing large numbers of adults who are on that spectrum.
Diagnosis is better and I suspect that there are also environmental
reasons. But at the moment, large numbers of adults are hidden. They
are not being diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorders, but that will
not be the case in the future. We must make sure that those children
are able to make the transition from childhood to adulthood and that
they are properly assessed so that they can live, as far as possible,
independently in the community. That is where the Bill is so important.
That is the essence of my strong support for the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06071457000291"></a>Currently, under
legislation, there is a real concern for children. It is likened by
some voluntary organisations in the sector to falling off a
cliff&#151;when children start reaching adulthood, their supportive
or structured school environment is followed by a complete absence of
services and support. That is deeply worrying for many of these
children, who rely on routine in such an important fashion. Under
current education legislation&#151;the Education Act 1996,
as amended by the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act
2001&#151;LEAs already have a statutory duty to make and implement a
transition plan from the age of 14 for disabled young people. As a
result, several agencies should be involved in a young person&#146;s
transition to adult services, but too often the parent must act as the
central point of 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_959"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 959</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>contact between the LEA, the primary care trusts, social services and
Connexions. The recent <I>make school make sense</I> report by the NAS
reveals rather shockingly that adult social services are involved in
transition planning in only 17 per cent of cases.That points
up the inadequacy of the current
arrangements.</p><p><a name="06071457000292"></a>The oldest
children at TreeHouse will shortly need transition planning to begin,
so that concentrates our minds in a major way. We must ensure that
every LEA is committed to effective planning and that all the other
agencies get involved early, so that adult services that meet each
young person&#146;s needs can be arranged. That is why the clause on
co-operation between local authorities and NHS bodies is so absolutely
crucial. The Bill takes the whole of that process a stage further and
would have a major effect on planning for that
transition.</p><p><a name="06071457000293"></a>Generally, I am
wholly supportive of the Bill. I have only one concern, about
individual budgets. I hope that these proposals are taken forward
giving the option of individual budgets. In many ways, in many areas,
that would be welcomed by disabled adults. But there are parents who
will be concerned if they have to manage individual children&#146;s
budgets; that is one option given in the Bill. I am sure that the noble
Lord would accept that some parents would prefer the agencies to manage
those budgets for themselves. It is important, too, that individual
budgets do not replace direct service provision by public agencies. Of
course, that will continue. Not all parents will want to manage the
budget for their child&#146;s services, and support services need to
be in place to ensure that it is not only those parents with high
levels of financial skill and expertise who can benefit from individual
budgets. However, that is a very small point that I am sure the noble
Lord is aware of, and I strongly and warmly commend and support the
Bill.</p><h5><a name="06071457000544"></a>2.58

your Lordships' House for the very warm welcome that I have received
and noble Lords for their kind words of wisdom and advice since my
introduction. I also thank all the staff of the House for their
kindness in helping me move around the House. I have no sense of

useful.</p><p><a name="06071457000295"></a>I pay tribute to the
noble Lord, Lord Janner of Braunstone, who was Member of Parliament for
the constituency of Leicester West, when I was growing up. It is from
him and his dedication to his constituents that as a child I was
inspired to understand the real value of freedom, democracy, pride in
one&#146;s country and social justice. It is a great privilege to
have this peerage bestowed on me and to seek to contribute to the
proceedings of your Lordships&#146; House alongside the vast
experience and knowledge of other noble Lords. I pray that, with your
Lordships' support and guidance, I can play a small part.</p><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_960"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 960</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071457000296"></a>The Bill raises some very important points
and I welcome the opportunity for debate that it allows. Before
continuing, however, I declare an interest as an independent sector
provider of care to help support independent living.</p><p><a name="06071457000297"></a>Care provision for those experiencing
disability at birth or from illness or age-related processes,
regardless of whether the disability is physical, mental or emotional,
deserves much greater support and investment. I am very pleased to see
that my party leader, David Cameron, has placed great emphasis on
looking at issues of care provision. Provision is currently fragmented:
care levels can vary between different authorities, the systems are
often very complicated and bureaucratic, and duplication in some
services can lead to great confusion about who is in charge of specific
services. The sector is very much the poor relative of the health
service and responsibilities are often divided among many
partners&#151;the health service, social services and the independent
providers, all of whom have budgets which leave them strapped for
resources and who most likely cannot provide the levels of care and
support that many of us who are able bodied so readily enjoy.</p><p><a name="06071457000298"></a>The Bill raises a debate on life choices
and opportunities, about access to services that enable people to live
as independent and full a life as possible. However, I believe that the
debate should also include the contribution made by non-paid and paid
carers who are often the most important factor in the service package
provided to support independent living.</p><p><a name="06071457000299"></a>Life expectancy has greatly increased
because of medical achievements. As it continues to increase, ever
greater numbers of people will suffer age-related disability. I do not
think that the resulting strains on services have been factored into
the forecasts for care level requirements. Huge shortages of
professionals already exist, including occupational therapists,
district nurses, properly trained social services staff and carers.
With the additional factor of people&#146;s desire to remain
independent but with support in their homes, it is easy to see how many
will find themselves failing to access services that should allow such
arrangements to be a right and not just an aspiration.</p><p><a name="06071457000300"></a>I return to the role of
carers, both paid and non-paid. Carers save the state huge sums by
providing the support and the care that big institutions often cannot
provide. Yet, time and again, people are failed by the systems under
which they live. Respite care is often a lifeline for these families
but is so difficult to access. It is valiant of political thinkers to
try to evaluate the value of care support, but such evaluations are
valueless if they do not include the offset in real value that carers
bring by supporting disabled people&#146;s desire for independent
living.</p><p><a name="06071457000301"></a>I could offer noble
Lords several examples from the care that I provide but I shall provide
only two. The first concerns a rather tall lady with a wheelchair that
is totally and utterly unsuitable for her body length. Her feet drag if
the wheelchair is pushed. She is therefore confined to her house and
completely 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_961"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 961</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>limited regarding activity outside it. She has been waiting months for
someone to come and assess her for a new wheelchair. The saddest part
is that her situation was poorly assessed initially; she certainly has
not grown several inches in height during or after assessment. So, her
only contact with the outside world consists of my two carers who
attend her basic needs three times a day. There are many such tales.
Our discussion on the Bill will highlight the failings that we need to
address before we can find new and better solutions to support people
with independent living.</p><p><a name="06071457000302"></a>In
conclusion, I thank noble Lords for giving me the opportunity to speak
in this debate. Many of the issues will be debated further and I should
like to contribute to that debate. This area of concern is very close
to my heart. Day in day out I try to enable people to lead as
independent a life as possible and I know the difficulties that they
and their families face trying to access the means to help them to do
so.</p><h5><a name="06071457000545"></a>3.05

Masham of Ilton:</b> My Lords, it is a pleasure and
an honour for me to congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, on her
moving maiden speech. The noble Baroness is a campaigner for the rights
of disabled and vulnerable people and on women&#146;s matters. She is
an important addition to your Lordships&#146; House. She comes from
Leicester. I am sure that as a Member of your Lordships&#146; House,
and with her campaigning spirit, she will help to solve many
problems.</p><p><a name="06071457000304"></a>I thank the noble
Lord, Lord Ashley of Stoke, for initiating the Disabled Persons
(Independent Living) Bill in your Lordships&#146; House. I have the
greatest admiration for the noble Lord, who with the noble Lord, Lord
Morris of Manchester, has campaigned for years in both Houses of
Parliament on behalf of disabled people. Other long-term supporters are
also speaking in the debate. It is so good that the noble Baroness,
Lady Royall of Blaisdon, will reply to the debate as she also
understands the problems of
disability.</p><p><a name="06071457000305"></a>I declare an
interest as president and founder of the Spinal Injuries Association
and as a paraplegic. As with all voluntary self-help organisations, we
devote a great deal of energy to raise funds to survive. We have some
wonderful supporters. Our aim is to help support our members who are
paralysed through spinal injury from the neck or back down. We are a
support organisation for members, their families and friends. We
encourage people to pick up their lives after devastation. Our first
publication was a book entitled, <I>So you are paralysed</I>, which
sought to encourage independent living and to show that even though you
are paralysed, life goes on, and with adaptations it is a new
beginning.</p><p><a name="06071457000306"></a>I founded the SIA
because when I left hospital in 1959 after breaking my back I found no
support group for people severely disabled through spinal injury who
have the special problems of the three Bs: bowels, bladders and bed
sores. There was little information on daily living needs such as
design of suitable housing, lightweight wheelchairs, suitable

With legislation over the years we have progressed a long way, but not
far enough. That is why this Bill is
necessary.</p><p><a name="06071457000307"></a>Severe disability
covers a multitude of varied and complex conditions, both physical and
mental. This Bill sets goals to be aimed at, but I can see that there
are many mountains to climb. Severely disabled people cannot climb, so
they have to have help from society to enable them to reach their
potential in daily living.</p><p><a name="06071457000308"></a>Many
organisations for disabled people, special groups representing serious
illness such as cancer, spinal injury and motor neurone disease, and
hundreds of organisations support this Bill. Only this week, I heard of
two societies that I had not heard of before. One is the Scleroderma
Society. It is for a condition where the skin goes like leather and the
immune system packs up. It is very dangerous if it attacks the internal
organs, and the cause is unknown. The other is the society for
Epidermolysis Bullosa, which is a rare genetic condition. Those orphan
conditions need support, help and research.</p><p><a name="06071457000309"></a>There is concern that dermatology wards
have closed and the number of beds has been reduced. All specialised
conditions, and there are many of them, need specialised medical and
nursing support, without which independent living cannot proceed and
prosper. Independent living means ensuring that disabled people of all
ages have the same freedom, choice, dignity and control as other
citizens, at home, at work, and in the community. It does not mean
living by yourself or fending for yourself. It means having rights to
practical assistance and the support to participate in society and live
an ordinary life.</p><p><a name="06071457000310"></a>The existing
statutory rights and entitlements in relation to social services are
not delivering the means for independent living. In some cases, they
act in complete contradiction and are subject to financial restrictions
and draconian means testing. The assumptions that underpin their design
anddelivery focus on managing vulnerability, risk and
dependency, rather than supporting choice, control and
participation.</p><p><a name="06071457000311"></a>On Clause 3,
which contains the definition of &#147;independent living&#148;,
the Guide Dogs for theBlind Association believes that the
definition of &#147;independent living&#148; could be strengthened
by a reference to &#147;independent functioning&#148; as a
desirable outcome for disabled people. It would welcome the inclusion
of a specific reference to rehabilitation in the Bill. It could provide
a definition that puts the restoration of independent functioning at
the heart of the service. Does the noble Lord, Lord Ashley,
agree?</p><p><a name="06071457000312"></a>Macmillan Cancer Support
welcomes the Bill&#146;s commitment to effective, supportive
palliative care provision. One of the main complaints of cancer
patients is that they feel abandoned by the system on leaving hospital.
The Bill would ensure that National Health Service bodies and local
authorities worked in a joined-up way to provide a holistic approach to
supporting cancer patients throughout their cancer journey.</p><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_963"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 963</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071457000313"></a>The Bill would give an explicit right to
all disabled people to decide where they live and die; one has to say
when possible, as sometimes circumstances beyond the control of carers
do not allow that to happen.</p><p><a name="06071457000314"></a>The Spinal Injuries Association welcomes
the idea of pooled funding. Disabled people are often caught between
two agencies that both say that it is the responsibility of the other
agency to fund the service that is being asked for. SIA often finds
that many people have a problem when it comes to being discharged from
hospital. A newly-injured person can need a great deal of support when
leaving hospital, and the assessment process is tackled in the Bill.
Get the assessment right and the person can get on with his or her
life; get it wrong and it can be miserable for that person.</p><p><a name="06071457000315"></a>One of the biggest problems that causes
bed blocking in spinal cord injury centres is a lack of appropriate
housing. There should be adequate housing so that when someone becomes
disabled they are not forced to stay in hospital or forced into a
residential care home until a house becomes vacant. There should be
more suitable housing across the country.</p><p><a name="06071457000316"></a>The Bill would also bring about an end to
the unfair postcode lottery that exists around the country regarding
the Wheelchair Service. The noble Lord, Lord Warner, knows only too
well that this is happening&#151;and that was explained so well by
our maiden speaker. The Wheelchair Service for severely disabled people
is vital for their daily living. This is so important that it cannot
wait for this Bill to become law. An overhaul should take place now so
that those people who have to stay in bed can get a suitable chair and
move about their house and get into the
community.</p><p><a name="06071457000317"></a>A devastating
disorder is motor neurone disease, MND. It progressively attacks the
body, removing the ability to walk, talk or feed oneself. But the
intellect and senses usually remain unaffected. Respiratory, muscular
weakness attacks most people with MND as their disease progresses.
Non-invasive ventilation can give support. It is provided through
specialist respiratory centres. The Motor Neurone Disease Association
believes that more people with MND must have access to home ventilatory
support services that adequately support their needs. This will enable
people with MND to live in their own homes longer with a greater degree
of independence and a higher quality of life. We are far behind Japan
with this key service.</p><p><a name="06071457000318"></a>The Bill
includes people with a mentalhealth problem. As a member of
the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Prison Health, I cannot end
without saying that, despite all the health problems in prisons, such
as drug abuse, hepatitis C, HIV and alcohol disease, mental illness is
of the greatest concern. Links between prison mental health services
and those outside must undergo rapid and radical improvement. If not,
there will be more disasters and we have had enough.</p><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_964"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 964</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071457000319"></a>This Bill poses a huge challenge.

that this country will rally and give disabled people a chance to
succeed in independent living. I have given only a few examples of the
needs of some disabilities. There are thousands more. I wish the Bill

congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Ashley of Stoke, on his vision and
tenacity in introducing this Bill, which I greatly welcome. The
Disability Rights Commission is particularly to be congratulated on all
its work in the preparation of the Bill, and when&#151;not

both the noble Lord and the DRC. I also congratulate the noble
Baroness, Lady Verma, on her interesting maiden
speech.</p><p><a name="06071457000321"></a>The hopes of all
disabled people, especially those involved in the independent living
movement rest on this Bill and they give it their strongest support.
They do so because it is they&#151;disabled people with high support
needs&#151;who know only too starkly, day by day, the yawning gap
that lies between the current rhetoric of the policy on independent
living and the daily reality of their lives. As the DRC points out, far
from being given dignity, choice and control over their lives, the
current entitlement of severely disabled people to social care amounts
to little more than being washed and
fed.</p>

<p><a name="06071457000322"></a>When I first became
disabled in the mid-1960s, the only prospects for people who needed
help with their personal care were to be looked after by their
families, to marry their nurse, or to end up in residential care.
Happily, since that time, the Independent Living Movement has been
developing and growing in influence. Its driving force is severely
disabled peoples&#146; desire to have choice and control over their
lives so that they can live the lives that they
want.</p><p><a name="06071457000323"></a>Throughout the years,
various individuals and groups have used their ingenuity to find
solutions so that they can live ordinary lives in the community. I
refer to pioneers such as Ken and Maggie Davies, both tetraplegic, who
developed the Grove Road Housing Scheme, whereby non-disabled tenants
were given housing in return for providing personal care. Ken and
Maggie then went on to establish Derbyshire's Centre for Independent
Living. John Evans, Philip Scott and the late Liz Briggs managed to
persuade Le Court Cheshire Home to let them use the funding for their
residential care to hire their own personal care assistants so that
they could move out of care and into their own homes. That group
started the Hampshire Centre for Independent Living. From those early
beginnings in the 1970s, today's direct payments scheme was
born.</p><p><a name="06071457000324"></a>Over the years,
Governments have recognisedthe glaring good sense and justice
of what the Independent Living Movement was calling for and have
adopted much of its rhetoric of choiceand control. But the
legislation lags far behind, and today's social care structures
lamentably fail to provide the necessary framework for independent
living. In fact, as the DRC points out, the existing statutory rights
and entitlements in relation to social 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_965"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 965</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>care often act in complete contradiction to delivering the means to
independent living.</p><p><a name="06071457000325"></a>That is why
the Bill is so crucial. It will amend current community care
legislation so that it can begin to meet the demands of government
policy on independent living, user choice and of people taking control
of their own health and well-being. I am sorry for the clich&#233;
but it will make it fit for purpose, which is far from the case
now.</p><p><a name="06071457000326"></a>As a briefing from the
Guide Dogs for the Blind Association points out, 70 per cent of
councils now offer services only to people whose needs are judged as
critical or substantial, using the criteria set out in Fair Access to
Care Services. Most visually impaired people are not judged to have
this level of need so are left in circumstances which diminish their
dignity and quality of life. What is more, it is estimated that in the
coming year eight out of 10 councils will tighten their eligibility
criteria further, meaning cuts to support services for many blind and
partially sighted people.</p><p><a name="06071457000327"></a>The
Bill is wide-ranging and I particularly welcome Clause 3, which reforms
the definition of disabled people, as was recommended in the Prime
Minster's Strategy Unit report, <I>Improving the Life Chances of
Disabled People</I>. The current definition used for community care
legislation is still based on the outdated terminology of the National
Assistance Act 1948, which excludes many older people and
people who need support because they are
ill.</p><p><a name="06071457000328"></a>I also welcome the emphasis
in Part 2 on the duty of local authorities and NHS bodies to
co-operateto promote independent living, especially the
requirement that they pool funds wherever necessary to deliver the
duties in the Bill. Particularly welcome is the requirement for local
authorities and NHS bodies to build capacity and support the long-term
sustainability of user-led organisations at grass-roots level,
including centres for independent living. I declare an interest as
co-vice chair of HAFAD,my local disabled people's
organisation. These organisations provide not only essential services,
such as personal assistance advice and support and benefits advice and
advocacy, but a place where disabled people can test out their ability
to return to the employment market. Most importantly, they provide peer
encouragement, confidence and
support.</p><p><a name="06071457000329"></a>One of the most
important elements of the Billis the provision of one single,
self-directed and comprehensive assessment of an individual's needs for
practical assistance and support. This will end the bureaucratic
nightmare of multiple assessments which many disabled people have to
endure, and which are not only stressful but an appalling waste of
resources. As the DRC points
out:</p><ul><a name="06071457000501"></a>&#147;To get support,
whether in education or to improve their homes, disabled people face
more bureaucracy than an average small
business&#148;.</ul><a name="06071457000483"></a>Two more
provisions that I would highlight are the right to advocacy and the
right to portable support, so that disabled people are not trapped in
one locality because of the impossibility of transferring their care
package. <p><a name="06071457000330"></a>However, I want to
concentrate on the housing provisions in the Bill. It is essential that
the 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_966"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 966</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government are persuaded that they must act to address the housing
crisis for disabled people and those with long-term health conditions.
Unless they do so, all the other attempts to ensure that disabled
people become equal citizens by 2025 will be in vain. With an ageing
population the situation can only get worse.</p><p><a name="06071457000331"></a>There is a housing crisis and one to
which we have become shamefully inured. Approximately half of all
disabled children live in unsuitable housing and 70 per cent of
families with a disabled child say that their houses are
unsatisfactory. According to the 2003-04 survey of English housing,
there are 329,000 people with a medical condition or disability living
in housing that is unsuitable for their needs. That does not mean some
slight inconvenience. It means that someone has to be carried up and
down stairs each time they need to use the bathroom or that they have
had to take over the family sitting room for a bedroom, with all the
indignity of constantly having to ask for the commode to be emptied. It
means elderly people never moving from their four walls for months on
end because there is a flight of stairs outside the front door. It can
also mean disabled people living in such a restricted space that their
personal assistant has to share the bedroom with them. In my own
borough one lady&#146;s PA had to sleep on the living-room floor,
which is hardly conducive to a satisfactory caring
relationship.</p><p><a name="06071457000332"></a>To my mind, the
provision of accessible housing is the most essential building block in
the framework of independent living and in giving people choice and
control over their lives. Yet the Government continue to allow the
building industry to regard it as a voluntary matter. We will be stuck
with the inadequacies of the current housing stock for decades to come,
so if we are to have any hope of alleviating the housing crisis for
disabled people, the Government have to take firm action. The London
Plan puts a demand on developers and builders that all new housing, of
whatever tenure, be built to lifetime home standards and that 10 per
cent be built to the higher wheelchair standard. Builders and
developers do not like it, but it is fair and they are all in the same
boat. They know that that is the price of doing business in London. As
far as I can see, it does not seem to have deterred them.</p><p><a name="06071457000333"></a>However, in a Written Answer to me on 21
June this year, the Department for Communities and Local Government
stated that it had no plans to adopt a similar clear lead for the
building industry nationally. Instead the Government are relying on the
voluntary provision in the new code for sustainable housing to persuade
the private sector, which accounts for 90 per cent of all new housing
each year, to build new houses to lifetime home standards. What is
more, while they may pride themselves on having incorporated lifetime
home standards into Part M of the building regulations, the standard is
a non-mandatory part of the new code for sustainable housing, so it may
not even be applied within publicly funded housing. To date, the
housing market has lamentably failed to provide for our long-term needs
as frail human beings. What hope is there that it might have the
inclination to do so now?</p><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_967"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 967</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071457000334"></a>For those reasons I wholeheartedly support
Part 4. Clause 31 would require all local authorities to operate a
disability housing service so that our scarce current resource of
accessible and adaptable housing was used to its best advantage. That
would help to ensure that local authorities match the needs of disabled
people to the housing stock that might meet those needs and end the
current waste. At the moment, many adapted properties are let to
non-disabled people, as housing departments strive to meet the targets
for void turnaround times. An analysis of lettings in the social
housing sector over the past five years by CORE&#151;that is a system
developed by the Housing Corporation and the National Housing
Federation&#151;found that on average only one in six
wheelchair-standard dwellings were let to a household containing a
wheelchair user, despite the overwhelming
demand.</p><p><a name="06071457000335"></a>Clause 32 would require
local authorities to have regard to the housing needs of disabled
people when conducting their housing strategies. Together with Clause
31, this will build a more accurate picture of the extent of disabled
people&#146;s housing need. Clause 33 would require the Government to
ensure that building regulations, which govern the design of all new
housing, produced housing easily adaptable to the widest range of
people, so that it meets both their current and any future
needs.</p><p><a name="06071457000336"></a>The lifetime home
standard is our current blueprint for this. Its mandatory enforcement
is essential to begin to meet so many of the Government&#146;s
policies. Not only would it save money on disabled grant facilities
expenditure, it would reduce avoidable admissions to health or social
care and radically reduce delayed discharges. Research from Northern
Ireland, where the lifetime homes standard is mandatory for all
publicly funded housing, has found that adopting the standard has
significantly reduced the incidence of falls in the home, which
currently costs the nation &#163;130 million a year. Clause 34 would
help ensure that the building regulations were effectively enforced,
and academic research has found that Part M&#151;the access
requirements building regulations&#151;is regarded as half-hearted
and poorly interpreted by builders.</p><p><a name="06071457000337"></a>Finally, Clause 35 would ensure that
accessible housing was incorporated at the planning stage, and further
developed at the later building control stage, of all new housing
developments. Taken together, these measures to improve access to
housing for disabled people will not only begin to address the
Government&#146;s political rhetoric, which stresses the importance
of developing an inclusive society, but help to meet the
Government&#146;s wider policy objectives of better health and
employment opportunities, reduced admission to health and social care
settings, and the promotion of independence.</p><p><a name="06071457000338"></a>I sincerely hope that the Government will
give the provisions of the Bill their fullest support. Indeed, I fail
to see how the Government hope to fulfil their policies of social
justice, and their vision of disabled people living as equal citizens
by 2025, without it.</p><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_968"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 968</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="06071457000547"></a>3.32

Darcy de Knayth:</b> My Lords, I give my warm support
for this hugely welcome and much-needed Bill, so clearly and
comprehensively described by the noble Lord, Lord Ashley of Stoke, and
so cogently argued for by other noble Lords, from different sides, with
a wealth of experience. This is not a very wheelchair-friendly
microphone; the other one used to be more
moveable.</p><p><a name="06071457000340"></a>I must declare a close
interest, in that I have for the past four years needed increasing
amounts of help with personal care: washing, dressing and getting out
of, and now getting into, bed. I am in receipt of a higher rate of
disability allowance, which in no way covers all the costs. I do not
qualify for any further financial help. I add this only to make it
clear that this is not a personal moan, but one on behalf of all those
who cannot manage and are not in control of their lives. I hope my
remarks will dovetail with, rather than repeat, those of the noble
Baroness, Lady Wilkins, who speaks from a wealth of experience in
independent living.</p><p><a name="06071457000341"></a>The people
using social care services now feel that they are often inadequate,
inflexible and focus on what Peter Beresford, of the service user
network Shaping Our Lives, describes
as,</p><ul><a name="06071457000517"></a>&#147;providing bodily
maintenance at best, keeping people within their own four walls rather
than offering them social support to enable them to be part of the
wider world&#148;.</ul><a name="06071457000484"></a>Hence
there is so much wasted potential and so many examples of extensive
equality gaps between disabled and non-disabled people. Many people and
families, as indicated by the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, receive no
support at all from the state until they reach crisis point. This year,
many disabled people will find services withdrawn as councils struggle
to balance the books. The system is in crisis and it can only get worse
as our population ages. As the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, mentioned
the many informal carers in her thoughtful and experience-based maiden
speech, I shall mention the young carers&#151;12 year-old
schoolchildren, some with learning disabilities&#151;that councils
rely on. I hope that an amendment to the Education and Inspections Bill
will help schoolsto support these children. It is, however,
totally inappropriate that they should be relied on at all.
<p><a name="06071457000342"></a>Rationing services is justified on the
grounds of scarce resources, but huge resources are wasted on what Bert
Massie, the chair of the DRC, has
called,</p><ul><a name="06071457000518"></a>&#147;a

<a name="06071457000485"></a>and are tied
up in block contracts and costly residential provision. We could
support more people to achieve truly independent living by redirecting
those resources into the system proposed by the Bill, as other noble
Lords have mentioned. There ishuge support for the Bill from
individuals and organisations across the board because it is rooted in
people&#146;s experiences and delivers the new approach they want.
Disabled people must have control over how, when and by whom their
personal assistance is provided. Inflexible support makes it difficult,
if not impossible, to work and participate in public and community
life. 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_969"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 969</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071457000343"></a>I hope the Minister will give the matter
of earned income some thought and reply on it. At present, earned
income is disregarded for home care charging and independent living
fund payments&#151;my noble friend Lady Wilkins successfully
campaigned for that&#151;but not for other forms of support. The
report <I>Improving the Life Chances of Disabled People </I>highlighted
the continuing barriers to work thrown up by the current system. A
disabled person living in residential care faces significant financial
disincentives to seeking paid employment, as he would be able to keep
only &#163;20 a week of his earned income before it has to be used to
pay the residential home fee. In a footnote, the report
stated:</p><ul><a name="06071457000502"></a>&#147;While the
numbers of disabled people living in residential homes who would be
able to work are small, the Strategy Unit did receive evidence that
there are some in this
situation&#148;.</ul><a name="06071457000486"></a>So we are
talking about only a very small number of people. The report also
stated that, <ul><a name="06071457000519"></a>&#147;there
should be a national charging policy which so far as possible minimises
financial disincentives to seek paid
employment&#148;.</ul><a name="06071457000487"></a>Thus
the policy on disregarding earned income for community care
charging, <ul><a name="06071457000520"></a>&#147;will
need to be extended to the means test for ... residential
care&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06071457000344"></a>Will the
Government act on this as a matter of urgency? It would not cost very
much, but would make a massive difference to the people concerned. I
hope when the Minister answers she may be able to respond on this or
will indicate that she will look into it. I think it could probably be
done without the Bill. I do not know whether primary legislation would
be needed to change this. I would be interested to know whether we have
to wait for the Bill, because this would concern only a small number of
people. To give an example, a man of 28 who has lived in residential
care for the past five years&#151;although he was told that it was
only a temporary measure&#151;is a first-class honours graduate in
geophysics from the Open University. He has recently been headhunted
for two jobs designing websites accessible for disabled people. He has
had to refuse and is doing voluntary work designing websites and
teaching IT in a school once a week.</p><p><a name="06071457000345"></a>If individual budgets and self-directed
support are to work effectively, we need a solid infrastructure of
information, advice, advocacy, expertise and support. For that reason,
the life chances strategy pledged an independent living centre for
disabled people in every locality by 2010 to help make that a reality.
However, at the moment, centres are closing because of lack of core
funding and inequalities in the contracting process, and there is no
plan to secure this key recommendation. The Bill requires local
authorities and NHS bodies to develop, support and sustain local
user-led organisations, including centres for independent living, and
to foster partnerships between them.</p><p><a name="06071457000346"></a>I passionately hope that the Government
will support the Bill. It does everything that they say they want to
happen, and more. Disabled people welcomed the commitments to
independent living in the White Paper on life chances, but there is a
danger of those commitments coming to be viewed as nice rhetoric 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_970"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 970</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with no prospect of being turned into reality. The concepts of choice,
freedom and independent living litter many a government policy
document, but there is no reference to them in community care law. If
we want to make independent living real, we need a new law that
reorients our whole social care system towards independent living. That
is precisely what the Bill would achieve, so I hope that it has a
speedy journey into
law.</p><h5><a name="06071457000548"></a>3.39

Greengross:</b> My Lords, much well respected
research&#151;for example, that headed by Professor Sir Michael
Marmot at University College London&#151;has clearly demonstrated
that lack of autonomy in decision-making, lack of control over
one&#146;s life and lack of feelings of self-respect and status can
shorten one&#146;s life by several years. We know that disabled
people tend to live shorter lives than able-bodied people. How
iniquitous it is, therefore, to rob people of the autonomy that we all
ought to take for granted, sometimes thereby robbing them of a crucial
aspect of quality of life and, sometimes, of years of life itself. That
is one reason why I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, on his
Bill, which is of the utmost importance and relevance to disabled
people of all ages, as well as to us all. His vision and leadership in
this field and the work of the Disability Rights Commission in
preparing the Bill are to be
admired.</p><p><a name="06071457000348"></a>I declare an interest
as patron of New Beginnings, an alliance of organisations from all
sectors that encourages people into work and, once in work, to have a
career and develop it. I am also a patron of SHARE, a London initiative
providing vocational and skills training for people of all ages with
physical and mental disabilities&#151;sometimes very severe
ones&#151;and chief executive of a think tank. I am vice-president of
Age Concern, where we continually consider the impact of the ageing of
society on people of all ages and on society as a
whole.</p><p><a name="06071457000349"></a>Independent living is a
policy priority. We know that existing demands on carers, usually
family members, will increase and that the increasing care needs of an
ageing population will mount up if we do not do something to get our
priorities right. Evidence consistently shows that people want to
remain independent as long as they possibly
can.</p><p><a name="06071457000350"></a>The Bill is welcome because
it recognises the right of disabled people to the same control,
freedoms and opportunities to make choices as the rest of the community
has. It gives people the right to choose to have direct payments and
thus determine how their services are delivered. It is inclusive; it
demands inclusivity. It covers people of all ages, thus removing some
of the iniquitous distinctions in support for people aged 65 and over.
It is now well known that, if you acquire a disability, you had better
do so before you are 64, otherwise you will be deprived of many of the
benefits that other people can take for granted. It recognises that
discrimination is the single biggest factor impacting on the mental
health and well-being of older people in this country.</p><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_971"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 971</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071457000351"></a>The Bill gives disabled people a single
assessment of their needs. At the moment, we know that the silos in
departments and among authorities responsible for providing services
prevent many people from getting the services that they
need&#151;certainly in the way that they would like. It gives people
some choice as to how services are delivered, which gives them autonomy
and a sense of control that they have never really experienced before.
At last, it places a duty on statutory authorities to co-operate, to
pool resources and to promote independent
living.</p><p><a name="06071457000352"></a>The Bill would remove
the scandalous current situation whereby private and voluntary sector
homes do not come under the definition of a public authority with
regard to the Human Rights Act. We know that there are cases under
review at the moment in which people have been treated appallingly
because of that awful loophole in the law, which I know the Government
want to do something about&#151;I hope that the Minister will be able
to assure me that the Bill would get rid of it.</p><p><a name="06071457000353"></a>The Bill will also allow for review of
care for those people who are in institutions against their will. That
is an abuse of the right to autonomy, which is what we are talking
about, but it is also an appalling situation when people who would
like, and need, to be in some form of institutional care, because they
cannot manage in their own home, cannot always get access to that care
because of a shortage of places. The Bill would remove a lot of
unfairness in that respect.</p><p><a name="06071457000354"></a>The
Bill makes the case for a proper debate on the very important issue of
how care is funded now and, more important, how it will be funded in
the future. But this is not just a Bill that will increase the cost to
the nation; it will relieve a lot of pressure on carers&#151;60 per
cent of informal carers are women still&#151;and as a spin-off it
will give them a chance to participate more in the workforce. It will
therefore promote gender equality and better family life. We know the
difficulties that many carers experience in trying to fulfil multiple
roles in difficult situations. The Bill will also bring social and
economic benefits in later life to many people who at the moment are
excluded from many such benefits.</p><p><a name="06071457000355"></a>I wish the Bill a successful passage
through this House and another place. It will help to ensure a better
quality of life for people in our society who deserve no less if we are
to be called civilised.</p><h5><a name="06071457000549"></a>3.46

persistence. He has not let the issue of disabilities rest. He has been
battling away for considerably longer than I have. At times, I think,
&#147;Haven&#146;t we done enough? Haven&#146;t we pushed the

party&#151;is that the issue is &#147;difficult&#148;, or does
not &#147;fit in&#148;.</p><p><a name="06071457000358"></a>I
went through the clauses, deciding which was my favourite. It is Clause
5, the smallest one:</p><ul><a name="06071457000503"></a>&#147;General duty of local
authorities and NHS bodies&#148;.</ul><a name="06071457000488"></a>Making bits of government work together
to achieve common objectives is probably one of the great targets that
Parliament should aim for. The Chinese walls of Whitehall and other
parts of the government system are sometimes so dense that nothing
happens between them. Ministers have a great responsibility for
bridging those walls, or punching holes through them&#151;whatever is
required to get there. When an Act takes on that responsibility, it
will have to tackle probably the major cause of inactivity among
government departments, where the aspiration is there, and make the
departments talk to one another. They might then realise that, once
they get out of the &#147;my little budget&#148; zone&#151;and it
is usually no more than that&#151;they still have a responsibility to
continue, not just if they are pushed by a persistent
Minister. <p><a name="06071457000359"></a>Having got that
little rant out of the way, I shall consider the rest of the Bill. It
is valuable, because it addresses the tendency of us all to be slightly
protectively condescending to someone whom we do not quite
understand&#151;the &#147;Does he take sugar?&#148; attitude that
is there in all of us, in a way. We must fight against that. Those whom
we do not understand we are slightly frightened of&#151;slightly
wary&#151;and we think, &#147;Maybe this is safe for you. Maybe
you&#146;ll be worried out there&#148;. As my noble friend said,
the problem is when parents get frightened. Parents are usually the
initial carers of most of these groups. Most of the bodies that look
after and support people with disabilities usually start with parents
as the formation base.</p><p><a name="06071457000360"></a>We have
to remember that people are individuals first and foremost. I hope that
this Bill will be a step forward for disabled people by allowing them
to organise their lives and occasionally get it wrong or make
mistakes&#151;or get something of which we do not approve, which will
be more normally the case. The emphasis on advocacy, support and
information that runs through the Bill is its underlying strength. The
Government must find out who needs help. These things will draw
everything together to ensure that, if we co-ordinate help, it will go
to the right people.</p><p><a name="06071457000361"></a>The
current service of help and support is effectively a mirror or reverse
image of battlefield medicine, where those who are least badly damaged
are patched up first in order to get them out again. We wait until
something is critical and broken down before doing anything. In
particular, the health service finds itself a catch-all for everything
that has gone wrong. We incur costs at the extreme end because we do
not intervene earlier. The Government should give advice and support to
enable people who can work to do so. If that is not possible, people
should at least be able to organise their lives so that they are
fulfilled and do not have unnecessary problems associated with mental
illness. People want to interact positively with the rest of society.
If that is 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_973"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 973</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>done, many costs will be avoided. There could be, for example, acute
support service costs if intervention is
incorrect.</p><p><a name="06071457000362"></a>If the Government can
assure us that some of this will be taken on board&#151;in the Bill,
co-ordination and advocacy immediately grab me&#151;there will be no
need for the noble Lord&#146;s Bill. However, I suspect that the
noble Lord will need to carry on battering and using his persistence,
and that we will need to go through Committee stage in order to at
least drag out a clearer idea of the Government&#146;s thinking on
how these needs will be met.</p><p><a name="06071457000363"></a>The
noble Lord is continuing in the rich vein of form that he has had since
I came to this House. He makes sure that the Government are kept up to
the mark and that those of us who have less natural persistence and a
less keenly felt sense of purpose carry on. This Government can safely
say, &#147;We have done more than any other Government&#148;. That
is true, but previous Governments could have said that, too. We could
do this almost Parliament by Parliament, as we build on law that has
been passed by previous Governments. We have to make sure that we
continue to apply this. There are no new ideas, although these are well
put together in one new form. I hope that the Government and the noble
Lord, Lord Ashley, will give an assurance that we will have further
discussion on the Bill and that the Government will tell us exactly
where they think they have got in their independent programmes for
meeting the ends that are brought into focus by this
Bill.</p><h5><a name="06071457000550"></a>3.53

Skelmersdale:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord,
Lord Ashley, for introducing this subject today. He would be quite in
order to be extremely gratified by the many speeches that he has heard
in praise of it. The Second Reading of his Bill has also persuaded my
noble friend Lady Verma to speak to us for the first time, drawing on
her particular&#151;I am tempted to use the word
&#147;peculiar&#148; in its 18th century sense&#151;knowledge of
caring, carers and the establishments in which they operate. I hope
that we will continue to have her advice when these subjects come up,
which she will find they do quite regularly in your Lordships&#146;
House.</p><p><a name="06071457000365"></a>Your Lordships will have
heard my starting point in discussions about disability many times, but
it does no harm to re-state it. The noble Lord, Lord Addington, almost
did so. My fundamental belief is that disabled people are people first
and disabled second. From that, it follows that any rights that
able-bodied people have are automatically transferred to disabled
people. Therefore I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, that it is
important that disabled people should be empowered to have access to
those rights&#151;in my view, this is really an access Bill as
opposed to a rights Bill. The obvious example is access to transport,
with which we dealt at length in the Disability Discrimination Bill
over the winter of 2004-05. Being able to get about is quite clearly
part of independent living. The Royal National Institute

frequently made housebound by their
blindness.</p>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60714-0967.htm"/>


<p><a name="06071457000366"></a>That brings me
specifically to this Bill. I am glad that in its briefing on the Bill,
the Disability Rights Commission
stated:</p><ul><a name="06071457000504"></a>&#147;Independent
living means ensuring that disabled people of all ages have the same
freedom, choice, dignity and control as other citizens at home, at work
and in the community. It does not mean living by yourself or fending
for yourself. It means rights to practical assistance and support to
participate in society and live an ordinary
life&#148;.</ul><a name="06071457000489"></a>The DRC goes on
to say that social services arenot delivering the means for
independent living. I certainly agree with that. However, I am not
convinced that a change in the law is necessary. When the DRC goes on
to talk about means testing, I am in some difficulty for two reasons:
first, because all our citizens are means tested before they get access
to a whole range of social security benefits, and secondly, because of
the inevitable expense that would
arise.<p><a name="06071457000367"></a>The Government are
rightly proud of the extra moneys they have given to the NHS over the
past few years. The problem, as we have all recognised today, is that
not enough is being used for the purposes we are currently espousing.
It is deflected into other parts of the health service. The Bill and
the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, propose a joint fund, locally
created between the NHS and social services which would be drawn upon
to make the lives of disabled people easier. That also suggests that
rather than statutory services, individuals should get a grant to be
applied outside the state sector for the services they need. While I
accept that the two items, indeed the whole Bill, are, as the noble
Lord, Lord Addington, almost put it, a counsel of perfection for
disabled people, how practical would these two ideas actually be? How
can we be sure that the personal fund would be spent on the things that
particular disabled people are assessed as needing? On an NHS/social
services fund, I can certainly see the logic in it. However, has the
noble Lord thought this through? What percentage would the NHS or the
local social services department
contribute?</p><p><a name="06071457000368"></a>Many years ago, as
the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, will no doubt remember, I returned from
Northern Ireland singing the praises of the four area health boards,
which of course combine health and social services in a single entity.
Almost total condemnation was visited upon me for suggesting that they
should be joined into one statutory service here. I have not reneged on
that position. I still believe, although it is not the position of my
party, that that is the answer to joint funding, not that proposed in
the Bill. I trust that I can now persuade the noble Lord, Lord Ashley,
and other noble Lords to join my crusade&#151;which, incidentally, is
now supported by the former director of social services in my home
county of Somerset.</p><p><a name="06071457000369"></a>The Bill
also covers employment, and I welcome the Government&#146;s belated
decision under the Welfare Reform Bill to seek to ensure that weight is
given to what people can do rather than what they cannot. No doubt we
will be debating this in the months to come and it is hardly
appropriate to go into the detail now. Suffice it to say I believe
there are people currently 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_975"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 975</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>receiving incapacity benefit who are perfectly able to undertake at
least some paid or voluntary work. In this connection, I note
Rethink&#146;s complaintsabout telephone claiming, which it
believes may discriminate against some people with mental illness.
However, I hope that the Minister will tell us about other methods of
claiming. Would the Benefits Agency accept an advocate, especially in a
personal interview? The Mental Health Alliance makes this point and I
can see no reason why not, nor why a change in the law should be
necessary to achieve it.</p><p><a name="06071457000370"></a>I
should emphasise here that as disabled people are a part of our wider
society, so any policy that evolves should include them as part and
parcel of that policy, not an embarrassing add-on. Disability is not a
separate and distinct issue; it should be integral to government
thinking. It certainly is as my party develops its policies. People
with disabilities have much to contribute to society&#151;as, indeed,
we all do&#151;and should be valued for that
reason.</p><p><a name="06071457000371"></a>I know that there are
other themes in the Bill that I have not covered&#151;the right to
choose where to live, for example&#151;but time marches
on.</p><p><a name="06071457000372"></a>The Bill contains lessons
for us all. Some are achievable by administrative means if the will is
there. It is the job of parliamentarians, Government, Opposition and
Back-Benchers to keep plugging away to see that it does. Others do
indeed need the law to be strengthened. I am afraid that this Bill
contains both and I await with eagerness the Minister&#146;s
identification of which is
which.</p><h5><a name="06071457000551"></a>4
pm</h5><p><a name="06071457000373"></a><b><a name="06071457000595"></a>Baroness
Royall of Blaisdon:</b> My Lords, I warmly welcome
the opportunity that the Bill provides for a debate on disabled people
and independent living. I pay tribute to my tenacious noble friend Lord
Ashley in bringing the Bill before your Lordships today. His efforts
over the years to further the interests of disabled people have, as
many noble Lords have said, been absolutely tireless. He has been, and
continues to be, a real catalyst for change. I also pay tribute
tothe Disability Rights Commission, an excellent organisation,
which I know has provided considerable support in the drafting of the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06071457000374"></a>I congratulate the noble
Baroness, Lady Verma, on her excellent maiden speech and I am delighted
that she chose to intervene in this debate. Her commitment to social
justice is clear and we all look forward to her future
contributions.</p><p><a name="06071457000375"></a>I must also
mention that my noble friend Lord Morris of Manchester, who has such a
fine record on this issue, very much wanted to participate in the
debate but he could not be in his place
today.</p><p><a name="06071457000376"></a>I am glad to be able to
say that the Government are fully supportive of the principles
underpinningthe Bill, which are entirely consistent with the
Government&#146;s position and what we wish to achieve in the future
to improve the lives of disabled people. But it would be wrong to
forget what has already been achieved. I believe that our performance
in extending rights and opportunities for disabled people and ensuring
that they are able to live more independent 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_976"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 976</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>lives is unparalleled. The noble Baroness, Lady Masham, is absolutely
right, of course, when she says that we are only part way along the
journey. Huge changes still need to be made to transform the lives of
disabled people and the demographic challenges mentioned by many noble
Lords are enormous.</p><p><a name="06071457000377"></a>The debate
has highlighted many practical problems&#151;for example, in relation
to wheelchairs&#151;issues which have to be addressed as a matter of
urgency. I am glad to say that on 22 June the Prime Minister announced
that the Department of Health will undertake a radical review of
community equipment and wheelchair services, the transforming community
equipment services project which will help to make independence a
reality. The aim of the project will be to achieve a streamlined, more
responsive and realistic assessment of individual needs across health
and social care and explore how to harness the capabilities of both the
third and private sectors across the end-to-end delivery of these
services. The Government aim to have developed a new model for the
provision of community equipment and wheelchair services across England
which will be capable of being implemented by autumn
2007.</p><p><a name="06071457000378"></a>Today&#146;s debate is
particularly timely as it coincides with the publication yesterday of
the inaugural annual progress report to the Prime Minister from the
Office for Disability Issues. As many of your Lordships have mentioned,
in 2004 the Prime Minister asked his strategy unit to look at what more
could be done to help bring about equality for disabled people. In
January 2005 the unit published its report <I>Improving the Life
Chances of Disabled People</I>. The report sets out a clear vision for
Government that by 2005 disabled people should have the same
opportunities and the same choices as everyone else. It contains 60
recommendations dealing with issues from the early years, the
transition to adulthood, employment and, of course, independent living
to help realise that vision.</p><p><a name="06071457000379"></a>The overall strategy is being driven by
the new Office for Disability Issues, or ODI, which was established in
December 2005. We are now just over 18 months into a 20-year strategy
which provides the kind of joined-up coherent approach that has been
rightly demanded today. The progress report published yesterday by the
ODI provides an honest assessment of the situation and enables everyone
to judge whether we are achieving our aims. The report makes specific
reference to transition, mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord
Clement-Jones. It refers to the responsibility of directors of adult
social services for managing the transition process and ensuring that
there is a clear line of accountability for improving outcomes and
monitoring the quality of the
transition.</p><p><a name="06071457000380"></a>While the Government
have overseen the largest extension of disability rights in history,
they are rightly committed to delivering greater change to enable
disabled people to make real choices. For example, the ODI is bringing
the voices of disabled people into the heart of government. This very
week, we announced that we would be establishing Equality 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_977"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 977</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>2025, the UK Advisory Network on Disability Equality. It will work with
Ministers and departments to ensure that disabled people&#146;s
perspectives are built into policy-making from the start. The ODI is
also successfully bringing departments together to improve services for
disabled people. I understand the frustration rightly expressed about
the lack of co-operation on the ground between local authorities, NHS
bodies and key partners, but co-operation between departments is a step
forward and it is already bearing fruit. We are starting to break down
the Chinese walls referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Addington.
Indeed, the report looks at that very
issue.</p><p><a name="06071457000381"></a>A further reason why the
Bill is well timed is that I am able to announce today that we have set
up a cross-government independent living review to drive forward this
complex agenda. It will be led by Jenny Morris, an independent living
expert, working with a team in the Office for Disability Issues,
steered and shaped by an independent living expert panel, chaired by
Dame Jane Campbell, whose record in this area is well known. I am
enormously pleased that these two eminent experts have agreed to work
closely with the Government on this
project.</p><p><a name="06071457000382"></a>We see the review as a
strengthening of our commitment to disabled people&#151;bringing into
the heart of the ODI the views, thinking and experience of independent
living experts, while building on the mechanisms that the office
already has in place to carry forward the detailed work between and
within government departments. This will, I hope, help to bridge the
gap between rhetoric and reality mentioned by my noble friend Lady
Wilkins. It will also enable people better to battle against
bureaucracy.</p><p><a name="06071457000383"></a>Many other
initiatives introduced by the Government have had and will have a
hugely positive effect on the ability of disabled people to live
independent lives&#151;for example, the Disability Discrimination Act
2005. The Government believe that a comprehensive framework of civil
rights is a necessary foundation for achieving equality for disabled
people. Following the Government&#146;s action, the framework is
finally in place. The Disability Discrimination Act 2005 followed the
landmark extension of the DDA from 1 October the previous year. The
changes we introduced from that date extended the employment provisions
of the DDA to more than 1 million additional small businesses and a
further 7 million jobs, and brought the final access duties into
force.</p><p><a name="06071457000384"></a>So now, at last, the DDA
is driving the cultural change in society that we all want. Access
ramps, communication aids and toilets for disabled people are at last
becoming the norm, not the exception&#151;well, I hope they are. We
do not underestimate the scale of the challenge that remains in
embedding these duties, particularly for small businesses which
sometimes assume that improving access means a complete refit of their
premises.</p><p><a name="06071457000385"></a>As your Lordships
will know, the new Act extended protection from last December to a
further 250,000 people, by covering people with HIV, multiple sclerosis
and cancer from the point of 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_978"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 978</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>diagnosis. People with mental health conditions will find it easier to
use the protection of the DDA. Disabled people will progressively have
new rights when, for example, sitting exams, using transport services,
renting property and joining or using private members&#146;
clubs.</p><p><a name="06071457000386"></a>The new Act also
introduced a disability equality duty, which will come into force from
this December. From that date, it will no longer be lawful for public
bodies to design services or carry out functions without first
considering how disabled people are affected.</p><p><a name="06071457000387"></a>It is also appropriate to touch on our
proposals for welfare reform. I am grateful for the support expressed
by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale. There has been much speculation
and, at times, misinformation in the media about our intentions, but I
hope we have been absolutely clear that, far from seeking to get tough
with people on incapacity benefits, our starting point is that disabled
people want to have the right to work, and would do so if the right
opportunities and support were in place. Employment brings dignity and
opportunity to end isolation, as well as wages. We estimate that
around 90 per cent of the 2.7 million people claiming an
incapacity benefit would meet the core definition of disability in the
Disability Discrimination Act. These figures perhaps help to
demonstrate why the employment rate of this group is less than 50 per
cent at a time when we are seeing record numbers of people in
work.</p><p><a name="06071457000388"></a>I note the concerns
expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth, about earned
income disregard for independent living. It is rathera
detailed issue to consider in a short debate, so I undertake to write
to the noble Baroness and I shall place a copy of the letter in the
Library.</p><p><a name="06071457000389"></a>On adult social care
and the progress that we have made in developing the concept of
individual budgets, the Government are currently undertaking a number
of pilot projects on providing individual budgets for older and
disabled people. I therefore welcome my noble friend&#146;s focus on
individual budgets as a key element in delivering improved choice and
control for disabled people. However, it is important to remember that
individual budgets are still being piloted at this stage. We have
commissioned a comprehensive evaluation of the pilots. This will
identify whether they can be delivered within our existing resources
and whether they are delivering benefits to the people that use them.
The evaluation will also look at whether there is a particular model or
models of individual budgets that work best for people with different
needs. We are not expecting to have final evidence from the pilots
until spring 2008. We do not believe therefore that it would be
sensible to introduce a statutory requirement for the introduction of
the individual budgets approach until we have seen the results coming
from the pilot projects, and have had time to consider all the
evidence.</p><p><a name="06071457000390"></a>I am told that I said
earlier that the strategy unit&#146;s report set out a clear vision
for government to be 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_979"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 979</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>achieved by 2005; clearly I meant 2025. Forgive me&#151;I, too, want
to push forward with the
progress.</p><p><a name="06071457000391"></a>The noble Baroness,
Lady Darcy de Knayth, rightly emphasised the crucial role of carers,
including very young carers, the pressures that they are under and
society&#146;s dependence on them. Over the past nine years we have
consistently sought to improve carers&#146; lives and well-being, but
I understand that the burdens are still enormous. We supported
legislation giving carers the right to a holistic carer's assessment,
including the carer&#146;s wishes with regard to paid work, education
and leisure activities. We introduced the carers grant to help councils
support carers with respite breaks and other services&#151;though
possibly not enough. By 2008, we will have invested more than &#163;1
billion in support for carers. But we want to do more, or course. In
the White Paper, <I>Our health, our care, our say</I>, we proposed a
new deal for carers to improve support for them through a range of
measures, including the establishment of a helpline to offer advice;
the provision of short-term, home-based respite support for carers in
crisis or emergency situations; and the creation of an expert carers
programme to provide training for the skills carers need to control
their own health and the health of those in their
care.</p><p><a name="06071457000392"></a>Many noble Lords referred
to the Bill&#146;s proposals relating to housing and accommodation
for disabled people. The Government fully recognise that it is
extremely important that disabled people who have access needs are
housed appropriately and that they have the right level of priority for
housing. That is precisely why we have amended the legislation
governing the way in which housing authorities allocate social housing.
This now makes clear that in giving &#147;reasonable
preference&#148; for an allocation to people who have medical and
welfare grounds for moving house, authorities must include people who
need to move on grounds relating to a
disability.</p><p><a name="06071457000393"></a>The changes we
introduced in the Housing Act 2004 were intended to meet the sort of
concerns the noble Lord&#146;s Bill has identified. The term
&#147;medical grounds&#148; was being interpreted too narrowly by
some local authorities, and disabled people were being disadvantaged as
a result. The Government also want to see social landlords make the
best use of housing stock, including accommodation which is accessible
or has been adapted for use by disabled people. We recognise that
accessible housing registers can be useful and the current statutory
guidance to local authorities on the allocation of accommodation
encourages their use. However, we do not believe that forcing
authorities to compile registers is the right way forward. We believe
that it would be burdensome and could be counter-productive. Rather, we
believe that it should be for local authorities to decide whether a
register would meet their local needs and, if so, to set it up in a way
which best suits those
needs.</p><p><a name="06071457000394"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Greengross,
referred to decisions by the courts that have limited the scope of the
Human Rights Act over residential care. The Government are disappointed
that the narrow interpretation taken by the Court of Appeal of the
meaning of &#147;public authority&#148; is limiting the 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_980"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 980</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>protection that we intended to put in place withthe Human
Rights Act. Following the JCHR's recommendations in 2004, we have
already taken effective measures to mitigate the problem by issuing
guidance to local authorities on contracting for services and by
setting up a system to identify a suitable case in which the Government
can intervene to argue for a wider interpretation of public
authority.</p><p><a name="06071457000395"></a>Perhaps I may now
move briefly to what the Government are doing to assist independent
living for people with learning disabilities. In March 2001, the
Government set out their plan for improving the lives of people with
learning disabilities, their families and carers in the White Paper
<I>Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st
Century</I>. This, the first White Paper on learning disability for 30
years, was based on the principles of rights, inclusion, choice and
independence. It was written in consultation with people with learning
disabilities, their families, carers, and the organisations who
represent them. It set out a cross-government approach to addressing
the lifelong needs of people with learning disabilities across health,
housing, education, employment, social services, transport and
leisure.</p><p><a name="06071457000396"></a>To drive delivery of
the White Paper, we created the role of national director of learning
disabilities, and in May 2006 we took a step further and appointed a
co-national director with a learning disability to work alongside the
existing director. The appointment of a learning disabled person to
this senior post will play a significant role in leading this
cross-government agenda, and it demonstrates our commitment to
inclusion, choice and control for people with learning
disabilities.</p><p><a name="06071457000397"></a>Our policy is to
promote inclusion and participation in community life for people with
learning disabilities. They should be able to participate in the
activities other people take for granted such as getting a job,
travelling, raising a family or going out with friends. The national
director&#146;s 2005 progress report, &#147;The Story So
Far&#148;, showed that change is happening&#151;people
arebeing listened to more and supported to live
independently&#151;but not
enough.</p><p><a name="06071457000398"></a>As I am sure noble Lords
will agree, user-led organisations play a vital role in supporting
disabled people. A strong support network is essential, and that is
often best provided by bodies which are led by the very people they
wish to support. As the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth,
remindedus, the Government have already accepted the
recommendations, in &#147;Improving the Life Chances of Disabled
People&#148;, that by 2010 each local authority should have a
user-led organisation modelled on existing centres for independent
living. To this end we have established a project as part of the
independent living review to identify what needs to be done to make a
reality of the recommendation. We are of course aware of the
difficulties with funding and local procurement processes and we must
find a way through.</p><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_981"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 981</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071457000399"></a>This wide range of initiatives
demonstrates the Government&#146;s real commitment to improving the
ability of disabled people to live as independently as possible. But
have we done enough? No, of course not. Barriers and poverty of
aspiration are a reality for far too many disabled people. There is
still too much to do, but inevitably it will take time.</p><p><a name="06071457000400"></a>This morning I was reminded that cultural
change is a lengthy process when, with colleagues, I laid flowers at
the memorial to Emmeline Pankhurst, who was born 148 years ago on 14
July. It is precisely because we want to ensure further progress for
disabled people that we have set out a 20-year strategy. But I believe
that the Government can be proud of what has been achieved to date. In
many ways my noble friend&#146;s Bill demonstrates just how far we
have come in our thinking on making provision for disabled people and
in changing the culture and attitudes of society. I am glad to say, as
the noble Lord, Lord Addington, said, that this is no longer a party
issue; there is cross-party agreement.</p><p><a name="06071457000401"></a>I have to say that there are aspects of
the Bill with which we might disagree, or which we believe are already
achieved or can be achieved through existing
provisions.</p><p><a name="06071457000490"></a>In addition, there
would, as my noble friend acknowledged, be cost implications in
implementing all that is proposed, especially at the pace implied in
the Bill. However, I recognise that some of those would be offset by
cost savings.</p><p><a name="06071457000402"></a>But debate on the
detailed clauses of the Bill is for a later stage. At this point I am
very happy to welcome the principles underpinning the Bill, and again
to warmly congratulate my noble friend on bringing it forward and
enabling us to debate this important issue. It has allowed us to
identify and discuss some of the main challenges that we must meet in
the coming years if disabled people are to become equal partners in our
society, as they must, with the same opportunities and choices as
everyone else, participating as equals in every aspect of family and
community life.</p><p><a name="06071457000403"></a>This issue is
close to the Government&#146;s heart, and we have made real
achievements. However, we are only part way through the journey and
today&#146;s debate provides us with a further impetus for progress
so that all members of our society are, to quote R H Tawney, enabled to
make the most of such powers as they
possess.</p><h5><a name="06071457000552"></a>4.20
pm</h5><p><a name="06071457000404"></a><b><a name="06071457000596"></a>Lord
Ashley of Stoke:</b> My Lords, I wish to respond
briefly to the debate. As so many issues were raised in such detail it
is impossible to reply to them
all.</p><p><a name="06071457000405"></a>I congratulate the noble
Baroness, Lady Verma, on her maiden speech, which we were all delighted
to hear, and welcome her general support for the Bill. I assure her
that the Bill makes provision for carers. Perhaps we can discuss that
at a later stage.</p><p><a name="06071457000406"></a>The noble
Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, mentioned individual budgets, which are an
option in the Bill. There is no compulsion in that regard. However, I
hope that people will want them and that there will be 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_982"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 982</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a big demand for them. They comprise an important part of the Bill, but,
as I say, there is no compulsion whatever on anyone to have
one.</p><p><a name="06071457000407"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady
Masham, referred to a different definition in the Bill. We have
discussed that at length but perhaps we can discuss it further as the
Bill progresses. I cannot respond to that point
now.</p><p><a name="06071457000408"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Addington, is right to say that disability is now a non-party issue. It
used to be years ago, but, happily, as the noble Lord, Lord
Skelmersdale, indicated, there is now general amity on the principles.
There may be some differences, but I see no mountain of opposition to
the Bill. Rather, I see a warm welcome for it and I am sure that the
Government have taken note of that. Like the noble Lord, Lord
Skelmersdale, I believe that we have made great progress and that there
are no substantive differences between us. The same goes for the
Liberal Democrats.</p><p><a name="06071457000409"></a>The noble
Baroness, Lady Royall, was extremely positive and welcoming, which I
appreciate very much indeed. Speaking for the Government, she outlined
all that has been done in recent years. As someone who has played a
small role in those developments, I can say that we warmly appreciate
what the Government have done. On the other hand, we would like, and
keep pressing for, a specific assurance that the Government support the
Bill. The noble Baroness, Lady Royall, could not give that assurance
this afternoon, but it is something for us to aim at. We want the
Government to say, &#147;Yes, we endorse the Bill&#148;. The
announcement by the noble Baroness of a general review of independent
living is a major step forward. The two people whom she mentioned in
that regard, Jenny Morris and Jane Campbell, are marvellous. Two better
people could not have been chosen to do that job. So, it will be a
genuine review, for which I thank the
Government.</p><p><a name="06071457000410"></a>My noble friend the
Minister was right to delineate all these developments, and they are
considerable. This Bill has been called the holy grail of disability,
which is a very demanding title. Some of the elements in the Bill may
be burdensome, as my noble friend said. That is the
objective&#151;for it to be burdensome, if necessary, to help
disabled people. We accept that it will be burdensome. It is up to
local authorities and National Health Service bodies to adapt to the
Bill as best they can.</p><p><a name="06071457000411"></a>I thank
everyone who has spoken for their brilliant and rewarding speeches. I
believe that we are on our
way.</p><p><a name="06071457000412"></a>On Question, Bill read a

<h3 align="center"><a name="06071457000004"></a>Scotland
(Petitions for a Referendum on Independence) Bill
[HL]</h3><h5><a name="06071457000553"></a>4.25
pm</h5><p><a name="06071457000413"></a><b><a name="06071457000597"></a>The
Earl of Mar and Kellie:</b> My Lords, I beg to move
that this Bill be now read a second time. Before I go any further,
there are some headline points to make about this short Bill. First,
there must be a democratic path to political independence available at 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_983"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 983</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>all times. Secondly, the withdrawal from the United Kingdom would only
be political; an end to the parliamentary union of 1707. Thirdly, the
Bill specifically retains the Union of the Crowns in 1603, which is
itself the symbol of the inevitable, at least in my mind, British
social union. Fourthly, this Bill is both liberal and democratic, but
it is not Liberal Democrat policy; at least not
yet.</p><p><a name="06071457000414"></a>Nothing that I intend to
say will compromise my Oath of Allegiance to Queen Elizabeth. I am only
too aware of the Act of Attainder passed by this Parliament on the Earl
of Mar in 1716. Ever keen to rehabilitate that most significant
Scotsman, I remind the House that in the pre-democracy days the only
way to change His Majesty&#146;s Government was to change His
Majesty.</p><p><a name="06071457000415"></a>The background to the
Bill must be presented in summary form, for I am anxious not to take up
too much time. I suspect that this will be welcome, as I have 11 points
to make in this section. First, in international terms, Scotland
languishes as a semi-autonomous British region with a sub-national
Parliament. Secondly, Scotland, with 5 million people, is submerged as
one-twelfth of a medium-sized superpower and is inevitably dominated by
England with 50 million people. England is supposed to be a superpower.
Thirdly, pollsters report that twice as many people living in Scotland
would vote for political independence as would vote for the SNP.
Fourthly, the delayed rise of the English question is now upon us in
its various forms: English votes for English laws; no Scottish MP to be
Prime Minister; and no Scottish MPs to be Ministers for English
departments. Clearly, that is not part of this Bill, but some
constitutional change needs to
occur.</p><p><a name="06071457000416"></a>Fifthly, I gave up the
struggle against a politically independent Scotland in the spring of
2004, with the advent of EU enlargement and so many countries poorer
and smaller than Scotland becoming full members of the European Union.
Sixthly, a quick look around the north Atlantic shows prosperous
states, mostly smaller than Scotland, all of which have departed from
union states. There were Sweden and Denmark in 1812; Norway in 1905;
Finland in 1920; Ireland in 1922; Iceland in 1944; and the Faroe
Islands, which have had home rule, the equivalent of Scotland, since
1948.</p><p><a name="06071457000417"></a>Seventhly, the National
Covenant of 1947 to 1950 was signed by 2 million people and ignored.
Noble Lords should bear in mind that the same people elected a Scottish
Conservative majority in 1955. Eighthly, there are the Scottish
feelings of impotence in world affairs and British foreign policy as
only8 per cent of the United Kingdom population. Ninthly,
there is the Norwegian model, departing from the Kalmar Union in 1812
and from the United Kingdom of Sweden and Norway in 1905, with a very
satisfactory vote of 360,000 in favour and 179 or so against. Norway
also shares similar oil and gas resources to Scotland. Tenthly, I have
been a member of the Independence Convention since last year.
Eleventhly, I very recently became a member of the constitutional
commission that is being set up.</p><notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_984"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 984</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06071457000418"></a>The Bill is also a memorial to the
Scottish union negotiators, Robert Burns&#146;s &#147;parcel
o&#146; rogues&#148;, who were in London from April to July 1706
and whose treaty was presented to Queen Anne on 22 July 1706. The Earl
of Mar was a Secretary of State and principal negotiator. Although the
Scots sought an end to war, a guarantee of peace and free trade with
England and its colonies, there was no way that the Earl of Godolphin
was going to allow the Scots to avoid a parliamentary union. They read
the runes correctly and have been castigated ever
since.</p><p><a name="06071457000419"></a>That Earl of Mar would
have been all too aware that a predecessor Earl of Mar had come to
London in 1601 to negotiate the Union of the Crowns for his childhood
friend, King James VI. Both Earls of Mar would have been aware that the
first Erskine Earl of Mar, Sir Robert Erskine, had come to London in
1421 as an ambassador to seek the release of King James I, whose
childhood was spent being held captive in London, following his
hijacking by English pirates while making his way to the Continent for
education.</p><p><a name="06071457000420"></a>Finishing off this
memorial section, perhaps I may set down, first, the Declaration of
Arbroath in 1320, an appeal to the Pope for help, only six years after
the stunning but only tactical victory at Bannockburn; secondly, the
wisdom of King James IV in seeking to marry Princess Margaret Tudor in
1503, thereby setting up the dynastic union; and finally, the almost
united kingdom of Norway and Scotland of 1287, which was foiled by the
death of the Maid of Norway in Kirkwall while on her way to take up the
Scottish throne.</p><p><a name="06071457000421"></a>Noble Lords
will be pleased to know that I will move closer to the Bill. Attitudes
towards Scotland&#146;s future can be divided into
&#147;instinctive&#148; and &#147;functional&#148;. An
instinctive thought goes like this: &#147;Scotland should resume full
autonomy&#148;, which is my belief, or &#147;Scotland should remain
submerged within the United Kingdom&#148;. Of course, a functional
attitude would be, &#147;I want the parliamentary union to continue
because&#148;, or, &#147;I want the repatriation of all
parliamentary powers because&#148;. Reasons can be wide-ranging and
may include, &#147;I want Scotland to re-find its place in the
international community&#148;, &#147;I want to win a United Kingdom
general election&#148;, or perhaps, &#147;I am frightened of
Scottish democracy&#148;. Enough of
that.</p><p><a name="06071457000422"></a>I wish to move on to the
subject of referendum acquisition. There are two routes. Alex Salmond
MP hopes that the Scottish Executive will hold a referendum about
transfer of sovereignty and then open negotiations with the United
Kingdom Government. That is enshrined in the draft Referendum (Scottish
Sovereignty) Bill 2007. Alternatively, this Bill enables people who
live in Scotland to petition the House of Commons directly for a
referendum, laying down that if half a million do so in one year, the
Secretary of State must introduce a referendum
Bill.</p><p><a name="06071457000423"></a>My approach respects the
sovereignty ofthe people&#151;the successor to the community
of the realm&#151;and respects Westminster&#146;s concept of the
supremacy of Parliament. My approach is workable at any time, rather
than the SNP&#146;s position that 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_985"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 985</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>requires the SNP to form part of the Scottish Executive. Scottish
sovereignty is a matter reserved to
Westminster.</p><p><a name="06071457000424"></a>What is the purpose
of political independence under the British Crown? My vision is this:
three sovereign states in the British Isles with a resulting increase
in international influence for the English-speaking people of the
north-west European archipelago&#151;a politically neutral
description. Scotland should become a pro-British state without
controversy at the border, provided that the Schengen agreement is
agreed to, and be in the EU, NATO and the United
Nations.</p><p><a name="06071457000425"></a>There
would be no need to haul down the Union flag, for this predates the
parliamentary union of 1707, but I would prefer that the version with
the Saltire superimposing be used. Already, Queen Elizabeth flies a
Scottish version of the royal standard when in Scotland. This retention
of the union of the crowns would give confidence to the 400,000 English
who live in Scotland, not to mention the 700,000 Scots who live in
England. It would be not a velvet divorce but a growing up of the
British family&#151;a fraternal development no longer needing the
corralling of Queen Anne's reign in the face of the French.</p><p><a name="06071457000426"></a>Lastly, I shall describe the Bill. The
Long Title is misleading. The withdrawal is from the United Kingdom's
Parliament, but that is a point for constitutional anoraks. Clause 1 is
the substantive clause. Subsection (1) identifies petitioners as being
those on the local government electoral register&#151;that is,
residents of Scotland. Subsection (2) says that a sample petition is
contained in the Schedule to the Bill, and the wording of this has been
acquired from the House of Commons. Subsection (3) requires the
petition to be gathered in one calendar year. Subsection (4) requires
the Secretary of State to prepare and give out petition forms on
request.</p><p><a name="06071457000427"></a>Subsection (5) is the
most significant. It says that if 500,000 people&#151;that is,
one-eighth of the adult population of Scotland&#151;petition the
House of Commons in one calendar year, the Secretary of State must
introduce a referendum Bill. Presumably, the question would be either,
&#147;I agree that all parliamentary power should be returned to the
Parliament of Scotland&#148;, or, &#147;I agree that the devolution
settlement of 1998 should
continue&#148;.</p><p><a name="06071457000428"></a>Subsection (6)
defines the calendar year as being 1 February to 31 March to conform
with the electoral registration process. Subsection (7) requires the
referendum to take place within eight months of the subsequent
referendum Bill being enacted. Subsection (8) contains a safeguard for
stability in the event of a referendum result rejecting Scottish
political independence, in which case there may not be another one for
at least 10 years.</p><p><a name="06071457000429"></a>The second
clause is the Short Title with a commencement date of 1 February 2007.
The Schedule contains a sample petition approved by the House of
Commons. It is a matter of record thatthe House of Commons is
actively considering the improvement of its public petition process.
Indeed, 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_986"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 986</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Members of that House have visited the Scottish Parliament to examine
its worthy Public Petitions Committee
procedures.</p><p><a name="06071457000430"></a>The Bill&#146;s
only real innovation is to require action by the Secretary of State.
Petitions can already be delivered to the House of Commons at any time.
The principle at stake is that the national community of Scotland must
have the right and means to control its sovereignty and to do so as a
single issue, rather than have it bundled in general election
manifestos. The selection of representatives to a devolved Parliament,
or even a multinational Parliament such as Westminster, is wholly
different from a transfer of
sovereignty.</p><p><a name="06071457000431"></a>The effect of the
Bill would be galvanising. First, a national debate would ensue,
separate from a general election, in the run-up to the referendum.
Secondly, an agreed blueprint for a sovereign state&#151;perhaps from
the new constitutional commission&#151;would need to have evolved to
be put before the people. Thirdly, the disaggregation process would
have to be agreed for human resources, material and Scottish MPs and
Peers. The fourth item would be settling the combined issue of the
Scottish share of the national debt set against the past oil revenues
already collected. I have in mind the Norwegian concept of an
endowment, known until recently as the petroleum fund. There was no
Scottish national debt in 1707 but I would accept that part of the
United Kingdom national debt which is owed to Scottish savers. Fifthly,
as regards settling the Faslane and Coulport submarine base issue, I
would suggest a treaty port agreement for, say, 20 years to enable the
Royal Navy to build a new base in England. Alternatively, it could be
leased for a longer period.</p><p><a name="06071457000432"></a>In
conclusion, a petition is possible at any time, even without the Bill
being enacted. Of course, there would be no requirement for action by
the Secretary of State. The Bill respects the sovereignty of the people
and the supremacy of Parliament. Parliament would have to agree to pass
the referendum Bill or take the consequences. It must we recalled that
that supremacy is over the Crown and the Government but not, I hope,
over the people. The parliamentary union has not been bad for Scotland
but the corralling of the British family of nations in 1707 and in 1801
is no longer necessary. In any case, part of Ireland departed in
1922.</p><p><a name="06071457000433"></a>Scotland and its people
are, however, stifled internationally and economically by lacking the
economic levers to alter business taxation, among other things. The
Celtic fringe inclusion project is over. England should be the
unfettered superpower that it is meant to be. Finally, there is a
delicious irony in the possibility of negotiating Scottish political
independence with a Scottish Prime Minister. I commend the Bill to the
House.</p><p><a name="06071457000434"></a>Moved, That the Bill be

Roper:</b> My Lords, having heard the very
interesting speech of my noble friend, I now welcome the opportunity
for this brief debate. It is appropriate 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_987"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 987</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that the hereditary keeper of Stirling Castle should be the one to move
such Bill. Having two small grandchildren, who are both at school in
Edinburgh, I always welcome his speeches, as I am able to go back with
all sorts of historical titbits to show that I am not quite as dim as
they think I am.</p><p><a name="06071457000436"></a>I do not want
to delay the proceedings on this Bill too long, but I was interested by
one thing that my noble friend said which I had not heard him say
before. He referred to Scottish MPs and Peers. Perhaps he can tell the
House whether he envisages the new Scottish Parliament being bicameral,
as distinct from the present
one.</p><p><a name="06071457000437"></a>My noble friend has, of
course, a long-standing commitment to this cause, which is respected,
if not shared, by his colleagues on these Benches. My first point is my
personal point of view. Although I believe that there are occasions for
referendums, I do not favour their proliferation. I am not in favour of
the kind of procedures that exist, for example, in Switzerland or in
California, where it is possible for the population to call for a
referendum on a subject. I believe that that is not in keeping with our
concept of a parliamentary democracy. I have some disagreement with the
concept of a mechanism whereby the electorate, or a portion of
them&#151;I believe one-eighth of the electorate&#151;could call
for a referendum on a specific matter if a similar Bill were
subsequently introduced.</p><p><a name="06071457000438"></a>Turning
to the provisions concerning the end of the 1707 union of the
Parliaments, I want to make it clear that the Bill goes in a direction
different from that of the Liberal Democrats, as my noble friend has
said. We are a unionist party and a federalist party. While we have
campaigned, and continue to do so, for devolution to the regions of
England&#151;we are disappointed that not more progress has been made
on that&#151;we would not wish to see a break-up of the United
Kingdom as suggested in the Bill.</p><p><a name="06071457000439"></a>In recent years, the Liberal Democrats in
Scotland, under the leadership of my noble friend Lord Steel, have
participated in the Steel commission, which has looked at ways of
strengthening the Scottish Parliament and developing the Scottish
Executive into a Scottish Government. The Steel commission proposals
will be considered by our Scottish party later this year. I believe
that, thereafter, they will want to set up a Scottish convention that
could see ways of strengthening the Scottish Parliament within the
present framework. I believe that that is the right course to take and
more satisfactory than the one proposed in the
Bill.</p><h5><a name="06071457000555"></a>4.44

Skelmersdale:</b> My Lords, I understand exactly why
the noble Earl chose to petition the Chief Whip to debate the Second
Reading of his Bill today. I am sorry that it falls to me to respond on
behalf of my party, rather than my noble friend the Duke of Montrose
who has to be elsewhere this evening. He particularly regrets that,
because this is the 300th anniversary of the period of negotiation for
the Act of Union. Seven generations ago, my noble friend&#146;s 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_988"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 988</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>ancestor was the High Admiral and president of the council that
empowered those
negotiations.</p><p><a name="06071457000441"></a>The Bill provides
a mechanism to start the dismemberment of that Act. Not only that, but
it does so in a most peculiar way, proposing to wreck the
constitutional settlement between Scotland and England. I accept, of
course, that the ScotlandAct 1998 is a variant of that old
settlement bygiving devolution&#151;but, importantly, not
self-government&#151;to the people of
Scotland.</p><p><a name="06071457000442"></a>I am surprised that a
member of the Liberal Democrat Party is proposing this Bill at all, and
am glad to hear from both the noble Earl and the noble Lord, Lord
Roper, that it is not the policy of their party. In my more cynical
moments, I would suppose that if it were, the Liberal Democrats must be
seeking electoral advantage in Scotland by teaming up with the only
party there that seeks full independence: the Scottish National Party.
If there really was a call for independence, that party would be doing
much better in the polls than it currently is, irrespective of what the
noble Earl said a few minutes ago. The Scottish people always have the
option of electing those who hold the same views they do at a general
election&#151;as we do in this country&#151;and more frequently
than every 10 years, as is envisaged in the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06071457000443"></a>The Bill envisages that a
mere 14 per cent of the local government electorate, who of course
include people who would not be eligible to vote in a general election,
could trigger the request for a referendum Bill. The Bill&#146;s
500,000 is indeed a low figure to start the ball rolling to petition
another place to introduce such a referendum Bill. If the subsequent
referendum is successful&#151;if the petitioners get their
will&#151;presumably the noble Earl wants the Westminster Parliament
to act on the results of that referendum. I wonder why the Bill does
not say so, because it seems such an obvious thing for the noble Earl
to want.</p><p><a name="06071457000444"></a>I could nitpick about
the various details of this Bill, but time is short. Suffice to say
that I expect such a deluge of cold water from the Minister that this
debate will, I hope, be the end of the
matter.</p><h5><a name="06071457000556"></a>4.47
pm</h5><p><a name="06071457000445"></a><b><a name="06071457000600"></a>Lord
Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> My Lords, here comes the
cold water.</p><p><a name="06071457000446"></a>This has been a
short debate on an important subject. I point out to the noble Earl
that the research for this speech was carried out in Dover House
beneath a portrait of John Erskine, the sixth Earl of Mar, whose
history included service on both sides of the argument. The portrait
may have to look for a new home if the Bill were to progress.</p><p><a name="06071457000447"></a>In accordance with the conventions of the
House, the Government will not seek to block the Bill being given a
Second Reading should the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, wish it to
have one. However, it will not surprise the noble Earl, or any other
Member of this House, that the Government do not favour the Bill and
would have no intention of bringing forward such a measure.
Scotland&#146;s position as an integral part 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_989"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 989</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the United Kingdom, with its own Parliament for devolved matters,
remains the settled will of the people of
Scotland.</p><p><a name="06071457000448"></a>The noble Earl has
been in correspondencewith the Lord Chancellor on the
sovereignty of the Scottish Parliament. He is quite right to point out
that the Union of the Kingdoms and Parliaments of Scotland and England
would be for Westminster. However, the Government believe that
Scotland&#146;s position within the United Kingdom, with its own
Parliament for devolved matters should, as I have said, remain the
settled will of the people of
Scotland.</p><p><a name="06071457000449"></a>Today&#146;s union
may be a different union to that of 1707, but is made up of partner
nations with a common history, common language and common cultures,
which finds strength not only in these similarities but also in its
diversity. It is a union that means together we punch well above our
weight on the world stage, and with far greater effect than if we broke
up the United Kingdom.</p><p><a name="06071457000450"></a>The
United Kingdom Parliament is an institution that is self-governing and
self-reforming. This Government are proud of their record of reforming
our political institutions so that they are better able to do their
jobs. We are proud that, since devolution, our institutions are more
closely aligned with the people they serve and represent. These
institutions reflect the wishes of the people of those countries to
have a greater say and greater accountability for many of the issues
that directly affect their day-to-day
lives.</p><p><a name="06071457000451"></a>Devolution in Scotland
and Wales is the integral part of this package. It was supported in a
general election where the party proposing devolution won a convincing
victory over those who supported independence and those who saw no need
for change. Referendums, based on manifesto commitments, reinforced the
idea that Scotland, in particular, saw the need for a devolved
Parliament responsible for a wide range of domestic matters, but
Scotland&#146;s people also recognise the benefits of remaining part
of the United Kingdom&#151;economic stability, more people in
employment and a focus on public service delivery; they also recognise
the sense in doing certain things&#151;foreign affairs, trade and
industry, social security, employment and the constitution
itself&#151;at a UK level. Devolution is built on the retention of a
United Kingdom Parliament where Scotland continues to play its part and
this structure delivers the right balance between responsibility,
accountability and representation.</p><p><a name="06071457000452"></a>But devolution has a wider purpose, which
is to preserve the union so that the partner nations feel that they can
give effect to their wishes and aspirations within the union. How could
the union survive if its democratic institutions did not chime with its
people? There have been four opportunities since 1997 for the people of
Scotland to indicate that they are not happy with our existing forms of
governance and they have resoundingly not done so in elections to
Westminster or to the Scottish Parliament. The votes of the nationalist
parties have remained in the minority, and the different settlements
represent the different ways in which the people of Scotland and Wales
want to 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_990"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 990</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>articulate their relationship with the United Kingdom as a whole and
with each of the partner
nations.</p><p><a name="06071457000453"></a>The noble Lord suggests
that a 500,000 signatory petition should be the method by which a
referendum is triggered that unpicks this relationship, but the history
of petitions shows us that they are perhaps not the most reliable of
constitutional tools. I am sure noble Lords are aware that the
signatures of Queen Victoria, Sir Robert Peel and the Duke of
Wellington appeared on the Chartists&#146; final petition. I do not
for one moment suggest the noble Earl is advocating fraud such as that,
but the method is fraught with difficulty and open to abuse and
challenge. How could we possibly justify the use of such a procedure to
trigger a process that would have untold costs, monetary and
otherwise?</p><p><a name="06071457000454"></a>I reaffirm the
Government&#146;s intention, in accordance with convention, to not
seek to block the Bill. However, I very much hope that the noble Earl
will not push it to a Second Reading, and force a change in the
portraits at Dover House. He may wish to remember Thomas
Carlyle&#146;s warning:</p><ul><a name="06071457000505"></a>&#147;Painful for a person is
rebellious independence, only in loving companionship with his
associates does a person feel
safe&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06071457000455"></a>The noble
Earl&#146;s Bill would be the first step towards the break up of a
union in which this Government and, I believe, Parliament and the
nation, have absolute faith. Throwing in the towel on a renewed
partnership of Parliaments and peoples that has so much to offer is not
a road to
take.</p><h5><a name="06071457000557"></a>4.54

the Public Bill Office and, in particular,Mr Nick Besly, for
helping me to turn my ideas into something that could be presented to
Parliament. I also thank all noble Lords who have taken part in the
debate.</p><p><a name="06071457000457"></a>A recent poll by YouGov
identified that 49 per cent of those who answered the poll in Scotland
were in favour of political independence, whereas 41 per cent were
against, leaving 8 per cent who did not know. Much more significantly,
80 per cent of the same sample believed that sovereignty should be
decided as a single issue, not to be bundled into a general election;
12 per cent were against and 8 per cent did not
know.</p><p><a name="06071457000458"></a>I am also aware that the
maverick&#151;I am sure that he will not mind being called
that&#151;ex-Conservative MSP Brian Monteith is currently proposing a
referendum on the parliamentary union, believing that disarray among
the independence movement would lead to the parliamentary union being
retained for a generation. That is a wake-up call to the independence
movement. My noble friend wondered about a bicameral parliament of
Scotland. I very much doubt that that will happen. Personally, I want
to adopt something akin to the Norwegian model, whereby the Storting
divides itself into two Houses, the Lagting and the Odelsting, on
occasion.</p><p><a name="06071457000459"></a>The Minister reminded
me about the portrait that my great-grandfather gifted to the then
Scottish Office in the 1920s. It is rather fine. However, I have 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_991"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column 991</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>six others&#151;the man was clearly vain as well as many other
things&#151;and I can think of one more in Geneva. I would be very
happy if that one was to remain in Dover House. There is something
special about the idea that someone whom this Parliament arraigned for
high treason should be&#151;or his portrait should be&#151;hanging
in the office of the Secretary of State for
Scotland.</p><p><a name="06071457000460"></a>I had hoped that we
would have a littlediscussion about whether 500,000, or
one-eighth of the population, was sufficient to trigger a referendum of
this magnitude. I think that opinion is that it would need to be a
slightly larger number. I was asked why I did not press forward to
connect the Bill directly to a referendum. The answer is that I am
trying to respect Westminster's concept of the supremacy of Parliament.
This Parliament would have to decide to do it. This Parliament does not
take orders from anyone&#151;although on this issue, I might agree
that it should.</p><p><a name="06071457000461"></a>As for fraud, in
my initial drafts, I included in the provision for the petition that
not only did people had to submit their name and address&#151;which
is, apparently, all that the House of Commons requires for a
petition&#151;but their number on the electoral roll. That would be
quite a test and would show how serious they were. You could not fob
someone off on the doorstep by signing it to get rid of them, because

the House of Commons
procedure.</p><p><a name="06071457000462"></a>Obliquely, the issue
of economics arose. One would not approach sovereignty based on an
economic case. After all, we made a complete nonsense of joining the
euro on that basis. People must want to do it or not. Looking around
the North Atlantic, I can see only states that have broken away from
unions and have prospered. So I conclude: is there a democratic pathway
to political independence under the Crown? I do not think that we yet
have one. I regard myself as a unionist&#151;a person in favour of
the Union of the Crowns&#151;seeking a better settlement allowing
Scotland a foreign policy.</p><p><a name="06071457000463"></a>To
the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, I must say that there are three
parties in Scotland actively seeking independence: the SNP, the
Scottish Socialist Party and the Greens. Finally, I hope the House will
give the Bill a Second Reading, bearing in mind that there is no Motion

Statement.</p><p><a name="06071467000047"></a>As part of the
Government&#146;s continuing commitment to investigate Gulf
veterans&#146; illnesses openly and honestly, data on the mortality
of veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf conflict are published regularly. The
most recent figures for the period1 April 1991 to 30 June 2006
are published today as a national statistic on the Defence Analytical
Services Agency website.</p><p><a name="06071467000048"></a>The
data for Gulf veterans are compared to that of a control group known as

a similar profile in terms of gender, service, Regular/Reservists
status and rank, who were in service on 1 January 1991 but who were not

following Written Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="06071467000052"></a>During the passage of
the 2004 Housing Bill the Government made commitments to consider
whether it is possible to devise an approach to overcrowding that
provides for some incremental improvement in standards over a period;
and to consult on how the new Section 216 powers could be used to amend
the statutory overcrowding standards in Part X of the Housing Act
1985.</p><p><a name="06071467000053"></a>The Government are today
publishing a discussion document, <I>Tackling Overcrowding in
England</I>, which sets out options for revising the outdated
definition of overcrowding and developing long-term solutions. This
document is designed to stimulate and garner ideas about how best we
can tackle the problemsof overcrowding. DCLG officials will be
actively engaging stakeholders in discussions, which will conclude on
15 September 2006. Copies of the document have been placed in the
Libraries of both Houses.</p><p><a name="06071467000054"></a>The
Government are also providing a &#163;51 million package for tackling
overcrowding and increasing the number of settled homes for people in
temporary accommodation. The funding announced today is focused on two
key areas.</p><p><a name="06071467000055"></a>Some &#163;21
million will be made available for immediate action to tackle
overcrowding, by increasing the supply of family homes in London. This
could include converting existing homes to create extra bedrooms;
adding extensions to existing council stock; building or purchasing
additional homes, or buying back right-to-buy homes. Five co-ordinators
will also be funded to work across London to tackle the most immediate
problems of overcrowding.</p><p><a name="06071467000056"></a>Some
&#163;30 million will also be provided to fund an Extra Home pilot,

government, the Low Pay Commission recommended that the accommodation
offset provisions should continue to apply to all workers housed by
their employer in all circumstances; and that Government update
existing guidance and raise awareness. It also recommended that the
Government should implement legislative measures to prevent employers
using the device of a separate accommodation company to evade the
offset.</p><p><a name="06071467000059"></a>The
Government accepted the need to update guidance on the accommodation
offset in its response in March 2006. In the House of Commons debate on
3 July and the Lords debate of 4 July 2006 on the draft National
Minimum Wage Regulations 1999 (Amendment Regulations) 2006 the
Government announced that it agreed with the Low Pay Commission's
recommendation that the accommodation offset should apply in all
situations, but believed that legislative measures were not required.
Existing legislation already covers a wide range of circumstances in
which the employer provides accommodation to workers. We announced our
intention to consult on the clarity of the revised
guidance.</p><p><a name="06071467000060"></a>I am

of Defence: Porton Down
Trials</h3><p><a name="06071467000066"></a><b><a name="06071467000087"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Lord
Drayson):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary
Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Tom Watson) has made the
following Written Ministerial
Statement.</p><p><a name="06071467000067"></a>On 21 November 2000
the then Minister for Veteran&#146;s Affairs (Dr Lewis Moonie)
announced a package of measures intended to address emerging concerns
that some Porton Down volunteers might have suffered unusual ill-health
because of their participation in trials at the Chemical Defence
Establishment, Porton Down. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has sought to
address these concerns through a number of measures. These include a
historical survey of the Porton Down service volunteer programme
1939-89 (the period of most interest to volunteers), which is published
today. It sets out a full description of the size and shape of the
studies in which volunteers took part, and explores their ethical
aspects. Also, the MoD is funding an independently run epidemiological
study, overseen by the Medical Research Council, to assess the
incidence of cancer and mortality among former Porton Down volunteers.
The study is expected to report in 2007 and it is hoped that the
results will be published in peer reviewed literature shortly
thereafter.</p><p><a name="06071467000068"></a>Copies of the
historical survey will be placed in the Library of the House and it
will also be available on the MoD website at
www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/Issues/PortonDownHistoricalSurvey.htm.</p><p><a name="06071467000069"></a>The
survey has been conducted by MoD officials who had no previous
professional contact with Porton Down. No member of Porton Down staff
was involved in determining the ground that the survey should cover or
the documents which were to be consulted. Porton Down's advice has been
sought in order to clarify explanations of scientific
matters&#151;for example, the effect of agents and treatments on
physiology and the metrics used to measure doses and exposures. They
have not had any further editorial
involvement.</p><p><a name="06071467000070"></a>I would like to
place on record my deep appreciation of Professor Sir Ian Kennedy's
contribution as the independent supervisor to this project. I know that
the survey team appreciated his valuable guidance. Sir Ian's assessment
of Porton Down's conduct appears at the end of the survey. It draws on
the descriptions of the trials conducted by the Chemical Defence
Establishment, the information presented on how service volunteers were
recruited and on Dr Alasdair Maclean's analysis of ethics
codes/guidelines and practice. No attempt has been 
<notus-date day="14" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS67"></a><b>14 July 2006 : Column WS67</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>made by the MoD to summarise Sir Ian's assessment, to avoid any
inadvertent changes in meaning or
language.</p><p><a name="06071467000071"></a>Sir Ian identifies a
small number of trials spread over several decades which he considers
&#147;amount to serious departures from what should have been
done&#148;. However, he is clear that they &#147;are few in
number&#148;. Sir Ian also warns that these studies must be viewed in
the historical context of both the Second World War and the Cold War.
The MoD welcomes Sir Ian's view that &#147;a very great debt of
gratitude is clearly owed to those who volunteered to take part in the
research at Porton and to those who carried it
out&#148;.</p><p><a name="06071467000072"></a>The MoD takes the
health of veterans very seriously indeed. We are seeking to address the
concerns of former volunteers who are worried about their health and it
is for this reason that the MoD established an independent medical
assessment programme (MAP) at St Thomas&#146; Hospital in London.
Attendance at the MAP is free of charge but is conditional on the
provision of details of participation in the Porton Down service
volunteer programme and access to individual NHS medical records. If
volunteers have concerns about their health and are interested in
attending the MAP they should contact Porton Down on their helpline
number (0800 7832521) in order to obtain their records of attendance.
Volunteers also have the opportunity to inspect their own records
relating to the trials in which they took part at Porton Down.
Alternatively, they can contact the MAP direct on the MAP Helpline 0800
169 5401 or ask their GP for a referral. The MoD welcomes the
publication of this historical survey today as being complementary to
these existing
resources.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06071467000010"></a>NHS:

medical regulation, my noble friend the Minister of State, the Lord
Warner, commissioned a review. Shortly thereafter, the Department of
Health elected to conduct a parallel review of the arrangements in
place for the regulation of the other healthcare professions in order
to provide consistency of approach and in recognition of the blurring
of traditional job roles in
healthcare.</p><p><a name="06071467000076"></a>The review of
medical regulation was conducted by Sir Liam Donaldson, Chief Medical
Officer for England. His report, <I>Good doctors, safer patients</I> is
published today, along with the parallel departmental review of
non-medical regulation. Both reports focus upon the protection of the
interests and safety of
patients.</p><p><a name="06071467000077"></a><I>Good doctors, safer
patients</I> is a rigorous and thorough report, taking into account
systems of regulation in other high-risk industries, systems in
operation in other jurisdictions and the views of the profession and
the public. It is the first comprehensive review of medical regulation
for over 30 years. There are 44 recommendations. The parallel review of
non-medical regulation followed a similar
process.</p><p><a name="06071467000078"></a>Among the key themes
raised in the two reports are: changes to the governance and
accountability of the professional regulators; the importance of
operationalised standards against which to regulate; the appropriate
legal standard of proof; the introduction of an independent
adjudicator; a spectrum of revalidation across all clinical
professions; and devolution of some regulatory powers to the local
level. Professional regulation is a complex area. I very much welcome
the publication of these reports and the authoritative contribution
that they make.</p><p><a name="06071467000079"></a>Today, I am
announcing a period of consultation on the proposals put forward by the
Chief Medical Officer in <I>Good doctors, safer patients</I>, and upon
the options outlined in the parallel review of non-medical regulation.
As regulation of most professions is a matter reserved to Westminster,
comments on the reports are invited on a UK-wide basis. Matters
relating to specific devolved administrations may be copied to the
appropriate administration. Both reports are accompanied by initial
regulatory impact assessments. Copies of the reports have been placed
in the
Library.</p>

Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 to enable the police to gain advance
bulk access to passenger, crew and service information on air and sea
journeys within the United Kingdom for certain purposes. The new power
will enable the police to gain effective intelligence on the movement
of known terrorist suspects and criminals and will allow them to build
up a detailed picture of suspect passengers, travel patterns and
networks. Improved intelligence will result in more targeted
interventions and reduce the likelihood of innocent travellers being
stopped. It is not intended to help the police to detect and prosecute
the theft of passengers&#146; baggage at airports, which is more
appropriate to Clause 10. Clause 10 introduces a new power for police
to stop and search any person at an aerodrome, amending Part III of the
Aviation Security Act 1982, to enable a police constable to stop and
search, without warrant, any person, vehicle or aircraft in any area of
an aerodrome where he has reasonable grounds to suspect that criminal
activity has, or is about to, take place. The aim of this new power is
to reduce opportunities for criminal activity at airports and, in turn,
simultaneously to reduce opportunities for organised crime and
terrorist activity. As such, it will extend to crimes involving the
theft of and from passengers&#146; baggage although at this stage we
have no reliable estimates of the number of prosecutions that may
