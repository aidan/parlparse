However, I am disappointed that he has not thought fit to use today to adopt the COPD strategy, which was left up and ready, as it were, when the previous Government left office. Apart from anything else, I wonder whether he is aware that the British Lung Foundation's research shows that up to 80 per cent of GPs cannot tell the difference between asthma and COPD. That is a very serious issue for prescribing. The adoption of the COPD strategy would bring systematic training and awareness raising of this condition.</p>

That has to include COPD. We have to ensure that everything that we do fits into the proposed new architecture of the NHS. In the mean time, we will continue to work with key organisations and with clinical leads for COPD and asthma to make sure that change happens. I know that a great deal of activity is in hand across the NHS to improve outcomes for patients with COPD and asthma as a result of the good work undertaken so far.</p>

Will he consider whether this is not an argument for further investment in child and adolescent mental health services, so that children and young people suffering from anxiety and depression receive the help that they need at an early stage and do not reach for alcohol, tobacco and other substances that can have these awful outcomes in later life?</p>

He is absolutely right that smoking is an activity that puts one at high risk of COPD and that smoking is closely associated with poor mental health. Fifty per cent of the tobacco smoked in this country is smoked by those with mental health problems. We are determined to continue efforts to discourage smoking in the general population. We are also keen to raise awareness of good lung health generally, which brings us back to the Question on the Order Paper. To a large extent, such efforts will fall to the new public health service in future.</p>

Of course, we will keep this issue under review. However, it is important for all patients, including those who have contracted Clostridium difficile infection, to have a well-balanced diet.</p>

Is he aware that C. difficile costs the country about £100 million a year and prebiotics are very cheap? Prebiotics are a food supplement that bypasses the stomach and goes into the gut and helps to keep a person fit, so that they may not get C. difficile. Does he agree that anything is worth trying with such a debilitating and dangerous condition?</p>

More than 25,000 cases of C. difficile infection are reported annually and there remain significant variations in outcomes among organisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="10111743000021"></a>In principle, prebiotics should be beneficial, but there is in fact little good evidence to show that they work or that food can provide a prebiotic effect. There is likely to be considerable inter-patient variation in the gut flora response to prebiotics, which could be exacerbated by differences in diet.

As my noble friend indicated, the company may be seeking agreement from the US FDA to fast-track the application when the development programme is complete, as that would give them access to the US market. It is of course for the manufacturer to decide when and if it wishes to seek access to the market in the UK and the wider EU.</p>

It is appropriate for me to emphasise that, as he will well know, inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics is above all what has caused the high levels of infection that we have seen in recent years.

Prebiotics are non-digestible carbohydrates that act by promoting the growth and/or activity of probiotic bacteria in the gut. The most common prebiotics are fructo-oligosaccharides, inulin and galacto-oligosaccharides. They are found in various vegetables and fruit, such as tomatoes, asparagus and bananas. The best example of a probiotic is yoghurt.</p>

He reminds your Lordships that there is a long border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan and that many Tajik people live in north Afghanistan and play a relevant, decisive and, we hope, fully helpful part in seeking to pacify that country and meet our priorities there. He makes valuable points. Also relevant are his references to the narcotics problem, some of the cross-border trade that has been going on and some of the difficulties with the Uzbek border of the country as well.</p>

However, DfID does not see this as a proper tool of development and empowerment of ordinary people; it is in effect given low priority because DfID thinks of the British Council as the main supplier. To what extent will the Government help the Tajik Government in respect of English language teaching in schools and universities and in the training of teachers of the English language?</p>

He is certainly correct that this is a valuable part of the support for the future and something on which we must seek to build. There are obviously priorities for DfID to look at. Indeed, DfID is looking at recurrently reviewing the whole range of its support operations, almost around the world, including those in the Caucasus and in the region that we are discussing. That does not deny for a moment, however, that language training is one of the great exports and assets that we can contribute to peace and stability in the region, which I hope will continue to be the case.</p>

In abolishing the nine autonomous organisations, we have set ourselves a challenging task to achieve that by March 2012.

The introduction of ID cards was controversial and subject to intense debate in your Lordships' House. We on this side saw the ID card scheme as a convenient and secure way of asserting one's identity in everyday life. The card was more affordable than a passport and functioned as a valid travel document throughout Europe, and we saw it as a way of demonstrating eligibility to work and as proof of age for young people or those without a driving licence. The parties opposite disagreed with that principle and in their election manifestos argued for abolition of the cards. For that reason, we have not at any stage sought to

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="10111743000068"></a>The point of my amendment is this. As a result of the introduction of ID cards, 12,000 or so members of the public purchased a card for £30. The cards were for a period of 10 years. As a result of the Bill, should it successfully pass, the cards are to be cancelled within a short time, many years before their due expiry date. That is fair enough; it is a decision of the Government and is why they have brought this legislation to your Lordships' House. What is not fair is the Government's decision to refuse to refund the £30 to those who purchased an ID card.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="10111743000069"></a>I have been rather disappointed by the Minister's somewhat unsympathetic attitude. On Second Reading, she said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="10111743000245"></a>"We realise that some people who spent £30 for a card with a 10-year life expectancy will be disappointed that it will be cancelled later this year without any refund, but those who chose to buy a card did so in the full knowledge of the unambiguous statements by the coalition parties that the scheme would be scrapped if we came to office. They cannot now expect taxpayers to bail them out".</p>

<p><a name="10111743000239"></a>She went on to say that,</p>
<ul><a name="10111743000258"></a>"citizens have to be aware of what is going on around them. It was clear that this scheme would have a risky future ahead of it".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 18/10/10; col. 715.]</ul>
<p><a name="10111743000240"></a>She then dismissed the potential refund of £30 as,</p>
<ul><a name="10111743000259"></a>"rather less than probably most people pay for a monthly subscription to Sky".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 18/10/10; col. 742.]</ul>
<p><a name="10111743000241"></a>The Minister seemed to be saying that members of the public are meant to have a thorough understanding of the views of political parties, make an assessment of who is going to win an election and then make their dispositions accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="10111743000242"></a>So even if you accept the argument that members of the public were meant to read the newspapers to get an understanding of what the opposition parties were saying would happen with ID cards in the event that they won-that even though a member of the public had bought a card for 10 years, it was tough luck-the fact is that the position was not clear in the media and there were conflicting statements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="10111743000075"></a>I encourage noble Lords to think about the wider principle, not just about ID cards and £30. An incoming Government are saying that because they disagreed with the original policy of a previous Government, it is simply tough luck that members of the public decided to act on that policy. They are simply expected to have this right taken away from them without any possible compensation or recompense at all. I think that that is a rather extraordinary principle to adopt. I also think that it impacts on the reputation of governments as a whole. Does the Minister not see that, in refusing to refund the £30, she is really developing a new principle which can only reduce trust in government generally?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="10111743000076"></a>I also point out to the Minister that, in the impact assessment which accompanies the Bill, and in the option that the Government believe is the right option, provision is made for the termination of contracts with contractors who were employed to develop the ID infrastructure. Why is it acceptable to recompense contractors but not members of the public? Of course she will say that there is contract law, but this surely goes much wider than contract law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="10111743000077"></a>I would like to quote from a letter that appeared in the <I>Times</I><I></I>on 9 June 2010. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="10111743000247"></a>"Sir, I received last week an undated letter from the chief executive of the Identity &amp; Passport Service. His letter contained a most extraordinary statement: 'I am writing to let you know that the Government has announced it intends to cancel the identity card scheme and the National Identity Register. To minimise the cost to taxpayers, the Government has also announced that refunds will not be provided for current cardholders'".</p>

<p><a name="10111743000243"></a>The letter goes on to say:</p>
<ul><a name="10111743000260"></a>"It is beyond belief that a government department can offer a ten-year service to the public, charge a fee and then, after a few weeks, announce that the service is to be withdrawn and no money refunded. Were such an action to be proposed by a private business, it would create an outcry from whichever government department was responsible".</ul>
<p><a name="10111743000078"></a>The letter concludes:</p>
<ul><a name="10111743000261"></a>"I believe a large proportion of those issued were purchased, after encouragement by the Government, by young people, to whom £30 is a significant sum. Can there be any possible justification for penalising them in this way?".</ul>
<a name="101117-0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="10111743000079"></a>That was from the noble Lord, Lord Levene, and I think that the comments he made in June are as relevant today as they were four months ago. I very much hope that the Minister, even at this late stage, will agree that members of the public who request to have the £30 recompensed will have the money refunded. I beg to move.</p>

I led the opposition from these benches to the Identity Cards Bill. I spent a good deal of one year of my life opposing it. I am therefore utterly delighted that this Bill is before the House. However, I have to say that, for me, it is slighted by the denial of reimbursement of the fee paid by 12,000 of our fellow citizens when they took out this card. Had they been told at the time they took out the card that they were in danger of losing the card and not being reimbursed, then that would be different. Had the coalition partners in their election manifestos said not merely that they

But neither of those circumstances prevails. I really do not think that it is remotely acceptable, for the reasons which the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, laid out in moving the amendment. It simply is not acceptable to say, "Ah, but they should have realised", which is what it boils down to.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="10111743000081"></a>Governments must set an example of the standards they expect of private industry. Had private industry engaged in a tactic of this sort, noble Lords on all the Benches would have been up in arms, and rightly so. I feel probably more strongly than I ought to that there is a simple, basic issue of fairness in this. Since this coalition launched itself as a coalition on the basis of fairness, I felt compelled, contrary to the wishes of my Whips, to put my name to this amendment, and I have done so with some conviction.</p>

Will the noble Baroness tell the House whether she disputes that the card is property for the purposes of Article 1 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights. Its cancellation is therefore a deprivation of property and compensation is payable. It would be most unfortunate if those whose cards are being taken away need to litigate this matter.</p>

I still oppose this Bill in abolishing them. But certainly I think that the Government are being very petty in terms of refusing compensation to those who bought the cards, particularly as it appears that they are paying compensation to contractors which supplied machinery, software and everything else to set up the ID scheme. They will be paid full compensation. The argument is that they have a contract between the Government and them.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="10111743000084"></a>I would argue that the people who bought ID cards equally have a contract between themselves as individuals and the Government from whom they purchased the card. If that is the case, they are as much entitled to compensation as the companies which are being compensated for loss of earnings and profits as a result of the card scheme being cancelled. Will the noble Baroness spell out exactly what compensation is being paid to these companies? I gather that the computers holding the information will be physically smashed up. Will she also include the cost of that smashing up? There must be a cost to the public purse involved in all of that. Perhaps the noble Baroness will spell some of that out during her speech.</p>

In fact, they were helping the Government out. Although it was not this coalition Government, it was a Labour Government. Nevertheless, those people had every reason to trust the Government and trust a future Government to give them some recompense if the system of ID cards did not go ahead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="10111743000086"></a>I have to say to the noble Baroness that the coalition is in need of support at the present time. Would it not be in their own interests to show good will and to show that they are cognisant of people's feelings and do not want them to feel offended? Would it not, for a small cost, be better if the Government supported, or accepted, this amendment, which might do them some good electorally? You never know.</p>

The complexity seemed to be manufactured and the cost involved figures that I could not recognise; nor could anybody else who studied it, given that banks issue cards every day of the week gratis and do not expect it to cost a tremendous amount of money. On the other hand, I was convinced by the noble Baroness's determination not to move on the issue and not least by the discourtesy shown-not that I blame the Minister for this, because she has always been courteous. But I asked two questions in Committee and I did not get the courtesy of an answer. I indicated that I was happy to accept the answer betwixt then and Report. I asked whether the Government had consulted the Government of Gibraltar, who issue travel cards and replace them at very little expense for the same kind of number as the 12,000 that have been issued in this country to people who are not airside workers. I also asked how many ID cards from different countries were accepted by the UK Immigration Service at British ports and airports. I did not get an answer to that, either.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="10111743000088"></a>But those unanswered questions were not what determined me not to move Amendment 1. I thought that the moral high ground was rather greater on Amendment 2 than on Amendment 1. Amendment 1, although it was justified in my view, would have applied to a number of the 12,000 people and it would have pre-empted consideration of Amendment 2. Amendment 2 applies to everybody who voluntarily applied for a card, meaning that they at least would have the consolation of the restoration of the money they paid. For me the most telling argument for why this should happen concerns the impact assessment that the Government carried out. The civil servants who drew up that impact assessment put as the case for refunds that a non-refund would mean a reputational loss to the Government-a reputational loss for the sake of £400,000. I said in Committee and I say it again: the reputation of any democratic Government in this country, of whatever source, colour and coalition, has to be worth £400,000. It is de minimis in departmental budget terms and infinitesimal in national budget terms, but not to those 12,000 people, many of whom are elderly or very young. Business people might use the card for travel, young people would like the card because it would get them into places where they needed to carry their passports, such as clubs and pubs where they had to prove their age, and elderly people could use it as a travel document although it was also a document of some cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="10111743000089"></a>It seemed to me that the Minister was saying that if you are wealthy enough that £30 does not matter, you will not complain. Ipso facto, if you are poor and you do not complain, you will suffer in silence. Again, for

I do not believe that any Member of your Lordships' House or the other place can sit easy when this happens and we have the opportunity with this amendment to remedy it.</p>

That is assuming that 12,000 people will be seeking £30. I very much doubt whether everybody who has paid their £30 will in fact be doing so, so the sum is probably rather less than the noble Lord, Lord Brett, was talking about. I wondered, as a sort of compromise, whether it would not be possible for those who had paid their £30 to be allowed to offset it against the cost of their next passport so that the cost of their passport is reduced by that amount. That might in some way alleviate this disheartening feeling that everybody seems to have about this rather abrupt and unfair arrangement.</p>

I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Brett, because I see that the card could still have some use. Although the national identity register, which is what we all objected to, has been removed, having a bit of plastic as a travel document to get around Europe would have been useful and still might be. Some of the 12,000 people concerned bought the card for that. Like the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, I certainly think that those people who thought that they had bought a plastic passport should be allowed to offset it against the cost of getting the more expensive passport that they will now require to go to Europe. For them, it was effectively a cheap way of getting a passport if you needed to travel to Europe.</p>

If you expect a member of the public, seven months ahead of the general election, to be able to predict its outcome, there are a lot of geniuses among the public whom we ought immediately to recruit to become pollsters. They may be all the people who did not buy the card. To me, it looks vindictive and nothing else. This matter could be a PR negative for the Government-a little spark that could catch the newspapers' imagination. They will find someone who feels really hard done-by. It will get blown up; it will be in the <I>Daily Mail</I>, which will say that something must be done about it, but it will be too late by then.</p>

I cannot see the problem in saying, "The only people who get refunded are those who turn up with a card. If you hand in a card, you get 30 quid". It would be as simple as that. That would not be very expensive to administer. If the Government wished to give the contract to one of the large systems integrators, however, they would end up with a bill for about £5 million, because it is their job to make sure that partners in America are well satisfied with lots of dosh. They are the people whom the Government will have to pay at the end of all this. They will have had unbreakable contracts, so they will have to be paid several million pounds for breaking the contract. A large slice of that will end up in American partners' pockets. The poor old citizens of this country will get absolutely-I will use unparliamentary language if I go on.</p>

Even if the card belongs to the Government and is non-transferable, that card gave you rights-that is what they sold it on. I am quite sure that that is expropriation and that there could be a claim under the ECHR. It will go on top of the Digital Economy Act, which we were advising the Government against the other day. So they will have a nice time in the courts.</p>

If they bought it, as it seems, for a purpose, and that purpose no longer obtains, there is no doubt that we are taking away something from them. Surely, therefore, the answer is not to recompense them but to enable them to continue for the period of the card's validity to be able to do what it is they bought the card for in the first place. That is a sensible and proper way of doing it. Like the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay-though I may express myself in less elevated language-I feel that the public have every reason to believe that, if they buy something from the Government for a period of time, they should be able to continue to use it in that way. Whereas recompense is an expensive and untidy way of doing it, I really do not see why they cannot go on using it for the time that they were supposed to use it for.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="10111743000101"></a>My view is that this issue is finely balanced between taxpayers and individual cardholders. It is not the same as a consumer situation where there are two parties, the supplier of goods and the purchaser of goods. There are three parties, and the third party is the taxpayer. I understand the point that this is a comparatively small sum of money, but comparatively small sums have more value than they did a year or two ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="10111743000102"></a>The point has been made about whether this would be expropriation. That point was not taken up by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. No doubt the Minister will say something about that. I hope, too, that she will say what would be required if the cards were to go on having a use. As I understand it, it would still be necessary to retain the register. Otherwise, the cards are pieces of plastic that do not relate to anything. Quite apart from our objection to the offensiveness of the register, the cost and perhaps the confusion of retaining the register would be issues.</p>

It is not just that it is a small sum of money, so it is particularly stupid not to pay it, but, as has been said, this sort of thing does the Government-any Government, those of the ruling political class-absolutely no good. The public will say, "They are just not to be trusted. They just can't do things fairly". Whoever was the civil servant and others who put up the suggestion that this money should not be compensated or that the card should not be used, I beg them to think again.

Indeed, when I came in here this afternoon, I did not think I was going to take part in it today. However, I have listened to this debate and I find myself in total agreement with the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss. It seems to me that, from looking at this as objectively as one can, this is an issue about the continuity of government. The identity cards were not sold on the basis of, "You are buying it from a Labour Government, but if another one come in, things may change and you may have to renegotiate it". The contract-if it was a formal contract-was with the Government, and it is the Government who are now reneging on the contract. I feel very uneasy about it and I hope the Minister will take this back and have another look at it. It is interesting, listening to this debate, that the only person, I think, who has suggested that what the Government are proposing should take place was the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. Everybody else seems unanimously against the Government's position. There is a famous dictum about a hole-I do not need to repeat it. This seems to be an occasion when the Government should think very hard.</p>

It requires the surrender of the ID card for there to be a reimbursement of £30. There may well be a category of person who would like the £30 back and feel entitled in law to get the £30 back but who actually want to keep their ID card. Of course, there is a further issue here, which may have struck a number of us. With only 12,000 or so cards in circulation, the residual value of the identity card in future might well be a great deal higher than £30. So the question may arise of how many people with an eye to the future would be keen to get that £30 back now but to retain their identity card.

It has always been the intention, whether in opposition or in government, to scrap the ID cards scheme at the least possible extra cost to the taxpayer. Our primary purpose has been to prevent further expense being incurred when we can avoid it. We have no option but to pay compensation to some contractors because we are tied in by the contracts negotiated by our predecessors. That is a contractual agreement, and we are negotiating at the moment what that final sum should be. We do not agree that there is a contract between the Government and cardholders who received a service, nor do we believe that there is any expropriation of property or rights under it. The cardholders are not card-owners; the noble Lords who said that the card was government property were quite right to say so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="10111743000116"></a>The Identity and Passport Service has estimated that the cost of cancelling the ID cards scheme and the national identity register will be up to £5 million. This includes an estimated figure for compensation to the contractors, which I have just mentioned, destruction costs, staffing and other administrative matters. They are all necessary costs that we cannot avoid in abolishing the scheme. A refund scheme would add 10 per cent to that cost, which we do not consider to be a trivial addition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="10111743000117"></a>Noble Lords have talked about principle. One can look at that in several ways. One of the principles that seems to be on offer this afternoon is that one set of taxpayers should refund another set of taxpayers. This does not seem to be a sensible arrangement. Some say that the sum is only about £400,000-one of the noble Lords mentioned that sum-the inference being that in the grand scheme of things this is entirely insignificant. Certainly, compared with the cost of the ID card scheme that has already been paid out-over £290 million-another half a million pounds might not seem significant. That is not, I am afraid, the attitude that the coalition Government take to public spending. We have demonstrated that we have a commitment to ensuring that unnecessary and unjustifiable expenditure is stopped and that we focus on delivering more for less. We are not therefore in a position to offer this refund.</p>

Could we not, for instance, set the cost of this against the cost of the next passport or, indeed, use the lifetime for which the present card was available? There are associated problems. I do not want to detain the House extensively on this, but the fact of the matter is that the two databases-that is to say, the identity register and the passport database-are not the same. They contain different information, issued for different purposes; their legislative frameworks for what you pay are also different.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="10111743000248"></a>"The practice of the House is normally to resolve major points of difference by the end of report stage, and to use third reading for tidying up the Bill ... The principal purposes of amendments on third reading are ... to clarify any remaining uncertainties ... to improve the drafting ... and to enable the government to fulfil undertakings given at earlier stages of the Bill".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="10111743000154"></a>In response to my noble friend Lord Phillips, that means that my noble friend has given an undertaking, as she has today, to look at this matter again. She will do so. She does not, as the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, requires, have to give a commitment today as to the precise amendment that may or may not be brought forward. These are the normal rules of procedure.</p>

There are no longer three; there are two of us. The noble Baroness will know that we have met on many occasions to discuss whether it is in order for noble Lords to table an amendment at Third Reading that was previously moved in Committee and on Report. We need something rather clearer than we have had so far this afternoon. We need an assurance that if this matter cannot be resolved to our satisfaction-and I think that the House is very much behind the amendment in the name of my noble friend Lord Hunt-then we can bring back precisely this amendment so that this House can quite properly determine this issue on the terms in which it has been set out this afternoon for the benefit of your Lordships.</p>

I understand, as Government Chief Whip, that it would be appropriate for the Opposition to bring forward an amendment if they felt that the government amendment or failure to act was inappropriate. These are the matters that are discussed in the usual manner; as the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, says, we have had these discussions in the past. It may perhaps assist the House to recall that over the last few months the Public Bill Office has on two occasions advised Opposition Members that they may table Third Reading amendments to take forward matters that have been debated on previous occasions. We do enjoy a fair amount of latitude-I say fair because it is fair to all-within the overall context that Third Reading is not intended to open new issues.</p>

This matter has been aired at Second Reading, in Grand Committee and now on Report; this is the third time we have debated these issues. While great eloquence has been brought to our debates, no new argument has been brought. The noble Baroness has said, finally, at the end of a long debate-and I suspect rather reluctantly-that she will take it back to look at again. Frankly, in view of the debate, that is not good enough: it is quite clear that the House requires the Government to change their mind. Not much purpose is served by yet more agonising. The House is quite prepared to come to a view and I wish to test its opinion.</p>

Conservative shadow Ministers when in opposition made varying claims about the current cost of the ID card scheme which ranged widely from nearly £1 billion to up to £20 billion. Meanwhile, the National Identity Service cost report of October 2009-the official document laid before Parliament under the terms of the Identity Cards Act 2006-stated that the projected forward cost of providing ID cards for the next 10 years until 2019 was £835 million. Crucially, that figure does not equate to the savings to be made from scrapping the scheme. We know that because we read the impact assessment that accompanies the Bill, which states at the bottom of page 4:</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_801"></a><b>17 Nov 2010 : Column 801</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="10111743000253"></a>"The October 2009 cost report indicated that cancellation of ID cards would avoid future costs of £835 million up to October 2019. However, these costs are planned to be recovered through future fees to ID card purchases. Therefore, there are no benefits to the taxpayer from Year 3 onwards".</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="10111743000162"></a>The tables included in the impact assessment reveal that total savings from scrapping the scheme are £118 million. The total cost of cancelling the ID cards and the NIR are given as £22 million, although the Bill's Explanatory Notes state the cost to be £55 million. There appears to be a muddle and the Government have been rather misleading to claim the scale of the savings that they have done. A definitive, preferably independently audited cost and saving report would be desirable and it would be appropriate for it to be part of the Bill. I hope that the noble Baroness will consider this matter as sympathetically as she can.</p>

Ministers have set out the level of costs, both in the debate here and in the other place. Clearly, the Opposition do not entirely agree with our figures, but we have set out the costs and savings as we see them and as they are expected to be over the spending period. We also agree that it is important that these are set out in an accountable and auditable form and that is why we are including the costs and savings associated with scrapping the ID card scheme in the annual report and accounts-we have already undertaken to do this-which will be submitted to the House of Commons by the chief executive of the Identity and Passport Service.</p>

Identity fraud is one of the UK's fastest growing crimes, with nearly 2 million people a year falling victim, and figures suggest it costs the country some £2.7 billion a year. More than nine out of 10 people in the UK consider themselves to be at risk from identity fraud. According to the Government's own fraud prevention service, in the first three quarters of this year, levels of identity fraud increased by almost 10 per cent when compared with the same period in 2009 to nearly 80,000 cases. Any Government obviously have a duty to address this concern and to obtain whatever information is available to ensure that they have an up-to-date and coherent plan for action in this area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="10111743000169"></a>Minimising the paper trail of one's identity details is key to facing the threat of fraud, and it should be acknowledged that ID cards helped to do this. The ID card scheme did not, of course, offer a panacea in addressing identity fraud, and in cases of identity fraud committed online, for example, the ID card did not offer added security. The Minister told the House at Second Reading that an action plan was being developed by the National Fraud Authority and the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau following their strategic assessment of the harm caused by the impact of identity crime and that it was being overseen by the Home Office. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us an update on the progress of the development of the action plan because it should surely take account of the impact of the repeal of the Identity Cards Act 2006, which is provided for in this Bill, on combating identity fraud and the lessons learnt from the operation of the scheme, particularly in the light of the statement in the Government's impact assessment that there would have been benefits in relation to identity fraud. The evidence given to the Committee in the other place on this Bill from the representative of the Manchester Airports Group referred to benefits from the scheme, not least that people were absolutely sure under the scheme that the person who was standing in the pass office was the right person. The witness said that he thought the benefits might be able to be achieved by other means and that some of the innovative ideas in the identity card scheme could be replicated using the passport database or something similar. He believed that if there was a will to do that, it could be done, but at the moment, he did not actually feel that the will was there. Such observations also suggest that there would be a real benefit in having a report on the issues referred to in this amendment and in this work being taken into account in the action plan that, as we understand it, is being developed or subsequently being taken into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="10111743000170"></a>In the impact assessment that came with the Explanatory Memorandum to what was the Immigration (Biometric Registration) (Amendment) Regulations 2010, the Government were quite clear on the benefits in this area of the residence permits for third-country nationals who are subject to immigration control and who have limited leave to stay in the United Kingdom. The biometric immigration document issued under the regulations takes the form of a card with a chip containing biometric data-namely, fingerprints and a digital facial image. That impact assessment states that among the key monetised benefits of biometric residence permits are a reduction in benefits fraud, enhanced security of the individual's personal information, an easier method of evidencing an individual's rights and entitlements and an improved ability, as it puts it, to check for impostors. That impact assessment also states that it was intended that the additional information that would be provided by recording of biometric data under that regulation could be made available to other bodies, such as the police, within the limits of legislation and would help reduce crime. The impact assessment went on to say that the new permit arrangements also enable checks undertaken when a person applies for a residence permit automatically to identify individuals who have previously had their biometrics recorded and who are now claiming to be someone else.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="10111743000171"></a>The Government do not have any difficulty in identifying very clearly the benefits in combating fraud and false identity claims and, indeed, in crime generally in relation to biometric residence permits, and it should therefore not be very difficult for the Secretary of State to have a report produced on the impact of the repeal of the 2006 Act by this Bill on combating identity fraud and on the lessons learnt from the operation of the identity cards scheme. There is surely real potential in taking a close look to ensure that the potential benefits from helping to address identity fraud offered by the identity cards scheme are not lost and that lessons learnt from the operation of the scheme are taken on board. I very much hope that the Minister will feel able to accept this amendment, which I move, as it is clearly in everyone's interest to gain as much information as possible from the operation of relevant schemes in the fight to combat identity fraud.</p>

There will eventually come a point when, in view of the rising number of people purchasing goods and services online, the banks and the people selling goods will insist that there is some form of identity involved in the transaction. Whether it will be putting a card into your computer or a camera that will show that you actually are the person, I do not know, but I would think the banks in particular will insist on this in the longer run, both for their own hole-in-the-wall cash machines and for buying online. The ID card, as it was originally proposed, if it had been made compulsory from the word go, as I wanted it to be, would have been one of the answers to that and would have saved the private sector very considerable sums of money in the long run.</p>

I do not think it is really the Home Office's forte to produce such a report. I entirely agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee; there are a lot of lessons to be learnt and a lot of people studying this sort of thing. As for the figures used by the noble Lord, Lord Rosser-and taking the point just made about the banks-that is the whole point. People confuse theft of credit card details with identity theft. Identity theft is when someone's identity is taken over and used to do many other things, such as entering into contracts, travelling across borders and perpetrating crimes. Nicking a credit card and its details is something completely different. Those provide the huge figures, and the people who can stop that are the banks and the credit card companies by increasing their security. They are always looking at this, and they are trading off between the losses they make on transactions where cards are not present, and the cost of additional security. We are seeing new security measures coming through, but it is not a government job. There is no point at which you would take a national identity card that is not designed for online transactions, and a credit card that at the moment is not designed for them, and hope that one is going to help with the other. Actually, the entire problem about security for the credit card is contained there, and the people know what to do about it. They are getting on with it rather slowly to my mind, but when the fraud figures get big enough they will do something about it. I agree there are lessons to be learnt, but I do not think it is an identity card lesson. There are some other lessons to be learnt, but I think there other bodies better qualified to do the job than the Home Office writing expensive reports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="10111743000178"></a>I very much support the notion that what we do in government should be evidence-based, but I do not think that trying to draw lessons from a scheme of such narrow scope and numbers, as well as short duration, will help us a great deal in what are, without doubt, serious issues. One can draw a number of lessons about the operation of the scheme itself, but I do not know that they would cast much light of a general kind on how to operate identity schemes in the future. Frankly, the Government's view is that this is not a worthwhile thing for us to try to do.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="10111743000179"></a>We entirely agree that combating fraud is a major issue. There is no argument between us on that. That is precisely why the Home Office is taking it very seriously in conjunction with other departments. The National Fraud Authority and the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau have, as I mentioned in Committee, produced a strategic threat assessment of the harm and the impact of identity fraud. I entirely agree with the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, that identity is an issue and we certainly will have to do work on identity authentication. That would have been the case even with the NIR.</p>

But I can assure the House that we are taking this issue seriously.</p>

One of the organisations that had had most involvement with the identity cards scheme-the pilot carried out with the Manchester Airport Group-clearly referred to the benefits of the scheme with regard to identity. Quite relevantly, it said it thought that, even if identity cards were no longer there, perhaps the benefits that it had seen arising from the scheme could be achieved through other means. In the light of that kind of evidence, I should have thought that the Government would have been interested in the impact of the repeal of the Identity Cards Act 2006 and of trying to ensure that the benefits that at least some of those involved in the pilot exercise saw coming from it could be retained through other means. I am a little disappointed that the Minister has not indicated that the Government intend to carry out any sort of investigation or review of the benefits that were achieved from it and of any benefits relating to the issue of identity fraud to see whether they could be maintained through other channels.</p>

I am very grateful for the interventions and contributions that have been made by noble Lords in this debate in which reference has been made to the problems of identity fraud. I think I am right in saying that there is a rollout of a new generation of identity documentation in Germany which will include a radio-frequency identity chip to help to facilitate, or so it is claimed, secure online transactions. I hope that as part of the action plan to which the Minister has referred that has been set up and is being developed that some regard will be paid to what is happening in Germany and whether that has a contribution to make in this field.</p>

I am sorry that she has not been able to say that the Government will do that. Nevertheless, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.</p>

A friend of mine described the Bill as the King Canute Bill; in other words, it is doing away with something-identity cards-which, in a relatively short time, whatever Government are in power, will have to be reintroduced.

I would hope that an appointed independent person would give that recommendation to the Government of the day and say, "Sorry, we have got it wrong. It is time that we reintroduced ID cards". I agree entirely with my friend's view, except that poor old King Canute is the most maligned man in English history, because he never suggested that he could hold back the tide. What he said to his courtiers was, "I cannot hold back the tide". I suppose that it is the first example of PR going badly wrong.</p>

There are some residual powers in the Bill which we need to keep an eye on. Although an Information Commissioner exists, he does not have the power to march in and look at things unless there are complaints. He would also be overextended.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="10111747000014"></a>We need to look out for residual powers that could give rise to concern. They come in Clause 10. Subsections (8) and (9) sensibly state that certain information which is gathered to prove someone's identity when a passport is being issued should be destroyed after 28 days. Given that the Government will destroy the information within 28 days, I am happy for them to consult other databases-I mentioned in Committee electricity bills, which is probably the quickest way of finding whether someone has changed address or where they really are. I have no problem with the Government doing that to verify a person's identity for the purpose of producing a passport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="10111747000015"></a>However, then we get to subsection (10), which is the good old catch-all. It says that the Government can retain the information beyond 28 days for the purpose of "preventing or detecting crime"-I remember this sort of wording in RIPA, which led to a lot of grief-and "apprehending and prosecuting offenders". Well, that depends on how quickly they apprehend them again. We should have oversight by an outside commissioner who reports to Parliament and not by a Home Secretary, because this sort of thing can get out of hand and, later, suddenly rise up to bite a Government in the future. We have several commissioners doing this sort of job elsewhere in the security world. We either add it on to someone's job or create another one, but it is sensible for protecting the public.</p>

I was told then that subsection (10) reflects the provision in the Data Protection Act. I went away and looked at that, and I ought to say thank you. I was entirely happy that although the wording is a little different, it amounts to precisely the same thing. That is not to say that the issue is entirely satisfactorily dealt with. Perhaps it should be dealt with in a different way in this piece of legislation or, as I would like to see, more widely. However, I think that that is a different point.</p>

First, I fully understand the point that the noble Lord is raising. It is quite remarkable that we have reached a situation in which private sector companies such as Google are allowed to amass a massive amount of information and then use it for marketing purposes. Frankly, I have some concerns about that. I understand the noble Lord's concerns.</p>

The noble Lord is quite right. I hope that your Lordships' House will have further opportunities to discuss the implications of that, because it is a matter of great concern. There are some international companies that seem to feel that they can do what they like, and there is a need for this to be looked at very carefully. I understand the concerns about Governments amassing data. Equally, I refer the noble Lord to Mr Hodder, who wrote to me before Grand Committee, as an example of a business person who has used his card 30 times in going to the European zone and found it very convenient. For that reason, I do not think that we have heard the last word about the use of such cards.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="10111747000034"></a>I hope that the Minister considers taking this matter away. Whatever view noble Lords take of what the last Government did and of the nature of the cards and the information, it is rightly important that the public have confidence that the process used is done properly and well, as the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, said. The BBC carried a very interesting story about some of the techniques that will be used to ensure that the information is appropriately destroyed. I welcome that, but it would be helpful-and it is an important matter of public confidence-to have a proper independent scrutiny of this matter, which is why I very much support the noble Lord in his amendment.</p>

The first was whether one needs the extraordinary amount of information that would have been contained on the national identity register as a means of establishing ID cards, and whether that is the kind of thing that we want to see reintroduced, which I certainly do not believe to be the case. The second issue, which is the proper intention of the amendment, is about ensuring that information retained by the Government is properly governed and accountable. On that second point, I share absolutely the preoccupations of those who have  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_811"></a><b>17 Nov 2010 : Column 811</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>proposed the amendment, but I have reservations about the method that they have chosen to achieve the end. In effect, the amendment establishes a new individual-some sort of passport commissioner-who would have the job of overseeing how the data were used and retained by the IPS. That would also be the case in connection with information received by third parties for the validation of passport applications.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="10111747000036"></a>In our view, the Information Commissioner has significant powers, and we would regard them as sufficient to examine and consider or scrutinise any of the data processed within the IPS. I think that the noble Lord has had a conversation with the Information Commissioner to that effect. My impression of the Information Commissioner is that he takes a considerable interest in the operation of the Act and has powers to serve the IPS with a notice to allow him, or his staff, to find out whether the IPS is complying with the Data Protection Act, which is the governing Act here. He is able to oblige the IPS to allow himself or his staff to enter any premises and to show any of the specified documents or to see any of the information of the specified descriptions that he wishes to inspect.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="10111747000037"></a>Those are very considerable powers. I share the preoccupation of the House in ensuring that Government retain information for the purposes only for which it is genuinely needed and they are governed in ways which ensure that that is the case-that it is not used for purposes for which it was not specified and for which the Government are not entitled to use it. It is important for us to ensure that this is the case, and to talk to the Information Commissioner to ensure that he is able and willing to exercise his powers in this way, which I believe to be the case. I ask the noble Lord if on that basis, and with an assurance from the Government that we will take the intent of this amendment seriously, he is willing to withdraw his amendment?</p>

Over a third of its total running costs is recovered through fees on visas, nationality and immigration applications. The remaining costs are met by the UK taxpayer. Clearly there is a balance between these two things to which I shall return.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="10111743000189"></a>Earlier this year the Chancellor set out in his emergency Budget the position of the nation's finances, which revealed the very difficult choices that had to be made by government departments. Of course the decision to increase the fees is relevant to the background and the economic situation which we were left by our predecessors. The decision has been taken to take the UK Border Agency into the new spending review period in a position where more is done to balance the costs of supporting the immigration system between those who use and benefit directly from it and the UK taxpayer, who is otherwise obliged to subsidise it.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="10111743000190"></a>The Home Office is making savings of £367 million this year. The proposals we are debating today form the other part of the equation-that is to say, seeking to increase fees paid by migrants and sponsors.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="10111743000191"></a>The regulations are made under Section 51 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 and are in accordance with the powers granted in Section 42 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004, as amended by Section 20 of the UK Borders Act 2007. Under Section 42, the Secretary of State can set a fee for an application at a level that exceeds the administrative cost of determining the application. The way in which the legal powers are defined means that the Government must also specify fees for applications, processes and services that are provided at or below the administrative cost of determining the application, in separate regulations under the powers in Section 51 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006. These regulations were laid before Parliament on 9 September 2010, are subject to the negative process and are not being debated. I recognise that having fees in two sets of regulations makes things a little complicated and I am happy to take the points that may be raised today on any of the fees proposals.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="10111743000192"></a>For these mid-year increases, the UK Border Agency has undertaken very careful consideration of the issues. These increases are made in line with the principle that the overall contribution of fee increases should be spread across all routes and be in line with our broader policy to align better our fees structure overseas with the one operating in the United Kingdom. Where there are greater increases to the fees on some routes than others, we have done so on the basis of the benefit to the migrant of a successful application. Examples of benefit vary from route to route but may include, for instance, access to the UK labour market, the right to stay here permanently or the right to vote.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="10111743000193"></a>These increases mean that the Government can hold other fees at existing levels, or increase them only by a comparatively small amount to help maintain our international competitiveness and in recognition of the importance of these routes to the UK economy. For example, the Government recognise the importance  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_813"></a><b>17 Nov 2010 : Column 813</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of keeping direct costs to sponsors under the points-based<I></I>system as low as possible, particularly in the current economic climate. The fees for acting as a sponsor and the certificate of sponsorship fee have been held at the same level as previously, while maintaining existing concessions for small businesses, charities, education providers and the arts and entertainment sectors.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="10111743000194"></a>In the same spirit, we have managed to limit the tier 4 visa increase to just £21, which is for a visa being offered below cost. It is a very small proportion of the overall costs incurred by a tier 4 student coming to the UK to study, who will pay an average tuition fee of close to £10,000 a year in higher education. The visitor visa has been increased by only £2. Tourism is obviously important to the UK economy, but it is right that the migrants contribute towards the costs of the services they use and benefit from. However, we have still kept it down and the fee recovers only about half of the total administrative cost of the visa.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="10111743000195"></a>The House will, I hope, be pleased to hear that these proposals also introduce a fee exemption where a person makes an application for a nationality registration relying on Section 4C of the British Nationality Act 1981. This will align better the position of those applicants born to British mothers with that of applicants born to British fathers. This is a long-standing grievance, which I have shared, and was a matter of great interest to this House. I hope that fulfilment of that commitment made by the previous Government gives satisfaction today.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="10111743000196"></a>This Government are committed to sending a message overseas that we welcome legal migrants and that the UK is open for business. I believe, as the Government believe, that migration brings great benefits to the UK. However, I also believe that UK citizens and newcomers to this country wish to see an immigration system in place that is sustainable and stronger in the future, and is less subsidised by the average taxpayer. The immigration system costs money and, through these proposals, the Government are seeking today a greater contribution, as I say, from those who benefit most-a little more in line with the benefits on offer-so that the traveller and migrant meet a greater proportion of the costs of the system. As your Lordships can see, we have tried to keep down the cost for those who receive comparatively little-the tourist and, indeed, the student-and put the increases primarily in those areas where there is long-term benefit for individuals who come to work or to settle here. I beg to move.</p>

A company employee took a degree at a Welsh university. He is a Hong Kong citizen. He obtained an 18-month postgraduate visa to do further development work, but that has expired. In the summer, we applied to get the visa extended, but we got caught up in the mish-mash of everything when the new immigration cap of 24,100 visas was suddenly introduced. We needed a certificate of sponsorship.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="10111753000003"></a>We got the certificate of sponsorship just in time, which was amazing since we employ hardly anyone over here and the chap in question will really be the first serious employee. That was the right thing to do. However, we were given a zero visa allocation. All the time that we put into the matter was completely wasted because we cannot sponsor him. We have now been told that, for £1,000, we might get a visa after all. The decision has been taken that, as a small business, we cannot afford to pay out £1,000 on a gamble. As another director of the company said, "It is a lottery", so there is absolutely no point in doing it.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="10111753000004"></a>I am intrigued that the Explanatory Memorandum's paragraph 11, "Regulating small business", states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="10111753000080"></a>"The legislation does not apply to small business".</p>

<p><a name="10111753000077"></a>The very reason that we will have to relocate offshore is because, indirectly, the legislation does apply to small business. We will probably try to relocate the research arm in either Singapore or Hong Kong. Pingar is not the only company that I know of in this situation. Many people are considering relocation. I am afraid that the Government's immigration policy is about the most stupid thing that they could have done for small business.</p>

In the next week or two, we have to decide where he should move to. I should be delighted to hear from the Minister how these new entrepreneurship visas will work. Why should we pay £1,000 to enter a lottery to see whether we can exist in this country?</p>

There is great concern that the way in which the current cap is operating is doing real damage not just to British business and industry but to the arts and academia, as we have discussed in the House on several occasions in the past few weeks. I hope that we will receive an early announcement from the Government that they will look at the policy again and make it more flexible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="10111753000007"></a>Having said that, we support the general principles that the noble Baroness has outlined. We recognise the challenge of balancing the burden of the administration of the system between the migrant and the taxpayer. My reading is that the burden on the migrant is increasing slightly, although not significantly. Perhaps the noble Baroness can confirm that. I should also be

Has an analysis been carried out of the possible impact on at least the main categories of application and whether there will be any unwelcome impact on regular migration when fees are increased? The Minister rightly mentioned some of the benefits of migration, which I must say was welcome.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="10111753000008"></a>Has an analysis been carried out of where there is clear benefit to our country from the skills that have been brought in and of our costs and prices as compared with those of other countries, such as Australia, European Union countries and the US? To extend the theme that was mentioned by the noble Earl, we need to be mindful that this country is a great global trading nation. We must be wary of any action that we take that would undermine the ability of UK companies to attract the best people. That has been one of our great strengths over the past 30 years, which it is important that the policy on immigration should not undermine. It is worrying to hear of small companies looking to, say, New Zealand for R&amp;D purposes because of the constraints of the current system.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="10111753000009"></a>I would also be grateful if the Minister could confirm whether the increase in the cost of visas, particularly settlement visas, is part of a more general policy to bear down on numbers. Is the price increase part of a general policy of reducing net immigration? Perhaps the Minister would also refer to the matter of the migration impact fund, which was raised by my right honourable friend when the regulations were debated in a committee of the other place. I understand that the visa fee increases of the previous year took into account a £50 million contribution from migrants to that fund, which was intended to pay for projects in constituencies with a sudden increase in the number of immigrants. The Government have decided to abolish the fund, but the amount to cover the fund is staying within the visa fee. If the Minister could give us an explanation of that, it would be extremely welcome.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="10111753000010"></a>Will the Minister also provide a little more explanation of the alignment between fees in country and fees out of country, which she referred to in her introduction? Is the goal to have equalisation? Given the policy of looking at the proportion or cost of the administration of the fee, what measures will be put in place in that regard?</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="10111753000011"></a>I note the significant increase in the fee for dependants. We do not oppose that, as there is a huge benefit to the dependant, but is that increase part of a deliberate policy to deter immigrants from bringing in dependants? Is it in line with the reductions of the rights of dependants, such as work rights, as part of the scheme, or is it just a method of raising extra resources when there is pressure on budgets?</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="10111753000012"></a>Will the Minister also reassure me that no fees or charges will be imposed on Members of Parliament or Members of your Lordships' House who make inquiries about the progress of an immigration application, on behalf of a constituent, in the case of an MP, or of someone who has approached a Member of your Lordships' House, as happens from time to time?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="10111753000013"></a>I have no doubt that the noble Baroness will be able to respond to these questions, orally or in writing. She may take it that we support the general principles, although I share the noble Earl's concern about the wider aspects of the cap, which are doing great damage to British business at the moment.</p>

<a name="10111753000014"></a><b><a name="101117-0001.htm_spnew160"></a><a name="10111753000090"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> My Lords, I followed the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, very closely and will try not to repeat what he said, but I, too, have a number of questions.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="10111753000015"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, asked how our fees compared with those of a number of other countries. I would be particularly interested in those of EU countries, because that is the context in which we should look at ourselves.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="10111753000016"></a>Wider policy objectives are referred to in the Explanatory Memorandum. Paragraph 8.2 gives the example of attracting specific groups of migrants who are beneficial to the UK. Like both the previous noble Lords, I find it difficult to separate that from the wider issues of immigration policy. Perhaps the Minister could amplify on that, without taking us into a bigger debate, which we will no doubt have very soon.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="10111753000017"></a>Can the Minister tell the House how the monitoring of the impact of the fees, which the Explanatory Memorandum promises will be monitored closely, will be done? Will it be a matter of looking at trends? Important as the examples that we have heard are, those examples would probably not feature very much, if at all, in the statistics. However, sometimes anecdotes are useful.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="10111753000018"></a>Like the noble Lord, I am happy to support the approach that has been taken in the regulations.</p>

<p><a name="st_177"></a>
<a name="10111753000019"></a><b><a name="101117-0001.htm_spnew161"></a><a name="10111753000091"></a>Baroness Neville-Jones:</b> My Lords, a number of points have been raised in the debate, which I will try to answer.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="10111753000020"></a>One of the first points was on the question of a sensitivity analysis of the elasticity of demand for visas and whether price affects take-up. Partly because the impact of the fee in relation to the benefits gained is relatively marginal, there is little or no convincing evidence that the increase will have such an effect. Indeed, we have had cases-this may be regarded as perverse-in which an increase in the fee actually led to an increase in demand. The reverse is also true, as a reduction in the fee has coincided with-I do not know whether it led to-a reduction in demand. We do not have convincing evidence of a direct elasticity relationship. However, it is clearly important that we monitor what goes on, and we intend to do that. It is fair to say that there is a continuous monitoring process. In the wake of price increases, it is right and sensible that we should be particularly careful about the monitoring of their effect, and we will certainly do that.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="10111753000021"></a>On the competitiveness of the UK visas system with other regimes, comparisons are fairly difficult because, as Members on the Benches opposite will know, no two national systems are exactly the same. However, I will try to give some comparisons. Two comparisons that are perhaps relevant include comparator  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_817"></a><b>17 Nov 2010 : Column 817</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>countries in the European Union, which the noble Baroness will be interested in, and some of our Anglophone competitors. France and Germany operate simplified immigration systems. In Germany, applications include a Schengen visa-comparable to a UK short-term visa-for which the fee is €60, which this month is roughly £51. France offers a Schengen visa for the same fee or a long-term visa to remain for more than 90 days, for which the fee is €99 or roughly £85. The comparable figure in the UK is £70. Overall, therefore, we mostly reside in the middle range, although we are possibly nearer the upper end for the charges for some long-term visas. I am happy to give the noble Baroness more detail in a table if she would like. To give another example, Australia charges a total fee of £1,074 for a tier 2 visa, which is a longer term visa, whereas the equivalent figure for the UK is £1,750. Ireland is much more expensive. From looking at these figures, you would not immediately say, even with the increases, that the UK is out of line with comparator migrant countries.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="10111753000022"></a>On the question of fees inside and outside the country, this is where one enters the Hampton Court maze of the fees structure, as the permissions for raising fees inside and outside the country are different. However, I can say to the noble Lord that equalisation is not the objective. We are raising the fees in those contexts in which we are allowed to do so and where we are able to do so without regard to whether we are going over the limits of the cost. We do not intend, or indeed have as an objective, that the fee increases or the fee structure should contribute to, or be part of, immigration policy. The issues are separate. Therefore, if noble Lords have any thought that the fee increases might somehow be a covert immigration control, I can assure them that that is not the case.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="10111753000023"></a>I am quite certain that we will not be charging MPs or Members of your Lordships' House for inquiries.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="10111753000024"></a>Finally, on the question of the migrant impacts fund, it is indeed the case that a contribution from the visa fee previously went to feed that fund, which has now been abolished. The money will now contribute to the cost of the visa and will mitigate increases that we would otherwise have had to make.</p>

<a name="101117-0001.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="10111753000025"></a>I am grateful to noble Lords for their support for-if I understand the mood of the House correctly-the price structure that is being put in place.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="10111743000200"></a>The House should consider these three instruments, which I laid before it on 18 October, together. Two of them contain the decision of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, as justifying authority under the Justification of Practices Involving Ionising Radiation Regulations 2004, that the generation of electricity from two nuclear reactor designs-Westinghouse's AP1000 and Areva's EPR-is justified. The third, the draft Nuclear Decommissioning and Waste Handling (Designated Technical Matters) Order, specifies which technical matters, in addition to those already in the Energy Act 2008, are to be "designated technical matters".</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="10111743000201"></a>First, I will consider the two regulatory justification decisions. Regulatory justification is derived from the recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection, the ICRP, which are used around the world as the basis for radiological protection. The ICRP's recommendations form the basis of the European basic safety standards directive and, in the UK, of the Justification of Practices Involving Ionising Radiation Regulations 2004.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="10111743000202"></a>The regulations provide that the Secretary of State, as justifying authority, must decide whether a new class or type of practice resulting in exposure to ionising radiation is justified, in advance of it being first adopted or approved, by its economic, social or other benefits in relation to the health detriment that it may cause.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="10111743000203"></a>Regulatory justification is an initial, high-level process. It is the first step in the radiological protection regime and is made on a generic, not a site-specific, basis. Following a regulatory justification decision, there are further processes involving more detailed examinations by regulators of reactor designs and of the impact on specific sites of proposals to build nuclear power stations separately and after the regulatory justification process.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="10111743000204"></a>A justification decision does not mean that the reactor design and the nuclear power station will pass through these further processes successfully. These further processes are based on the principle of optimisation, a requirement to keep all exposures as low as reasonably achievable, and dose limitation, the principle that the total dose to any individual from regulated sources in planned exposure situations-other than medical exposure of patients-should not exceed the appropriate recommended limits.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="10111743000205"></a>Regulatory justification decisions are made in advance of full information on the benefits and detriments of the practice which might emerge from operational experience. They therefore seek to identify the potential detriment from the reactor designs by making assumptions based on the best information currently available, including information arising from the operational  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_819"></a><b>17 Nov 2010 : Column 819</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>experience of similar classes or types of practice and the expert opinion of regulators and others. If new and important evidence about the efficacy or consequences of the class or type of practice comes to light, the 2004 Justification Regulations allow the Secretary of State to reassess any regulatory justification decisions.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="10111743000206"></a>Last year, my department published a consultation on proposed decisions that two reactor designs should be justified-Westinghouse's AP1000 and Areva's EPR. After considering responses to that consultation, on 18 October my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change announced his decision that the two designs are justified. I will outline our reasons for making those decisions.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="10111743000207"></a>We see a clear need for the generation of electricity by the AP1000 and EPR through the contribution they can make to securing the UK's energy supplies, helping the UK decarbonise and meet legal low-carbon obligations and benefiting the economy more widely. Against this, the radiological detriment to health from these nuclear reactor designs and their associated waste facilities will be low compared to naturally occurring levels of radiation and effectively controlled by the regulatory regime. The AP1000 and EPR will be able to produce large quantities of electricity over an extended period, making a significant contribution to the electricity supply. Nuclear power has long been our most significant source of low-carbon energy and can continue to contribute to our energy mix.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="10111743000208"></a>It will be for companies to fund and build any new nuclear power stations and to determine whether they provide sufficiently attractive returns. Nuclear power is economically competitive with other forms of generating technology, and developments in the UK market have made clear that energy companies are investing significantly in the prospect of new nuclear power stations.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="10111743000209"></a>We are confident that there will be economic benefits for the UK from new nuclear power stations. Beyond direct investment and employment, we can benefit through the development of a globally competitive nuclear supply chain and improvement in the quality of a skilled UK workforce. Further, we believe that, if nuclear power stations are not part of the UK's future energy mix, the UK would face significantly higher costs in meeting the transition to a low-carbon economy.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="10111743000210"></a>Against these benefits, there is the potential for detriment. However, the safety features of the designs and the regulatory regime, which sets limits to the release of radiation and monitors compliance, will ensure that emissions will be minimised. The radiation to which members of the public would be exposed, as a proportion of the overall radiation to which they are exposed from all sources-including medical procedures and background radiation-would therefore be very small and the risk of health detriment very low.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="10111743000211"></a>The decisions apply to the operation and decommissioning of new nuclear power stations and also the management and disposal of the radioactive waste they will produce. In making the decision, we are therefore satisfied that the regulatory regime will limit health detriment from waste management and disposal, that the interim storage of waste can be  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_820"></a><b>17 Nov 2010 : Column 820</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>carried out in a way that causes a very low level of health detriment and that a robust process is in place to identify a site for, and build, a geological disposal facility.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="10111743000212"></a>We also concluded that the potential environmental detriments arising from new nuclear power stations are likely to be avoided or adequately mitigated by the licensing and planning regime. We considered the risk of detriments from an accident or terrorist incident. This potential detriment already exists and the risk of such incidents would be seen in the context of the regulatory regime which is intended to prevent accidents and protect against terrorist attack. We are confident in the regulatory regimes for safety and security of civil nuclear installations and materials in the UK and consider that the likelihood of an accident or other incident giving rise to a release of radioactive material is small. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change therefore concluded that these significant potential benefits outweigh the potential detriments, and that the generation of electricity by the AP1000 and EPR should be justified.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="10111743000213"></a>I now consider the draft Nuclear Decommissioning and Waste Handling (Designated Technical Matters) Order. The purpose of the draft order is to support the requirement under the Energy Act 2008 for nuclear operators to make financial provision in their funded decommissioning programmes for those designated technical matters. The Energy Act 2008 contains only one category of designated technical matters-decommissioning a nuclear power station and cleaning up the site. The Energy Act provides that the Secretary of State specifies by order the other matters which are to be designated technical matters. The order is, therefore, necessary to give operators clarity over what are the designated technical matters that they must provide for.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="10111743000214"></a>The order specifies that the construction and maintenance of an interim fuel store used for storage; any activity preparatory to the decommissioning of a relevant nuclear installation; and the cleaning up of the site are designated technical matters. This means that these costs also have to be funded through funds set aside as part of the funded decommissioning programme. It might be claimed that the operator could pay for these costs out of operational expenditure and that designation is unnecessary. However, this may put the costs in competition with other demands on revenue and if the operator was unable to meet these costs when they fell due, there would be a risk that they could fall to the taxpayer. It is therefore appropriate to designate these costs to limit the risk to the taxpayer by ensuring that funds are set aside to carry out the relevant work. The order will be complemented by the Nuclear Decommissioning and Waste Handling (Finance and Fees) Regulations, which will be laid before Parliament once this order completes its passage.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="10111743000215"></a>Following a consultation on the provision of the draft order earlier this year and responses received, the Government do not propose to extend the definition of "designated technical matters" beyond interim stores and activities preparatory to decommissioning and cleaning up the site. I believe that the order will benefit  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_821"></a><b>17 Nov 2010 : Column 821</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>both industry and the public. It clarifies the obligations of the nuclear industry and therefore reduces uncertainty and helps investment. The order, together with the Act, ensures that the costs of waste management, disposal and decommissioning do not fall on to the taxpayer.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="10111743000216"></a>I commend these regulations and the two other instruments to the House.</p>

I do so for a number of reasons, not least because the NIA undertook the drafting of the justification report on which these statutory instruments are based. It was a lengthy process. Indeed, some of us thought that we would never see the end of it-first, in getting the reports right and, secondly, in terms of ministerial overview and the preparation of the SIs which we are debating today. It is fair to say that this is of critical importance to the realisation of the new nuclear build programme.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="10111743000218"></a>There are various elements. One could say that the building blocks, or the foundations, involve more than just the justification process in respect of the Areva and Westinghouse reactors. These reactors will also be subject to the rigorous generic design assessment programme being undertaken by the health and safety regulator and the Environment Agency. But these are of a different order, being almost exclusively technical in character and they do not concern us today. We have to satisfy ourselves and the country that the kit we are going to use is of a quality that can allay the fears of people in the UK. We have to recognise that there is not unanimity on the issue of nuclear power. There is certainly now, I think, what could be called a working majority and the consensus is probably a wee bit more robust than some of the elements within the coalition, but in order to reinforce and develop this consensus, we have to deal with the broad issue of the environmental concerns of the EU.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="10111743000219"></a>We have ceded to Brussels-probably correctly-a number of responsibilities in relation to environmental matters. I may be wrong, but I think that, apart from the reactor at one of London's universities, the nearest one to London is in France, so it is only appropriate that we are subject to rather broad environmental legislation which covers the continent and not just this island.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="10111743000220"></a>In considering the process of preparing the report it would be wrong of me not to pay tribute to the work of Peter Haslam on behalf of the Nuclear Industry Association and its members. He had the responsibility of herding the cats into the bag and it was not always easy getting the various players around the table, but consensus was established, agreement was reached, the document was prepared and it is in no small way due to the efforts of Peter Haslam.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="10111743000221"></a>We have to be careful, not only of the issue of building a consensus of tolerance of and support for nuclear power, but we also have to take account of the fact that there are those who are quite happy-with other people's money, usually-to seek access to the courts to have judicial review and things like that. It

I hope not and, indeed, I think that one way to ensure public confidence is that when those who are against nuclear power-they are perfectly entitled to be so-take the advice of their learned friends, they get the message that this document stands up to close scrutiny. The Minister and many of us across the House feel that to have got to this stage and to have these statutory instruments being discussed is evidence of our confidence in the robustness of the documents and, as time will go on, of the robustness of the case for nuclear power.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="10111743000222"></a>It is fair to say that issues relating to waste and decommissioning are worries. There is sometimes a wilful ignorance of the fact that other countries have accommodated waste, are treating it and dealing with it in a way which has, by and large, allayed public anxieties within those countries. We can look to Finland and Sweden. In Sweden, there has always been an anxiety about nuclear power, but there has not been the concern about storage, because Sweden has got on with the job. The funding of decommissioning and the treatment of waste and its storage are paramount and people have to be reassured that that part of it that has been created by private industry will be paid for by private industry. I make that distinction at this point because a lot of the waste that we have was created by nationalised industries and therefore is the responsibility of government. That part of the deal is not a subsidy but is the public purse meeting its historical responsibilities.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="10111743000223"></a>My second point is that not all of the waste is civil in character. It is waste that has come about as a result of the various forms of nuclear deterrent we have had. That again is a responsibility of the state. That is not a subsidy. It may well be that in putting together the three elements-the privatised waste, if I can call it that, the nationalised waste and the military waste-we create economies of scale that make the job that bit easier because the volumes will be such that critical mass will be created and we will be able to do it more cheaply, but that is not to suggest that we are talking about subsidies of one against the other.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="10111743000224"></a>It is important that these statutory instruments are dealt with today and that they get the support of the House. I think that the industry can stand up to the challenge, "Well, they would say that, wouldn't they?". It does not want to be an unsafe industry. That is one argument, but the other argument, which is far more compelling, is that if these private companies do not get it right, it will perhaps cost people their lives, but it will certainly cost their shareholders a hell of a lot of money. Therefore, we realise the significance of the investments, the dangers of the materials that are being used and the problems that could be created if the reactors are not satisfactory. All these issues are being considered. Once we have this element out of the way, get the generic design assessment process completed and eventually get the planning applications going to the IPC in whatever form it finally emerges, we will be in a position to start building the nuclear power stations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="10111743000225"></a>At the end of the day, even if we build no more nuclear power stations in this country, we will still have to decommission the existing facilities and handle

It is important that they are given the best support that the House can give them. I do not anticipate there being a vote as that is not our custom.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="10111743000226"></a>I have a commitment this evening so I have to leave the House and will not be here for the wind-ups. No discourtesy is intended. I was going to send the Minister a letter, but I thought that since there are not many people here I could just say it entre nous, as it were. It is important for the industry that we get this cleared out of the way. It is one of the important building blocks. It has been not tiresome, but time-consuming, and it is a necessity that no one would shirk from recognising has been central to the development of the nuclear industry and its regeneration in this country.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord O'Neill of Clackmannan, and I were fortunate to attend a briefing this morning by one of the potential investors that would be building these nuclear power stations. One word came out of that. The noble Lord used it; it is "confidence". He was talking about the billions of pounds that will be invested in the next generation of nuclear power stations. The investors will have to have confidence at every stage that this is going to go ahead and be successful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="10111743000228"></a>We are discussing these regulations and the order. The whole process of justification has been very elaborate. I have here the justification report on one of the two designs of reactor. This has been a formidable step. The fact that the Secretary of State has now accepted that the justification process has been properly completed and that we now have these statutory instruments is one further step in the confidence of the industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="10111743000229"></a>This is not the last word: the industries have to continue to get further consents, not least the licensing of the designs through the generic design assessment process. We heard high praise this morning of the work of the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate in getting to this stage. There seems to be confidence that this will happen by the due date of July next year. That has to happen, but I say nothing about planning-we are not talking about planning tonight, and that is another stage to be got through.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="10111743000230"></a>The industry has been looking for a number of steps to generate confidence. The Secretary of State's statement last month was a major step along the way. There was no question about that: it made an extremely favourable impression on the industry and its potential investors and the supply chain as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="10111743000231"></a>Last week I asked a Question about the future of the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate and I raised with the Minister who was representing the Department for Work and Pensions-he is responsible for the Health and Safety Executive, and the NII comes under the HSE-that we are still waiting for the decision about the reorganisation and, I hope, the setting up, through a legislative reform order, of a new statutory corporation to take over the functions of the NII. I do not know whether my noble friend can say anything more about that. It is something to which great importance is being attached by the industry, particularly because

These people are much in demand and this process, which has been under discussion for some time, is seen by the industry as another important step which, if and when it is achieved, will continue to generate confidence. I hope my noble friend will be able to say something about that, although the actual process-I entirely accept this-is not for his department but for the Department for Work and Pensions. If he can say something that would help this process of confidence, to which I have referred, I would be extremely grateful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="10111743000232"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord O'Neill, I too have an engagement. I hope I can stay until the end, but I offer my apologies to the House if I cannot.</p>

I thank my noble friend for his usual panache in introducing the subject. One of the things that strikes me while reading through these statutory instruments is that we have, once again, a problem of opaqueness with respect to this industry and sector. They are among the few SIs I have read in which, even after reading the Explanatory Memorandums, it is quite difficult to really get to the depths of what they are trying to say. No doubt we can blame that on EURATOM regulations or whatever. In terms of designated technical matters, this sounds innocuous but is obviously crucial to these documents and the meaning of "justification" is rather different from what I have known before. In particular, we talk about approval, but neither of these reactors is approved at all. This is just the start of the process and there is much more to go on further. I was particularly interested that in the justification SIs we have two useful definitions-on intermediate-level waste and on spent fuel-but they are never referred to in the documents. That is slightly strange.</p>

Mainly health considerations are mentioned, but the documents refer to "environmental protection". I would be interested to understand whether environmental issues were taken into consideration in terms of the effective cost-benefit analysis that is taking place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="10111743000235"></a>When you get to the bottom of this, the regulations are not approval of either of these designs. I would be interested to obtain clarity from the Minister on when that approval process might take place. I also note that these regulations deal with only two of four reactor classes that the Secretary of State has deemed necessary to go through those processes. Where are the other two? Will they come through your Lordships' House as well? Given that this is a requirement under the EURATOM legislation, I would be particularly interested to understand what has happened in terms of these two designs in other member states. Have they gone through the same procedure yet? Have any member states rejected them or hesitated in terms of justification? That would be useful and important to understand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="10111743000236"></a>I see from some of the Explanatory Notes that "justification" includes a much broader process than just the nuclear reactions that take place and nuclear generation. It can include the whole supply chain. Therefore, is the justification seen by the Government to include waste disposal? I suppose I ask from this half of the coalition whether you can really justify such reactors when we have not sorted out waste disposal in the longer term. I treat that more as a philosophical question. Certainly, as the noble Lord, Lord O'Neill, has said, I have no intention of bringing the matter to a vote this evening.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="10111743000237"></a>On decommissioning, I welcome very much the Government's repetition that there will be no public subsidy for nuclear power. I know that some of the papers answer why interim storage is included in decommissioning. It seems to me that it was already included effectively in the decommissioning of interim waste disposal sites. But obviously interim waste, or waste facilities, will have to be built anyway as these nuclear power stations are developed. What happens to the cost of building them to enable them to operate? Is that included in this scheme?</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="10111743000238"></a>Although these instruments cover funding, and I know that we have further instruments to approve, I ask the Minister now when we are likely to have the detailed funding mechanisms. This caused considerable debate earlier in the year when the previous Government started to present this under one of the energy Acts. This is of the greatest importance. The Minister may not be able to answer these questions now, but certainly I would like him to in the future. How do we make sure that these funds, which will be very large amounts of money, are not affected by such issues as bankruptcy of the companies involved; are not sold on in the money markets to other owners; or, perhaps the biggest risk, are not consumed by the Treasury long before they ever reach decommissioning of the power plants? Given the fact that it is accepted that the nuclear industry will go ahead to meet our energy needs for the future, I welcome these regulations and hope that we will move forward in a well managed and effective way to achieve that.</p>

I note that the noble Lords, Lord O'Neill of Clackmannan and Lord Jenkin of Roding, may not be able to stay until the end, but I have probably benefited more from hearing them than they would from hearing me. I note also the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, on the technicality of the statutory instruments. In looking at the SIs today, I have been through more assessments, consultation documents, and justification orders than I have for any other SI I have ever spoken on in the other place.

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="10111753000027"></a>The three instruments before us today are linked. We have two justification decisions on nuclear reactors and a further instrument on nuclear decommissioning and the handling of waste. In all cases the Merits Committee drew special attention to these SIs because  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_826"></a><b>17 Nov 2010 : Column 826</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of their importance and because nuclear energy is a high-profile and sensitive issue, as was acknowledged by all noble Lords who have spoken. I am grateful to the Merits Committee for its work and I am sure that when he comes to reply the Minister will want to address the issues that it has raised.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="10111753000028"></a>The justification decisions are taken by the Secretary of State as the justifying authority; that is that the generation of electricity from the nuclear reactor designs, the AP1000 and the EPR involving ionising radiation, can be justified as the social, economic and other benefits outweigh the health detriments. The third statutory instrument relates to the costs of the decommissioning of waste and the funded decommissioning programme, which must be approved by the Secretary of State, setting out the likely costs of decommissioning and cleaning up the site and how those costs will be met. These three instruments strike at the heart of the issue, addressing, first, the need for new energy capacity and the ability of nuclear to provide low-carbon energy while assessing the level of risk, and secondly, the need to have a strategy and a policy for funding to deal with the waste that is created.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="10111753000029"></a>I want to flag up to the Minister, as did the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, the need to move quickly on the new arrangements for the regulatory regime. I appreciate that this is not his responsibility-although he will have heard the Questions in the House on this last week-but rightly the remit of another government department. However, if there is to be public confidence in the system, the new arrangements have to be in place as the Government move forward with decisions such us those before us today. The Minister will know that the regulatory arrangements and expertise in this country are recognised and admired around the world, and we all want that to continue. Will he assure the House that his department has raised and will continue to raise this with the relevant Ministers in other departments.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="10111753000030"></a>We currently have 10 nuclear power stations in England, Scotland and Wales which provide 13 per cent of the total electricity used in the UK. All but one of these will be shut by 2025. If we are to maintain an energy mix using nuclear, then new stations will have to be built, as Secretary of State Chris Huhne announced on 18 October 2010 when he laid the instruments before us today. In his Statement he summed up the basis of his justification as,</p>
<ul><a name="10111753000083"></a>"a clear need for the generation of electricity by these nuclear reactor designs ... because of the contribution they can make to increased security of energy supplies and reduced carbon emissions".</ul>
<p><a name="10111753000078"></a>He added:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="10111753000081"></a>"Against this the radiological detriment to health from these nuclear reactor designs and their associated waste facilities will be low compared to overall levels of radiation, and effectively controlled by the UK's robust and effective regulators".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 18/10/10; col. 44WS.]</p>

<p><a name="10111753000031"></a>Both the justification decisions were subjected to considerable consultation and no changes were made as a result of the consultation that took place. There has been some concern that there was no inquiry or hearing relating to the justification process. Does the Minister consider that the process is in any way weakened by not having any hearings?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="10111753000032"></a>These justification decisions are time-critical, given that the Government are committed to nuclear new build by 2017. The delays are regrettable. It would have been helpful if we had been able to get to this stage before the general election, and we have had nearly six months since then. I raise this not to apportion blame in any way but to seek the Minister's views as to whether he considers that the Government are still on schedule for the new nuclear power stations to come into operation by 2017.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="10111753000033"></a>A further issue that may cause delay is the HSE licensing programme, which we have heard about already this evening. In July 2009, it was reported that the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate had written to two French companies that want to build reactors in the UK to express its concerns about the control and instrumentation-the C and I-of the European pressurised reactor, the EPR, which is one of the reactors that we are discussing today. I shall not pretend to have any great technical knowledge on these issues, but I know that C and I is also known as the cerebral cortex of a nuclear power station. It controls performance, including temperature, pressure and power outlet levels. The NII raised other related concerns; similar concerns have been raised by other regulators.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="10111753000034"></a>The HSE said that the EPR design in Britain could be rejected if its concerns could not be satisfactorily addressed. At the time, it was reported that, in addressing these issues, the design assessment stage could be delayed well past its expected completion date of 2011. As far as I am aware, none of the EPR reactors being built in other countries is yet in service, but the companies concerned engaged with the NII and were, and may still be, in discussion with it. The companies were confident that a solution could be reached. The NII rightly made it clear that it would not issue a licence unless it was satisfied that that design could be built and operated safely. Similar issues arise also with the AP1000</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="10111753000035"></a>The Health and Safety Executive has announced that it may have to delay a definite decision on whether to approve the designs of both the AP1000 and the EPR reactors. My understanding is that the HSE considers that all the technical issues can be resolved, but that there may be some delay. I was encouraged to hear the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, say that at the EDF briefing this morning it was said that a slight delay is expected, but it would be helpful if the Minister could comment on that.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="10111753000036"></a>Have the Government given any consideration to possible legal challenges to, or judicial review of, these justification orders? The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, also raised this matter. If it were the case, does the Minister consider that it could significantly delay the process? Both these issues have the potential to impact on the 2017 time scales, so any reassurance from the Minister would be appreciated. Perhaps I may also raise something that is not in the justification orders: the use of mixed oxide fuel or reprocessed fuel, known as Mox. Are there plans to bring this forward at a later date? No justification order for Mox could potentially limit the scope of the reactors. It may just be that the work is ongoing, but it would be helpful to know.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="10111753000037"></a>I also invite the Minister to say something on any potential health risks and the level of any such risk. A number of respondents to the consultation raised concerns on this issue. It is difficult for any Government to balance risk to health and well-being against other factors. This justification order means that the Secretary of State, having examined the issue, considers that the social, economic and other benefits of proceeding with these two reactors outweigh the health detriments. The Secretary of State is charged with making an assessment not just for citizens at this point in time but for many years ahead.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="10111753000038"></a>I know that the Secretary of State, the Minister and his colleagues are fully aware of the weight of this responsibility and I have read his considered view in the justification documents. The Secretary of State responded to the concerns raised by using evidence from a number of studies. I invite the Minister to say something further about the relative risk and the Secretary of State's assessment.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="10111753000039"></a>In its submission to the Merits Committee, Greenpeace raised a number of issues about which I hope the Minister can say something, but I draw one specific issue to his attention; namely, whether decisions on justification are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, given they are "practice as a whole" decisions and have a wide ranging impact.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="10111753000040"></a>On the third SI, on nuclear decommissioning and waste handling, the Minister will understand why I want to probe the amendments made to the impact assessment. I understood an impact assessment to be a statement of fact, so I was surprised to receive notice of a change. In the original impact assessment, at several points under what was then described as the "do nothing" option, which is now called the "correct base case", it was stated that the cost of verifying the information provided by operators in the funded decommissioning programme, or FDP, "would fall on Government".</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="10111753000041"></a>The new impact assessment states that there shall be no subsidy to new nuclear power stations and that operators should pay all costs. The reason for the change is that government policy is not to provide any subsidy to new nuclear power stations. The new policy is that the Government would seek to agree with the operator to recover reasonable costs incurred by the Secretary of State when verifying the information contained in the FDP. But the impact assessment adds:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="10111753000082"></a>"Although we would not be able to compel the operator to agree such terms, it would be likely to be in their interests and so we view it as quite likely that the costs of verification would not fall to Government".</p>

<p><a name="10111753000079"></a>Is the coalition Government's policy of no subsidy now reduced to "quite likely" and only with the agreement of the industry? What discussions have there been with the industry on this change? What is its view? How likely is "quite likely"?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="10111753000042"></a>I have raised this issue previously, following some confusion about the Secretary of State's view. I am therefore grateful to the Minister for the letter I received shortly before I came to the Chamber today, giving further advice and information on the issue of subsidy. I am trying to get an understanding of what the

He could help me further by explaining whether the change in policy still gives the industry the confidence it needs to progress. I would be grateful for the Minister's guidance on this. I know he shares the commitment on this side of the House to ensure that the power stations are in place by 2017.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="10111753000043"></a>Taking a broader examination of this statutory instrument, we need further clarification, over and above the Energy Act 2008, of what operators will be expected to provide in applying to build and operate nuclear power stations, which will clearly not be covered by the public purse. I listened carefully to the Minister's comments today, and I admit to some confusion and not fully understanding a couple of points. On the funded decommissioning programme, I am not clear exactly what is involved. Is it the case that the operator must deposit and show that funds are available for the construction and the subsequent maintenance of a storage site-prior to eventual underground storage-and all the costs of preparatory activity before decommissioning? If this is the case, it is a substantial undertaking. I think the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, raised that point as well. On the storage issue, it would certainly outlast the lifespan of those giving the undertaking. I may be wrong-which is why I am seeking clarification-but it looks as if this is a tightening of what is defined as "no public cost". If it is, has it been discussed with the industry, and what was the reaction of the industry? The point I am trying to get back to is the confidence that the industry can have in the process moving forward.</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="10111753000044"></a>My final point-I saw the Minister raise his eyebrows then-is whether the Minister can provide an update on what comes next, including the energy market reform. We have the road map showing the date for new nuclear to be in operation by 2017. However, as I have outlined today, there are a number of hurdles still to be cleared, and market reform is not in the Bill to come before us shortly. Does the Minister think it will be necessary to amend the road map, or is he confident that the issues I have raised today have been fully addressed and that there will be no further concerns?</p>

<a name="101117-0002.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="10111753000045"></a>I am sorry for having spoken slightly longer than I had intended, but there were a number of issues on which I wanted clarification. I know that the Minister has a personal commitment on these issues, and we all want to ensure that there can be confidence that they have been fully examined by your Lordships' House.</p>

This is a great day for the nuclear industry, and I am delighted. Unfortunately, everyone who has spoken seems to have left, which says a lot for my winding-up speech. I am very grateful to the noble Baroness for sitting there and listening to what I have to say. Perhaps she can report it accordingly. It is a great day for the nuclear industry, and I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord O'Neill of Clackmannan, who is a terrific exponent as chairman of the NIA, for his kind words in saying that it is a great day. I think this clearly sends confidence to the industry that we are determined to get the nuclear show on the road. We have had 13 years without the nuclear show on the

I am grateful to the previous Government for helping to change public opinion, but we have had no activity, and we now have activity. As always, the noble Lord, Lord O'Neill, makes good points in everything he says on this issue, because he is an expert. He is a pleasure to work with on this subject. He makes good points about waste, the economic benefit perhaps of economies of scale working with government and with civil waste, and I take those messages on board. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, again talks about confidence. The first two statutory instruments clearly demonstrate that there is confidence and that we are going down the road for it. Both he and the noble Baroness have asked questions on the subject of the NII. I take on board her comments, asking us to get on with sending a clear route map of what we need to do. The Government have been considering two options for the reform of nuclear regulation, as was said at Question Time last week-a discrete agency within the HSE or a standalone, statutory corporation. This is a discussion between two departments, and I assure the noble Baroness that we are pushing very hard for a conclusion on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="10111753000047"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, made a series of excellent points, as always. He talked about spent fuel and the levels of waste not being defined. They are defined in the regulations, in the companion instrument to this order, and I should be happy to have my staff take him through those pages, because I shall not be able to do it myself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="10111753000050"></a>One question is why we should designate interim stores. Operators must provide for interim stores during the life of a station and it is essential to ensure that the money is set aside. I was asked whether the funds were secure. Yes, there is protection in the funded decommissioning programme and in the Act itself. Funds must be remote from the operation of the Government. Neither party, including the Treasury, can get its hands on it. That was the concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="10111753000051"></a>The two reactors are hybrids and based on the foundation of reactors already in use. Obviously, they are not the same, because the people who make them are continually trying to improve on them and technology is moving forward on that. The noble Lord asked whether other reactors would require approval. Of course they would-as, indeed, would a Mox plant, as it does not fit within this legislation.</p>

<p><a name="10111753000062"></a>That clearly gives opportunity for a watering-down, because if similar support is made available more widely to other types of generation then obviously we will consider it from a nuclear standpoint. I hope that answers her concern in that area.</p>

I was particularly referring to the order and the FDP. It seemed to me that it was tightening up the issues around any subsidy available and all costs would fall on the operator.

There is an urgent need for a diverse range of new energy infrastructure with a massive expansion in renewables, as well as more new nuclear, clean coal and gas. All of this will help us to reinforce our domestic security of supply. Regulatory justification is one of the facilitative actions necessary to enable new nuclear power stations to be built in the UK. It requires an assessment of whether the benefits of building these nuclear reactors in the UK outweigh the radiological health detriment that they may cause.</p>

<p><a name="10111751000004"></a>From 1 April 2011, the shares for the arts, heritage and sport will increase from the current 16.66 per cent each to 18 per cent each, with the Big Lottery Fund going from 50 per cent to 46 per cent; and on 1 April 2012, the arts, heritage and sport will each go to 20 per cent, with the Big Lottery Fund moving to 40 per cent. Why we are doing this? The National Lottery was set up 16 years ago this month. It has been a huge success, raising £25 billion for good causes and over 350,000 projects. Every part of the country has benefitted. The success of the lottery depends on people continuing to buy tickets, of course, but sales remain very strong and noble Lords will be pleased to hear that, on current projections, they should remain strong.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000005"></a>It is important to remember the "additionality" principle. The lottery is intended to provide additional funds in the areas of the arts, the national heritage, sport and the voluntary and community sector. The lottery funding is not used for government matters and purposes, but rather for projects which the Government would be unlikely to fund. So despite the success of the lottery, we need to reform it so that it can remain true to its founding principles.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC62"></a><b>17 Nov 2010 : Column GC62</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000006"></a>We have said that the share change alone will provide £50 million a year extra each for the arts, heritage and sport: a total of £150 million. However, when the effect of increased lottery income and the end of the Olympic transfers is included, the cash figures will be much higher. Arts Council England should receive around £80 million a year more from 2013-14. The Heritage Lottery Fund should receive around £115 million a year more. Sport England should receive around £70 million a year more.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000007"></a>We carried out a public consultation on our proposals between May and August, and received 362 responses. As well as the lottery distributors and the devolved Administrations, we also heard from local and community organisations and others with an interest. The response was overwhelmingly supportive of the change. Seventy-three per cent of the responses clearly supported the change, with just 12 per cent opposed. In the arts, heritage and sport sectors, 97 per cent were supportive.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000008"></a>Many respondents welcomed the idea of more lottery funding for these good causes. Some wanted the change to be made in one go. We considered that option, but because the diversion to the London 2012 Olympics does not end until 2012, it would not have been able to protect voluntary and community sector funding through the Big Lottery Fund. Some respondents from the voluntary sector were concerned about the impact on their sector, but others felt, as the Government firmly believe, that the protection of voluntary and community sector funding through the Big Lottery Fund, together with the additional funds that are available through the arts, heritage and sport, will enable the sector to benefit overall. Indeed, all lottery distributors should, on current projections, have more lottery income after the Olympic transfers end, including the Big Lottery Fund.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000009"></a>Alongside the order, we intend that the Big Lottery Fund will, in future, be able to focus its funding on the voluntary and community sector. We intend to issue a policy direction which the Big Lottery Fund would be required to take into account when it makes funding decisions. Our public consultation on this ended on 29 October and we are currently considering the responses received.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000010"></a>Many respondents wanted to ensure that increases in lottery funding should not be used as an excuse for reductions in government funding. The Government agree. We remain committed to the principle of additionality, as I have already mentioned. Nothing in the order would change the principle of additionality. The lottery regime, as set out in the legislation, and the way in which distributors function, are untouched by the order, save for a discrete percentage share change to the good causes.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000011"></a>The reductions to government funding announced in the spending review are necessary across the whole of government because of the structural deficit. They have not been made to the arts, heritage and sport, because increased lottery funds will be available. Actual funding decisions are for the lottery distributors themselves to make, acting independently of government, and they will continue to be required to report each year on how their grants have met the additionality principle. So the pattern of lottery spending will continue to

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000012"></a>National Lottery Distribution FundSome voluntary and community sector respondents wondered about the effect on their organisations, but I hope I can assure noble Lords that the Government believe that the staged change, together with the increased levels of lottery income and the extra money available when the Olympic diversion ends, mean that they will not be worse off. Indeed, from 2013-14, they will be very much better off than at present. Voluntary and community organisations will also be able to benefit from the additional funds that are available in the arts, heritage and sport. The Big Lottery Fund should have about £635 million a year from 2013-14, compared with about £565 million now.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000013"></a>Some respondents from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were concerned that their countries might lose out from the change. The Government appreciate that it is difficult to make a precise estimate because a number of UK-wide distributors do not have formulas for allocating funds to each country, but we believe that in cash terms every country in the UK will be better off. Scotland should receive about £40 million a year more in 2013-14; Wales should receive more than £20 million a year more; and Northern Ireland £12 million a year more.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000014"></a>I commend the order to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="10111751000015"></a><b><a name="101117-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="10111751000145"></a>Lord Evans of Temple Guiting:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for her comprehensive statement. We on these Benches welcome and acknowledge the huge success of the National Lottery. Thousands of projects, small and large, throughout the country have shared in the fortune bestowed on them by the lottery, and thousands of community groups, millennium halls and galleries would never have existed had it not been for the lottery. That is in part because lottery money has supplemented and enhanced the work of government, thanks to the principle of additionality which the Minister spoke about. I will come back to that issue later.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000016"></a>I also put on record the achievements of those on our Benches in supporting the arts and heritage while we were in government. We greatly increased government investment, raising it to record levels. Funding for the arts rose by more than 70 per cent in real terms; and for sport, investment more than trebled. It is thanks to that that museums and galleries were able to open their doors to the public with free access. One enormous side benefit of that has been to the tourist industry.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000017"></a>Since the general election, we have had the comprehensive spending review, which plans substantially to cut the budget of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport by 24 per cent over the next four years. Cuts to the Arts Council will come to 29 per cent. English Heritage, so ably chaired by noble friend Lady Andrews, will see a third of its income cut. I would be grateful if the Minister could make a statement about what impact the Government consider these cuts will have on these vital areas of our public life.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC64"></a><b>17 Nov 2010 : Column GC64</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000018"></a>I turn now more directly to the order in question, which is to fulfil a commitment in the coalition agreement to,</p>
<ul><a name="10111751000124"></a>"reform the National Lottery so that more money goes into sport, the arts and heritage",</ul>
<p><a name="10111751000019"></a>as we heard from the Minister. I am sure all in this Room welcome that commitment. However, what was strangely absent from the coalition agreement was the resulting fall in money to the Big Lottery Fund from half of lottery funding to 40 per cent-a cut of 20 per cent. In other words, there will be a cut of 20 per cent to expenditure that is charitable or that is connected to health, education or the environment. The Government's own assessment of the impact of this change, in paragraph 10 of the Explanatory Memorandum, is that,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10111751000116"></a>"A smaller proportion of funding will be available for organisations and projects via the Big Lottery Fund".</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000020"></a>I also express great concern at the ongoing funding of many of the projects that the Big Lottery Fund has committed to. I quote from the Big Lottery Fund's 2010 annual report:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10111751000117"></a>"The fact that many of our grants will be paid out several years after they are committed means we make commitments from money we do not yet have".</p>

<p><a name="10111751000021"></a>It goes on to say that if,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10111751000118"></a>"Lottery income fell, we might be unable to meet all our commitments".</p>

<p><a name="10111751000022"></a>Is this not an income fall for the Big Lottery Fund? Is this not an issue of great concern to the Government and to all of us?</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000023"></a>We have heard a great deal from the Prime Minister about the big society and how important it is that  the voluntary sector plays a greater part in our communities-a laudable aim with which we all agree. However, we are concerned that the big society is a mask for handing over swathes of responsibility for work that has been done by government to the voluntary sector simply as a means of reducing government responsibility and expenditure. At the same time, there is great concern that government funding of the voluntary sector is under threat. I would be grateful if the Minister could provide some reassurance on this matter.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000024"></a>It is because of the proposed cut in funding to the Big Lottery Fund that I ask whether the Government will listen to the concerns of those who stand to lose. In any redistribution of money, those getting the increases will, as we know, widely welcome them, often quietly, while those who lose will loudly protest. However, in this case it seems that some of the poorest and most disadvantaged in our country are to be the losers. They are the ones who do not have the voices to protest or friends in the media to make their case. I quote from the DCMS summary of consultation responses on this order:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10111751000119"></a>"Many ... respondents were concerned that transferring funding away from the sector would have an adverse effect on many organisations, and that this would compound the effect of the anticipated forthcoming reductions in public spending, both for the organisations themselves and for their clients and the communities they work in".</p>

<p><a name="10111751000025"></a>I would be most grateful if the Minister could provide assurances to the organisations that have submitted those responses, of which I just gave an example.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000026"></a>I ask the Minister what plans the Government have to improve the efficiency of the lottery distribution organisations. The Government have indicated that they intend to impose a ceiling of 5 per cent of expenditure for administration charges. The Big Lottery Fund has reduced its expenditure on administration from more than 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent in the most recent year. How will the Government fulfil their objective, and when do they plan to do so?</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000027"></a>Turning now to the proposed increase in funding, what criteria will be used to decide how the additional funding is apportioned? How transparent will the process be? Will Ministers be involved in any way? How will the balance between national and grass-roots spending be decided? Finally, as I indicated at the beginning, I come back to the question of additionality. It is right to say that the Minister gave an absolutely irrevocable undertaking on this matter during her speech.</p>
<h5><a name="10111751000126"></a>4 pm<I></I></h5>

<p><a name="10111751000028"></a><b><a name="101117-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="10111751000146"></a>Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville:</b> My Lords, perhaps I may declare an interest as having been the Secretary of State responsible for the introduction of the lottery. I emphasise that the interest is emotional rather than financial. Additionality was discussed widely when the Bill was going through in 1993 and 1994. In those days it had the agreeable title of the National Lottery etc. Bill. There was a concern as to whether the charities would lose out through the apportionment, which was 20 per cent to each of the five lottery funds. During the passage of the Bill, the Government made the offer that in any Parliament there could always be a day's debate to discuss whether the apportionments were in fact correct, and whether the charities were losing out as a result of what had occurred by comparison with the charitable money they had received previously. After 1997, when the Labour Government came in, a general debate did not occur, but there was a consultation to which there were about 600 respondents. It was not wholly surprising, given that the people who replied were mainly producers who would be the beneficiaries of any change in the apportionment, that 90 per cent communicated that they would like the apportionments to be altered.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000029"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Evans of Temple Guiting, alluded to additionality both at the beginning and the end of his speech, and perfectly understandably raised his concerns about the change in the Big Lottery Fund's resources and that, inferentially, of its initial predecessors. I will say, having sat through the whole of the process between 1997 and 2001, that one noticed that if, for instance, the Department of Health decided that it would be agreeable for there to be a rather larger allocation from the lottery for cancer equipment, one did not hear from the lottery distributors that money was going to be coming to one's constituency. The first thing one had was a letter from Frank Dobson saying how pleased I must be that money was coming to hospitals in my constituency. I did have to warn the Secretary of State for Health that it looked as though the doctrine of additionality was actually being offended against if he was the first person to communicate the news rather than the lottery distributors themselves.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000030"></a>I conclude by saying that I wholly support what the Government are now doing and I congratulate the Minister on the way in which she introduced the order.</p>

<p><a name="10111751000031"></a><b><a name="101117-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="10111751000147"></a>Baroness Garden of Frognal:</b> My Lords, I thank both noble Lords for their comments and I am pleased to respond to the points made. Our consultation has shown that there is wide support for the changes, with many people pleased to see increased lottery funding for the arts, heritage and sport. However, I would acknowledge to the noble Lord, Lord Evans, the contribution made by the previous Government on aspects such as free entry to museums and other measures that were taken during their time in government. I also reassure the noble Lord that, in cash terms, each of the good causes of the arts, heritage and sport should expect to receive well over £100 million a year extra from 2013-14 compared with the present total of an extra £300 million a year. The additional funds will be for lottery-funded projects and need not raise any questions about breach of additionality. On that, I noted with interest the comments of my noble friend Lord Brooke and assure him that lottery projects should certainly be decided by the distributors. We hope, too, that it will be the distributors rather than Ministers who convey information on those projects in order to get the proprieties right. Nothing about this order changes that in the lottery regime.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000032"></a>The economic situation of the country has meant that government funding has to be reduced across the board. The arts, heritage and sport are not being singled out because more lottery money will be available. The noble Lord raised his concerns about that, but I assure him that in cash terms, Big will have much more money in 2012 than now. Between now and then, Big is not restricted to its annual income because it has a balance on which it can draw, so the voluntary sector should not feel the impact too severely. Of course, if lottery income generally falls, there might be a problem, but we are confident from what we hear from the Big Lottery Fund that that is not anticipated in any way.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000033"></a>All lottery distributors, including the Big Lottery Fund, should have more lottery income after the Olympic diversions end in 2012, and the voluntary and community sector will certainly be able to benefit from the extra funds in the arts, heritage and sport. This order will allow a considerable increase in the funds available for additional projects in the arts, heritage and sport, while protecting the funds available through the Big Lottery Fund for the voluntary and community sectors.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000034"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Evans, asked whether there would be an effect on Exchequer cuts. There will be a spending review, and the Government will shortly announce the administration costs of lottery distributors, which relates to another question raised by the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000035"></a>If there are other points that I have not picked up on in my response, I shall of course write to noble Lords. I beg to move.</p>

</ul>

<p><a name="10111751000037"></a><b><a name="101117-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="10111751000149"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> My Lords, all Members of the Committee will be aware of the important work that is being done by the UK Statistics Authority. This body was created in 2008 with a statutory responsibility to promote and safeguard the production and publication of official statistics. This includes the authority monitoring and reporting on official statistics.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000038"></a>Under the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007, statistics produced by the Office for National Statistics, government departments, the devolved Administrations and other Crown bodies are automatically deemed to be official statistics. The Act also makes provision for identifying other organisations as producers of official statistics. This is important as it enables their work to fall within the remit of the authority and for the public to have confidence in their statistics. The purpose of this order, which is subject to the affirmative procedure, is to specify these organisations.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000039"></a>The UK Statistics Authority has been consulted in preparing this order in accordance with the statistics Act, and is content for it to be laid. The Cabinet Office has laid this order on behalf of government departments in preference to each department laying an order for the bodies for which they are responsible. This approach saves considerable parliamentary time.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000040"></a>This is the third such order, and it revokes and replaces the one that came into force on 1 April 2009. The previous order contained 54 bodies. In arriving at the current order, three bodies have been removed from the previous order and six new bodies have been added.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000041"></a>On 14 October, the Government announced their plans to reform 481 quangos. Consequently, 37 of the 57 bodies in the order will be reformed. Once the Public Bodies Bill has received Royal Assent, many of these will be abolished through legislation. However, until the bodies are abolished or reformed, it is important to continue to recognise them as producers of official statistics so that the public can have confidence in their statistical outputs. The Government will lay a further order for the House to consider once the reforms have been completed. This is likely to be some time in 2012.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000042"></a>In summary, this order extends slightly the number of bodies that are subject to the UK Statistics Authority's oversight. These bodies will have to work to the new code of practice for official statistics, and their statistics will have the potential to be nominated for formal assessment by the authority as national statistics. The agreement of the House to the order is a vital part of enhancing public confidence in official statistics. I beg to move.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC68"></a><b>17 Nov 2010 : Column GC68</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="10111751000043"></a><b><a name="101117-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="10111751000150"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for his clear explanation. The integrity and validity of official statistics is an important issue. Numbers make the world go round, as the adage goes, and if the numbers are not right, authoritative and independent, the world has a greater tendency to go around wrongly. So the statistical output of a new number of public bodies being designated as official statistics is welcome.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000044"></a>The standards set for this designation are rightly high. The UK Statistics Authority, which we on these Benches established three years ago when we were in office, maintains high standards of integrity and independence, both in itself and in the statistics it produces-as, indeed, did its predecessor body the Office for National Statistics. It is important for the Government and for the country that it does so. Without proper statistics that are properly compiled, properly produced and properly presented, none of us can properly gauge the state of the country, the economy or where politics and government are taking us. So I welcome the inclusion of the statistical output of the new range of bodies listed in the schedule to the order and its status as official statistics. I am sure that the designation will be a benefit to the statistics, which will now be produced under official auspices.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000045"></a>One issue puzzles me, however. As the noble Lord recognised, as well as proposing this order he is also in the early stages of taking through your Lordships' House the Public Bodies Bill, which aims to scrap or modify a number of non-departmental public bodies-or, as we might call them, quangos. The Bill had its Second Reading in your Lordships' House last week, and although we on this side did not manage to convince the House of the value of sending the Bill to a special Select Committee, I think the Minister will agree that what was said in that debate gave him and his ministerial colleagues a considerable amount to think about.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000046"></a>The point that I wish to draw to noble Lords' attention today is a point which the noble Lord has himself recognised: the overlap between the organisations appearing in the list set out in the schedule to today's order and the lists of organisations set out in the schedules to the Bill. Let us take the new organisations that are listed in the schedule to today's order. Of the six new additions to the list detailing the organisations that produce official statistics, half of them appear  on a list in a schedule to the Public Bodies Bill as  being under review and, in effect, two statutory  instruments away from abolition: the Marine Management Organisation, the Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency and the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service. On the one hand, the Government, the Cabinet Office and the Minister are saying that the statistical outputs of these bodies is of such value that they qualify to be designated as official statistics, while on the other hand the Government, the Cabinet Office and the Minister are placing these organisations on a list of public bodies that have been characterised, rightly, as having, in effect, the sword of Damocles dangling permanently above their heads. And that is only with the new bodies coming on to the list in today's order.</p>

<p><a name="10111751000047"></a>The same applies to a number of bodies that are already on the list, such as the British Tourist Authority, the British Transport Police Authority and the Competition Commission; I could go on. So the question is this: where is the consistency here? Where are the signs that the Government have thought through all these issues? How does the Minister square the inclusion of a number of new and extant members on the designated list before us today with the proposals in the Bill? How can he value these organisations in one way but threaten their very existence in another? What will happen to the statistical outputs of these bodies if they are axed by another part of the Government in the future?</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000048"></a>Consistency in politics is hard to achieve, but the Government seem to be doing two entirely opposite things at the same time. I would be grateful for an explanation of how and why the Government are doing so.</p>

I do not want to repeat the debates that we have had in previous years, but I draw to the Minister's attention a point that was originally drawn to the attention of the House by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral. The body that produces the most statistics and is the most controversial, but sadly does not appear on this list, is the Bank of England. We have had happy debates in previous years about whether it would be a good idea to include the Bank on the list. I think that in the past the Bank has succeeded in persuading the Treasury that it should not be included-surprise, surprise-but the list would be strengthened, and indeed the way in which the Bank's own figures are viewed would be strengthened, if the ONS could have a look at them. I do not expect the Minister to have anything of comfort to say because I know how formidable the Bank can be in guaranteeing and protecting its independence, but it is a logical body to be covered by the order. I remain sorry that it is not.</p>

I shall deal first with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Newby. He is quite right that I am not in a position to give any immediate comfort, except to say that he will of course recognise, as does everyone, that the independence of the Bank of England has been a major development in politics. Indeed, one has to give credit to the previous Government for putting the Bank of England in a position of independent standing. Although the authority and the Bank are in regular contact with each other, they have agreed not to include the Bank in the 2010 order, and that has been done with the consent of the Cabinet Office and the Treasury. The Bank has its own code of practice for statistics, which works well for its specific and important role. It passes a lot of data on to the Office for National Statistics, and any resulting statistics, including parts of the national accounts and their publication, <I>Monetary and Financial</I><I>Statistics</I>, are national statistics and therefore fully compliant with the authority's code.</p>

<p><a name="10111751000051"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Royall, the Leader of the Opposition, made a strong point about the overlap between this order and the Public Bodies Bill, and those who are responsible for my briefing for this short debate will vouch for the fact that my first reaction on receiving the brief was, "Oh, public bodies again". There is, of course, an overlap, but I hope to persuade the noble Baroness that there is a consistency in that the Official Statistics Order deals with the current position and is designed to implement this year's additional bodies and reinforce their standing.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000052"></a>As the noble Baroness rightly pointed out, the Public Bodies Bill is legislation in progress. It is not for me, standing at the Dispatch Box and dealing with this order, to presume the outcome of the legislative process in Parliament. The Government clearly have to allow for the passage of the Bill before they can address its statistical consequences.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000053"></a>I can reassure the noble Baroness that placing bodies in Schedule 7 does not mean that they are threatened with immediate abolition or that the statistics that they produce are not an important part of government. It is therefore very important to recognise that, although a number of bodies in this order are also mentioned in the Public Bodies Bill, the collation of statistics is a matter for government and will continue to be so. Any process that produces statutory instruments under the Public Bodies Bill will address the issue of the statistics that a body may well provide to government and to the public.</p>

It will be aware that my honourable friend the Parliamentary Private Secretary for the Natural Environment and Fisheries presented this statutory instrument in another place yesterday. As the Committee knows, better regulation across government and its network of delivery bodies is an important tenet of the coalition Government's drive for responsible and accountable policy and delivery. This statutory instrument seeks to ensure, formally, that the Marine Management Organisation adheres to a common standard of better regulation by adding it to the existing list of bodies that are subject to the legislative and regulatory format of 2006.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC71"></a><b>17 Nov 2010 : Column GC71</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000056"></a>The principles of better regulation stipulate that regulatory activities should be transparent, accountable, proportionate, consistent and targeted. I am sure noble Lords will agree that these principles must underpin the effective working of all our public bodies. The MMO has been following these principles since vesting on 1 April this year. The framework document setting out its remit and corporate governance responsibilities, as agreed by the MMO and its sponsors, states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10111751000120"></a>"As a government regulator the MMO must have regard to the five principles of good regulation ... The MMO will have a risk-based, proportionate, targeted and flexible approach to regulatory inspection and enforcement".</p>

<p><a name="10111751000112"></a>Although the MMO already complies with this, it is nevertheless important to recognise formally its commitment to these regulatory principles.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000057"></a>The Committee will also know that the MMO is the Government's key delivery body for marine policy, bringing together management for a number of marine activities including fishing, nature conservation, planning, licensing and enforcement. Delivering functions on behalf of a range of government departments, the MMO is jointly sponsored by the Department for Communities and Local Government, the Department of Energy and Climate Change, the Department for Transport, the Ministry of Defence, and my department, Defra. The length and breadth of responsibilities that rest at the door of the MMO are huge and range from planning and fishing to aggregate extraction and pollution control. Its influence is felt not only locally but at a national and international level.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000058"></a>That is exactly what we-the Government, the Opposition and all parties-envisaged when the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 passed through Parliament. People right across the political spectrum worked together to put this important piece of legislation on to the statute book. For my part, now that we are in government we want to ensure that the legislation is enacted correctly. It is therefore right that the MMO adheres to the common standards of better regulation, and today this statutory instrument recognises their efforts. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="10111751000059"></a><b><a name="101117-gc0001.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="10111751000155"></a>Baroness Quin:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for bringing forward the order and for explaining it. From the outset, I can assure him of the support of the Opposition for the instrument. It is good that, as a result of the delay caused by parliamentary business, the MMO could be consulted; obviously, it is right to add it to the list of regulators and that it should have to meet the key principles of good regulation which the Minister has enunciated.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000060"></a>As he said, the MMO was created as part of the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009. It is a cross-cutting body that brings together key maritime decision-making powers-planning, regulating and licensing activity-in the marine area. It has the overarching emphasis on and duty to the promotion of sustainable development. Generally, I strongly agree with the Minister that the Act and the establishment of the MMO is good news for the public, particularly with the establishment of marine protected areas, which have been described as doing what national parks did for enhancing awareness of the natural environment and countryside but this time in the marine environment.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC72"></a><b>17 Nov 2010 : Column GC72</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000061"></a>The role of the MMO is very important in fulfilling the terms of the Act. Not surprisingly, the Minister will understand that I, as a north-easterner, very strongly welcome the establishment of the MMO in the north-east of England, with its long maritime tradition, its superb Newcastle University marine research department and, indeed, allied facilities such as the very long-established research facility, the Dove Marine Laboratory at Cullercoats.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000062"></a>I am also glad that the Government have a strong commitment to the MMO. Perhaps, via the Minister in this House, I could congratulate the Minister in the other place who spoke to this order yesterday. He admitted that in opposition he had concerns about the MMO, but he said firmly that his reservations had been resolved after visiting the organisation and that he now had nothing but praise for the motivation of the staff and their determination to make it a success. I, for one, very much welcomed the remarks that the Minister in the other place made in Committee yesterday.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000063"></a>Not surprisingly, I have concerns about the effect of budgetary cuts on the organisation. It was recently established, and it was to be a lean, mean and efficient organisation without lavish start-up costs. For that reason, we are concerned that it should not bear the heavy brunt of cuts in current circumstances, and that it should have the resources to carry out its work and responsibilities.</p>
<h5><a name="10111751000131"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000064"></a>The Minister in the other place gave some assurance yesterday that the cuts that might be asked of the MMO would be much less than those for other organisations in the department. At the same time, he indicated that further details would become available. I urge the Minister today to keep the House informed of the effects of budgetary cuts on the MMO and its ability to carry out its functions. Not surprisingly, given that the current Opposition were in government when the MMO came into being and were committed to its establishment and the effective workings of the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009, we will be watching this closely; we are anxious to make it a success. Having said those words, I am happy to support the Minister in what he has said today.</p>

<p><a name="10111751000065"></a><b><a name="101117-gc0001.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="10111751000156"></a>Lord Henley:</b> I thank the noble Baroness for her comments. We are grateful for them, particularly for certain points that she underlined, such as the fact that there is a duty on the MMO to promote sustainable development. We will ensure that that continues. I also thank her for emphasising its north-eastern connections. I might be from the north-west but these matters are still important to me. I will certainly pass her remarks back to my honourable friend, who will, I am sure, be very grateful for what she said in praise of him and what he said in another place.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000066"></a>The noble Baroness asked, in effect, only one question and that was about the spending review and the effect it might have on the MMO. She will appreciate that  I cannot go into any further detail only 24 hours after my honourable friend spoke in another place, but I will make two comments, which I think my honourable friend made, to give her some assurance. First, we  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC73"></a><b>17 Nov 2010 : Column GC73</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>accept that the MMO is a new organisation and has been created as a lean and fit machine, as the noble Baroness described it. The implication behind this was that there might not be much fat on it. Its newness and the fact that it has further duties that it will have to take on next year will be taken into account as we develop the details of the spending review. Obviously, no part of government or Defra can be immune from that, but those two factors are relevant to any decisions that we make about the MMO.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000067"></a>Secondly, as an adjunct to that, the noble Baroness asked that we keep her and the House informed of any details of this. Again, I have given assurances that that will be the case in due course. I end by thanking the noble Baroness again for her contribution. I beg to move.</p>

<ul><a name="10111751000141"></a>
<p>That the Grand Committee do report to the House that is has considered the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) (Amendment) Regulations 2010.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="10111751000068"></a><b><a name="101117-gc0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="10111751000158"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord Henley):</b> My Lords, these regulations set new recovery and recycling targets for packaging waste for 2011 and 2012. They will also improve transparency in the way in which the packaging recycling system is funded and will make a number of technical changes to improve the clarity of the regulations and reduce costs to business.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000069"></a>First, it should be remembered that tackling waste is not just the responsibility of government; it is a responsibility for all of us, including businesses, private individuals and local authorities. It is for this reason that the Government are undertaking a review to look at all aspects of waste policy and delivery in England. The review's main aim will be to ensure that together we are taking the right steps towards creating a zero-waste economy in which resources are fully valued and nothing of value gets thrown away.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000070"></a>Last year, nearly 11 million tonnes of packaging were placed on the United Kingdom market with the products that it protects. About half this packaging is from household goods, and after use it accounts for about 20 per cent of household waste. The rest of the packaging is used and disposed of by businesses, and it accounts for about 10 per cent of commercial and industrial waste.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000071"></a>The EU directive on packaging and packaging waste, which has been in place since 1994, requires member states to recover every year a minimum of 60 per cent of all packaging waste, of which 55 per cent must be recycled. Through the producer responsibility system that we have put in place in the UK and which is set out in these regulations, the UK achieved those targets in 2008 and 2009 and is on course to do so again in  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC74"></a><b>17 Nov 2010 : Column GC74</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>2010. However, the current regulations set recycling targets for packaging producers in the UK only until the end of 2010. We therefore we need to put measures in place to ensure that the UK continues to meet the EU packaging recycling targets in future years, and so ensure that packaging waste continues to be recycled. If we do not, we can expect rather costly infraction proceedings. At the same time, we need to ensure that these targets are achieved at the lowest possible cost to businesses to support them in this challenging economic climate.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000072"></a>The Government will set out our long-term approach to packaging as part of the waste review, to which I referred, which is due to be published next spring. In the mean time, the Government propose in these regulations to set packaging recycling targets for 2011 and 2012 only, and at a level that will ensure the delivery of the EU targets in the packaging directive but no more. Targets for 2013 and beyond will then be considered in light of findings of the review.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000073"></a>The regulations also include provisions to improve the transparency of the funding associated with packaging waste recovery notes, PRNs, and packaging waste export recovery notes, PERNs-the evidence notes issued by reprocessors and exporters to show that recovery and recycling has taken place. Reprocessors and exporters will now be required to report on how they have spent the PRN revenue against new more defined categories. The new categories, developed with the industry, will provide a more accurate picture of how this funding is used to benefit the packaging recycling system as a whole.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000074"></a>Finally, the regulations contain a number of minor technical changes. Most of them aim to clarify definitions, key dates for data returns and payment deadlines, and update references to legislation revised since 2007. Two changes are deregulatory. First, the amendment removes the requirement for reprocessors and exporters to have an independent audit, which can cost up to £10,000 for a large company. Secondly, it will allow a certain category of smaller businesses to use a simpler method to calculate their legal obligation, which will save time and effort. Benefits from these mean that as a whole, the proposed package of changes will reduce the net administrative burden placed on UK businesses by between £285,000 and £371,000 annually.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000075"></a>In conclusion, I believe that the amendments that the Government are proposing to the packaging regulations will enable the UK to continue to meet its EU obligations, while minimising costs to UK businesses; will make the flow of producer funding more transparent for producers and local authorities; and will resolve a number of technical issues, which will overall reduce costs to business. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</p>

<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC75"></a><b>17 Nov 2010 : Column GC75</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a continuation of an existing policy and approach, and derive from EU obligations. As the Minister explained, the targets needed to be updated for the immediate future. In responding for the Opposition, I simply raise a few questions that are largely stimulated by the Explanatory Memorandum. We know that consultation has taken place on the regulations, and I ask the Minister about the level of interest in the consultation and the overall responses to it. Is he happy about how extensive the consultation was and whether those who will be affected by the regulations heard about it and had a fair chance to give their views?</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000077"></a>The Minister was uncharacteristically uncharitable yesterday at Question Time in referring to consultations under the previous Government. In my modest experience as a Minister, consultations were very important in arriving at and even changing government policy. It would be interesting to hear how effectively the Minister rates the consultation process that took place on the regulations.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000078"></a>At paragraph 7.3 of the Explanatory Memorandum, mention is made of the targets being set higher to offset the exemption for small businesses. Were any problems created through that; were there any specific areas of difficulty? I am not sure what proportion of SMEs are covered by the regulations. Does the Minister consider that the burden that is now on SMEs through the renegotiation of the regulations is reasonable?</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000079"></a>In paragraph 7.6 of the Explanatory Memorandum, the Government talk about longer-term targets being set. I would be grateful if the Minister could give us an idea of the timetable for that process. In paragraph 7.7, mention is made of the revenue that can be raised. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10111751000121"></a>"Reprocessors and exporters are not compelled to spend the revenue in any specific way".</p>

<p><a name="10111751000113"></a>Was any specific obligation on the spending of that revenue ever considered? Does the Minister have any further information about that?</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000080"></a>In paragraph 7.10, the Government say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10111751000122"></a>"Most of the changes will have a negligible impact on businesses".</p>

<p><a name="10111751000114"></a>I am happy to accept that that is the case, but since "most" is not all, it would be interesting if he could give us any information about what seem to be the most significant impacts of the changes.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000081"></a>Paragraph 7.11, to which the Minister referred, states that there is to be:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="10111751000123"></a>"The removal of the requirement on reprocessors and exporters to be independently audited".</p>

<p><a name="10111751000115"></a>When I first read this I felt some concern, because independent auditing requirements are often extremely important. However, I understand from a later point in the Explanatory Memorandum that the regulators were happy with this change. None the less, I would be grateful if the Minister could tell us whether the regulators have any outstanding concerns about that. I realise that this may not be easy to answer, but can he say whether this requirement for independent auditing happens elsewhere in the EU, given that we are talking about EU regulations?

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000082"></a>My final question is fairly basic but important. Can the Minister assure us that nothing in these regulations will affect negatively our recycling targets and the other environmental commitments that we have entered into? We want to be reassured on that point.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000083"></a>Once again, I thank the Minister for the way in which he introduced these regulations and for explaining the large element of continuity in them, which certainly seems to be in evidence.</p>

<p><a name="10111751000084"></a><b><a name="101117-gc0001.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="10111751000160"></a>Lord Deben:</b> My Lords, I apologise for not being here for the Minister's speech, except for his excellent final paragraph, but I was caught in the Chamber, having intervened on what turned out to be a rather controversial occasion. Politeness meant that I had to remain there until it had finished. I should also declare an interest-two interests, really. I was the Minister who invented these regulations and drew up the environmental regulations that were accepted by the European Union. This is unusual, because these regulations were created by Britain and France together to avoid the interference in trade that had otherwise occurred. Therefore, the regulations are permissive in the means by which we meet the ends. It is a very British concept. I also declare an interest as chairman of Valpak, which is the largest of the organisations that help businesses to meet the obligations under the regulations. It is a not-for-profit organisation set up by British industry and covers about 65 per cent of those who have to meet the regulations. I declare an interest, but perhaps I also declare knowing something about how these things work, which is not easy because they are somewhat complicated.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000085"></a>I have to say that there is a real and fundamental disagreement with the way in which the Government have decided to proceed. Britain has managed to become not the worst operator of recycling-as the noble Baroness knows, we have not been very good in our recycling record-by having the most permissive system that you could possibly have. It is very competitive and we have managed to do this probably more cheaply than any other country in Europe. Last year, it cost British business roughly £180 million to meet the obligations. It is likely to have cost German business about £1.8 billion. That is the difference in the efficacy of our systems; this is not a heavy burden on our businesses. Indeed, we actually have a positive advantage, because we run the system so effectively. I have to say that that is because we went in for a good capitalist system-it is competitive. Anyone who provides services has to compete with everyone else; if you do not provide or buy the evidence of recycling at the lowest possible cost, they do not come to you, they go to someone else. There is a real reason for this.</p>
<h5><a name="10111751000135"></a>5 pm</h5>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000086"></a>The other reason why it has worked is that every year the targets have been lifted, not hugely but enough to keep the whole thing moving. Those who provide recycling facilities know that if they invest in them on the basis of this year's demand, by the next year there will be sufficient increase for that investment to have been worth while. On the one occasion on which the previous Government did not act in this way, it had  a very serious effect. Recycling facilities were laid up  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC77"></a><b>17 Nov 2010 : Column GC77</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and the programme for the creation of such facilities was interrupted. It took us at least a couple of years to get back into the system. History shows that when you do this, it has a real effect.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000087"></a>I ask my noble friend why he has decided to do this when almost the whole of British industry is perfectly happy to have gently rising targets. It has accepted that it is a sensible system. The noble Baroness mentioned SMEs. One problem with the system is that it has a very high de minimis level. Because of this, SMEs are to a large extent excluded. They do not normally put enough on the market to bring them into the system. That means that when you talk about meeting a percentage target, it is the percentage of a sum that is affected by the de minimis numbers being excluded. We could even have a situation in which we technically recycled more than 100 per cent of the total amount because we exclude so much at the bottom.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000088"></a>This system is designed to help the poorest, those least able to pay and those with the least opportunity to have a proper system that enables them to manage the bureaucracy. However, I say to my noble friend that I have canvassed opinion widely. The industry, large and medium-sized players alike, very much welcomes the fact that the previous Government went into a system in which they advertised the increase in targets well in advance. People knew that they were coming and very much welcomed that fact. Therefore, when one has fundamentally flat targets, the effect on the system is serious. It is already serious. One has only to look at the effect on glass prices at this moment. They have been very much affected by this knowledge, which has been around for a long time; people have known what the Government had in mind.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000089"></a>I put this to my noble friend; if we have two years of flat targets, there will be a considerable diminution in the amount of money that goes to local authorities. If the targets are low and people do not pay a proper price for recycling, the return to a local authority for collecting, say, bottles diminishes. It may be excluded altogether. A large number of local authorities may find it difficult in these straitened circumstances to continue with their services, which would be a great pity. I know my noble friend thinks that my warnings are not correct. However, we are both Conservatives. Conservatives normally go for their advice to those who actually do the job. There is a universal view among those who do the job that a gentle increase is the way to achieve this end.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000090"></a>I would not have troubled your Lordships on this occasion. Indeed, it is my first attempt to speak in Grand Committee, which is daunting because of the small numbers that are present; it is a curious way of speaking. Perhaps this is an occasion on which declaring an interest is valuable. It shows one's technical understanding of what is going on. I know that this is not a sensible system because we cannot change the regulations. However, I would like an absolute assurance that, if I am right, my noble friend will not wait for reports from waste committees and so on, but will return to this Committee next year with a change, which is perfectly possible under these regulations, to ensure that local authorities can go on doing their job and that British industry is listened to. That is what it   


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC78"></a><b>17 Nov 2010 : Column GC78</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>wants. It would be improper of me to quote them, but hardly a household name agrees with the regulations. Most are overwhelmingly in favour of a gentle increase.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000091"></a>Finally, I hope the Minister will set his face against those who somehow think that it is an imposition on British industry to do better in environmental matters than the rest of Europe. One of the things we are up against is that the European Union, of which I am a passionate supporter, is slow in putting all this right, so we are in position in which we can do this. It is a pity that we have not set an example and that we have not moved as we should have. I hope my noble friend will give a commitment to try this. If he is right, I shall be happy to come back on a suitable occasion and say, "Mea culpa. I was wrong; the expert was faulty and the onlooker saw more of the game". I would be as humble as he would wish me to be. In return, if it turns out that there is a serious diminution in the provision for recycling, and if there is a clear sign that local authorities are finding things more difficult than before, I hope he will give a commitment to come back to the House and lay a new order.</p>

<p><a name="10111751000092"></a><b><a name="101117-gc0001.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="10111751000161"></a>Lord Addington:</b> My Lords, after the last speech I feel that I am treading on someone else's carpet. It was an extremely interesting intervention and both my noble friends should be encouraged to continue talking about the questions raised. If there is a danger that the incentive to carry on will be removed, given the expertise here we should consider that matter. If allies of long standing, new allies and all those who are interested in the field say that there is a danger here, perhaps the Minister can give an assurance that the Government will keep a weather eye on the situation. I would be reassured by that commitment.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000093"></a>It is more reassuring when you hear from someone who genuinely knows what they are talking about; not a parliamentary expert, which is how I interpret someone who has merely spoken on the subject three times,  but someone who knows something about it. I hope the noble Lord, Lord Henley, will say that the Government are watching the situation and monitoring these  concerns, because if we cannot have a broad church on environmental matters we should give up and go home now.</p>

<p><a name="10111751000094"></a><b><a name="101117-gc0001.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="10111751000162"></a>Lord Henley:</b> My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Quin, teased me at the beginning of her remarks that I had possibly over-attacked her at Question Time yesterday on the subject of conservation, and I wonder whether I possibly over-egged my remarks. Perhaps I was provoked by the noble Baroness; I am not sure. I accept that her Government consulted effectively on some occasions and I hope she will accept that, when we consult, we consult genuinely and with a real intention to listen. She asked what interest was shown. I can assure her that we had 96 responses from local authorities, producers and trade associations, and that the consultation covered the usual 12 weeks. I hope I can say that we consulted enough; that, as far as one ever can, we got to everyone it was necessary to get to, although one can never guarantee that; and that we covered as many SMEs or their representatives as possible. Very often, SMEs  do not have time to respond themselves but have representatives who can.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000101"></a>The noble Baroness then asked about the waste review-again, a matter raised by my noble friend Lord Deben-and when it would come out. Our intention is to publish it in April of that year. April might turn out not to be a suitable month because, as the noble Baroness will know, there are local government elections on 5 May. It might therefore have to be published on  6 May, but I cannot give a precise date other than an assurance that it will be before June.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000102"></a>On independent auditing, again I can give an assurance that, as I made clear in my opening remarks, we are keen to try to reduce the burden on all businesses. So far as I am aware, the regulators were perfectly happy. I am not aware of any concerns. We will continue, as we have said in the past, to make sure that we strive to meet all our recycling targets, and our targets post-2012 will be considered as part of the review to be published in 2011.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000103"></a>I turn to the points made by my noble friend, and again I pay tribute to him for, as he reminded us, inventing these regulations, getting them through with the support of the French-something I hope we will be able to do more often in the future, but we are all learning new tricks at this stage-and getting them agreed. I am also grateful to him for stressing their efficacy and the competitiveness of our system. What my noble friend is saying in effect is that our targets for 2011-12 are not ambitious enough. The simple answer to that is that we will have the review and we want to make sure that we get everything right before we move on.</p>

<p><a name="10111751000104"></a><b><a name="101117-gc0001.htm_spnew24"></a><a name="10111751000169"></a>Lord Deben:</b> I understand my noble friend's view, but this is a continuing system. If you decide to stand aside for a relatively important period, as this would be-if my noble friend can tell me that it will be for only a year I shall be happier-the fact of history is that it takes you several years to catch up if you discover that you do want to raise the targets. As I cannot imagine that anyone in the coalition would want to lower the targets, it might be better to do this as we have done it for the past 12 years.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC80"></a><b>17 Nov 2010 : Column GC80</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

In some respects we are continuing with that line. Perhaps I can offer him some encouragement in another field in this area. One of the other drivers of these things is the landfill tax. It will continue with its escalator, which is due to go on up to 2015, at which point I think it will reach £80 a tonne. It is certainly a driver for all those involved in waste when considering how to handle waste. What happens to the tax after that, as my noble friend is perfectly well aware, is not a matter on which I can comment. No doubt colleagues in the Treasury will look at the efficacy of that particular tax because it is one of the most successful taxes that has ever been created in changing behaviour.</p>

<a name="101117-gc0001.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="10111751000106"></a>My noble friend also said that he has been listening to those who advise him and that he wants the Government also to listen to them. He said that if he was wrong he would come to me, as he put it, covered in sackcloth and ashes and admit it. If we are wrong, I see no reason why we cannot amend things later, but in the mean time we want to get the waste review right. Once we have done that we can look at these issues again.</p>

<p><a name="10111751000107"></a><b><a name="101117-gc0001.htm_spnew26"></a><a name="10111751000171"></a>Lord Deben:</b> Can my noble friend assure me that nothing will stop him-let me put it as delicately as that-coming back next year with a revision, or does he really mean that the arrangements for the waste review will mean that it will be at least two years before he can change this?</p>

<p><a name="10111751000108"></a><b><a name="101117-gc0001.htm_spnew27"></a><a name="10111751000172"></a>Lord Henley:</b> I cannot give my noble friend an absolute assurance because we want to consider the results of the waste review before we come to decisions. He will know that Governments can do  a great deal of things as and when they wish, particularly after publishing a review. I certainly cannot give an assurance that we will do something. All I can say is that we might, if it was necessary. I would then come to the noble Lord in sackcloth and ashes to say "Mea culpa" and whatever else he wished me to say. I am not saying that we will do this; I am saying that it is always a possibility.</p>

<p><a name="10111751000109"></a><b><a name="101117-gc0001.htm_spnew28"></a><a name="10111751000173"></a>Lord Deben:</b> Of course my noble friend cannot say that he will do it; indeed, that is not what I asked him. I asked him whether, if it turned out that it were necessary, he would do it. I am sure that he would. My question now is: if it were necessary, could he do it in the time, or could something in the circumstances make it impossible? If nothing in the circumstances would make it impossible, I am happy to rest on his good assurances and he need not say "Mea culpa"  to me.</p>

<p><a name="10111751000110"></a><b><a name="101117-gc0001.htm_spnew29"></a><a name="10111751000174"></a>Lord Henley:</b> I can never give an absolute guarantee; it would have to be a guarantee given by me at this stage. All that I am saying is that I believe that it would be possible if necessary. I might be wrong, but my noble friend will have to rest on that assurance. The important thing is that we think that it is right and proper to get these things sorted out, as we are doing now, for 2011-12, then publish our waste review and then take things forward and make further decisions

I know that my noble friend says that the price of glass has collapsed. We have seen that in the past and it has gone back up again. We have seen that with other recyclables. I think we can cope with that. These are not the only drivers in this field; as I mentioned, there is also the landfill tax. I do not believe that we face the problems that my noble  friend suggests.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="10111739000011"></a>Today, I am setting out the steps that the Government are taking to support workers to establish employee-led mutual organisations.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="10111739000012"></a>Every government department will put in place a "right to provide"-a right for public sector workers to take over the running of services. These rights will not be uniform across departments because each department's requirements will be different. The rights will be as far reaching as possible, but we accept that there will be areas where it will not be possible to mutualise, for example, because of security or operational stability concerns. It will be for departments to set out these areas.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="10111739000013"></a>The Cabinet Office will work with departments to explore where public procurement processes allow for staff forming a mutual to be awarded a contract to continue providing services.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="10111739000014"></a>In developing and implementing these new rights it is important that central Government lead by example. I will announce today that the Government will develop a right for civil servants directly employed by departments to form mutuals. In the wider public sector workforce, it will be necessary for Government to work with local public sector bodies and employers.</p>

<a name="101117-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="10111739000015"></a>The Government will not seek to dictate what is best for employees and for the users of services; rather, the precise model of mutualisation should follow the service being provided, which could, for example, include joint ventures.</p>

<a name="101117-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="10111739000016"></a>I am establishing a challenge group in Government to advise me and other ministerial colleagues on how we can best enable the success of this policy. This group will convene key policy-makers and experts to drive the changes to policy and process necessary across Whitehall.</p>

<a name="101117-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="10111739000017"></a>From spring 2011, the Government will invest more than £10 million to fund a programme of support for some of the most promising and innovative mutuals so that they reach the point of investment readiness. This will build on the work of leading organisations in the sector to develop a network within which public sector employees, investors and public service commissioners can develop viable businesses.</p>

<a name="101117-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="10111739000018"></a>The new suite of rights to provide is part of the Government's broader commitment to ensure that a much wider range of organisations can deliver excellent and efficient public services. The Government will publish a White Paper on reform early next year, setting out where we can go further to shift power away from central government to citizens, communities and independent providers.</p>

<a name="10111739000019"></a><b><a name="101117-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="10111739000049"></a>The Commercial Secretary to the Treasury (Lord Sassoon):</b> My honourable friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Justine Greening) has today made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="101117-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="10111739000020"></a>I represented the UK at budget ECOFIN on 11 November, resuming on 15 November. The council meeting took place alongside a meeting of the Council-European Parliament conciliation committee on the 2011 EU budget.</p>

<a name="101117-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="10111739000021"></a>At a time of unprecedented economic and financial difficulty throughout the EU, the Government had made clear that a 6 per cent increase in the 2011 EU budget above 2010 levels, called for by the Commission and the European Parliament, was unacceptable. In July the UK voted against Council's position calling for a 2.91 per cent increase in the budget, with six other member states. This position was nevertheless adopted by qualified majority. At the European Council on 29 October, my right honourable friend the Prime Minister led 12 other EU leaders in stating clearly that we could not accept any budget increase beyond the level agreed by the majority in Council.</p>

<a name="101117-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="10111739000022"></a>The Government's aim at these budget ECOFIN and conciliation committee meetings was to agree a budget for the EU in 2011 at the level of a 2.91 per cent increase. The European Parliament said that it was prepared in principle to accept this figure. The Government believe that agreement could have been reached on the 2011 budget in these terms, fulfilling the conciliation committee's mandate.</p>

<a name="101117-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="10111739000023"></a>However, the European Parliament also demanded an outcome on a number of broader, strategic budgetary issues. These included text on an increased role for the European Parliament in discussions of the next financial framework and the EU's own resources, as well as a provision for flexibility to increase spending in the EU budget in future years.</p>

<a name="101117-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="10111739000024"></a>The Government were not prepared to accept these conditions for agreement to the 2011 budget. At a time of widespread austerity measures, the Government believed that the over-riding priority for these meetings was to agree on next year's EU budget, and that it was inappropriate to condition agreement to progress on these longer-term political issues. A number of member states expressed similar concerns.</p>

<a name="101117-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="10111739000025"></a>The European Parliament was not prepared to agree the 2011 budget in these circumstances,  ending the negotiating session on 11 November and declaring the conciliation committee's deadline reached on 15 November. The committee therefore ended without agreeing a budget for next year. The Commission must now present a new draft budget for 2011 as a basis for further negotiations.</p>

<a name="101117-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="10111739000026"></a>The Government strongly believe that there was a prospect for agreement on the 2011 budget at these meetings. Both Council and the European Parliament said they could have accepted a budget increase of 2.91 per cent in 2011 compared to 2010 levels. However, the Government were simply not prepared to enter an

In these circumstances, the Government believe it was better for UK taxpayers not to reach agreement yesterday at all, rather than making a bad agreement which was counter to the interests of UK taxpayers.</p>

<a name="101117-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="10111739000027"></a>The Government will continue to engage constructively in further negotiations aimed at securing agreement to a 2011 EU budget.</p>

<a name="10111739000028"></a><b><a name="101117-wms0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="10111739000050"></a>Baroness Rawlings:</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport (Mr Edward Vaizey) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="101117-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="10111739000029"></a>The education, youth, culture and sport council will be held on 18-19 November in Brussels. Culture, audiovisual and sport issues will be taken on 18 November. The deputy UK permanent representative, Andy Lebrecht, will be representing the UK for the culture and audiovisual section of the council. The Minister for Sport and the Olympics, Hugh Robertson MP, will represent the UK for the sport section of the council.</p>

<a name="101117-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="10111739000030"></a>The first item on the agenda will be a progress report from the presidency on the ongoing negotiations on the proposal for a European heritage label (EHL). The EHL is a proposal that builds on an informal process launched independently by a group of member states in 2007. The designation is intended to focus on the promotion of sites that "symbolise and strengthen European history and heritage", rather than conservation. Although the UK does not oppose the creation of the EHL in principle, the Government have reservations about the need for a new scheme that presents the potential for duplication of the UNESCO world heritage list. The UK has actively supported the voluntary nature of the scheme, opposed any additional cost burdens and supported changes to make the scheme as light touch as possible. As this item will only be a progress report from the presidency, no formal agreement on the proposal will be reached at the council meeting.</p>

<a name="101117-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="10111739000031"></a>The presidency will seek the adoption of a decision on the selection of a city to host the European capital of culture event for 2015. Belgium and the Czech Republic are the EU member states eligible to nominate cites for 2015. Belgium has put forward the city of Mons for the title. The UK will support this proposal. The selection procedures for the Czech Republic are still ongoing and are due to be completed in early 2011.</p>

<a name="101117-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="10111739000032"></a>The council will be invited to adopt conclusions on the work plan for culture 2011-2014. The conclusions take into account the final reports from the culture open method of co-ordination (OMC) groups and the Commission report on the implementation of the European agenda for culture, noting the member states' support for continuing the OMC work. The work plan sets out six priority areas. These are: cultural diversity, intercultural dialogue and accessible and inclusive culture;  


<notus-date day="17" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS45"></a><b>17 Nov 2010 : Column WS45</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>cultural and creative industries; skills and mobility; cultural heritage including mobility of collections; culture in external relations; and culture statistics. The implementation of the work plan will be achieved by four new OMC groups, presidency seminars and Commission activity. The UK will support the adoption of these conclusions.</p>

<a name="101117-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="10111739000033"></a>The council is expected to adopt council conclusions on the role of culture in combating poverty and social exclusion. The conclusions address the need to consider cultural policies in the fight against poverty and social exclusion. The UK welcomed these conclusions especially as this year has been designated as the European Year of Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. The UK will support the adoption of these conclusions.</p>

<a name="101117-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="10111739000034"></a>The council will be invited to adopt conclusions on European film heritage, including the challenges of the digital era. The conclusions focus on the need to safeguard the cultural heritage of film in the light  of evolving digital technologies. They invite member  states to adapt existing legal deposit arrangements to cover film, to promote voluntary deposit and suitable arrangements for preservation, exhibition and use of films, including digitisation of film heritage and film archive education and training. The UK is broadly supportive of the aims of the conclusions and intends to support their adoption.</p>

<a name="101117-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="10111739000035"></a>The council is expected to adopt the council conclusions on the opportunities and challenges for European cinema in the digital era. The conclusions aim to promote the use of digital technologies for film distribution, including for art-house and rural cinemas, to promote access to European works, cultural and linguistic diversity and social cohesion. The conclusions welcome Commission plans to provide funding through the Media programme before the end of 2010 to support digitisation. The UK intends to support the adoption of these conclusions.</p>

<a name="101117-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="10111739000036"></a>There will then be a discussion of a presidency paper on the cultural and audiovisual strands of the digital agenda. The paper asks questions on which cultural and audiovisual strands should be considered a priority in the digital agenda and how this can be reflected. The deputy permanent representative will intervene to outline the two UK priorities. The first priority is the need to address the fragmented state of the European digital market to reduce burdens on business, to make it easier for consumers to get access to legitimate content and to reduce piracy. The UK's second overarching priority in respect of the cultural and audiovisual strands of the digital agenda is digital literacy and skills.</p>

<a name="101117-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="10111739000037"></a>Under the sport section of the meeting, the council is expected to adopt a resolution on the creation of high-level structured dialogue between representatives of the sport movement and EU public authorities. The new structured dialogue process will bring together the high-level sports movement and EU public authorities once per presidency, in the margins of the council meeting. This could potentially be an important  and influential group, with senior sport figures taking key seats. The UK will support the agreement of this resolution.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="10111739000038"></a>The council is invited to adopt the council conclusions on sport and social inclusion, demonstrating the value that it places on sport. The conclusions highlight the power of sport to break down social barriers and promote social inclusion. The conclusions invite the member states to take action at domestic level. The UK has a strong story to tell on sports performance in these areas and will support the adoption of these conclusions.</p>

<a name="101117-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="10111739000039"></a>There will then follow a policy debate on social inclusion in and through sport. The presidency has posed questions on specific projects running in member states aimed at promoting sport among socially disadvantaged groups and what priorities member states envisage for work at EU level in this field. The Minister for Sport and the Olympics will intervene to highlight examples of initiatives in the UK and to welcome the new working group on social inclusion in sport in which the UK is taking a leading role.</p>

<a name="101117-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="10111739000040"></a>The council is also invited to adopt council conclusions on the role of the EU in the fight against doping. The conclusions intend to officially recognise the need for appropriate co-ordination on issues concerning the EU and member states' dealings with the World Anti-Doping Agency. The UK intends to support these conclusions.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="10111739000041"></a>Under any other business, there will be an information point from the Luxembourg delegation on a draft extended partial agreement on the Council of Europe cultural routes programme. There will also be an information point from the Bulgarian delegation on the charity campaign for the recovery of the Triumph theatre in Haiti. I do not foresee a need to intervene on either of these.</p>

At a difficult time, Ministers' aim has been to ensure that the maximum amount of funding is spent at the front line, rather than on bureaucracy. Ministers had regular discussions with those arm's-length bodies during the Spending Review and those discussions continue. We are confident that in cutting administration in order to limit cuts to the front line, arts organisations across the country will continue to thrive.</p>

Eurest does supply British produce where it is economically viable to do so. The Written Answer by Lord Henley referred to in the Question shows that 85 per cent of pork is procured from UK sources. British bacon is not procured by the supplier for use on its contract with the department, with price being the determining factor. While British products are encouraged, canteen customers are cost-conscious and the supplier's focus is on keeping prices at the point of sale as low as possible. Eurest recently trialled the use of British bacon, which attracted a price premium at some of the department's sites through a "Best of British Bacon" promotion, but sales were negligible.</p>

Throughout the Spending Review process, the Treasury looked closely at the impacts that decisions may have on different groups. The Treasury published the document <I>Overview of Equalities Impacts of the Spending Review</I> on 20 October alongside the announcement. This document outlines in more detail the approach taken to assessing the impact of the Spending Review on different groups.</p>

<a name="101117w0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_29"></a><a name="10111740000065"></a>However, the role of the Treasury at the Spending Review is to allocate resources between departments. It is for departments to consider the equalities impacts as they develop their policies in line with their Spending Review settlements. Ministers will therefore consider equalities impacts and whether mitigation options are appropriate and compatible with their policy aims as they make the decisions necessary to live within their Spending Review settlements. For example, people claiming disability living allowance are exempt from the household cap on income from benefits; this is a mitigating action to limit the effect of the policy on disabled people.</p>

The current version is dated 2010. Changes to the STPCD are made following recommendations from the independent School Teachers' Review Body (STRB). The Secretary of State issued a remit letter to the STRB on 27 October. It covers two matters, requiring a report by 28 February 2011 on the pay uplift for those earning £21,000 or less; and a report by 30 March on whether there should be a cap on head teachers' pay in line with the Prime Minister's salary. The remit letter also flagged the Secretary of State's intention to return to the STRB early next year to look at the introduction of greater freedoms and flexibilities to the teachers' pay system, as part of the coalition Government's commitment to give schools greater freedoms to pay good teachers more.</p>

The measures of poverty currently used by the Government are largely income-based. It is not possible to provide a robust estimate of the impact of changes in public service spending on individuals' incomes, including those of disabled people. It is therefore not possible to measure accurately the impact of departmental spending on relative income poverty. Some of the methodological issues are discussed in Annex B of the Spending Review 2010 document.</p>

In return, people can reasonably be expected to look for and prepare for work. Improving the incentives to take up mini-jobs will particularly help those who are not able to take up full-time employment and otherwise would remain fully dependent on welfare. Promoting a culture of employment will not only help those individuals but will also tackle the intergenerational cycles of worklessness and welfare dependency. We will require every claimant to sign a claimant commitment as a condition of entitlement, setting out clearly the work-related expectations and requirements placed upon them and the consequences for failing to meet these agreed standards. Financial support will remain unconditional for people who we do not expect to be able to work or prepare for work.</p>
