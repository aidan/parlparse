The Czech Government&#146;s recent loss of a majority and the president&#146;s bizarre attitude to climate change reform and certain other related matters has caused anxiety in the UK and in the EU. Can the Minister confirm that the Swedes, with their enthusiasm for climate change reform, will nevertheless take things further on an accelerated basis and that their Government&#146;s international policy priority is to ensure the chance of a united EU position for the eventual agreement in Copenhagen?</p>

The Czech president is of course entitled to his own view on climate change and there is no evidence that it has undermined the Czech leadership of the presidency as a whole. The noble Lord is right that there has been a vote of no confidence in the current Czech Government, who are continuing as a Government in resignation.

Intensive discussion at the spring council meetings addressed in some detail the issues that the noble Lord has raised. On Copenhagen, it is essential to agree not only ambitious developed country targets but, as the noble Lord suggests, finance and technology flows to support developing country action on reducing carbon emissions.</p>

Last Thursday, the Government announced in a Statement that we would take forward proposals for up to four demonstration at-scale projects for carbon capture and storage, which are essential because 40 per cent of global energy requirements are met through coal. We will not achieve the required GHG reductions unless we can develop carbon capture and storage effectively. This Government&#146;s action in leading globally in this area will be critical. This Government have also played a very large part in securing agreement within the EU on providing some funding for up to 12 projects within the EU. This country&#146;s position was pivotal to that agreement.</p>

The work leading up to Copenhagen is towards agreeing very challenging and tough targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in order to prevent a disastrous increase in global temperatures. However, it is not possible to prevent some increase, which is why the globe will have to adapt to some climate change. I very much agree with the noble Lord on the need for international action. However, it is also essential that this country takes appropriate adaptation action.</p>

If the word bizarre was used by a Member of your Lordships' House, I think it was directed not at the Czech president&#146;s views on the EU and its future but at his somewhat sceptical view of climate change.</p>

My understanding is that the sun&#146;s 11-year cycle of activity is currently at a minimum. Although its brightness is lower than during other recent minima, scientists expect its activity to increase again in the coming months. I understand that contrary to what has been reported, the influence of the sun&#146;s natural variability on the climate is small compared with the impact of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>

We seem to have stopped dithering here over nuclear and the Government have at last changed their mind and are getting on with things.

I have set out the Government&#146;s policy as clearly as I can. This country recognises, and has done for many years, a marriage that has taken place abroad as being valid in England and Wales provided that it has been created in accordance with English private international law. To be recognised as valid, it must have been contracted between parties of full capacity and the marriage ceremony must have accorded with the formal requirements of the law of celebration in the country where it took place. If these conditions are satisfied, the marriage in question is normally recognised as being compliant with English private international law. This includes polygamous marriages but is not government approval of such marriages.</p>

There is protection for the innocent parties of such a ceremony. For the wife, these include various abilities to get injunctions for domestic violence, approvals under the trusts of land Act and rights on the death of the purported husband. There are also rights for any children of such a union under the Child Support Agency rules and there are lump sums for children. There are some protections for those who are the innocent victims of such a ceremony.</p>

That is my understanding of what the Minister said. Does he agree that it is also part of UK public policy to mitigate the serious disadvantages suffered by women in polygamous marriages in this country and that one way in which to do that would be to grant legal protection to unmarried cohabitant couples so as to provide a safety net for multiple wives whose polygamous marriages are unrecognised, as the noble Baroness, Lady Afshar, suggested in a recent debate?

That is exactly what I said, I hope, in answering the Question. But whether the Cohabitation Bill that the noble Lord has introduced to this House is the answer is much more questionable. We think that it is unnecessary and takes the wrong approach towards addressing the mistaken perception that cohabitation confers a quasi-marital legal status. We believe that sufficient provision for financial and property protection is already available to adult couples who live together. However, although we do not support his Bill&#151;the noble Lord knows that already&#151;we want to consider the Scottish experience and extrapolate from it the likely balance between cost and benefit that the Bill involves.</p>

We do not want a divided society and it is very important that a message should be sent to people who live here that they have to comply with the moral and ethical situation and not only the law.</p>

They add a huge amount to what this country represents in the world. Of course, in this particular field it is essential that anyone who comes here behaves in accordance with English law. Again, I think that that is widely understood.</p>

One thing that we think might improve the situation&#151;and this has been supported by a respectable organisation that calls itself the Muslim Parliament&#151;relates to the fact that, of the 809 mosques in this country, only 159 are registered to carry out proper marriages. In other words, there is either a registrar present when the religious ceremony takes place or an authorised person already exists in the mosque to ensure that the civic element of any marriage that there must be under English law is provided. We would encourage more mosques to come forward and be registered for carrying out marriages.</p>

With this scheme we are trying to help those people who have suffered an income shock and who need short term breathing space to get their finances back on track. There are few greater anxieties than the threat of losing one's home and all that goes with it such as the loss of a job, family break-up and the rest. The people who will be helped by the scheme will be households that previously relied on two incomes where one person has lost a job or a single person who has had overtime hours cut. I stress that it is not a payment holiday: a proportion of the interest payments will be deferred, but they will have to be paid back later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="09042836000049"></a>The group of lenders who are taking part in the government guarantee scheme cover 50 per cent of the mortgage market. Four other high street lenders&#151;Barclays, HSBC, Nationwide and Santander&#151;have also confirmed that they will offer comparable arrangements to HMS to their customers, but they do not feel that they need the government guarantee. That will account for 80 per cent of the mortgage market.</p>

How do the Government intend to review the scheme to see how well it is working? Will the Minister particularly say whether the Government will look at borrowers from the 20 per cent who are not taking part in the scheme? Have they monitored the other schemes, as they have brought in one after the other?</p>

For example, the mortgage rescue scheme, about which the noble Baroness knows, is for the most vulnerable. It will help 6,000 potentially very vulnerable people move to shared equity or into the rented sector. Essentially, that will be monitored by looking at the lenders&#146; use of forbearance, which is considered through the home finance forum chaired by my noble friend Lord Myners. That is also working to improve the availability of data.</p>

We want to make it is generous and effective as possible for people who may be in difficulty.</p>

Will the Minister consider whether it is necessary to give the courts more power to impose a stay of execution for possession orders where there is a good chance of people repaying their mortgages? In those cases where the lenders take very little notice of the excellent scheme now on offer, remembering that in every case they can use their discretion, would those extra powers not give us a better guarantee that repossessions will in fact be reduced as a result of this measure?</p>

Let me say something about the notion that this is a damp squib. I think one of the ways in which we could certainly accelerate and improve take-up is to make sure, as we are doing, that people who are in need have access to advice. The whole foundation of this scheme is that people in need should go to their lenders and should also take independent financial advice. That would help enormously. Certainly, as the noble Lord will know, we have boosted the court desks; we have made more advice available. The idea that we should look to extend the stay of execution is something that I shall take back to the department.</p>

<a name="09042836000059"></a><b><a name="90428-0002.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="09042836000498"></a>Lord Elystan-Morgan:</b> My Lords, following the question of the noble Lord, Lord Best, is it not the case that extensive powers are already vested in judges under Section 36 of the Administration of Justice Act 1970? These powers allow the judge to postpone an application or, indeed, suspend a possession warrant, where there is a possibility that a family will be able to pay and repay all debts within the total period of the mortgage. That is very important, for however parlous the situation might be now, if the mortgage has 20 years to run, it may very well be that that can be achieved within the terms of that provision.</p>

<a name="09042836000060"></a><b><a name="90428-0002.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="09042836000499"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> My Lords, I am very grateful for the noble Lord&#146;s advice. He has enormous experience in this area. Clearly, repossession is not inevitable, even after a claim has been issued. Provided the borrower is able to pay their arrears in a reasonable period of time, or place the property on the market to effect a sale, and the lender does not have satisfactory reasons for not agreeing, the court does have the power to adjourn the proceedings. So there clearly are different ways of easing this situation.</p>

Is it not the case that, not only are the criteria for qualifying for the scheme too restricted, but even if a home owner can qualify, more than half the mortgage lenders have refused to have anything to do with the scheme?</p>

We have estimated&#151;these figures are based on our discussions with lenders, which have been very close partners in designing this scheme and the criteria we have set for eligibility&#151; that up to 42,000 households could enter onto HMS in the next two years. If we were to be able to get 100 per cent of the mortgage market&#151;if that was covered&#151;then we would be looking at 85,000 people. As I have already explained, we have enough lenders to account for 80 per cent of the mortgage market. Of course, we have done a great deal, not just through this initiative but through the whole range of initiatives, in providing advice and supporting people in different degrees of difficulty, both before and after the Budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09042836000067"></a>That is the function of the statement of accountability, which also provides a very useful summary of the current structure of the NHS and what the bodies within it are tasked with doing. Just as there are cross-references between the 12-page constitution and the handbook, and just as it is not possible to understand one document without the other, there are also cross-references between the constitution and the statement of accountability. How might the statement be useful to a patient? If you were someone who was unhappy about some aspect of NHS services and were seeking to understand how best to impress upon the service that it needed to focus more attention on a particular matter, the statement of accountability would enable you to navigate your way around the NHS and its institutions. It is more than arguable that you would not be able to do that properly by reading only the handbook.</p>

<a name="90428-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="09042836000068"></a>Why is it then that the <I>Statement of NHS </I><I>Accountability</I> receives no mention in the Bill? If it is to be regarded as part of the <I>NHS Constitution</I>, as the department&#146;s website strongly implies that it is, we should be able to see mention made of it here, on a par with the handbook. Indeed, what is the difference between the status of the handbook and that of the statement of accountability? I beg to move.</p>

<a name="09042836000069"></a><b><a name="90428-0002.htm_spnew23"></a><a name="09042836000505"></a>Lord Walton of Detchant:</b> My Lords, the British Medical Association has said that it has been a vocal supporter of the concept of an NHS constitution. It is the BMA&#146;s belief that a clearly articulated set of values that reflect a shared consensus concerning the nature and purpose of the NHS will strengthen the public&#146;s trust in it. The BMA considers that a constitution, properly constructed, offers the means to maintain the public&#146;s confidence in the NHS and to safeguard its future.</p>

<a name="90428-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09042836000070"></a>However, the BMA has concerns with regard to the constitution&#146;s commitment to developing a responsive and accountable health service. Past experience and some evidence suggests that there exist significant failings in enabling patients, public and staff to engage in and influence meaningfully NHS decision-making processes. Recent examples of service redesign, involving poor levels of transparency and a lack of effective consultation reinforce this view.</p>

<a name="90428-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09042836000071"></a>The BMA continues to be a strong advocate of patient and public involvement as an integral and collaborative process that is essential to grow productive partnerships between patients, the public, health professionals and policy makers. Consequently, the BMA does not believe that the NHS contribution goes far enough in determining a framework that will better enable and safeguard local accountability for widening and strengthening the relationship between the health services at a local level and the populations they serve. I support this amendment.</p>

<a name="90428-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09042836000073"></a>I agree with the sentiment behind these amendments. The system of responsibility in the NHS should always be made clear and accessible to the public, the patients and the staff. As I explained in Grand Committee, it is critical that the public know how the NHS is accountable at a local level and how they can get involved.</p>

<a name="90428-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09042836000074"></a>During the formal consultation on the draft constitution, patients, the public and NHS staff told us that it would be helpful to produce a document that explains accountability and the roles and responsibilities in the NHS. The <I>S</I><I>tatement of NHS </I><I>A</I><I>ccountability</I>, which was published alongside the constitution on 21 January, was a response to what we heard. It is a public-facing document that explains the roles, responsibilities and accountability in the NHS.</p>

<a name="90428-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09042836000075"></a>However, I do not believe it is necessary to place in the Bill the requirement to review and update the statement of accountability. This is because the Government have already committed to doing this through the <I>NHS Constitution</I>.</p>

<a name="90428-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09042836000076"></a>Principle 7 in the constitution explains that,</p>
<ul><a name="09042836000172"></a>&#147;the NHS is accountable to the public, communities and patients that it serves&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09042836000153"></a>It says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="09042836000165"></a>&#147;The system of responsibility and accountability for taking decisions in the NHS should be transparent and clear to the public, patients and staff&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09042836000154"></a>It goes on to commit that,</p>
<ul><a name="09042836000173"></a>&#147;the Government will ensure that there is always a clear and up-to-date statement of NHS accountability for this purpose&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90428-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09042836000077"></a>Therefore, we have already committed to ensuring that the statement of accountability is always clear and up to date. Imposing a timeline on how often the statement must be updated risks being too prescriptive&#151;at least once every three years may be too long to wait, or, conversely, the roles, responsibilities and accountability in the NHS may not change in one three-year period. By keeping the time flexible, we will ensure that it is constantly up to date and continues to be useful to the public, the patients and the staff.</p>

<a name="90428-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09042836000078"></a>I turn to the point that the noble Earl raised in relation to the interactive form of the <I>S</I><I>tatement of NHS </I><I>A</I><I>ccountability</I> and the supporting document. I will certainly look at the interactive version that the noble Earl referred to, but I think that the intention was to say that the interactive guide, and not the constitution, contains a statement of accountability.</p>

<a name="90428-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09042836000079"></a>I hope that I have demonstrated that there is no need for extra legislation on the face of the Bill. The Government have already committed to publishing a clear statement on NHS accountability that is always up to date.</p>

<a name="90428-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09042836000080"></a>I turn to the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Walton, in relation to the transparency of it. I made it quite clear, through the process of the NHS next-stage review in May last year, that any service redesign or reconfiguration has to be evidence-based, clinically led and needs to involve the local population and the public through the whole period of the consultation. Change has to be locally owned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09042836000081"></a>I hope that the service redesign concept that the noble Lord referred to is already covered within the statement of accountability. I hope, therefore, that the noble Earl is able to withdraw his amendments.</p>

It seems to be extremely important, and indeed the constitution reflects the importance of accountability.

That is why we published it alongside the constitution on 21 January this year.

Reading the Department of Health website, I think that you would certainly be forgiven for thinking that the <I>NHS Constitution</I> was, in essence, a three-legged stool, consisting of the 12-page document, the handbook and the statement of accountability. I, for one, was very comfortable with that. Notwithstanding that, the Minister implied that the statement of accountability is not in fact part of the constitution. The question that that raises is: do NHS staff or the boards of NHS trusts have to have regard to the statement of accountability? It would appear that they do not, and I wonder what kind of message that sends out to them.</p>

<p><a name="st_70"></a>
<a name="09042836000085"></a><b><a name="90428-0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09042836000510"></a>Lord Darzi of Denham:</b> My Lords, I am sorry to intervene but perhaps I may again read what principle 7 in the constitution says:</p>

It is only when you read it that you understand what the accountability structure in the health service consists of. The Minister suggested that, because that statement was in the constitution under principle 7, it was not necessary to include it in the Bill. I am a little puzzled by that because the constitution refers to the handbook. It says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="09042836000167"></a>&#147;It&#148;&#151;</p>

<ul><a name="09042836000174"></a>&#147;will be accompanied by the Handbook to the NHS Constitution, to be renewed at least every three years, setting out current guidance on the rights, pledges, duties and responsibilities established by the Constitution&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09042836000157"></a>One could equally well argue that perhaps the wording of the handbook should not appear in the Bill because the pledge is already set out in the constitution. Therefore, we are on difficult ground here. I remain puzzled but this is not an issue that I intend to press. If the Minister can enlighten me further after these proceedings, naturally I shall be grateful. However, for now, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_116"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 116</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>so, to what extent. I do not need to remind noble Lords that we have a very curious situation at the moment. The <I>NHS Constitution</I> was signed off by the Prime Minister in person early in the new year amid publicity and expressions of mutual congratulation of a kind that one associates with an event of some importance. Important as the event was seen to be, the publication and adoption of the <I>NHS Constitution</I> have nevertheless been entirely divorced from any parliamentary process. I am one of those individuals who think that that is just wrong. The constitution is a document that is intended to underpin the values and the modus operandi of the entire NHS for the next 10 years, at least, and as such it has been promoted by the Government as a text of fundamental significance for both staff and patients. It is not just that Parliament has been given no say at all on the content of the constitution, which I find regrettable, it is also that without the stamp of parliamentary approval on what the document actually says, the substance of it completely lacks any sort of legal standing.</p>
<a name="time_8"></a>
<a name="90428-0003.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="09042836000186"></a>3.30 pm</h5>

<a name="90428-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09042836000088"></a>In Grand Committee the Minister cited two main reasons for not incorporating the constitution or any part of it in the Bill. He said that he did not want to set anything in stone and, equally, he did not want to create a lawyers&#146; charter. I understand both those objections and, indeed, a number of noble Lords whose voices I always listen to weighed in on the Minister&#146;s side. I have therefore given renewed thought to the problem. By this amendment I suggest that there could be another way of achieving the objectives I have talked about; that is, by giving the Secretary of State a power to make regulations in which the core principles underpinning the constitution could be set out. That statutory instrument would be the direct link between Parliament and the constitution and would quite literally legitimise the content of the document. It would be up to the Government to specify what the principles would be, but if they happened to be closely related to the principles set out in the constitution itself, I am sure that we would all be satisfied with that.</p>

<a name="90428-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09042836000089"></a>That, I think, deals with the Minister&#146;s first objection, because, with a statutory instrument, nothing would be set in stone. If the Government wished in some way to amend the principles at the 10-year review point, they could do so without bringing forward primary legislation. The Minister may well say that I have not dealt with his second objection; namely, that by giving any element of the constitution the force of law, we run the risk of creating a lawyers&#146; charter. I suggest to him that this is not a worry that he needs to entertain, provided that, in the statutory instrument, we restrict ourselves to principles as opposed to rights.</p>

<a name="90428-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09042836000090"></a>The difference between rights and principles in this context is an important one. There can perhaps be no better example in law of the significance of that distinction than the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, published a paper in February 2001 in which he very helpfully drew a distinction between individually justiciable classic rights, by which he meant the civil and political rights guaranteed under the European convention, and what  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_117"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 117</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>he termed the social and economic rights covered by the charter, which are not really rights at all, but rather general principles which both the Union and European member states may not infringe when framing new legislation of any kind. The principles do not themselves give rise to rights, nor do they oblige member states to legislate in a particular way. They act as a means to ensure that any new legislation cannot be enacted in terms which violate the principles.</p>

<a name="90428-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09042836000091"></a>I emphasise the opinion of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, that no new rights are imposed on member states or their citizens by reason of the principles being included in the European charter. We perhaps need to remind ourselves that the UK is signed up to the charter. The parallel with the issue we are now debating is, I think, a direct one and extremely illuminating. These are the reasons why I believe this amendment, or one like it, poses no dangers at all, but rather gives us the best of all worlds&#151;flexibility for the Government and a means by which the citizens of this country can be assured of Parliament&#146;s approval of what the <I>NHS </I><I>C</I><I>onstitution</I> contains. I believe that that assurance is of fundamental importance and therefore I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_74"></a>
<a name="09042836000092"></a><b><a name="90428-0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09042836000514"></a>Lord Darzi of Denham:</b> My Lords, Amendment 2 would mean that the Secretary of State would need to make regulations to address changes to the principles set out in the NHS constitution. I understand that the noble Earl wishes to give a greater role to Parliament in determining the principles of the NHS. However, as I said in Committee, as acknowledged by the noble Earl, I do not believe that this amendment is necessary and will say why it carries a risk. The principles of the constitution were not dreamt up by the Government. They articulate the foundation on which the NHS has been built over many decades, and many of them have roots in primary legislation. Importantly, they were the result of full public consultation. Any changes to them would also require full consultation.</p>

<a name="90428-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09042836000093"></a>If the noble Earl&#146;s intention is to ensure that the Government of the day cannot tinker with the principles of the NHS behind closed doors, I can assure him that they could not. The Government would not be able to alter the founding principles of the NHS just by changing the wording of the principles in the NHS constitution, even if they did so following full consultation. That is because Parliament creates the underpinning legislative framework from which many of these principles are derived. For example, the second principle about access to services being based on clinical need, not ability to pay, is derived from Section 1(3) of the National Health Service Act 2006. If the Government of the day wished to change that principle&#151;I can assure noble Lords that this Government would not&#151;they would need to amend primary legislation with the consent of Parliament. Revising the NHS constitution would not be sufficient. Similarly, Section 72 of the NHS Act 2006 would have to be amended in order to change the constitution&#146;s fifth principle that the NHS works across organisational boundaries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09042836000094"></a>As the noble Earl mentioned, I was concerned in Committee that we should not make a lawyer&#146;s charter out of the constitution. Placing part of the constitution in legislation, whether secondary or primary&#151;the principal

I am sure that we all agree that we would not wish to see decision-making in the NHS become the preserve of the courts.</p>

<a name="90428-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09042836000095"></a>If the principles of the constitution were to be addressed in regulations, it would also create potential ambiguity with the rights, pledges and values set out in the constitution. I am very grateful to the noble Earl for addressing the issues about the rights and the examples in relation to the European charter. Those sorts of ambiguities have the potential to create litigation, which I am sure we would want to avoid.</p>

<a name="90428-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="09042836000096"></a>It would be unusual and cumbersome to single out one part of the constitution to be treated differently from the rest when reviewing it. The constitution is a coherent whole and we have proposed a system for reviewing it involving full consultation. I think this is the right process for updating the constitution. Given my reassurances and the long debate we had in Committee, I still do not believe that we should separate the principles. I hope that I have reassured the noble Earl that any changes to the principles, which are historically underpinned by legislation, will obviously be debated in Parliament. I hope that the noble Earl will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

He gave only a brief nod to the problem which I had been trying to identify in my remarks, which is, as I see it, that the model which the Government have chosen to adopt is that the content of the constitution&#151;the principles, the values, the rights and the responsibilities&#151;is totally detached from Parliament. I believe that that is simply wrong in principle. I realise that Ministers are well intentioned and extremely unlikely to change the principles set out in the constitution. However, for the reasons I outlined, the amendment offers a way of finessing the objections raised to the more explicit amendment which I tabled in Grand Committee. In my view, it bridges the gap which the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, referred to on that occasion.</p>

<a name="09042836000100"></a><b><a name="90428-0003.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09042836000516"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b> My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces. The Statement is as follows.</p>

<a name="90428-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09042836000101"></a>&#147;With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a Statement about the report on the strategic review of reserves, which I am publishing today. A copy has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<a name="90428-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09042836000102"></a>I know that the House will join me in paying tribute to Britain&#146;s reserves. They make an important contribution to current operations, serving with dedication and commitment alongside our Regular Forces. As I speak, over 2,000 reservists are on operations in Afghanistan and Iraq on tasks ranging from fighting on the front line to force protection and medical support. This is   


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_121"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 121</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>8 per cent of our forces deployed. Reservists have served with distinction in all the conflicts that our forces have faced in recent times, from the Balkans to Sierra Leone. Eighteen thousand have deployed to operational theatres since 2003. Since then, 15 have made the ultimate sacrifice by giving their lives on our behalf. When I visit operational theatres, I never fail to be impressed by the men and women of our Reserve Forces who give up their time to serve their country.</p>

<a name="90428-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09042836000103"></a>But it is not only the Armed Forces that benefit from our reserves; society does, too. Individual reservists learn and develop leadership, problem-solving and confidence-building skills that make them more capable employees and citizens. And they make a crucial contribution in the United Kingdom, helping out in emergencies from foot and mouth to flooding and providing cover during the firemen&#146;s strike.</p>

<a name="90428-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09042836000104"></a>The demands faced by our reservists have changed considerably. We are using them much more than we have before in peacetime. We need them to do more than simply prepare to defend the UK in the event of major conflict. We require them to augment our Regular Forces on expeditionary operations. Yet the structures, training and organisation of our Reserve Forces have not changed to match this and now need to be overhauled. We owe it to our reservists, their employers and their families to ensure that they are supported to face the challenges of today and the future, not the past.</p>

<a name="90428-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09042836000105"></a>People wrongly say that this is about tackling stretch by using the reserve to plug gaps in the Regular Forces. This is not the case. It is, in fact, about optimising the contribution of all elements of defence today and into the future. The reserves are an integral part of that and they are overwhelmingly keen to play a relevant role in current operations. That is why, last year, my right honourable friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun commissioned a strategic review of the reserves. As a result, the reserves have, for the first time in recent years, been subject to a review in their own right.</p>

<a name="90428-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09042836000106"></a>The review was conducted by a small team, led by Major-General Nicholas Cottam. It consulted openly throughout defence and beyond. It listened carefully to the views of the reserves community, including the Reserve Forces and cadets associations. General Cottam&#146;s comprehensive review addressed all strategic aspects of reserve service. I am placing copies of it in the Library of the House today and on the MoD website. As one would expect from such careful analysis conducted over several months, it is very detailed. We have therefore produced a summary of the review, which will also be placed in the Library today. General Cottam confirms that this summary report accurately reflects his review. It also indicates how we shall take forward this important work.</p>

<a name="90428-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09042836000107"></a>General Cottam&#146;s work offered seven strategic recommendations; I am pleased to announce that we are accepting all of them. They flow into more than 80 detailed recommendations. General Cottam was not asked to produce an implementation plan; his review was properly designed as strategic. Consequently, some of his detailed recommendations will require considerable further scoping work, taking account of resources and priorities across defence. This will make for difficult choices, but the review provides the solid  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_122"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 122</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>foundation on which they can be made. I am, however, pleased to announce that around half of the recommendations will be implemented immediately.</p>

<a name="90428-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="09042836000108"></a>The review has redefined the purpose of the UK reserves and notes that they provide defence with a cost-effective way of retaining certain specialised skills. It is precisely those niche capabilities and depth of personnel that are proving so invaluable to current operations. The review also acknowledges that reservists remain vital for supporting national resilience and recognises the very important role that they play in connecting the Armed Forces with the nation.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90428-0004.htm"/>


<a name="90428-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09042836000109"></a>A key tenet of the review has been bringing greater clarity to reservists about what we expect of them and what they can expect in return. That has been captured in the new proposition that sets out for the first time what reserve service offers. Specifically, it states that we must ensure that,</p>
<ul><a name="09042836000175"></a>&#145;we continue to offer the challenge and reward which attracts people to volunteer, while giving a firm undertaking to provide them with effective training and the best possible support throughout their service, including when mobilised and recuperating&#146;.</ul>
<p><a name="09042836000158"></a>Part of this challenge is the opportunity to lead and command, which is why General Cottam&#146;s detailed recommendations include proposals for officer recruitment and education.</p>

<a name="90428-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09042836000110"></a>If we deliver on that proposition&#151;and I am determined that we will&#151;the outcome should be a better trained and organised reserve, better able to deliver its tasks. I should like to give the House a few examples of what we are doing now to help to achieve this outcome. We shall develop better and more flexible terms and conditions of service, which will allow a range of different forms of reserve service&#151;as well as easier movement between regular and reserve service&#151;by removing complexity and administrative barriers. Reservist training will be refocused with a greater emphasis on preparation to support current operations. Initial training will be restructured so that new recruits receive sufficient military skills to participate in their units&#146; collective training within six months of joining and are fully trained and eligible for mobilisation within three years. Routine training will also be reviewed and sufficient man training days allocated to ensure annual military competency standards can be achieved by all.</p>

<a name="90428-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09042836000111"></a>The Territorial Army will be better integrated with the Regular Army to ensure that, combined, they are best structured to support current and future operations. This will include stopping reservist tasks that are no longer needed, thereby bringing efficiencies and enabling manpower to be used for higher priorities. Some tasks of this nature have been identified during separate work as part of the department&#146;s annual planning round.</p>

<a name="90428-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09042836000112"></a>As mentioned in the review, certain elements of 2 (National Communications) Signal Brigade have been identified as no longer having a clear operational role. This is partly because they hold capabilities that are no longer current and partly because their tasks can be achieved elsewhere in defence, not least because of improvements in wider national resilience. In addition, some TA signals units operate communications equipment that is now obsolete. These posts will be removed; they include Headquarters 12 Signals Group and 33, 34 and 35 Signals Regiments. It is logical to reallocate these resources to higher defence priorities.</p>




<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_123"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 123</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90428-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09042836000113"></a>This decision has not been taken lightly. We are very aware of the exceptional contribution made by the Royal Signals within the TA, but we must focus resources where we need them most. Where possible, those affected by this decision will be offered other opportunities within the TA, and we will conduct further work to decide the most effective configuration for the TA Royal Signals. As I have said, these decisions were taken separately from the reserves review, but they are entirely consistent with it.</p>

<a name="90428-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09042836000114"></a>We shall also rationalise and improve the way in which we approach the civil contingency reaction force and the part that it plays in wider national resilience tasks. This will make it more effective and less burdensome to the units involved. We shall also work closely with the Department for International Development to determine how best to employ niche reservist skills in support of stabilisation operations.</p>

<a name="90428-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09042836000115"></a>We need to rationalise the reserve estate. Some of it is underused, out of date and in poor repair. Some of it is simply unacceptable for modern military use. In some places, several sites sit near one another; elsewhere, the reserve footprint is absent. I am therefore setting in train work to deliver a modern, better managed and fit-for-purpose volunteer estate. This important work will take time and I am determined that it should be done properly.</p>

<a name="90428-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09042836000116"></a>Employers play a vital role in delivering and supporting our reserves. They bear the gap while an employee is training and play an even greater role when reservists are away from the workplace on deployed operations. We are very fortunate that so many of our employers are so accommodating of the demands that go with the reservist commitment. They recognise the additional skills and qualities that individual reservists can bring to any organisation. But we want to work better with employers. We shall continue to provide assistance and support to them through our employer support organisation, Supporting Britain&#146;s Reservists and Employers, commonly known as SaBRE. In addition, we shall give greater direction to the Reserve Forces and cadets associations to ensure that their excellent work in support of the reserves is more coherent and co-ordinated.</p>

<a name="90428-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09042836000117"></a>The review that we are publishing today is important for our Armed Forces and for Britain&#146;s reserves. It makes it clear that the two are not separate but that reserves provide an integral part of our military force structure. It provides a firm basis from which we can work further to develop and improve our Reserve Forces and how we support them. I believe that this is an exciting opportunity for our reservists. The review<I></I>outcome is a comprehensive piece of work, which has been welcomed by the single service chiefs. It is a blueprint to ensure that our Reserve Forces have a clear and bright future to match their illustrious past. I commend it to the House&#148;.</p>

I join the Government in paying tribute to Britain&#146;s reserves, who make an important contribution to current operations, as well  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_124"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 124</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>as helping out in emergencies. Maintaining strong reserves is vital to our country&#146;s safety both at home and abroad. I also join the Government in thanking the employers who play such an important role in delivering and supporting our reserves. I declare an interest as an honorary colonel of a TA Royal Engineers regiment.</p>

<a name="90428-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09042836000119"></a>As the Statement says, the review flows into more than 80 detailed recommendations. There is a lot to digest and, frankly, we have had little time to consider it all. Through the usual channels, I will ask the Government for a debate in government time on the reserves review. This is an important issue. There is great concern in the reserves as to where it will all go. On this side of the House, we have been bombarded with approaches from all ranks.</p>

<a name="90428-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09042836000120"></a>We welcome the restructuring of initial training. I imagine that this also applies to officers&#146; training. It is particularly relevant for officers where recruiting has suffered because of the cumbersome process of interviews, pre-AOSB, training, AOSB and then Sandhurst. There is no doubt that that is putting off some potential officers from joining.</p>

<a name="90428-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09042836000121"></a>We also welcome the fact that the TA will be better integrated with the Regular Army. I was in Afghanistan in February and spoke to a lot of reserves out there, including representatives of my own regiment. On the whole, they already feel pretty well embedded in the Army. The regulars of all ranks to whom I spoke were very complimentary about the work that the reserves were doing and felt that they were fully embedded. I was enormously impressed by their courage and professionalism.</p>

<a name="90428-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09042836000122"></a>General Cottam was not asked to produce an implementation plan. Half his recommendations will be implemented immediately, but who will take forward the other half? How long will the scoping work take? When will an implementation plan for these recommendations be produced and within what timescale will they be implemented? How will progress be reported to Parliament?</p>

<a name="90428-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09042836000123"></a>Can the Minister expand on the proposal in the Statement to,</p>
<ul><a name="09042836000176"></a>&#147;have more flexible terms and conditions of service, which will allow a range of different forms of reserve service&#148;?</ul>
<a name="90428-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09042836000124"></a>What is meant by a &#147;range of different forms&#148;? We accept that reserves are needed to augment expeditionary operations, but little information or thought appears to have been given to their role in homeland security and resilience. This is important when, as we saw in Mumbai, the terrorist threat is evolving.</p>

<a name="90428-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09042836000125"></a>The Government must also justify the cuts to 2 (National Communications) Signal Brigade. The Statement says that its tasks can be achieved elsewhere in defence and that some are not needed because of improvements in wider national resilience. It is imperative that the Minister should provide evidence to support this assertion. The brigade is tasked with the provision of emergency and post-disaster recovery communications infrastructure for government, the Armed Forces and the emergency services, by deploying and operating a variety of communications systems. It is on 12 hours&#146; notice to deploy. This is an important role.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09042836000126"></a>How will the CCRFs be rationalised? Has this been done in consultation with first responders? I understand that first responders&#151;the police, the fire service and the ambulance service&#151;want predictable support from the military and clear lines of authority, command and co-ordination.</p>

<a name="90428-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09042836000127"></a>The main focus of the Statement is on the TA; little if anything was mentioned about the Royal Naval Reserve, the Royal Marines Reserve or the Royal Auxiliary Air Force. How will this report impact on these forces? It also surprised me that there was no specific mention of the welfare issues impacting our reservists and their families. What measures in the recommendations will improve the welfare of our Reserve Forces and their families?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09042836000128"></a>Finally, in 1997, the establishment figure for the TA was 59,000; today it is 38,500, even though the current strength is 28,920. What will the establishment figure be in light of today&#146;s Statement, given that the TA has been funded to only 83 per cent capacity?</p>

However, unfortunately, I was able to obtain a copy of both those documents only at 3.15 this afternoon, despite having tried for the last three or four hours to get copies, including by phoning the MoD direct. It is impossible to ask sensible questions if one is given such a short space of time in which to examine the documents. I shall write to the Secretary of State for Defence to ask him what procedures his department operates in providing opposition spokespersons with this type of document in these circumstances. I do not hold the noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, personally responsible for this; he represents the department but, of course, is not a Minister in it.</p>

<a name="90428-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09042836000130"></a>We welcome the review and congratulate the review team. As the noble Lord, Lord Astor, said, the reserves play a vital and cost-effective role when our Regular Forces are overstretched. They are also there for civil emergencies and terrorism and for pandemics and similar. However, the Statement is long on words but short on specifics. There is no mention of costs at all; for example, I should like to know how much it will cost to rationalise the reserve estate, which is said to be,</p>
<ul><a name="09042836000177"></a>&#147;underused, out of date and in poor repair&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09042836000159"></a>Is the Treasury going to fund the costs for all those works? Specifically, how long has the TA Royal Signals been using communications equipment that is obsolete, as the Statement says?</p>

<a name="90428-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09042836000131"></a>There is no mention in the Statement of future numbers, as the noble Lord, Lord Astor, said. That is absolutely crucial. The <I>Evening Standard</I> today, which was presumably briefed in some shape or form a little earlier than we were, has a headline that says, &#147;TA fighting strength will fall to 25000 after Treasury cuts&#148;. Would the Minister like to respond to that headline? The noble Lord, Lord Astor, also said that present manning levels were 10,000 below establishment strength. What will the Government do in that regard?</p>

I am very sorry that he did not receive his copy appropriately and, while I thank him very much for noting that I am not the Minister, I shall take personal responsibility to ensure that we review those procedures and ensure that principal spokesmen have a clear expectation. Of course, I am embarrassed to find myself in the situation in which the noble Lord is not properly briefed.</p>

<a name="90428-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="09042836000134"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Astor, asked an awful lot of questions, and, not surprisingly, I shall not be able to answer them all, but I shall do my best. First, I thank him very much for his general support for the reserves and the issue of training. I do not have to hand specific figures relating to officer training; I will write to him on that issue. He asked, very reasonably, about who will take this forward. The MoD will set up a small team to take it forward. I do not have the name of the head of the team. The plan is to take it forward in three phases. The initial phase will introduce about half the recommendations straightaway. The other operational and organisational recommendations will be considered in the normal planning process as part of the total development of defence. That will take us about two to three years, through to April 2012. The estate will take a number of years, and we will set up a team to rationalise that.</p>

<a name="90428-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09042836000135"></a>On the issue of how it will progress, I would expect it to progress and to be reported in the normal way. We will make statements about plans, and the essence is that we will be talking about the reserves in the context of the forces as a whole, rather than specifically referring to the reserves per se. That is the theme that runs through this Statement: we are looking for more flexibility.</p>

<a name="90428-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09042836000136"></a>When it comes to resilience, the civil contingencies reaction force, which was developed in 2002, has not been used. The review recommends that the current structure should be abandoned, maintaining only the command and control framework, with all reservists declared available for UK operations and resilience tasks. This finding has been adopted by the Army as part of the ongoing review. It is important to note that the contingencies that have happened have actually been addressed by Regular Forces, supported by reserves. We think that this is a much better way for reserves to be used in future.</p>

<a name="90428-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09042836000137"></a>On the issue of signalling tasks, I will touch on one or two points made by the noble Lord, Lord Lee. There are two areas where we are rationalising in the light of budgetary and planning preparation, but consistently with the use of reserves. The first is the Ptarmigan trunk communications system which supports the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps headquarters communications, command and control suite operated by members of TA signals. This is now obsolete. I do not have data on how long it has been obsolete, but support is now provided by the newer Falcon system,

Therefore, as part of the department&#146;s normal annual planning round process, it has been decided to delete, as I said, Headquarters 12 Signals Group and 33, 34 and 35 Signals Regiments.</p>

<a name="90428-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09042836000138"></a>The Cabinet Office work on resilience has called for a more up-to-date and technologically advanced national resilience network, and it is important that 2 (National Communications) Signal Brigade will be removed&#151;it will be a regular-only operation from now on, because it is able to operate with more up-to-date, efficient and capital-intensive procedures that are less manpower-intensive. There will be no reduction in signals capability provided by the Royal Signals to support either the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps or national resilience communication.</p>

<a name="90428-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09042836000139"></a>In areas other than the TA, recruitment is taking place in all four reserves&#151;the Royal Marines, the Navy, the Royal Auxiliary Air Force and the Army. Over time, those numbers will become part of our planning round and concerns, but the MoD is looking to see them rise if possible.</p>

<a name="90428-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09042836000140"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lee, gave us some of the numbers involved. As we know, the numbers are about 10,000 down between establishment and strength. I think that that is common between us. What I am announcing today regarding signals will not directly address the numbers on strength. TA personnel will be offered posts in other TA units with regular personnel being returned to other posts in the Army structure. I admit that a small number of civilians, including some non-regular permanent staff and TA soldiers employed on timed reserve contracts&#151;these are small numbers&#151;may be made redundant if alternative employment cannot be found, but what I am talking about today is a structural change. It is about taking resources away from obsolete units and assigning them to active reserve units.</p>

<a name="90428-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09042836000141"></a>By accident, I seem to have answered all the questions put to me by the noble Lord, Lord Lee, that I am capable of answering. I hope that I have at least given a feel for how we are taking this important review forward.</p>

It was full of ringing declarations of good intent but was more notable for what it did not say than for what it did say. Perhaps I may self-indulge with a little trip down memory lane. In 1984, I stood at that Dispatch Box and announced the increase in the size of the Territorial Army from 79,000 to 83,000. Today, as someone has already said, the <I>Evening Standard</I> is reporting a strength of 25,000. I announced to your Lordships the acquisition of a fleet of River class minesweepers for the Royal Naval Reserve&#151; 11 minesweepers built especially for and assigned to that force. I stood at that Dispatch Box one evening and announced the formation of 607 (City of York) Squadron, Royal Auxiliary Air Force, to be equipped with Wessex helicopters and deployed in support of 2nd Infantry Division in York, at that time commanded

Does the noble Lord recall the words of the late Sir Winston Churchill, who was right in that matter as in so much else? Members of the Territorial Army, said the late right honourable gentleman, are &#147;twice a citizen&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="st_81"></a>
<a name="09042836000143"></a><b><a name="90428-0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09042836000521"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b> My Lords, I can answer only one question here and now because that was a description of the past and I have to admit that we are in a different place, and we have been quite open about the fact that we are in a different place. We are looking forward to an entirely different reserve in the future. An entirely different reserve has, de facto, been in existence since roughly 2002 in terms of how it is deployed. Interestingly enough, I can answer the final challenge as I do recall the words of Sir Winston Churchill. The seven recommendations accept the reserves&#146; important role in representing the military within our communities. They are the footprint of the military in most of our society&#151;in places of work and in the community. We acknowledge for the first time that that is a useful part of their role.</p>

That is quite true. They are bolstering overseas operations, well embedded into the Regular Forces, and they are all to be congratulated on that. But to describe that as not gap-filling is disingenuous. The point is that there are not enough Regular Forces to undertake the commitments to which our Government have committed them. Until that balance is right&#151;not only the manpower balance but the financial balance that is required to support that manpower&#151;we are going to find ourselves in an extremely difficult position.</p>

<a name="90428-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09042836000145"></a>I thoroughly support the need for this review, but the reserves are promised a variety of things&#151;improved training, improved opportunities to prepare for operations, and other funded matters&#151;when the funding itself must, in some part, be dubious. In that case, it seems to me that there is a genuine danger that the reservists, who are keen and willing, will find that the promises they have been given are not being fulfilled. That is much more of a let-down for them than not having had it promised in the first place. I believe that without a proper defence review into which these new reserve arrangements can be slotted, the whole structure, good as it may be, is under question because of the lack of funding for it.</p>

That will be for the Government and the Secretary of State to consider. On the matter of funding, I must be absolutely honest. This review promises no more funding and the Government are not promising any more funding. No additional funding is allocated to implement the recommendations, which will have to be taken forward within existing budgets. We have to be realistic. None of the parties that could credibly form a Government is currently promising to spend more money on defence. This review recognises that

I do not believe that a promise will be broken because the promise is about being more effective. It is about taking resources&#151;it may indeed be a matter of taking resources from other areas in defence&#151;and achieving, with the training standards of the people in the reserves, more capability to be better integrated. So, in that sense, I do not believe that this is disingenuous.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09042836000148"></a>I have two questions for the Minister which immediately spring to mind. First, how will the recommendations of the review of reserves be managed in the context of the current financial pressure facing all government departments, not least the MoD? The noble Lord, Lord Lee, specifically asked questions in that area. We do need answers on that. Secondly, and more specifically, am I right in understanding from what the Minister said that considerable numbers of Royal Signals soldiers and units are to be laid off? It is well known that a need for a large number of extra TA signallers was identified only comparatively recently. Laying off specialist soldiers because the equipment that the Government have issued them with is obsolete sounds suspiciously like babies and bathwater. But vitally, in these days where technical, especially IT, skills are so needed in the services, is it really wise to ravage the TA&#146;s main repository of such skills?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09042836000149"></a>Lastly, I would like to strongly support my noble friend Lord Astor&#146;s request for a full debate as soon as possible, because there are several other matters that need covering in this.</p>

We have been quite clear that we are not saying that these recommendations come with any new money. We are saying quite openly that they will have to be managed within the present allocations to defence, as part of the budgeting and planning round. They will be implemented because they will add value to defence within the constrained financial situation. If any party that could credibly form an Administration wants to promise more money, I will be very happy to note it. But I think we all recognise that we live in constrained times, and we have to manage and get best value.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09042843000002"></a>On the matter of the Royal Signals units, I have set out the units that will be disbanded and the unit which will no longer be reserve-manned. We have no intention of laying off the skills; we will do all we can to redeploy skilled individuals within other TA units. As noble Lords know, I have no part in whether or not there will be a full debate. If there is to be one, I hope that the Minister will be here to answer it, but if not, I shall perform as best I can.</p>

The Government constantly reassess how they rationalise their estate and I simply cannot predict how the property sales will be treated. On the matter of care, yes, I should strongly say that we will rationalise the estate with great care. We are putting together a team to look at this. As noble Lords will know, the estate consists of some 2,000 sites. The review confirmed the importance of the volunteer estate, but noted that it was old, expensive, underused and located to serve the population centres of the 19th century, as opposed to those of the 21st century. To ensure that the reserve has an estate that is modern, provides value for money and is correctly located to match changes in the demographics and national infrastructure, the review recommended that the Ministry of Defence conducts a detailed requirement-based review. That will be done.</p>

When I was doing that, we concentrated very much on the employers, and we formed the National Employers&#146; Liaison Committee. I shall return to that in a moment. I warmly support the words of my noble and gallant friend Lord Craig about the problems that may arise when we have, as I hope we will, a very comprehensive defence review, resulting in a possible revisiting of this comprehensive report, which I have not yet read&#151;but knowing General Cottam, I am sure that it has been extremely well done. I also echo the words of the noble Lord, Lord Astor, in calling for a debate, which is entirely needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09042843000006"></a>Without employers there are no volunteers. Last year in Afghanistan, I found nine bus drivers from a bus company in Enniskillen who were all working in one company. That was a remarkable tribute to them. When I was inspector general, I suggested to the MoD that one thing that it could do for the employers would be to relieve them of the employers&#146; contribution to national insurance as a reward for letting people go. The Minister mentioned assistance and support, but can he be more specific about what there is in this for the employers? Without that we will not have their support in the future, particularly as we go into the economic black clouds that seem to be ahead of us.</p>

The review involved the National Employer Advisory Board. Its views were taken on board.

Thanks to the necessary reorganisation in the Regular Army, those links have recently been weakened, but in the past they have, let&#146;s face it, made the British Army the envy of the world. An additional benefit lies in this being a means by which young people can gain a taste of what service life is like.

We all recognise that reservists are particularly well placed to connect with the nation, but we have actually spelt it out in this report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09042843000010"></a>Although Regular Forces make a connection with the nation, reservists are often better placed to connect, integrate with and influence the community in which, in their civilian lives, they live and work.

I also commend the value that is brought to the individuals in their reserve experience. It genuinely adds to the wealth of our community.</p>

Anxiety, however, is being expressed by many of the officers, both medical and nursing, over their repeated deployment on operations overseas, which is having an adverse effect, in some cases, upon their civilian employment in the National Health Service.

We have been in Afghanistan, for instance, for a while. We have all known for a long time that it could be a very long haul. Why has it taken us this long to come to this staggeringly obvious conclusion?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09042843000017"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Astor, pointed out, the use of reservists on the front line is integrated, in current operations, with Regular Forces. The review says that, if that is what we are going to do, we should review the training and make sure that the training is directed very strongly to that purpose. It says that we should start from the user and work back to the training&#151;unlike some of the training procedures, schedules and programmes, which still have more relevance to history than they have to the outcomes that we are looking to achieve.</p>

I first signed up to the TA in January 1974, so I think that I know a little about the TA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09042843000024"></a>The success of training and the speed at which TA soldiers can be trained are crucially dependent on the money available and the number of man training days allocated to a TA unit.

That has to be a caveat that any sensible Government stick to in the difficult circumstances in which we find ourselves. However, through this review, the Government are committing themselves to the Reserve Forces being an integral and valuable part of defence, and I am sure that the whole House will agree that that is the way forward.</p>

<a name="09042843000026"></a><b><a name="90428-0005.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="09042843000070"></a>Earl Howe:</b> My Lords, I shall speak also to Amendments 7 and 8. I make no apology for returning to a matter that we debated at some length in Grand Committee&#151;that is, the question of why the Bill contains no duty for NHS bodies and those delivering services on behalf of the NHS to have regard to the <I>Handbook to the NHS Constitution</I>. First, what is the handbook meant to be? In Grand Committee, the Minister made it clear that the handbook was the explanatory guide to the constitution. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="09042843000045"></a>&#147;It explains what the constitution means in practice, by setting out the law and departmental policy that underpin each right and pledge in the constitution&#148;. &#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 23/2/09; GC 21.]</p>

<p><a name="09042843000043"></a>That was absolutely as I understood the position. However, despite that, and despite the duty in the Bill for NHS bodies to have regard to the constitution, the Minister made it equally clear that it was not appropriate to extend that duty to the handbook. When comparing the status of the constitution and the handbook, the analogy that he drew was that between the Bill and the Explanatory Notes that go with it. However, the Explanatory Notes have no force in law; the Bill, when enacted, does.</p>

<a name="90428-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09042843000027"></a>I am still troubled by this. In the first place, I am doubtful whether the analogy the Minister drew actually holds water. The handbook is a statutory document; it is mentioned in the Bill, unlike the Explanatory Notes. I take us back to the departmental website. The part of the website devoted to the <I>NHS </I><I>C</I><I>onstitution</I> makes it clear that the constitution consists of&#151;I remind the House of those words&#151;not only the constitution itself, but also the handbook. It also includes the <I>S</I><I>tatement of NHS </I><I>A</I><I>ccountability</I> as well, but I shall not return to that issue.</p>

<a name="90428-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09042843000028"></a>If we look at the way this Bill is constructed, we should take due note of the heading to Clause 1: &#147;NHS Constitution&#148;. Clause 1 introduces and embraces not only the constitution itself but also the handbook. I took that bracketing together to be an implicit  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_134"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 134</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>acknowledgement that the two publications were legally and practicably inseparable for the purposes of interpreting what the <I>NHS Constitution</I> actually was. The Minister&#146;s reply indicated however that the handbook was not part of the constitution. He emphasised that,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="09042843000046"></a>&#147;It is not a document that we intend should be legally taken account of by providers of NHS care&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 23/2/09; col. GC 21.]</p>

<a name="90428-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09042843000029"></a>If that really is so, we are left wondering what patients and staff are meant to think when they read it. It is explanatory, but at the same time, they do not have to have regard to it. If they do not have to have regard to it, they can ignore it, because nothing will happen to them if they do. Indeed, if they can ignore it, they do not even need to read it. That is the construction which people may well put on the Government&#146;s position on this matter.</p>

<a name="90428-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09042843000030"></a>The Minister put forward another reason in Grand Committee why it was not appropriate to create a duty to have regard to the handbook. He said that,</p>
<ul><a name="09042843000049"></a>&#147;the handbook is primarily an explanatory guide for patients, not guidance for the NHS&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 23/2/09; col. GC 22.]</ul>
<a name="90428-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09042843000031"></a>I found that very odd. It is certainly true that the first part of the handbook is addressed to &#147;you&#148;, by which is clearly meant, &#147;you, the patient&#148;. But that is no less true of the constitution itself. The whole of the second section of the constitution is addressed to &#147;you&#148;, which means everyone who uses the NHS. However, that fact does not prevent there being a duty placed on NHS bodies to have regard to the constitution. Again, the obvious question is, why not also the handbook? Equally, the Minister said in our earlier debate, and he may well repeat it today, that,</p>
<ul><a name="09042843000050"></a>&#147;the handbook itself does not create policy or law&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 23/2/09; col. GC 21.]</ul>
<a name="90428-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09042843000032"></a>The implication is that its status is not of a kind that would put it on a par with the constitution. I accept that it does not create policy or law, but as I understand it, the constitution itself does not add to people&#146;s legal rights; it is a declaratory document, yet there is a duty to have regard to it.</p>

<a name="90428-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09042843000033"></a>We should perhaps bear in mind the handbook&#146;s opening sentence.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="09042843000047"></a>&#147;The Handbook is designed to give NHS staff and patients all the information they need about the NHS Constitution for England&#148;.</p>

<a name="90428-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09042843000034"></a>Indeed, it is designed for rather more than that, because, as the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, pointed out in Grand Committee, there are sections of the handbook which qualify or place limits on the open-ended statements made in the constitution. A very good example, which the noble Baroness chose, was the right,</p>
<ul><a name="09042843000051"></a>&#147;to go to other European Economic Area countries or Switzerland for treatment which would be available to you through your NHS commissioner&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 23/2/09; col. GC 19.]</ul>
<a name="90428-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09042843000035"></a>It is only when you read the handbook that you discover that the right can only be exercised at the discretion of the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="90428-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09042843000036"></a>The constitution sets out the right to make choices about your NHS care, but it is only when you read the handbook that you are told about the raft of exceptions to that right. The handbook spells out exceptions to the right of access to your own health records and exceptions to the right to receive clinically indicated

In a very real sense, a duty to have regard to the constitution which is not at the same time accompanied by a duty to have regard to the handbook risks, at best, confusion, and, at worst, downright contradiction.</p>

<a name="90428-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09042843000037"></a>I must press the Minister further on this point. How is it that a document which is to be treated, on the one hand, as an integral part of the constitution is at one and the same time not part of it? How can it make sense for there to be a duty to have regard to the 12-page document called the <I>NHS Constitution</I>, and yet for there not to be a duty to have regard to the fuller document which is meant to tell everyone how the constitution should be interpreted? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_103"></a>
<a name="09042843000038"></a><b><a name="90428-0005.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09042843000071"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Lord Darzi of Denham):</b> My Lords, Amendments 3, 7 and 8 tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, propose that the same list of bodies which are required to have regard to the constitution should also be under a duty to have regard to the <I>H</I><I>andbook to the </I><I>NHS C</I><I>onstitution</I>. It may be useful if I reiterate our intentions behind the purpose and status of the handbook. The noble Earl very eloquently described the debate in Grand Committee when I explained that the handbook is the explanatory guide to the <I>NHS Constitution</I> to be used by patients, public and staff. It is a reference guide for these groups, an explanation of what the constitution means in practice to help them understand it. Indeed, the very first sentence of the handbook reads:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="09042843000048"></a>&#147;The Handbook is designed to give NHS staff and patients all the information they need about the NHS Constitution for England&#148;.</p>

<a name="90428-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09042843000039"></a>The words in the constitution are necessarily high-level. The handbook takes these words and explains them in further detail, making each right, pledge and responsibility more accessible and digestible to patients, public and staff. The handbook is the result of extensive research with patients, public and staff into what format would be most useful to help them understand the constitution. For example, the handbook explains to patients, as the noble Earl said, how they can make a complaint and explains in more detail what their responsibilities are. It summarises what a right means in practice, and its legal status, for both a patient and for a member of NHS staff.</p>

<a name="90428-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09042843000040"></a>The handbook is not guidance; it is an explanatory document and it is certainly not an instruction manual. The words in the handbook do not mean that the NHS has to do anything new or different. They do not express any new laws or policies, or new interpretations of existing rights or policies, which are not already in the constitution. They are merely a summary for patients, public and staff of the current situation regarding the law and departmental policy underpinning each entry in the constitution.</p>

I am more than happy to look into what impact the handbook will have on the constitution itself. I do not want to dilute the constitution by inserting an amendment which gives

I respect his position, but we are left with what many would see as an anomalous situation with regard to the functioning of the NHS. On the one hand, there will be a duty to have regard to the constitution but, on the other hand, there is no duty whatever to have regard to what the constitution means in practice. From a legal standpoint, we have in the handbook a statutory document which the Secretary of State has a duty to revise from time to time but the document has absolutely no standing or force if the Bill is left as it is. I am still baffled by that and my bafflement stems ultimately from the contradictory signals sent out by the department over the past few months in the contrast between what the Minister has told us at the Dispatch Box and what the department has said elsewhere, whether on its website or by means of the Bill&#146;s construction and drafting. Nevertheless, it is not appropriate to press the matter. I am happy to engage in further discussions with the Minister between now and the next stage of the Bill, and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

As she said so movingly and so memorably in the debate on the Archer report last Thursday, the history of the contaminated blood disaster is one of unspeakable suffering for,</p>

<p><a name="09042849000049"></a>When I announced the setting-up of the Archer inquiry in February 2007, 1,757 patients had died. Since then, of a patient group of barely 5,000, over 200 more have died in direct consequence of the use of contaminated blood in their NHS treatment. The noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, was herself widowed by the disaster, and I know that the House very much looks forward to hearing her speak again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09042849000003"></a>The first unanswered question is whether it is now clearly understood by the department that the body for which my proposed new clause provides would be a statutory one. Correspondence between the department and the Haemophilia Society envisages a non-statutory body and is at variance with the intention of the Archer report. Thus it will be helpful if my noble friend Lord Darzi, in replying to this debate, can clarify the department&#146;s intended response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09042849000004"></a>I turn now to the urgency of the need for an updating of ministerial Statements to Parliament on the sombre threat of a third deadly scourge to patients dependent on NHS blood and blood products. The vCJD threat is increasingly worrying, a recent post-mortem on a hepatitis C-infected patient having found variant CJD in his spleen, thus totally undermining the Chief Medical Officer&#146;s assessment of the risk as &#147;hypothetical&#148;. Specifically, we need to know the department&#146;s current figure for the number of patients treated with blood taken from variant CJD-infected donors. We need also to know what action Ministers have taken since the post-mortem on the implications of its findings. Further, how do they now assess the risk facing patients treated with blood taken from such donors, and what protection is now in place to safeguard recipients of donated blood?</p>

They reported that the buildings were never designed for the scale of production envisaged. They commented: &#145;If this were a commercial operation we would have no hesitation in recommending that manufacture should cease until the facility was upgraded to a minimum acceptable level&#146;&#148;.</p>

<a name="90428-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09042849000006"></a>The Archer report then starkly stated:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="09042849000055"></a>&#147;BPL was rescued by Crown Immunity&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09042849000050"></a>and went on that BPL&#146;s,</p>
<ul><a name="09042849000059"></a>&#147;existing plant continued production, relying on Crown Immunity to dispense with the requirements of the Medicines Act, but was able to meet only 40 per cent of the national requirements&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90428-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09042849000007"></a>Thus, by the use of Crown immunity, a relic of feudal England, the lives of countless haemophilia patients were blatantly and gravely put at risk.</p>

<a name="90428-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09042849000008"></a>Speaking in the House on 10 March, my noble friend Lord Darzi, responding to me in exchanges about thalidomide, referred to,</p>
<ul><a name="09042849000060"></a>&#147;the tremendous amount of work that has gone into the marketing, testing and regulation of drugs, as encapsulated in the Medicines Act 1968, from which society has benefited greatly&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 10/3/09; col. 1059.]</ul>
<a name="90428-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09042849000009"></a>There could be no clearer text than this for describing the enormity of the BPL&#146;s use of Crown immunity to dispense with all the requirements of that renowned and so vitally important statute; hence the need to reflect again in this debate on from whom the BPL was &#147;rescued&#148; by its use of Crown immunity.</p>




<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_138"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 138</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09042849000010"></a>First and foremost, of course, it was &#147;rescued&#148; from the afflicted and bereaved by the disaster, thereby denying them any prospect of legal redress, a denial made all the more cruelly unjust by the refusals of successive Governments to agree to a public inquiry. So they were left with no hope of any independent assessment of responsibility for their plight until the Archer inquiry was announced.</p>

<a name="90428-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09042849000011"></a>Crown immunity has now been abolished. It was ended by John Major&#146;s Conservative Government in 1991, and infected NHS patients ask why the present Government, who clearly have no intention of reinstating Crown immunity, cannot now review the claims of the victims contaminated by NHS blood from whom the BPL was &#147;rescued&#148; by Crown immunity. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, said in his speech last Thursday that he was sure that it would be possible for actions to be brought now if the Government chose to waive, dating back as necessary, Crown immunity. Have the Government, opposed as they must surely be to Crown immunity, considered this possibility?</p>

<a name="90428-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="09042849000012"></a>Most of all, we need to know in this debate when the Government now expect to respond to the Archer report as a whole and how we can be sure that parliamentary time will be found for their response to be fully debated in your Lordships&#146; House. Meanwhile, I hope that a positive response to this new clause&#151;one giving a clear pointer to the Government&#146;s intentions vis- -vis the report as a whole&#151;will be forthcoming.</p>

<a name="90428-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09042849000013"></a>As I made clear both in Committee and elsewhere, the new clause can be implemented at no great cost but much to the relief of haemophilia patients who feel strongly that there must be no delay now in creating a statutory committee to advise government on the management of haemophilia, with patient and family representation. Of course there will be costs in giving full effect to the Archer report, but there will also be priceless benefits in enabling haemophilia patients to live fuller and more fulfilling lives.</p>

<a name="90428-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09042849000014"></a>Naturally, their principal desire is for closure with the Department of Health on their claims for just treatment. As the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, told the House last Thursday:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="09042849000056"></a>&#147;When we are ill, we have faith that the treatment that we receive will help to make us better, or will help us to manage the disease so that we can lead as full and dignified a life as possible. To receive treatment that leads to such tragic consequences is unimaginably cruel&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 23/4/09; col. 1628.]</p>

<p><a name="09042849000051"></a>Surely parliamentarians have no more compelling duty than to them.</p>

<a name="90428-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09042849000015"></a>It may, however, be said that, self-evident though the Archer report has made the case for closure, a time of deep recession is not one in which to expect it to be achieved. Yet some aspects of the current difficulties are frequently compared, not inappropriately, with those faced by Denis Healey&#151;now my noble friend Lord Healey&#151;when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer and had to resort to the IMF for support. Harold Wilson, then Prime Minister, in whose Government I served, said that it was a time for the broadest backs to bear the biggest burdens, but he needed no reminding that my responsibilities, as the first Minister for Disabled People, were for those with broken backs and even more handicapping disabilities. He and Denis Healey

<a name="90428-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09042849000016"></a>I hope that may put in some perspective the cries of alarm from anyone who thinks that acting justly to this small and stricken patient community is insupportable. Its claims are entitled to be seen as a priority of priorities and I know that my noble friend Lord Darzi will want to reply as helpfully as he can. I look forward to hearing him as we proceed.</p>

I ask noble Lords on all sides of the House to support this amendment, which, if passed by your Lordships, would establish a statutory committee to provide and give advice to government and haemophiliacs on health and support services.</p>

<a name="90428-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09042849000018"></a>This committee would undoubtedly improve the lives of those who have suffered from contaminated blood products. It would also bring together information for haemophiliacs and those who have cared for them into one place, with punch. I am not saying that there are no places to go for information, advice and support; the Haemophilia Society has done wonderful things. It is time, however, for a statutory committee that can really punch above its weight.</p>

<a name="90428-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09042849000019"></a>I shall not repeat my reasons for supporting the amendment. It is quite difficult for me to say these words, which take me back to an extremely difficult time in my life. Noble Lords will recall my connection with the haemophilia community and my experience, when my husband was contaminated in the mid-1980s, of trying to get coherent information and advice. If only we had had this committee then.</p>

<a name="90428-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09042849000020"></a>The committee would not be bureaucratic or cumbersome; it would be small and cheap to maintain. It would right a great wrong that has been done to haemophiliacs over so many years. Those who live with the complexities of their condition plus the consequences of contaminated blood&#151;and all that that brings&#151;should have the best information, support and advice. I believe that this committee would establish a modern response to a 1980s disaster and I urge noble Lords to support the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Manchester.</p>

I was going to speak about any section or interest that was added to this list because I feel that, if one group is added, I should bring forward a range of others who have an equal wish to be represented in the Bill. I find this difficult because the noble Lord, Lord Morris, and the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, are wonderful advocates for this cause, but others of your Lordships might have advocated other causes had they thought that they might be added to the list in this part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90428-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09042849000022"></a>Having said that, I hope that my noble friends will understand that I am not speaking against the need for an advisory committee; that need is a different issue from the consultation item under discussion, which is in a list in the Bill. If the need for an advisory committee was brought forward in another place, as I think will happen, I would be able to support it. It is with deep regret, then, that I feel unable to support my noble friends; it is simply because they are, as a technicality, making their argument in the wrong place. Should they put this forward at Third Reading, I would have to bring a long list of other people who would also wish to have their views heard.</p>

They made an important point. People have to trust the healthcare professionals who look after them; they have no choice but to trust the service to give them what they need. Therefore, at some future time, we might well be able to establish some grouping that would make representations for those who have, unwittingly and inadvertently, been the victims of a mishap that has occurred. If that is the case, such a committee should be included in this core list of bodies for which the NHS Constitution would be very important. Although the name outlined in the amendment may not, I fear, be right, the principle is correct. I wonder whether the Minister might be able between now and Third Reading to come back to us with some assurance that whatever comes in the future could be added to a broader grouping, and that the grouping outlined in the Bill may be a minimum, but not an exclusive, list.</p>

I say that only to address the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, who was perfectly right in her observations about the list, but I do not think&#151;if I read the noble Lord, Lord Morris, correctly&#151;that that was his prime intention.</p>

<a name="90428-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09042849000025"></a>Like other noble Lords, I take my hat off to the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Manchester, for his principled and deeply felt stand on the plight of haemophiliacs in our country. In Grand Committee, as well as on Thursday of last week and again today, he cogently argued the case for treating fairly and compassionately those individuals, a dwindling band of people whose privations have been, and continue to be, so great. It would be a hard-hearted person who could read the report, so excellently written by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, and not associate himself with the call that he makes for speedy and appropriate government action.</p>

<a name="90428-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09042849000026"></a>It was disappointing that the Minister was unable to throw any light on the Government&#146;s detailed thinking when she replied to the Motion of the noble Lord,  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_141"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 141</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord Morris, last week. She indicated then that she was pushing hard to be able to do so today. I hope that she can, or that her noble friend can.</p>

<a name="90428-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09042849000027"></a>Only last week, I was contacted by one of the people who received contaminated blood. She was not at all strident or pushy in her tone; she merely wished me to know that the hepatitis C which she contracted through no fault of her own as a result of the transfusion had now developed into full-blown cirrhosis of the liver. Her lifespan as a result can now be measured in terms of a few years at best. A liver transplant, she told me, is unlikely to be a practical possibility, not least because she has to take her turn in the queue. No allowance is made by the NHS for the fact that the NHS itself was the instrument of the serious illness which she now suffers from. Indeed, the attitude that she encounters in the NHS can be one of criticism, as if it were her own lifestyle that were to blame. That is a double insult.</p>

<a name="90428-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09042849000028"></a>It is the needs and wishes of that lady and individuals like her that most concern me here, rather than the business of attributing responsibility for what happened in the 1970s and 1980s. To be sure, it is important to establish what happened and why and to learn lessons for the future, but the immediate and pressing question is to ask what are the needs of the people who are now, many of them, very ill. What can and should we do to make their lives more bearable? As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, recommended, we should look at ways in which access to NHS services for this group of people could be improved.</p>

<a name="90428-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09042849000029"></a>It is here that a committee of the kind proposed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, and now by the noble Lord, Lord Morris, could have a useful role to play. It is not the only way of dealing with the matter, but one factor in its favour is that it would provide the haemophiliac community with the sense that it was being listened to by a group whose remit consisted solely of haemophilia and related issues. As the committee would be only advisory, it would not usurp the authority of the Secretary of State, with whom decisions would ultimately rest, but its recommendations would clearly carry considerable moral weight.</p>

<a name="90428-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09042849000030"></a>I very much hope that the Minister will be in a position today to indicate the Government&#146;s response in more than just a cursory fashion to the proposals so cogently made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer.</p>

<a name="90428-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09042849000034"></a>Amendment 4 is a device to allow this important matter to be debated early in proceedings. I am grateful to the opposition parties for their help and support in facilitating this. As we heard, Amendment 40, tabled by my noble friend Lord Morris, is based on a recommendation by my noble and learned friend Lord Archer in his report published on 23 February. The report considered the supply of virus-contaminated blood and blood products and its devastating effect on the haemophilia community in particular from the early 1970s onwards until tests became available for Hepatitis C and HIV. We welcome my noble and learned friend&#146;s report and warmly thank him and my noble friends Lord Morris and Lord Corbett for the efforts they are making on behalf of the haemophilia patients and their families.</p>

<a name="90428-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09042849000035"></a>There is no doubt, as the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, pointed out, that this group of patients has suffered tragic consequences as the result of the serious infections that were inadvertently transmitted via this treatment. I agree that it is important to ensure that these patients and their families are properly supported and to act to reduce as far as practically possible any further risk to all patients who need blood and blood products. There have been major advances in safer treatments for haemophilia. We have committed to making available synthetic products not derived from human blood for all those patients for whom they are suitable.</p>

<a name="90428-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09042849000036"></a>Haemophilia patients together with their clinicians and service commissioners already have influence in the selection, procurement and delivery of those products. This will continue. We entirely agree with the arguments in my noble and learned friend&#146;s report that it is vital for patients to be represented where decisions about good practice in healthcare provision are being made. This was the centrepiece of our strategy for embedding quality in the NHS and it certainly ran through my report, <I>High Quality Care for All</I>. Together with effectiveness and safety, patient experience is a guiding principle for high-quality healthcare.</p>

<a name="90428-0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09042849000037"></a>We agree that it is vital to have strong mechanisms in place to provide independent expert advice on blood safety, and to recommend improvements. We have an established mechanism to do this through the expert scientific Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs, which advises the UK Administrations. The committee has patient representation and is developing effective means of communicating its advice for stakeholders and the public. Our view is that it is better to build on existing arrangements and expertise, rather than risk disrupting or duplicating those arrangements via legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09042849000038"></a>With this in mind, one option that we are actively considering, and have already discussed with the noble Lord, Lord Morris, is that together with the devolved Administrations we could build on the existing UK-wide partnership in the Haemophilia Alliance between patients, haemophilia doctors and others involved in their care, such as nurses, physiotherapists and social workers. The alliance is jointly chaired by the Haemophilia Society. We are considering a formal arrangement whereby the Government would seek advice from the alliance on matters relating specifically to the care of haemophilia patients, and meet with them at least twice a year. If this were pursued, we would, of course, meet the costs of these meetings. The Haemophilia Alliance has already established a commendable reputation by developing a national service specification for bleeding disorders, which has been welcomed by commissioners.</p>

<a name="90428-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09042849000039"></a>I assure noble Lords that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State is looking at the most appropriate means of strengthening representation for haemophilia patients and ensuring that advice is provided to those best placed to act on it for the benefit of patients. This is being considered together with the other recommendations from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, for improving support more widely to the haemophilia community. I personally commit to do everything possible to ensure that the Government respond fully to the noble and learned Lord&#146;s recommendations in advance of the Whitsun Recess, if not the week before. Furthermore, we will of course assist as far as possible in securing a debate on the Government&#146;s response.</p>

<a name="90428-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09042849000040"></a>Finally, I turn to two points made by the noble Lord, Lord Morris, on CJD. First, since the announcement of the finding of the case, much careful work has been undertaken to ascertain the possible source of this infection. The information will be considered by the CJD incident panel, which will advise if further action is necessary. I remind the House that we have implemented many precautionary measures to reduce the risk as far as is practical and continue to monitor this area very closely. Secondly, on Crown immunity, I reassure my noble friend that the position is very different from what it was 20 or 30 years ago, but I am more than happy to look at what Crown immunity was 30 years ago and respond, giving the changes that have occurred since then.</p>

<a name="90428-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09042849000041"></a>I hope that the noble Lord will feel reassured by the steps that have been taken to consider the most appropriate way in which to involve those affected by haemophilia in decision-making and feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<a name="09042849000043"></a><b><a name="90428-0007.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09042849000076"></a>Earl Howe:</b> My Lords, in moving this amendment, I realise that I run the risk of crossfire from other noble Lords for seeking to add to the list in subsection (2). I am looking in particular at the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, but luckily she is not paying attention. I am prepared to accept the risk because, when we debated the NHS Constitution in Grand Committee, I drew the Committee&#146;s attention to a remarkable omission, which is that nowhere in the constitution is there even a mention of specialised services. This seems to me quite extraordinary and I thought that we ought to return to the subject today.</p>

<a name="90428-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09042849000044"></a>It might be helpful if I were just to outline the way in which specialised services are commissioned in the NHS. What happens is that within each strategic health authority area, PCTs delegate responsibility for commissioning these services to specialised commissioning groups. In so doing, they pool their commissioning budgets. The point of doing that is to share risk and to ensure that the care that is delivered is of high quality. We are talking here about a very considerable range of conditions; for example, cystic fibrosis, complex disability, haemophilia, HIV, various neurological conditions and certain types of cancer. Serious burn injuries and spinal injuries also fall within the category of specialised conditions for the purposes of the national definition set.</p>

<a name="90428-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09042849000045"></a>Collectively the services involved account for 10 per cent of NHS expenditure and the treatment of hundreds of thousands of patients. The handbook to the constitution mentions these services only in passing. A short paragraph on page 15 talks about,</p>
<ul><a name="09042849000061"></a>&#147;the small number of people who suffer from rare conditions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09042849000052"></a>From his reply in Grand Committee, I rather took it that the Minister privately agreed with me that this was inadequate recognition of a category of services which he himself referred to as being the &#147;jewel in the crown&#148;.</p>

<a name="90428-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09042849000046"></a>However, these services are important in another sense. We have to remember that the way in which the NHS commissions specialised services involves a diverse range of providers, many of them from the independent sector. That fact places even greater weight on the need for commissioning arrangements to maintain the standard of the services that are delivered, and, over time, to enhance them. Against that background, it is surely of great importance that the bodies required to have regard to the NHS Constitution should include specialised commissioning groups.</p>

<a name="90428-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09042849000047"></a>I understand that the PCTs participating in the specialised commissioning groups remain the statutory bodies, and the Minister may well say that my amendment  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_145"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 145</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is inappropriate for that reason alone. However, I would still argue that the quality and safety of specialised services is dependent on the effectiveness of the specialised commissioning groups acting on their behalf, which is why I am proposing an explicit reference to them in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90428-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09042849000048"></a>I hope the Minister will be able to give me a reassuring reply on this matter, which I do regard as significant, and I beg to move.</p>

<a name="09042853000001"></a><b><a name="90428-0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09042853000120"></a>Lord Walton of Detchant:</b> My Lords, this is an important amendment. The reason that I think it is important rests on my knowledge of specialised commissioning services across a large range of different activities in the NHS, not least in my specialty of neurology.</p>

<a name="90428-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09042853000002"></a>I am at present serving on two inquiries being conducted by All-Party Groups. One is on Parkinson&#146;s disease; the other is on muscular dystrophy. We have taken a great deal of evidence already on services for patients with Parkinsonism, and have found, not greatly to my surprise, that there is a remarkable unevenness of resources and facilities for patients in different parts of the country, in relation to their medical care and also to the availability of specialist nurses, specialist physiotherapists and specialists in language and speech therapy.</p>

<a name="90428-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09042853000003"></a>In the case of muscular dystrophy and other neuromuscular diseases, the situation is substantially worse. My own research, many years ago, was based in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. I will give you a perfect example of what I am talking about. The most severe form of muscular dystrophy, the Duchenne type, affects young boys who have difficulty in walking and who, by the time that they are eight, nine or 10 years of age, are often confined to a wheelchair. When I started working in this field, many of them died in their early teens from complications such as heart failure or pneumonia. In the unit in Newcastle with which I am now very familiar, the range of services, including physiotherapy, treatment of contractures, prevention of deformities, respiratory care and specialised support for cardiac complications, has meant that the average age of death of boys in that unit, and indeed in other specialised units in Oxford, London and other parts of the country, is 31 or 32 years of age. I even know of one patient who is 41 years of age&#151;admittedly on assisted respiration, but living a useful life. However, in certain parts of the country, and in one region in particular, a survey has shown that the average age of death of those patients is still 18 years of age. The standard of care is grossly uneven throughout the country.</p>

<a name="90428-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09042853000004"></a>The principles set out in the <I>NHS Constitution</I> are outstandingly good, but it is crucial that those responsible for commissioning specialist services should be in a position to take account of the crucial differences that already exist in services in different parts of the country. For that reason, this is a very important amendment that I warmly support.</p>

However, this seems to me to come down to the matter raised by the noble Earl who is ultimately responsible for the

It seems that, while it is extremely important that the specialised commissioning groups should have delegated powers to make appropriate judgments on the commissioning of services, ultimately they take their powers from the legal responsibility of the bodies that purchase the services. This matter should really be dealt with by providing guidance to PCTs and other authorities responsible for purchasing. It is a matter of specifying which NHS body has legal responsibility, and adding to the list in this way is perhaps not very helpful.</p>

It neatly provides the device that I was looking for the last time I spoke. If we do not have specialised commissioning groups flagged up centrally, that would suggest that they are not absolutely core to the delivery of services for patients with rare and complex conditions, some of which may have arisen through mishaps. Different groups will need specialised services commissioned for them. It would seem extremely sensible to have them in the group, because the way that the provision is worded would leave it quite open for the different specialised commissioning groups as they evolve. We should also consider the collateral effect of not having this added to the list as advocated by the noble Earl, Lord Howe.</p>

I want to pose a question to the Minister before he replies: is there any group working directly or indirectly for the National Health Service that would not need to have regard to the constitution? Is there any need for a list, because it surely goes without saying that they should have regard to the constitution?</p>

<p><a name="st_121"></a>
<a name="09042853000008"></a><b><a name="90428-0007.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09042853000124"></a>Lord Darzi of Denham:</b> My Lords, first, I declare an interest. I work in two NHS organisations that provide specialised services commissioned by specialist commissioners. I am sympathetic to the amendment and I understand why the noble Earl is seeking to ensure that we do not lose sight of specialised services. The NHS Constitution and the duty to have regard to it apply to specialised services as much as any other kind of NHS service, as adequately described by the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge. The Government remain committed more broadly to the collaborative commissioning functions of specialised commissioning groups, spending about &#163;5 billion of the NHS budget every year on such services.</p>

<a name="90428-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09042853000009"></a>However, as pointed out by the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, the amendment is not necessary, because it does not address the issue raised by noble Lords in this Chamber. Noble Lords passionately believe that we have a strong history of providing excellence when it comes to specialised services. I agree with them. The noble Lord, Lord Walton, gave one example and there are many examples of excellence across the country. We need to ensure that we have the adequate support and funding to continue to provide excellence in such services. But I do not believe that the amendment addresses that. It creates a regard by the specialist commissioners, who themselves are a consortium of  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_147"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 147</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>primary care trusts. There is no such thing as specialist commissioners with their own separate governance structures: they are part of a consortium of primary care trusts. The duty would require primary care trusts to have regard to the NHS constitution when performing any NHS function, including the function of commissioning specialised services.</p>

<a name="90428-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09042853000010"></a>I hope that I have reassured the House that the amendment is not necessary. I support noble Lords who made a strong case for why the NHS needs to look at commissioning functions in greater detail. I hope that in <I>High</I><I> Q</I><I>uality </I><I>C</I><I>are </I><I>F</I><I>or </I><I>A</I><I>ll</I> we made a strong case for specialist providers&#151;there are many in London and outside&#151;and why such services should be supported and funded.</p>

<a name="90428-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09042853000011"></a>We also acknowledge that in these cases we also need specialist commissioners with the expertise in commissioning such services. I hope that I have reassured the noble Earl that specialist commissioners have not been overlooked and that he feels able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_122"></a>
<a name="09042853000012"></a><b><a name="90428-0007.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09042853000125"></a>Earl Howe:</b> My Lords, this has been a useful debate. Of course, I understand the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, which in part I foreshadowed in my own remarks.</p>

<a name="90428-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09042853000013"></a>I would say to the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, that it is as much the ability to be consulted on revisions to the constitution as the duty to have regard to it that prompted me to include specialised commissioning groups in this part of the Bill. As she will remember, Clause 3(5) refers to those bodies and groups of people who will be consulted when the constitution is revised. It was that ability to respond to this important constitution that I felt would have maintained the profile of specialised services.</p>

<a name="90428-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09042853000014"></a>The Minister's reply was slightly disappointing although not wholly unexpected as regards the appropriateness of this particular amendment. However, I took some comfort from the general tenor of what he said. He of all people will understand what is at stake here. We cannot afford a situation where the profile of specialised services and the priority that is attached to them are allowed to suffer. It would be particularly helpful to hear, either now or outside this Chamber, that there will at least be a separate assurance scheme for specialised commissioning groups within the world-class commissioning programme. If we had that comfort, my mind would be considerably eased on this issue. For now, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_124"></a>
<a name="09042853000015"></a><b><a name="90428-0007.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09042853000127"></a>Lord Walton of Detchant:</b> My Lords, my noble friends and I have tabled this amendment for several important reasons. It is true that if one looks at the <I>NHS </I><I>C</I><I>onstitution</I>, in Part 1 on the principles that guide the NHS, item 3 says that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="09042853000100"></a>&#147;The NHS aspires to the highest standards of excellence and professionalism&#151;in the provision of high-quality care that is safe, effective and focused on patient experience; in the planning and delivery of the clinical and other services it provides; in the people it employs and the education, training and development they receive; in the leadership and management of its organisations; and through its commitment to innovation and to the promotion and conduct of research to improve the current and future health and care of the population&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09042853000090"></a>Education and training are mentioned; so, too, is research. But people who work in the universities and medical schools who are involved in the education and training of all healthcare professionals&#151;doctors, nurses and other members of the healthcare team&#151;have expressed to me and others concern that not more is said about the crucial importance of the education and training of these individuals and of the necessity that the NHS should take full account of the needs of such education and training.</p>

<a name="90428-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09042853000016"></a>Equally, bodies concerned with research such as the Medical Research Council the Association of Medical Research Charities have felt that the <I>NHS </I><I>C</I><I>onstitution</I>, which contains a number of very admirable principles, pays less than adequate tribute to the importance of research. As I have said often&#151;and I know that the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, would agree with me&#151;today's discovery in basic medical and scientific research brings tomorrow's practical development in patient care. There is no doubt that such research is one of the life-bloods of medicine in the UK and one of the great virtues of the National Health Service, which is something that does not exist in many other countries. Because of the nature of its organisation, it provides a wonderful situation for the conduct of clinical trials of new developments in medicine and in other branches of medical science.</p>

<a name="90428-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09042853000017"></a>It is very important that full account should be taken of the needs of education, training and research and more needs to be said. I accept the strictures that have been expressed by a number of noble Lords about lists and it is true that if one looks at this particular amendment one&#146;s first reaction on reading,</p>
<ul><a name="09042853000106"></a>&#147;bodies concerned with the education of health professionals&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09042853000018"></a>and</p>
<ul><a name="09042853000107"></a>&#147;bodies concerned with the support and delivery of medical and scientific research&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09042853000091"></a>should,</p>
<ul><a name="09042853000108"></a>&#147;have regard to the NHS Constitution&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09042853000092"></a>is that yes, of course they must. But equally, it is important that the NHS as an organisation should take full account of the needs of the education of health professionals in all of their branches and the need to support the circumstances in which medical and scientific research can be carried out.</p>

<a name="90428-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09042853000019"></a>I will also speak briefly to Amendment 34, which is grouped with this amendment because it relates to the section in the Bill relating to prizes for innovation in the National Health Service. As the Bill currently stands, that clause refers to prizes for innovation. Innovation could be innovation in the design of new  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_149"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 149</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>trolleys in the National Health Service or the design of items of equipment. It could mean a variety of different innovations which need not necessarily include components of research. For that reason, the Medical Research Council is particularly anxious, and deeply concerned, to see that particular clause, under which prizes can be awarded, includes the phrase &#147;or research leading to innovation&#148; as well as &#147;innovation&#148; itself. For that reason, I strongly wish to argue the case that these amendments are very important.</p>

<a name="90428-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09042853000020"></a>I am deeply grateful to the Minister for the letter he wrote to me expressing his feeling that perhaps there is already enough in the constitution to meet my concerns. He said that the NHS takes full account of the importance of the education of all healthcare professionals; of the way in which healthcare is nurtured by the results of research; and of the way in which the environment is provided in which research can be conducted. I find his letter extremely reassuring, but I am still not certain that that reassurance is, in itself, enough. For that reason, I beg to move this amendment.</p>

My noble friend Lord Walton has articulated very clearly why these amendments are needed. I welcome the proposed innovation prizes, but recommend that the scope should be broadened to encourage the research that underpins innovation. I think these amendments are designed to do that. Innovation depends on research, and I know very well that the Minister is well aware of that in his own research and innovations.</p>

<a name="90428-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09042853000022"></a>It is important to recognise and reward the translation of basic and clinical research into innovative ideas and products that will improve healthcare. The <I>NHS Constitution</I>, in its principles, enshrines a commitment both to innovation and to the promotion of conducting research. During the previous debate, there was recognition of the need to develop a stronger culture in the NHS to support research and innovation. The Cooksey review, some years ago, examined the future of health research in the UK. It emphasised the importance of removing barriers to translational research and discussed the need for &#147;pull&#148; incentives to encourage demand for research leading to innovation. The review concluded that there should be proper rewards for translating research into innovation in health interventions.</p>

<a name="90428-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09042853000023"></a>The Cooksey review also highlighted concerns that the incentives for research to achieve an impact on health and health needs are not as strong as those to achieve academic excellence. Better incentives are needed to ensure that the best ideas are carried forward for patient benefit. Therefore, the criteria for the prizes should be developed to ensure they identify and reward early-stage research that has the potential to be transformative in an NHS setting.</p>

<a name="90428-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09042853000024"></a>During the Committee debate, my noble friend Lady Murphy raised concerns about the time frame in which the success of an innovation is demonstrated. This was shown in a recent report, entitled <I>&#147;Medical Research</I><I>:</I><I> what&#146;s it worth?&#148;</I><I>, </I>that was commissioned and independently produced by the Academy of Medical Sciences, the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust.

Coming from the nursing profession and professions not so steeped in history in the educational bodies, I would emphasise that we are, as a profession, &#147;out of sight, out of mind&#148;. There is an unfortunate gap between service and education. That gap needs to be closed quickly to cover all the points that have been put in the NHS review by the Minister, concerning compassion and the values of the NHS. If this could be included in the Bill, it would help the universities to see&#151;in undergraduate training, leading to post-graduate training&#151;the importance of the values of the NHS, and to reinforce them. I strongly feel that &#147;out of sight, out of mind&#148; needs to be cleared, and hope the Minister will be prepared to take this on board.</p>

I would also like very strongly to support the point made by my noble friend Lady Emerton. The NHS is dependent on the places where people are educated for the supply of its future staff. Therefore, it becomes absolutely crucial that, right from the day of entry into that educational process, students are viewed as part of the continuing spectrum of the workforce of the NHS. They are the potential workforce. The danger is that those who are organising educational courses can often view something such as the NHS Constitution as something extra that they have to include somewhere in their curriculum, rather than making sure that it is in embedded as a theme running through every aspect of the curriculum. I have seen this in some courses, where new pieces of legislation&#151;and the Mental Capacity Act is one of those&#151;have been added on as if they were bolt-ons, rather than underpinning the way every patient is approached at all times. Therefore, it is important to look at educational provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09042853000028"></a>I turn to the second of these amendments. I fear that if we do not include original research, along with innovation, it risks being divisive. Original research may be the thing that triggers the subsequent innovation, and whoever undertook that deserves to be recognised for the work they did. It is also very evident that some of the more innovative and service-based research is coming from the healthcare professions beyond medicine, which are nursing and the allied healthcare professions. To encourage them to have a research approach, as well as to innovate in their practice, would foster the whole research agenda and drive forward the frontiers

I am particularly sympathetic to Amendment 34 about the prize. Of course, it is an NHS prize, meant for the delivery of innovation in NHS care. Quite whether this is the right amendment to ensure that the right people get prizes for research, or whether it would need to be translational research done within the NHS, I am not sure. But I am very sympathetic to this amendment, even though it may be very difficult in practice to translate that into a part of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09042853000030"></a>The problem with Amendment 6 is that we have a definition of the discharge of NHS functions. Clause 2 relates to the duty to have regard to the NHS Constitution, and states that each of the bodies listed,</p>
<ul><a name="09042853000110"></a>&#147;must, in performing its NHS functions, have regard to the NHS Constitution&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09042853000094"></a>Then an NHS function is described as,</p>
<ul><a name="09042853000111"></a>&#147;the provision, commissioning or regulation of NHS services&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09042853000095"></a>In a way, those bodies are already articulated as to who does provide, commission or regulate services.</p>

<a name="90428-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09042853000031"></a>It all depends on whether or not universities and FE colleges discharge any NHS function by delivering educational services. Legally, they probably do not under the definition included in this part of the Bill. That of course is a pity, because I would particularly like to support the notion of my noble friend Lord Walton and the comments of my noble friend Lady Emerton about the crucial nature of getting the principles of the NHS Constitution into the training of nursing and other professions concerned with medicine, as well as medicine itself. To do that, those principles of care need to go right back to the beginning of training. This would be a marvellous place in the Bill to put that. It is also true that universities should deliver education and research with regard to healthcare.</p>

I am sure that I do not need to remind him of the recent study that showed that it is possible to measure not only the value to people and patients, but the economic value, of medical research, whereby for every &#163;1 that one puts in, one gets &#163;1.39 out in economic terms every

My experience is that healthcare and relevant education is always better provided the more closely integrated the two processes are. I have no doubt about that. This is perhaps less obviously true in times of plenty, but in times of shortage people disappear into their bunkers and silos, and the more that one can do in real and symbolic terms to integrate these two area, the better.

There is a fundamental problem here to which the noble Lord alluded in tactful terms and the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, drew attention to more explicitly. It is that many NHS organisations, if not the majority, do not regard education and training as part of their core business. They may pay lip service to them, they may be able to show that education and training are taking place, but for many organisations whose primary day-to-day preoccupation is to deliver services efficiently and effectively to patients, education and training are not in the forefront of their priorities.</p>

<a name="90428-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09042853000036"></a>Unfortunately, this is particularly true of foundation trusts. There are some notable exceptions to that generalisation which we could all name, but the letter of the law which states that foundation trusts must include education and training as part of their core mission does not tend to occupy centre stage in the deliberations of foundation trust boards. Nor is it something to which Monitor devotes a large amount of attention. I may be wrong in that perception, but there seems to be insufficient accountability for success or failure in this area.</p>

<a name="90428-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09042853000037"></a>We remember all too well what happened in 2006 when the NHS budget came under particularly heavy pressure. Trusts were told that they had to break even or do better, no matter what it took. Surprise, surprise, it was the education budget which was cut quite ruthlessly. I have a figure which came from the <I>Nursing Times</I>, which stated that strategic health authorities skimmed more than &#163;70 million from education and training budgets during 2007-08.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09042853000038"></a>The years ahead are likely to give rise to equal, if not worse, budgetary pressures. The education budget is an easy target, because the general public do not

The training of staff is not something that you can abandon and return to from year to year; it is a long-term enterprise. The universities, whose core business is to deliver training, much of it in collaboration with the health service, are placed in an impossible position if the NHS decides to adopt any sort of stop/go policy.</p>

<a name="90428-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09042853000039"></a>I am told that the problem tends to be worse in trusts that are aspiring to become foundation trusts, because those organisations cut back on their costs to achieve the desired set of financial ratios, and the cutting of costs inevitably means cutting back on people, which in turn impacts directly on supervision ratios at ward level. That kind of economy has an immediate and obvious impact on the quality of training. Anecdotally at least, cuts are said to account for some of the high drop-out rates that there have been in nurse training, for example.</p>

<a name="90428-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09042853000040"></a>Equally, I am told that in primary care the quality of work placements is on the whole poor. Part of the problem is that doctors&#146; surgeries have only a limited physical capacity, but the more fundamental issue is that for primary care practitioners, education is not a core part of their mission. There is no measure which impinges on a service provider for a failure to engage with the next generation of professionals. Yet, in a very real sense, NHS organisations owe it to themselves to be mentors and custodians of the next generation. They also owe it to us as patients, and we need to be very careful that this key function of the health service receives adequate recognition in the way that the NHS Constitution is applied. Those responsible for delivering education and training in healthcare must be held to account for their performance.</p>

In recent years, much more nursing training has been provided outside the NHS. In the olden days, the training was mainly in hospitals, but it is now in many cases quite substantially provided in universities. This leads to the difficulty that has been mentioned about the listed bodies. In Clause 2(2), we have the list of bodies, but what the bodies are to do is told to us in Clause 2(1), which says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="09042853000101"></a>&#147;Each of the bodies listed in subsection (2) must, in performing its NHS functions, have regard to the NHS Constitution&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09042853000096"></a>Clause 2(3) defines what is meant by &#147;NHS function&#148;. It means,</p>
<ul><a name="09042853000112"></a>&#147;any function under an enactment which is a function concerned with or connected to the provision, commissioning or regulation of NHS services&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09042853000043"></a>I am inclined to think that most universities will be under an enactment of some kind. Under that enactment, they are providing education. That would be part of the provision of NHS services, because the education

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09042853000044"></a>As an honorary fellow of some of the medical royal societies, I feel that these societies are in more of a difficulty, because most of them are not governed by an enactment; they are usually set up and governed by royal charter. Certainly, that is my understanding. Therefore, there is some slight technical difficulty about fitting them into the list. I have no doubt that, if the Minister was prepared to agree to accept this in principle, his advisers would quickly put in place the necessary adjustment to take account of it. I just mention it in case it might be overlooked&#151;although I do not think that the Minister would overlook it&#151;or looked on as a fundamental difficulty, because I think that it is a difficulty that can be overcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09042853000045"></a>If the training of staff who are going to be members of the health service is undertaken by institutions other than NHS institutions, it is important that the spirit and ethos of the NHS and its constitution should be ingrained in them as part of the initial training. Therefore, I am strongly in support of Amendment 6. I also support the amendment on innovation, with which I have not noticed any technical difficulty.</p>

I am a university employee and still remain one. I can sympathise with the noble Lords, Lord Walton and Lord Patel, and the noble Baronesses, Lady Emerton and Lady Finlay, who propose that the list of bodies that are under a duty to have regard to the NHS Constitution be extended to include bodies concerned with the education of health professionals and with the support and delivery of medical and scientific research. In addition to this amendment, I understand that the noble Lord believes that it would be appropriate to require the same bodies to be consulted on the 10-yearly review of the constitution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09042853000048"></a>Both research and education are the bedrocks of high-quality patient care. I hope that I can provide noble Lords with reassurances in relation to some of the concerns that have been raised today. First, by way of context, I reassure the noble Lord that education and research are of vital importance to the NHS. In 2009-10, &#163;4.6 billion was allocated to strategic health authorities for education and training, and health research commissioned by the NHS has reached &#163;1 billion for 2010-11. <I>High Quality Care for All</I>, on which I reported in July last year, set out our commitments to the establishment of, for example, academic health science centres, which will bring together a small number of health and academic partners to focus on world-class research, teaching and patient care, bringing the NHS and research ever closer in the history of the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09042853000049"></a>My report also sought closer working between the NHS and education institutions by proposing the creation of new health innovation and education clusters. These announcements will be made soon. These clusters will bring together many partners, across primary, community and secondary care, universities, colleges and industry. Bringing NHS organisations and higher education institutions together will promote learning and education between their members and will enable research findings to be applied more readily in improving patient care.</p>

<a name="90428-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09042853000050"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, raised the issue of NHS budgets. We have on many occasions debated how we protect these budgets and, within the contexts of the health innovation and education clusters, some of the policy reforms that we are introducing will create more transparency. I remember on numerous occasions the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, asking how we protect these budgets. The best way to protect them is to introduce transparency and a tariff system, where a budget will follow a trainee. That is the way in which we hope we will reform our education system, under the guidance and the support of Medical Education England from the medical perspective, and working with nursing colleagues to find a more transparent way in which we can allocate our education and training budgets.</p>

<a name="90428-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09042853000051"></a>On Amendment 6, I would like first to consider the NHS Constitution. The importance that we attach to both education and research is reflected in the third principle in the constitution, which states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24"></a><a name="09042853000102"></a>&#147;The NHS aspires to the highest standards of excellence and professionalism ... in the people it employs and the education, training and development they receive ... and through its commitment to innovation and to the promotion and conduct of research&#148;.</p>

<a name="90428-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09042853000052"></a>In addition, although we have debated whether this amendment is necessary, I have to make the point that all education and training commissioned directly by the NHS is already covered by the legislation as drafted, as the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, pointed out. Strategic health authorities and other NHS organisations will have to have regard to the constitution in everything that they do, including education and training. That should be included in commissioning education and training. However, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, always challenges me when it comes to issues of the law and I take the point that certain colleges, as far as royal charters are concerned, may not be able to do this. I will be more than happy to seek further legal advice and to bring this back when we come to the next phase of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90428-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09042853000053"></a>I turn now to the new bodies concerned with the support and delivery of medical and scientific research. Primary care trusts and other trusts can undertake, commission and assist in research. Any of this research would be captured, I believe, by the duty to have regard to the constitution in Clause 2. The current definition of &#147;NHS function&#148; in Clause 2(3) refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="09042853000113"></a>&#147;any function ... concerned with, or connected to, the provision, commissioning or regulation of NHS services&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09042853000097"></a>I believe that this covers patient-facing research, where patients receiving NHS services are involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09042853000054"></a>On consultation on the constitution on a 10-yearly basis, I again reassure noble Lords that many groups involved with research, training and education of health professionals contributed to the production of the final NHS Constitution, such as the General Medical Council, the Medical Research Council and the Academy of Medical Sciences. Their contributions were valuable and we shall of course wish to involve them in any further changes to the constitution, including the 10-yearly review of the constitution and any more minor revisions, where they are affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09042853000055"></a>I now turn to the innovation prizes and the spirit in which they have been introduced. As I have said in the House before, I strongly believe that these prizes are intended to get the best minds in this country to focus on some of the challenges that will face us in the future, and those challenges will require major breakthrough discoveries. That is what I am referring to in relation to the prizes. I think that the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, mentioned Peter Mansfield, who discovered MRI in 1967 in Nottingham. He was not recognised for his research until 2005, when he won the Nobel Prize. Many such discoveries occurred in this country, and their benefits were translated elsewhere around the globe before they had an impact on our NHS patients. Therefore, the drivers behind the NHS innovation prizes are major breakthroughs and major discoveries.</p>

<a name="90428-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09042853000056"></a>My noble friend referred to innovation prizes and the use of the word &#147;research&#148;. This is a question of semantics. The definition of &#147;innovation&#148; is the successful development and implementation of new ideas, commonly divided into three stages: identification or invention, which is one area that we discussed in relation to research; growth, including adoption, testing and evaluation; and diffusion. However, if noble Lords still believe that we can strengthen the definition, I shall be more than happy to do so. In that respect, I am delighted to report that tomorrow we will be announcing the appointment of Professor Sir John Bell, the president of the Academy of Medical Sciences, as interim chair of the expert panel. I shall be more than happy to discuss the words &#147;research&#148; and &#147;innovation&#148; and to come back to the matter at Third Reading. I think that we all agree about the purpose of these prizes and about the very major role that universities and other higher education providers can play in relation to research.</p>

<a name="90428-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09042853000057"></a>I hope that I have reassured noble Lords that some of their amendments may not be necessary, but I am happy to seek further legal advice in relation to them and to come back at Third Reading.</p>

Despite everything that the noble Lord has said, certain NHS bodies seem reluctant to accept their responsibility in relation to education and research. For example, it has just been pointed out to me that, with regard to training around 95,000 students from this September in nursing, midwifery and the allied healthcare professions, universities have no information about the level of benchmark prizes to be paid by the strategic health authorities, and this is at a time when they are trying to finalise their budgets for the 2009-10 academic and university financial year.

<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09042853000062"></a>In Grand Committee, the Minister indicated in, I thought, a somewhat nonchalant way that there was a well established legal meaning to the phrase &#147;have regard to&#148;. The trouble is that he singularly failed to tell us what that meaning is. Of course, we have all dealt with the phrase in other Bills and usually one can understand perfectly well what it entails. For example, the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 obliges a local authority to have regard to every local improvement target specified in a local area agreement. It is fairly obvious what a local authority should and should not do in compliance with that duty, as it is very specific. The Healthcare Commission had a legal duty to have regard to government policy in exercising its functions. What this meant was very clear: in everything it did, the Healthcare Commission had to bear in mind the Government&#146;s priorities in the delivery of healthcare and, as far as possible, to build those priorities into the ordering of its work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09042853000063"></a>With the NHS Constitution, we have something rather different. The constitution is made up of principles, values, rights, pledges and responsibilities. What does it mean to &#147;have regard to&#148; a set of values or principles? Who can say whether you have succeeded or failed in doing so? How indeed is a patient supposed to know whether a nurse or doctor, or the hospital as a whole, has had regard to them? The answers to these questions are not straightforward. I, for one, do not pretend to know what they are. The plot thickens when we come to consider the rights contained in the constitution. What does it mean to say that an NHS body must merely have regard to a right? The average patient who reads the constitution may well believe that a right is something that is guaranteed.</p>

<a name="90428-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09042853000064"></a>In Grand Committee, I proposed in an amendment that the Government should issue guidance to dispel potential confusion and to ensure that everyone in the NHS, and everyone working on behalf of the NHS, understood what was expected of them. The Minister did not like that idea, and other noble Lords thought that it was unduly bureaucratic. However, if the meaning of the phrase is not explained, there will be only one result, which is a free-for-all across the country in the interpretation that people place on it. If we land up in a situation in which &#147;regard&#148; for a principle or value is interpreted differently in different parts of the health service, that will instantly undermine the credibility of the constitution. It is almost an invitation for someone to issue a challenge via the courts. Who wants that?</p>

<a name="90428-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09042853000065"></a>The Minister needs to realise, as I am sure he does, that the consultation that took place last year on the NHS Constitution raised enormous expectations among NHS staff. Many people genuinely believed that the constitution was to be part of a new way of working in the NHS under which everyone&#151;patients, the public and staff&#151;would know what was expected of them and what they in turn could expect to happen. In the event, the very opposite appears to have occurred. People are confused. It is true, and of course very welcome, that David Nicholson has written to chairs and chief executives with some examples of what they should be doing to fulfil the new duty. However, examples are simply that; there is apparently to be no guidance on how, as a matter of law, the duty to have regard to values, principles and rights should be translated into the day-to-day behaviour of NHS staff.</p>

<a name="90428-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09042853000066"></a>Indeed, we need to ask who is bound by this duty. The Bill says that NHS bodies and organisations are bound by it. Presumably that means that the duty rests on members of the board&#151;the people in ultimate control of the organisation&#151;rather than on each individual member of staff. However, if that interpretation is right, as I believe it is, it will lead to some odd results. The board will be held to account for the way in which it fulfils the legal duty, but the people who actually deliver NHS services will not be bound by it at all. I cannot see the sense of that, nor can I see how it will be workable. How will the average patient understand that distinction?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09042853000067"></a>We heard from the Minister that NHS bodies could fulfil the duty to have regard to the constitution by giving it &#147;proper consideration&#148;. That sounds to me  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_159"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 159</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>very woolly and feeble. It appears to bind an NHS body to do no more than consider what the constitution says before taking a given course of action. That is not much. Equally, I do not think that that is what people either wanted or expected. Most of us would surely wish that, at the very least, the values and principles of the health service could be relied on by patients and staff in virtually all circumstances, that patients&#146; rights could be similarly relied on and that, when someone in the NHS is given a responsibility or a duty, you could take it as read that that person had that responsibility or duty. However, that understanding is, apparently, not correct.</p>

<a name="90428-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09042853000068"></a>Nothing can be taken for granted, because, quite deliberately, the constitution has been given no legal force of its own. In an extreme case, as an aggrieved patient taking an NHS body to court, you could use the constitution only as supporting evidence; you could not cite a breach of it as in itself an infringement of your rights. It is true that some rights within the constitution have a legal basis of their own, but some do not, as the Minister knows, and the task of proving that the NHS had failed to give a value or a principle proper consideration strikes me as being particularly difficult. Again, we need to bear in mind that this could be attempted only by means of judicial review, which is neither easy nor affordable for most people.</p>

<a name="90428-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09042853000069"></a>I am conscious that I have rather laboured this issue and I will now stop, because I should like to hear from other Members of the House and from the Minister, who I hope can throw some brighter shafts of light on to this question than we have had hitherto. I therefore beg to move.</p>

Guidance as to what is meant by &#147;have regard to&#148; would either be extremely brief, or possibly, if it were extensive, a bit confusing, to say the least of it. I do not underestimate the skill in drafting available to the Minister, but I have seen some attempts at this kind of work and they are not always crowned with success.</p>

<a name="90428-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09042853000071"></a>The phrase &#147;have regard to&#148; is, as the Minister said in Grand Committee, a very common phrase. Indeed, my noble friend referred to it being in other statutes. It is a very common phrase in the law and I have been involved in arguing cases and sometimes deciding cases in which it was a crucial phrase. I will not be giving a definitive meaning for it, but I think what, in principle, it means, is that, in making a decision, you take account fully of all the provisions of the document so far as relevant to the issue in hand and you take account of them properly and seriously, not in a dismissive way.</p>

<a name="90428-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09042853000072"></a>On the example about duties, if a document confers a duty or a right&#151;perhaps I should take a right, to simplify matters&#151;if a document confers a right, I would suggest that, if you have proper regard to that document, you give effect to the right, unless there are some over-riding other considerations from other parts of the document which, in effect, reduce or modify the first expression of the right. On the other hand, if it is a value, you conduct yourself in accordance with that  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_160"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 160</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>value and that is what &#147;have regard to&#148; means. It is a compendious phrase with very considerable legal lineage in which it is applied. I do not think there are many cases in which the judges have attempted to say what it means; they know how to apply it. I have tried to summarise what I believe is the way it would apply in this sort of situation. If the Minister is prepared to accept that the Secretary of State will give guidance, I wish him joy in that task.</p>

<p><a name="st_138"></a>
<a name="09042853000073"></a><b><a name="90428-0009.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09042853000141"></a>Baroness Barker:</b> My Lords, I take the opportunity to support the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and to note, as one always should, the words of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern. Far be it from Members of this House to deprive members of the legal profession of a source of income which has been extant for a very, very long time, arguments over the phrase &#147;have regard to&#148; have made many a legal career. I take the point of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, in full part; because I think it would be difficult for a Secretary of State to give a full meaning to that. None the less, this document, this constitution, is going to sit alongside a whole range of other documents of varying degrees of legal importance which medical staff have to bear in mind every day in the course of their duties. I think the noble Earl, Lord Howe, is right to try to establish exactly where it stands in rank of importance, as against other laws and as against statutory guidance as well.</p>

<a name="90428-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09042853000074"></a>It is for the Department of Health to provide assistance to members of staff about how this document will work in practice and what practical difference it will make to their work. The Department of Health has been in this situation before. When the Mental Capacity Act was being argued in Parliament, a great deal of work went on, during the passage of the Bill and subsequently, to try to give examples to practitioners as to what the phrase &#147;best interests&#148; would mean. &#147;Best interests&#148; is, similarly, a legal phrase of some standing and contention, but nevertheless, in order to make what Parliament had passed become a reality for patients, the department did considerable work on that. We can argue about whether this constitution is going to be of the same import as the Mental Capacity Act and the guidance that went with it, but I think the noble Earl, Lord Howe, is to be commended for trying to find an answer to that question, because if he does not, we risk confusing staff when they come to make decisions in practice. The department has a duty to make sure that that does not happen.</p>

<p><a name="st_139"></a>
<a name="09042853000075"></a><b><a name="90428-0009.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09042853000142"></a>Lord Darzi of Denham:</b> My Lords, Amendment 9 would commit the Secretary of State to publishing guidance on the meaning of the term &#147;to have regard&#148;. I understand that the noble Earl is concerned that the NHS will be insufficiently supported in the interpreting of the duty to have regard to the constitution. I should therefore like to reassure noble Lords on this point. The department has already embarked on a programme of work to ensure that the NHS knows what will be expected of it when this duty comes into effect. The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, raised this issue and I hope I can reassure her over some of the activities within the department. First, the department has set up a state of readiness group, involving many important representatives, both from within the NHS&#151;for example,  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_161"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 161</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>SHA chief executives&#151;and from outside&#151;for example, UNISON. The purpose of the group is to understand how to help the NHS to be ready to embed the NHS Constitution and to establish ways of providing assurance that the constitution is taking effect. The group has had its first meeting and will continue to meet until the summer.</p>

<a name="90428-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09042853000076"></a>Another example of the support which the department is providing is a toolkit which will be made available to the NHS imminently. Among other things, the toolkit contains a guide for staff: suggestions about how to incorporate the constitution into organisations&#146; annual reports, information for line managers and induction messages for new staff. These resources will enable the NHS to communicate the importance of the constitution to all staff and to explain what it means for them both as employees and for the way in which they provide care.</p>

<a name="90428-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09042853000077"></a>I am also aware that the noble Earl is concerned that the duty to have regard will mean that the constitution will not have any bite. I therefore remind him that much of the constitution is not new to the NHS. It contains many existing legal rights and where there are new ones, guidance will be published specific to those new rights.</p>

<a name="90428-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09042853000078"></a>I should like to clarify an issue about having regard to a right. A right in the constitution is a legal right; there is no such thing as a right in the constitution which is not underpinned by legislation. Similarly, the pledges reflect good practice and current departmental policy. Many are underpinned by existing performance mechanisms&#151;in other words how we guarantee that these pledges are delivered. They are underpinned by existing performance mechanisms such as the operating framework. There is no possibility of them being ignored.</p>

<a name="90428-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09042853000079"></a>That leaves us with the principles, the values and the responsibilities. As I said, many of the principles are derived from existing legislation and do not represent a new way of working for the NHS. I do not think it would be appropriate to give guidance on how to have regard to the NHS&#146;s values or to patients&#146; responsibilities, for example. In my view, the best guide that the department can give the NHS on what is meant by &#147;having regard to the constitution&#148; is the advice that the chief executive of the NHS has already given in his letter to the chairs and chief executives.</p>

<a name="90428-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09042853000080"></a>I sympathise with the noble Earl in relation to how we make this stronger. To produce formal guidance, as eloquently advised by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, on the meaning of &#147;having regard to the constitution&#148;, the department would have to list every kind of action that an organisation would have to take to demonstrate that it has had regard. Even if I am surrounded by the best brains, I promise noble Lords that we will get this wrong. As I said in Committee, I do not believe that this is possible or appropriate and I will not repeat my comments here. I believe that the guidance is unnecessary from a legal point of view. As we have heard today, &#147;to have regard&#148; is established legal terminology. It has been used, as the noble Earl suggested, in previous health Acts&#151;the Health and Social Care Act 2008, and the Health Act 2006.</p>

<a name="90428-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09042853000081"></a>I sympathise with what the noble Earl is trying to achieve. The challenge in the NHS is how to get the constitution embedded in the mindset of all of us who  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_162"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 162</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>work in the NHS and how to disseminate that information to those who use the NHS. That challenge will be met only with dialogue across the system. I hope that I have reassured the noble Earl enough for him to withdraw the amendment.</p>

My noble and learned friend indicated that it would be very difficult to formulate guidance. I do not doubt that he is right. However, at one and the same time, he had a pretty good shot at framing some of the main points which such guidance might contain. I do not think that it is a totally impossible business. Nevertheless, I recognise its complexity. My noble and learned friend drew out the point that the degree of regard which should be taken of different elements within the constitution changes in accordance with the matter in question. For example, a right is a right, as the Minister pointed out, and it is not enough simply to have regard to it; you have to implement it and honour it. Part of what would be teased out by guidance in the broadest sense is the scope for confusion and settling that.</p>

<a name="90428-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09042853000083"></a>The same applies to values. If one takes two of the values contained in the constitution, respect and dignity, one sees that they are meant to guide the NHS in all that it does. That is what we are told and what we would expect but what does it mean to say that the NHS merely has to have regard to them? Either it has those values or it does not. Equally, if we take the principle that the NHS aspires to the highest standards of excellence and professionalism, what does it mean to say that an NHS body merely has to have regard to that aspiration? Either it aspires to the highest standards of professionalism or it does not. If it does not, in what kinds of circumstances may it not do so? But for my noble and learned friend, those questions would have been left somewhat open by this debate; I think they are less open now than they were. For that, I thank him.</p>

<a name="90428-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09042853000084"></a>The Minister did not cover the issue of staff. Will individual members of staff within NHS bodies be bound by the duty to have regard to the constitution? I am not sure I understood whether I had got it right or not. As the Minister will remember from my opening remarks, I suggested that the Bill should be interpreted as imposing a duty on NHS bodies and organisations; in other words, the boards of those bodies, rather than each and every member of staff. If I am wrong in that I should be very grateful if the Minister would write to me. For now, with thanks to all noble Lords who have taken part in the debate, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Amendments 10 to 14 propose that the Secretary of State is specifically required to consult bodies or persons representing patients, bodies or persons representing staff, carers and local authorities in any 10-yearly review of the constitution. The definition of carers and local authorities is set out. Amendment 17 requires that the Secretary of State explicitly considers the effect of the constitution on carers, in addition to patients, public and staff, during the three-yearly report.</p>

<a name="90428-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09042853000086"></a>In Grand Committee, we had an important debate about the role of carers, local authorities and other bodies in the functioning of the NHS. Many noble Lords spoke to amendments proposing that certain bodies be explicitly consulted during the 10-yearly review of the constitution, and that carers be included in the report on the impact of the constitution. I am grateful to them for their suggestions.</p>

<a name="90428-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09042853000087"></a>As I explained at the time, the Government believe that, as originally drafted, the legislation regarding the 10-yearly review of the constitution captured the bodies mentioned during debate. For example, the duty in Clause 3(5) to consult,</p>
<ul><a name="09042853000114"></a>&#147;such other persons as the Secretary of State considers appropriate&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09042853000098"></a>during the 10-yearly review of the constitution would capture local authorities, and the duties in subsections (3) and (5) to consult &#147;members of the public&#148; would, of course, include carers. I also attempted to reassure noble Lords that, where any revision of the constitution affects certain bodies, it is fully our intent to consult them. Bodies representing patients and staff, carers and local authorities have been, and will remain, vital groups in shaping the constitution and any future changes to it.</p>

<a name="90428-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09042853000088"></a>However, I was struck by the force of argument in Committee and I promised to look again at the drafting of the clauses. I have considered further and am persuaded that there is a strong case for explicit mention of certain bodies in the Bill. It is for those reasons that I have tabled these amendments, proposing that the Secretary of State be explicitly required to consult carers, local authorities and bodies representing patients and staff, and to report on the impact of the constitution on carers.</p>

<a name="90428-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09042853000089"></a>Noble Lords will understand that legislation does not need to list every person and body to be consulted or reported on in detail. Referring to bodies representing staff and bodies representing patients allows us to capture bodies which were also mentioned in Committee, such as Local Involvement Networks, as mentioned by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and trade unions and professional organisations, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours. We believe that these amendments strike the right balance. They ensure that carers and other bodies are represented and must be specifically consulted, while also respecting the concern raised in Committee about listing a large number of organisations in the Bill. I hope noble Lords are content with these amendments. I beg to move.</p>

As the community councils are no more, there is a lack of bodies representing patients, and some patient organisations are very small and may not be able to do this without financial help.</p>

They are entirely appropriate and I am glad that he has taken account of the strength of feeling all around the House. It is entirely right that carers, who are such major providers of healthcare but who also have special health needs themselves because of their caring duties, should be recognised as they are in Amendments 12 and 13. Carers everywhere will be extremely grateful for this recognition of their contribution and status. Amendments 10 and 11 are proof of the Government&#146;s proud record of support for patient-centred organisations; National Voices is only one of them. The NHS is infinitely more patient-focused now than it was 10 years ago, and for that the Government deserve praise.</p>

I know that many of the groups that were active in putting forward amendments would wish us to put their thanks on record, too. Politically, this might be one of the most important parts of the Bill. I suspect that during the next five to 10 years the NHS will go through some major transitions, perhaps the most major in its existence, and that its purpose, scope and nature might become even more hotly contested and debated matters than they are now. It is therefore extremely important that we put in this legislation the right of these people to be involved at the heart of those discussions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09042865000005"></a>I do not wish to be churlish, but can the Minister explicitly assure me that the organisations representing patients in his amendments include former patients and carers of former patients? There persists in the NHS a feeling that all former patients want to complain. I do not think that that is true. Former patients and carers often have valid experiences and they are quite passionate about wanting the NHS to improve. I made the point in Committee and I wonder if it could be included in the reply.</p>

The best learning we can get in the NHS is achieved by consulting former patients. LINks is one of many groups representing patients that might be consulted.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="09042865000192"></a>&#147;Before any revision of the Handbook, the Secretary of State shall consult such persons (if any) as in all the circumstances he may consider appropriate&#148;.</p>

<a name="90428-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09042865000008"></a>With this amendment I bring us back to the issue of who, if anyone, should be consulted when the handbook is revised. As the Bill stands, the Secretary of State may go ahead and revise the handbook without being under a duty to consult anyone at all. In Grand Committee a number of us questioned that. What it means, effectively, is that the Secretary of State has sole power to interpret the constitution as he sees fit. I realise that he would not do that in any way irresponsibly, but it was something that left some of us uncomfortable in the sense that it should be a collaborative process. It also means that those with the closest knowledge of how the constitution works, or should work, in practice have no say at all in the way that the manual to the constitution is drafted. They have no right to make a contribution to that process.</p>

<a name="90428-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09042865000009"></a>That seems, at the very least, short-sighted, but it is also wrong in principle. In reply in Grand Committee, the Minister made two associated points. The first one was that it would not be proportionate for the Secretary of State to have to consult on every minor change which might only be technical. The second one was that if the change was a more significant one relating to a policy issue, the Government would already have consulted on it, so there would be a lot of unnecessary extra bureaucracy if the Secretary of State also had to consult on the change to the handbook which brought the change of policy into play.</p>

<a name="90428-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09042865000010"></a>I understand both those arguments, but I accept the second one only up to a certain point. The purpose of consulting on changes to the handbook is not just to  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_166"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 166</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>obtain people&#146;s views on changes in government policy. It is just as much to ensure that the information in the handbook is accessible, intelligible and workable. The Minister said in our earlier debate:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a><a name="09042865000193"></a>&#147;The intention behind the regular reviews of the handbook is to assess whether the handbook continues to be fit for purpose for patients, public and staff&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 26/2/09; col. GC 155.]</p>

<a name="90428-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09042865000011"></a>If that is so, there is, at the very least, a prima facie case for involving staff, as well as patients and the public, in the review process. After all, there was consultation when the handbook was initially drawn up.</p>

<a name="90428-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09042865000012"></a>I am the first to want to avoid burdening everybody with unnecessary and pointless consultation. No one wants that. But I do suggest to the Minister that, from time to time, there could be a good case for consulting key stakeholders about changes being made to the wording of the handbook. This would not necessarily be when major changes of policy were in prospect, but rather when the practical implications of new or existing policy required explaining in clear and appropriate terms. This is one area of life where I do not believe that the Secretary of State or the Department of Health has a monopoly of wisdom. As it stands, the Bill gives the Secretary of State that monopoly. I, for one, am not comfortable about that, which is why I beg to move.</p>

<a name="09042865000013"></a><b><a name="90428-0010.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09042865000368"></a>Lord Darzi of Denham:</b> My Lords, Amendment 15 proposes that,</p>
<ul><a name="09042865000220"></a>&#147;the Secretary of State shall consult persons ... as in all the circumstances he may consider appropriate&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09042865000167"></a>on any revisions of the handbook. In our previous debate on Amendments 3, 7 and 8, which proposed that bodies be under a duty to have regard to the handbook as well as the constitution, I clarified our intentions behind the purpose and status of the handbook, although I promised that I would look at it again. Just as it would be incongruous to impose a duty on bodies that must have regard to the constitution also to have regard to the handbook, it would be disproportionate to impose a formal duty to consult on any revisions to the handbook. I agree with the noble Earl that any significant changes to policy or law that affect the handbook are likely to trigger consultation requirements in themselves, either by virtue of statute or because there will be an expectation that we should consult or comply with the Government&#146;s code of practice on consultation.</p>

<a name="90428-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09042865000014"></a>For this reason, we have chosen not to oblige the Secretary of State to consult again before amending the handbook, even for significant changes. The Secretary of State may need to make minor technical or legal changes to the handbook at any time to reflect current departmental policy or changes in the law. It certainly would not be proportionate to have to consult on a change of this kind. For the handbook to be useful as an explanatory guide for patients, public and staff, it is important that it should remain a live document that is constantly kept up to date. We want it to be as helpful as possible. A duty to consult on all changes, however minor, would impede this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09042865000015"></a>The intention behind the three-yearly reviews of the handbook is to assess whether it continues to be fit for purpose for patients, public and staff, as we debated in Grand Committee. For these reviews we will, of course, continue to involve on an informal basis those patients, public, staff and other stakeholders&#151;as the noble Earl suggested&#151;who were involved during the development of the handbook. We will do this to ensure that the handbook continues to be a relevant and useful document. This approach has been supported by stakeholders; one example is UNISON.</p>

<a name="90428-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09042865000016"></a>Again, I reassure noble Lords that the constitution cannot be amended via revisions to the handbook. Noble Lords will be aware of our previous debates. We have to ensure that the process for consulting on the constitution is robust. I hope I have reassured noble Lords that while we fully intend to involve patients, public and staff as necessary in each review of the handbook, we do not feel that it is necessary to impose a formal duty on the Secretary of State to do so. Once again, I hope I have reassured the noble Earl and that he will withdraw his amendment.</p>

I reworded the amendment that I tabled in Grand Committee to allow discretion for the Secretary of State not to consult on a particular change to the handbook if, in the circumstances, he felt that it was appropriate. This is not as sweeping an amendment as the one that we debated previously. I come back to the point that we need to bear in mind that the drawing up of the handbook that we have now was the subject of extensive consultation, so it is not altogether anomalous to suggest that revisions should be similarly consulted upon. Nevertheless, this is not a matter that it would be appropriate for me to press. I take note of what the Minister said and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

They were private dwellings and premises to which the public do not normally have access. I undertook to think further about this issue and come back on Report. Following further legal advice I agreed that we need to make the clause more explicit. The new provision would exclude certain premises from the requirement to display a notice. They are premises that the provider does not own or run, such as the patient&#146;s own home; or premises that the provider owns or runs but that patients do not directly access, such as a pathology lab. Our guidance will encourage providers to think about how they will publicise their quality accounts with patients whom they see off-site.

The Minister, if I do not misrepresent him, expressed a good deal of sympathy with the concept of validation, but saw no need to insist on a formal audit as such.</p>

<a name="90428-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09042865000021"></a>I respect the Minister&#146;s point of view, and I do not propose that NHS bodies should be burdened with any additional regulatory requirements. However, I still see accuracy as one of the cornerstones for the success and credibility of quality accounts. My concern has been brought into sharp focus by the recent publication of the Audit Commission&#146;s report on data quality in the NHS, <I>Figures </I><I>Y</I><I>ou </I><I>C</I><I>an </I><I>T</I><I>rust</I>. If noble Lords have not read this report, I respectfully recommend that they do. The Audit Commission&#146;s research&#151;which was partly desk-based and partly involved inspections of several trusts&#151;found that there is, to put it mildly, a great deal of room for improvement in the reliability of NHS data.</p>




<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_169"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 169</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09042865000022"></a>The error rate in clinical coding, for example, ranged from 0.3 per cent to 52 per cent, a range described by the commission as varying from excellent to wholly unacceptable. The average error rate was 9.4 per cent. The commission identified four main factors that it believes lie behind this. One is the training of staff; another is lack of involvement by clinicians; another is a lack of clarity in specific areas of the coding system; and the fourth is the quality of the source documentation and records. The reviews found that although trust boards devoted a significant amount of scrutiny to financial information, there was little evidence that they discussed or challenged the quality of other data. Indeed, the responsibility for quality assurance of data is typically delegated to information managers. The result of that is that many trusts do not have the knowledge or expertise at senior level to challenge the reliability of the data that are submitted to them. Not enough importance is attached to data quality at board level and there are no systematic programmes to enable trust boards to review the accuracy of such data. In general, the need to make sure that information is accurate is not seen as being an organisational responsibility of which everyone in the trust has a duty to take ownership.</p>

<a name="90428-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09042865000023"></a>Against that backdrop, it is not surprising that the commission sounded a warning about quality accounts. It said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a><a name="09042865000201"></a>&#147;If quality accounts are to have the same status as financial accounts and if patients and the public are to have confidence in the data that they contain, the quality of the data should be subject to internal and external review&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09042865000168"></a>That is paragraph 56. It goes on to say that it does not think that this needs to be on the same scale as for financial accounts, which are subject to detailed internal and external audit,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a><a name="09042865000202"></a>&#147;&#147;But we do consider that boards should put in place the kind of assurance programme outlined above and declare in their quality accounts that they have done so&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09042865000169"></a>The assurance programme it refers to is the one currently being piloted in NHS North West for payment by results. There is an obvious read-across here to quality accounts because quality accounts, as the commission points out, will rely on accurate clinical coding and secondary-uses service data.</p>

<a name="90428-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09042865000024"></a>The report usefully suggests that commissioners of NHS care could play a much stronger role in scrutinising information provided to them by trusts, which is surely right. The same applies to strategic health authorities. We need think only of Mid-Staffordshire in that context. It also suggests that regulators have an important part to play in improving data quality in the NHS. The noble Baroness, Lady Young, was very quick to dismiss this idea when we debated it in Grand Committee. I was suggesting then, if noble Lords remember, that the Care Quality Commission should be given the task of auditing the accuracy of a trust&#146;s quality accounts. The noble Baroness did not like that idea at all&#151;and I guess if she does not want to do it, it will not be done&#151;but the suggestion that I made could be finessed if, instead of an audit role, we were to give the CQC the responsibility of assessing at the pre-registration stage how accurate and reliable an NHS body was in collating and analysing the data that it produced for its quality accounts. Competence in that area could be

The amendment I have tabled makes this proposal, and I make it in all seriousness.</p>

<a name="90428-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09042865000025"></a>The importance of data quality in the NHS has never been higher. Leaving aside quality accounts, we have to think only of payment by results and the tariff system. But, at the same time, the problems identified by the Audit Commission could be considerably ameliorated simply by involving and engaging clinicians in the whole process. Generally speaking, that does not happen at the moment because much of the data that are currently collected relate to targets and processes rather than to clinical practice or the quality of care. I am sure the Minister will agree that the closer involvement of clinicians is inherently more likely when quality accounts come on stream because clinicians have a direct interest in making sure that the facts are not misrepresented. At the same time, the commission&#146;s report suggests that if a trust submits poor quality data, there need to be punitive consequences built in to the performance management process. So the answer lies in a top-down as well as a bottom-up series of initiatives.</p>

<a name="90428-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09042865000026"></a>I hope that the Minister will think carefully about these suggestions. I put them forward in a genuinely constructive spirit, although I realise that I may be at risk of being shot down again by the noble Baroness, Lady Young, when she reads <I>Hansard</I>. I hope not. For now, I beg to move.</p>

Of course we want quality in the health service, and there should be some way of measuring the quality of its work, but unless these data are collected properly, unless they are the right data and unless they are properly audited by an independent person or persons, they are not really going to be worth while.</p>

<a name="90428-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09042865000028"></a>Of course, if we are talking about quality, we will have to involve the clinical staff. I am concerned that the clinical staff will be burdened with more bureaucracy and more forms to fill in. Instead of getting together and having proper clinical discussions about how their teams could improve their performances, which is how the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, referred to it when he introduced the subject, forms will be prepared by the department of quality and they will have boxes to tick. It will all descend to that rather banal level. I am very concerned about this. The principle is excellent and it goes without saying that we want quality in the NHS, but I am still totally unconvinced that this will have the right outcome.</p>

As I said in Grand Committee, I share the noble Earl&#146;s view that data used in the preparation of quality accounts should be of the highest standards. The question is how to reach that stage of the highest quality of data. That is where we differ. I believe that the only way in which we will improve the quality of our data is to have clinicians  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_171"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 171</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>taking ownership of the data that they provide and a clear framework of safety, effectiveness and patient experience.</p>

<a name="90428-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09042865000030"></a>I assure noble Lords that one of the most gratifying things about <I>High Quality Care </I><I>f</I><I>or All </I>is that it captures what drives clinicians. Quality is the organising principle of the NHS. We are introducing the process of clinicians taking ownership of the data and publicly reporting them following engagement with the clinical community across the country. The pride of any clinician is to publicly report the data on the care that they provide. I sympathise with the noble Baroness in relation to some of the challenges that measuring and collecting these data may bring. We are strongly encouraging the NHS to appoint further staff to help in the collection of these data and to improve the coding of many procedures and episodes of care that are provided through the NHS.</p>

<a name="90428-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09042865000031"></a>I also believe that we need analytical power, epidemiological support and statistical competencies in the NHS. That is why we will be announcing the creation of 10 quality observatories in the 10 strategic health authorities. The function of these quality observatories will be to collect and analyse these data and, more importantly, to give them weighting against age, social deprivation and the disease entity. The data in themselves need to be refined and analysed before they become useful. The purpose of collecting these data is to empower clinicians to use the measures against the standards in constantly engaging in quality improvement. That is what drives clinicians; that is the movement that we are trying to create on the back of that.</p>

<a name="90428-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09042865000032"></a>The noble Earl mentioned the north-west. He is right that the north-west has started a process of improving the quality of its data by working with external stakeholders. I believe that it has the best data collection system in the country. However, it did that by engaging its clinicians, who took ownership of the data. I suggest to the noble Earl that the NHS collects more data than any other healthcare system, but it does not have ownership of it. That is what will improve the quality. The regulator is not the person to do that, but the clinicians&#151;those who are involved in care.</p>

<a name="90428-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09042865000033"></a>That comes back to the second point raised by the noble Earl in his amendment, on the quality assurance of the data. As I have suggested previously, I strongly believe that commissioners, patient representatives and local communities could and should challenge organisations on the quality of data. The noble Earl also referred to the Audit Commission, which said that commissioners have a strong role in ensuring quality assurance. I will also support that way of ensuring that those who commission the services will, based on the information from the providers, constantly appraise and encourage them to seek that external validation; that is their job, rather than the job of the regulator in the form of the CQC. When the noble Baroness, Lady Young, was concerned about this in Grand Committee, I sympathised with her because the regulator, who is independent, is there to ensure that core standards of care are maintained rather than to assure the data quality. I believe that the commissioners should probably be playing a greater role in that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09042865000034"></a>The noble Earl and I agree on the principles of improving data quality and I hope that I have reassured him that we have policies in which we can, at least, engage clinicians and provide them with the tools to make that happen. I hope that he will, therefore, be able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_161"></a>
<a name="09042865000035"></a><b><a name="90428-0011.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09042865000378"></a>Earl Howe:</b> My Lords, that was a helpful answer from the Minister and I thank him for it. We would all acknowledge that there is good practice, as well as less good practice, in this area, but there are no doubt problems to be addressed. How best do we do that? Part of the answer lies in encouraging accreditation, as I argued in Grand Committee; part of it lies in external review and in performance management. Most of all, however, the answer lies in better collaboration between clinicians, finance officers and business managers, with, as the Minister rightly said, clinicians taking ownership of data. The arrival of quality accounts creates a real opportunity in that sense.</p>

<a name="90428-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09042865000036"></a>Again, however, we should not forget about setting appropriate standards for data quality. The Audit Commission said in paragraph 57 of its report:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a><a name="09042865000203"></a>&#147;Standards used for regulation and registration should include a requirement to ensure the quality of data and to submit accurate information. The current <I>Standards for Better Health</I> omits this. Use and submission of poor quality data should have direct regulatory consequences&#148;.</p>

<a name="90428-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="09042865000037"></a>Therefore, it envisaged the CQC being involved in this area. Clinicians, as the Minister indicated, are likely to take ownership of the raw data for such things as patient outcome and mortality ratios. They are less likely to be closely involved in the statistical analysis of the data, an area where there is scope for things to go awry. We need to be mindful that there is a limit to the extent to which clinicians can oversee everything produced as statistics. Nevertheless, as so often, and in this area above all, I have confidence in the Minister wanting to get things right. I have no doubt that he is doing his level best to ensure that this part of the Bill will result in something that we can all value and be proud of, so I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee has recommended two changes to the Bill. The first relates to the procedure for exercising powers to create secondary legislation relating to quality accounts; the second relates to consultation by the trust special administrator on the draft report. These amendments act on those recommendations.</p>

<a name="90428-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09042865000039"></a>First, on quality accounts, the committee has recommended that the mechanism for exercising the powers in Clause 6(5) be subject to the negative procedure, including the first occasion on which the power is used. The powers in subsection (5) enable the Secretary of State to make regulations to omit prescribed providers  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_173"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 173</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>or providers of prescribed services from the duty to publish a quality account. It would not be desirable to list the providers to be omitted for the time being from the requirement, as the policy with regard to these providers will change over time and the flexibility of secondary legislation is needed to ensure that they can be appropriately included or excluded.</p>

<a name="90428-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09042865000040"></a>We originally considered the affirmative procedure appropriate when the power was first exercised, since the intention is to omit specified providers from the ambit of the duty currently under consideration. The negative procedure was considered appropriate for subsequent amendments to those regulations, since the intention is that the power will, in most cases, then be used to extend the duty to publish quality accounts to those previously excluded. The committee considers that the negative procedure should provide an adequate level of scrutiny even on the first occasion. The regulations will be subject to public consultation before we bring them before Parliament and there remains, of course, the option for the Merits Committee to comment on them and recommend further parliamentary debate as appropriate.</p>

<a name="90428-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09042865000041"></a>On the recommendations relating to trust special administrators, new Section 65H of the National Health Service Act 2006, proposed in Clause 13, requires those administrators to consult certain persons specified in that section&#151;for example, staff and staff representatives&#151;on a draft report. Subsections (7)(c) and (10) of the new section currently permit the Secretary of State to prescribe in regulations additional persons from whom the trust special administrator should request a written response, or with whom they should meet. Amendments 36 and 37 change the mechanisms by which the power is exercised from regulations to directions. Amendment 35 is a technical drafting amendment to bring about consistency in wording.</p>

<a name="90428-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09042865000042"></a>Amendments 36 and 37 are in direct response to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee&#146;s recommendations that the mechanism for exercising the powers relating to consultation by the trust special administrator should be consistent for NHS trusts and PCTs. The committee took the view that parliamentary scrutiny was not necessary, favouring the approach that has been taken for PCTs. I am grateful to the committee for its recommendations and I beg to move.</p>

However, I feel strongly that it is absolutely wrong that people should have to pay a large proportion of their wage in car parking fees, particularly for the more menial tasks for which they get paid in hospitals, such as cleaning floors. This also affects those who arrive at a hospital to attend the accident and emergency department. You may, for example, only have a broken finger and so will put in enough money for the four hours that is meant to be the maximum time before you are seen. However, if it takes a little longer than that, you may get back to your car to find it clamped. As I have said, the main point of the amendment is for the Government to look favourably in particular on lower-paid workers within the National Health Service and those who visit people who are terminally ill or under conditions of accident and emergency. I beg to move.</p>

I wish to give him some support, although I have no doubt that the Government will not. I know that the Scottish Executive have introduced measures of this kind; indeed, they have gone further and are bringing in measures to stop hospitals raising revenue from car parks. The amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, does not go that far.</p>

<a name="90428-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="09042865000045"></a>I support the noble Lord&#146;s amendment for two reasons. First, members of the public are angered beyond measure because they believe that they have no choice in many cases other than to take private transport to hospitals, when they are put in a situation where the NHS is making money from their disadvantage.</p>

<a name="90428-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09042865000046"></a>The amendment is important, secondly, because there are some patients for whom car parking fees at hospital are detrimental to their healthcare. Many years ago, when I worked in Age Concern, we did a study on non-emergency patient transport, which in those days was being cut back so severely that many older people were forced to make private arrangements to go to hospital. We called our report <I>A Helicopter Would Be Nice</I>, because that is what one of the people said to us. We found older people not going to hospital for appointments that they needed until they could arrange for their relatives to fly back from abroad to take them, or until they could rely on neighbours to take them. Time and again in our research, the stress of car parking and of taking people to hospital and having to run in and out of A&amp;E departments to make sure that the parking meter was topped up came through as something that was not conducive to older people&#146;s health and well-being.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09042865000047"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Palmer, has in a limited way hit on a big problem, which the NHS has a duty at least to examine. If all that it does is come clean about the amount of money that it is making from car parking, it would be a great step forward.</p>

A car park at a hospital is really an ancillary service. People do not go to the hospital for the sake of entertainment or anything of that kind; they go for the sake of receiving a service in the hospital. I commend to the noble Lord the good example north of the border, where, apart from in public/private partnerships, the Government have abolished car parking charges in the hospitals under their control. That is an example that would be well followed.</p>

<p><a name="st_169"></a>

The idea has merit and should be given consideration, but it ought to be covered in guidance and offered as an example of an issue that could be of local concern. This would achieve the best fit with the way in which quality accounts are being designed, assuming that the noble Lord&#146;s intention is that the duty should form part of a quality account.</p>

<a name="90428-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09042865000050"></a>If providers wish to talk about car parking charges from a patient experience point of view, they are free to do so. I strongly encourage providers to do that, because it is clearly an issue of concern. I shall not try to address the comments of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, in relation to contrasting policies on charging north of the border and in England, because I am sure that we shall have opportunities to debate it. However, the matter is of concern to patients and it should be reflected through the patient experience matrix that we are developing with the health service. One&#146;s experience in a hospital is not purely one&#146;s experience in a ward or that of the care that one receives from a surgeon; it also includes one&#146;s experience of the environment and the car park facilities that might be available, as well as the costs associated with it. We updated the guidance on car parking charges in November 2008 and I shall be more than happy to send copies to noble Lords.</p>

<a name="90428-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09042865000051"></a>I reassure noble Lords that the income generated from car parking charges must be used to improve health services within a trust. It does not leave the trust; that is an important point to make. The whole process of designing quality accounts should be inclusive. Ideas must come from the front line, which includes patients, user groups and others at a local level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09042865000052"></a>I hope that I have reassured the noble Lord that it is our intention to measure all aspects of experience.

If the noble Lord feels that I have addressed some of his concerns, I hope that that will give him the opportunity to withdraw his amendment.</p>

The fact that people who earn not very much over and above the minimum wage have to spend a vast proportion of their income to park their cars is of great concern.

The UN was created on 24 October 1945 with a commitment from 50 founding members to provide a strong body with power to provide a forum for debate and resolution to preserve the peace. The role of the United Nations has developed and diversified in the 63 years since its inception, yet many of the founding challenges remain.</p>

<a name="90428-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09042865000057"></a>The horrors that confronted the Allied and Red armies in eastern Europe motivated the founding members of the United Nations to make it much more powerful than the League of Nations. It was given the organs and strength to go further than simply preventing war. It is perhaps in this realm of world health and the codification of human rights where the UN has had its most impressive and unique successes.</p>

<a name="90428-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09042865000058"></a>As problematic as it may be to conceive of a world where the United Nations had not been created, it is equally difficult to imagine that so much would have been achieved in these areas without the work of those who have so generously served under its name. A World Health Organisation programme eradicated smallpox. UN awareness campaigns limited the scourge of landmines, HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09042865000059"></a>Despite its varied and historic achievements, the central organ of the United Nations&#151;the Security Council&#151;is in a state of near total paralysis, perennially handicapped by its inability to deliver in the face of  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_177"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 177</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>adversity. In pursuit of two of its central goals, the maintenance of international peace and security and the protection of human rights, the UN has fallen short of its establishing ideals.</p>

<a name="90428-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09042865000060"></a>When the United Nations was conceived, the shadow of the horrors of World War II still loomed large, not least the collective shame of the international community on discovering the fate of so many in Auschwitz, Belsen and beyond. Yet just half a century later in Rwanda, more than 800,000 people were murdered with nothing more sophisticated than a machete, for nothing more arbitrary than their ancestry. Soldiers wearing the blue beret of the UN peacekeepers were forced to stand by as Tutsi men, women and children were barbarically slaughtered.</p>

<a name="90428-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09042865000061"></a>Without the mettle, legitimacy or support to act, these peacekeeping actions have even served to worsen the suffering. UN troops with flimsy rules of engagement were used as a human shield while nearly 8,000 Muslim men and boys were ethically cleansed in Srebrenica. Even today in Darfur, essentially the same things are happening with the same wretched and feeble response from the international community. More could&#151;and should&#151;be done. The UN can go some way to addressing this dire need. With these stark and harrowing examples I seek not to shock or appal but to say that we could and should have done better.</p>

<a name="90428-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09042865000062"></a>We in the United Kingdom must accept our share of responsibility for these failings and ensure that we help to create a United Nations with the funding, structures, transparency and legitimacy to act where it has so painfully failed in the past, a UN whose actions are more than just an amalgamation of the interests of the United States, China, Russia, France and the United Kingdom, and one whose response is not muted and activity not hindered by a structure so spectacularly out of step with a globalised and independent world. While disputes and hostilities are invariably complex and contradictory, surely giving the United Nations the tools to act is much more agreeable than simply looking on as lives are extinguished on an unimaginably horrific scale.</p>

<a name="90428-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09042865000063"></a>In 1993, the UN General Assembly established an open-ended working group on Security Council reform. The commitment to change was reaffirmed in the millennium development goals but the status quo persists. It is absurd in the multi-polar world of the 21st century that the power of the United Nations is concentrated in the hands of the victors of World War II. Is it not preposterous that Africa and South America, together representing more than 23 per cent of the world&#146;s population, have no permanent representation on the UN Security Council? Many of the conflicts and humanitarian crises that persist today stem from the post-colonial legacy of failed states in Africa, yet they have no voice at the table&#151;an oversight, perhaps.</p>

<a name="90428-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09042865000064"></a>The United Nations has often been accused of acting only in the interests of its most powerful participant. In recent years, that has been the United States, using the UN to gain legitimacy where it could, acting unilaterally where it could not. Over the next 20 years, many believe that the role of chief puppeteer will fall to China. We are at a crossroads where the opportunity to change and enhance the UN sits comfortably with  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_178"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 178</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>our own national interests. This, perhaps more than any other reason, defines why we should act now in pursuing genuine and systemic change at the UN.</p>

<a name="90428-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09042865000065"></a>As it did with the creation of the United Nations, the UK should be taking a lead with reform. We need carefully to consider what changes we support to make the United Nations a more effective body. Failure to effect meaningful change would only serve to betray those who fought so fiercely to provide us with a seat at the table. The UK Government&#146;s current position is support for the expansion of the Security Council to include Brazil, Germany, India, Japan and African representation.</p>

<a name="90428-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09042865000066"></a>In a world of failed states and terrorist threats, it is almost inconceivable that the United Nations continues to concentrate its power in the permanent five, veto-holding powers. Britain is almost uniquely placed among the 192 member states of the UN to take the lead in redressing this asymmetric balance of power. Could we not be bold and cede our right to the veto in exchange for a genuine and far-reaching transformation? One could argue that we would gain influence and achieve more in forgoing our veto and supporting expansion than by maintaining the existing norms.</p>

<a name="90428-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09042865000067"></a>Maybe relinquishing the veto would be too hard a pill to swallow but we could make the Security Council more effective by limiting its use. This could be achieved through a number of strategies from unilateral action to institutional change. All too often the paralysis which befalls the Security Council is the result of one of the P5 vetoing a resolution supported by the rest of its members. One viable proposal is to change the influence of the veto by insisting that no single member of the P5 could unilaterally veto a resolution supported by the remaining four. No single power could continually act as a wrecking ball against the consensus of the wider international community, thereby freeing the Security Council to consolidate its primacy as the authoritative body in maintaining international peace and security.</p>

<a name="90428-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09042865000068"></a>The United Kingdom is currently the fourth largest contributor of UN funding, supplying just over 6.6 per cent of the regular budget. Yet the United Nations is chronically under-funded, hindered not least by the failure of some of the world&#146;s richest nations to pay their share. Although a difficult argument to win in our current economic crisis, we should consider the implications of pressure on this budget and look closely at the need to expand it. Money alone will not be the solution to the UN&#146;s ills but we cannot continue to expect it to achieve more while we starve it of funding.</p>

<a name="90428-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09042865000069"></a>One of the useful things additional funds could pay for is a permanent secretariat for the Security Council. I believe we could instil within it an institutional memory, making more effective the contribution of those elected members.</p>

To have a debate on the United Nations with the participation of the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, and a response from the noble Lord, Lord Malloch-Brown, as the Minister, is just another example of that marvellous opportunity.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90428-0012.htm"/>


<a name="90428-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09042865000072"></a>The preamble to the charter of the United Nations talks about it being an organisation, but I remember some years ago speaking with an old friend, Ahmad Kamal, who was the ambassador of Pakistan to the United Nations for about 17 years and who told me that the United Nations was not an organisation but a table&#151;a place where people meet and talk about things. I think that what he meant was that there are many of the attributes of an organisation that the United Nations does not have. The United Nations has moral authority but for the authority of its decisions it has to resort to the sovereign states&#151;particularly the permanent five and the other members of the Security Council. The noble Baroness mentioned the problem of resources. It is a question not just of financial resources but of resources of people. For military resources and peacekeeping operations, the United Nations is dependent on states agreeing, first, to stump up with the numbers and, secondly, producing the numbers that they undertake to provide in due time and with appropriate quality. On implementation, it is not as in a national situation when one can implement laws and depend on the administration of justice from the police and the courts to ensure that they are implemented. Many decisions are taken by the United Nations and it proves impossible to implement them; sometimes repeated decisions are made about various parts of the world and it proves impossible to take them very much further. These are difficult problems.</p>

<a name="90428-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09042865000073"></a>One outcome of the United Nations being a table, rather than an organisation, is that it has gradually lost vigour and momentum over the years. If one looks back at the vision of the person who will, I suppose, not be disputed as the greatest of the Secretary-Generals, Dag Hammarskjold, one sees that he brought with him a great conviction and passion for peace and a different world. To some extent that has fallen foul of national interests rather than what the charter calls common interests. As a country, we find ourselves probably better at instituting wars and military operations than in instituting peacekeeping forces backed by the tremendous experience of our military and focusing sometimes more on the technology of military operations than on the capacities of our people. We have also failed to capitalise fully on the remarkable network of relationships in the Commonwealth, which is exemplified fully in the United Nations, not only by smaller countries but by powerful countries such as Canada, India, Australia and South Africa.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="09042865000074"></a>I shall listen with great interest to what noble Lords say, with their experience, but I hope that we see more vigour on the part of our Government in this regard.</p>

<a name="90428-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="09042865000076"></a>The preamble is wonderful&#151;as relevant and eloquent today as ever. The UN, through its agencies for economic, social and humanitarian work, has pioneered the transition from peacekeeping to peacebuilding, and confidence in the UN must be strengthened if that vital work is not to be undermined. It must be tempting for Governments to let the bureaucracy hold sway and avoid sensitivities. I am glad that the UK Government have shown that they rate the UN as sufficiently important to take an initiative to find ways in which to make it more effective, but I am disappointed that they have not been brave enough to follow that through.</p>

<a name="90428-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="09042865000077"></a>The initiative to which I refer is the 2006 report called <I>Delivering As One</I>. It would be a wasted opportunity if it stayed on the shelf instead of being the catalyst for reform. My frustration echoes that of the distinguished former UN under-secretary, Dame Margaret Anstee, who has pointed out that the report is very similar to the capacity review that she co-authored with the late Sir Robert Jackson in 1968. There was no action then and there has been none now.</p>

<a name="90428-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="09042865000078"></a>Dame Margaret proposes three reforms that I endorse; together they would help to reinvigorate the leadership and quality of governance at the UN. First, the way in which the Secretary-General and all the DGs are appointed should change. No large multinational company would recruit its chief executive without a systematic and professional global search. Political criteria are bound to be relevant, but so are international track record and stature. Secondly, and also in line with good governance, there should be a maximum fixed term with no further re-election for these most senior appointments. Thirdly, there should be a unified budget for all the agencies, to eliminate duplication and improve value for money.</p>

<a name="90428-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="09042865000079"></a>These proposals are well known, but my understanding is that the Government are reluctant to push them, or any of the others from the <I>Delivering As One</I> report, because certain countries might misconstrue a UK initiative. But fear of being misinterpreted is a weak basis for inaction; why not just take the extra care to explain, show leadership and spell out what all Governments have to gain? These are fairly obvious reforms, but they have become too hot to handle, as if their supporters were naive idealists rather than highly experienced and knowledgeable people such as Dame Margaret Anstee. I hope that the Minister will be brave enough to persuade the Government and then a critical mass of other Governments that, if the UN is needed, not just as a wonderful idea but with the capacity and reputation to deliver on the promise of its preamble, these reforms are an essential starting point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="09042865000081"></a>There has been a change in the nature of conflicts around the world. Internal conflicts have in many instances replaced conflicts between states, and civilians now make up the vast majority of casualties. The genocides in Cambodia, Rwanda and Bosnia as well as the crimes against humanity in Kosovo, East Timor  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_181"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 181</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and Darfur, have demonstrated massive failures by the international community to prevent atrocities. That is why I was so delighted when in 2005 world leaders endorsed a new doctrine for the UN&#151;the responsibility to protect&#151;which is designed to provide a moral and legal framework for the international community to respond to mass atrocities. This means that if a state defaults on its responsibility to protect its citizens, the international community would assume the responsibility collectively. The notion that the international community has a responsibility to protect entails three distinct yet related commitments&#151;a responsibility to prevent, to react and to rebuild. But by far the most controversial element of the doctrine is the idea that military force should on occasion be used to protect civilians. That amounts to a new take on a very old and divisive issue&#151;humanitarian intervention.</p>

<a name="90428-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="09042865000082"></a>In recent years, there have been many debates and discussions about the application of responsibility to protect in relation to, for example, Zimbabwe and Burma. However, I should like to focus on Sri Lanka. I am puzzled at the lack of action from the UN in the context of responsibility to protect. Just last week the International Crisis Group talked of the humanitarian tragedy unfolding in Sri Lanka. The International Committee of the Red Cross has warned that,</p>
<ul><a name="09042865000221"></a>&#147;conflict parties must take immediate action to prevent further mass casualties among civilians&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09042865000170"></a>Members of the International Advisory Board of the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect have urged the Security Council to uphold the responsibility to protect 100,000 civilians at risk of mass atrocities in northern Sri Lanka. It states, of the responsibility to protect:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a><a name="09042865000210"></a>&#147;At the core ... is the obligation to act preventively to protect peoples from genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing, rather than waiting until atrocities have already occurred, as states have too often done in the past&#148;.</p>

<a name="90428-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="09042865000083"></a>I agree with my noble friend Lady Howells that we need to strengthen the UN. We need to enable it to act responsibly, and intervene in urgent humanitarian situations. The responsibility to protect goes some way towards doing that, which is why I ask the Minister why the UN has not taken action in Sri Lanka.</p>

We are perhaps celebrating the first meeting of the United Nations in San Francisco; but let us not forget that it was across the road from here, in the Methodist Central Hall in Westminster, that the first gathering was held a month or two before. We have spoken of the way that nations have developed and changed their approaches because of the UN. There are now 192 member nations.

<p><a name="09042865000172"></a>Is the United Kingdom taking the lead in building up the work and effectiveness of the UN? We sometimes criticise and condemn the actions of other nations, but the UN&#146;s strength depends on all member states being able to discuss, sign, ratify and implement conventions. The last time I brought up this subject, some time ago, I was told that there were 630 treaties and conventions, of which 156 had not been signed or ratified by the United Kingdom. Has the situation changed since then? These are treaties and conventions by which, it is said,</p>
<ul><a name="09042865000224"></a>&#147;the United Kingdom has not consented to be bound&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09042865000173"></a>We are talking about a quarter of the total. Has the situation improved since then? Are we implementing in full the charter on the rights of the child, or the convention on trafficking? These things are so important.</p>

<a name="90428-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="09042865000086"></a>Finally, the action of individual nations within their own borders affects their standing as good neighbours, and the dignity and worth of the individual. I have previously raised the desperate state of failed asylum-seekers under the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants) Act 2004. Whatever the Government&#146;s intention was, these people are driven to destitution when their benefits are withdrawn. Is that being thought of in the context of the United Nations preamble? There is also the situation of migrants. There is no time this evening to discuss this, but I have seen them. They are penniless, homeless and in this country. Life is desperate for them. I ask the Minister&#151;I know that his heart and mine often beat to the same rhythm&#151;whether we cannot somehow make the life of individuals more in tune with the preamble to the charter of the United Nations.</p>

It is also timely to be reminded of how far short we still fall when it comes to fulfilling those commitments, which have since been accepted by nearly 150 new states in addition to the original signatories. It is in that spirit, and having declared an interest as chair of the UNA association of the UK, that I welcome and participate in this short debate.</p>

<a name="90428-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="09042865000088"></a>Are the charter and its preamble still fit for purpose? With one exception&#151;the composition of the Security Council&#151;I would answer that question in the affirmative. We need to face the inconvenient truth that, if the 192 members of the UN were to sit down today to rewrite parts of the charter, they would be unlikely to produce anything so crisp, clear and to the point as the original. So despite all the compelling arguments for amendment, I would urge that we forswear that route.</p>

<a name="90428-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="09042865000089"></a>The one exception, Security Council enlargement, is now long overdue. The high road to enlargement and inclusion of new permanent members seems as firmly blocked as ever. That leaves the other road identified by the high-level panel on UN reform, on which I had the honour to serve: the creation of a new category of longer-term renewable seats to reflect better the regional balance of our own days. It is encouraging that the Government are pushing in that direction. They will need much patience and perseverance

They will also need to avoid overrating our own fairly modest ability to move things on.</p>

<a name="90428-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="09042865000090"></a>The main changes needed, if we are to act more effectively in accordance with the objectives of the charter and its preamble, lie outside charter amendment. I suggest three priorities. First, now that we have finally and belatedly got rid of regional pre-emption for the posts of Director General of the IMF and the World Bank, is it not high time that we did likewise for the post of Secretary-General of the UN? I am not so naive as to suppose that we can, or should try to, eliminate any element of regional rotation from appointments to that post; but surely we need to remove the degree of pre-emption that results in only candidates from one region being put forward at the outset, thus damagingly narrowing the field.</p>

<a name="90428-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="09042865000091"></a>Secondly, we need to strengthen the UN and regional peacekeeping, both of which are under greater stress because they are in greater demand than ever. What is the Government&#146;s response going to be to the recommendations of the Prodi report? Will they accept the proposals that regional peacekeeping operations, particularly those mounted by the African Union, should on a case-by-case basis be financed on the assessed contributions of the whole membership?</p>

<a name="90428-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="09042865000092"></a>Thirdly, the recent report of the Secretary-General on the responsibility to protect, based on the work of his special adviser, Professor Ed Luck, is a reminder of how far we still are from operationalising that new concept. What is the Government&#146;s reaction to that report; and, if they are in broad agreement with it, how do they propose to move away from a sterile debate almost exclusively about the pros and cons of military intervention in failed or failing states, unable to protect their own citizens, towards a multifaceted approach designed to prevent states from getting into that condition in the first place?</p>

<a name="90428-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="09042865000093"></a>This debate demonstrates what an essential part of any reformed international architecture the UN continues to be; and also how far we are from maximising the benefits that the international community could derive from the fully functioning organisation envisaged in the preamble to its charter. We have a UN that is both indispensable and ineffective, and we need to move on.</p>

I thank my noble friend for giving us the opportunity of this debate and for the powerful introduction that she gave us to her reflections. She concentrated to some extent on reform of the Security Council, and she is right. We simply cannot go into the 21st century with a Security Council based on what was appropriate in 1945. It has to match the challenges of the century in which we are living.</p>

<a name="90428-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="09042865000095"></a>My noble friend also referred to resources for the Security Council. I remember a previous Secretary-General saying on one occasion that when he was analysing the kind of crises that confronted us, he  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_184"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 184</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>found it immensely difficult that he was utterly dependent on intelligence provided to him by the permanent members of the Security Council at their discretion. He did not have an independent intelligence system at his disposal by which he could make his own judgments. My noble friend's proposal for a permanent secretariat for the Security Council is a first-class proposition which deserves fuller consideration.</p>

<a name="90428-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="09042865000096"></a>If the UN did not exist&#151;it is easy to say this, but it is true&#151;it would be essential at this juncture to invent it. The sense of exclusion and exasperation among millions of people in the world because they are not able to participate in the decision-making processes of the world cannot be overestimated. Many men and women just like us with the same aspirations as us are absolutely fed up with being told in effect that they have to be managed by a self-appointed elite in the international community. It is therefore essential that we have somewhere in the world system a place where the world can come together and demand accountability from those who have greater power than the others.</p>

<a name="90428-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="09042865000097"></a>It is also essential to re-examine the concept of security itself. Traditional concepts of security do not suffice. We have to look at the matrix that makes up the security challenge&#151;the economic issues, health issues, environmental issues, issues of climate, issues of terrorism and issues of human rights. On financial issues, it may well be said that the UN is not the appropriate body to manage the multilateral financial institutions of the world. That might be so, but it is essential for some way to be found for those bodies to play into the deliberations of the Security Council if we are to have a sane approach to managing the security of the world.</p>

<a name="90428-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="09042865000098"></a>Finally, there has been reference to the charter. The charter emphasised people. People are now looking for an opportunity to be heard. We cannot impose security; we have to build it. That means having global forums where the world can speak.</p>

That must explain why the second objective of the UN charter was,</p>
<ul><a name="09042865000225"></a>&#147;to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="09042865000100"></a>It is easy for people to criticise the UN when they think of the outrage of poverty, child labour and the depths to which human beings have to sink to survive, and of our collective inability to change even the worst aspects of the way in which we live. But this country has a good record at the UN. The Government have not only met aid targets, they have made notable and specific contributions to the workings of the UN. British NGOs have also made their mark going back to Eglantyne Jebb&#146;s work for Save the Children 85 years ago when she persuaded the League of Nations to adopt the first Declaration of the Rights of the Child.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="09042865000101"></a>The UK was among those states that established the new Human Rights Council following the 2005 summit and the report of the high-level panel, and it was a UK initiative that in September 2007 established the Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Slavery. I have seen at first hand the extraordinary success of the UN in post-conflict countries such as Nepal, where the UK has also played a leading role.</p>

<a name="90428-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="09042865000102"></a>Human rights, especially the rights of minorities, are arguably the UN's biggest headache. Membership of the old commission was a constant source of internal rows and an embarrassment to the secretariat. That was one of the concerns of the high-level panel which said that membership,</p>
<ul><a name="09042865000226"></a>&#147;has become a source of heated international tension, with no positive impact on human rights and a negative impact on the work of the commission&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09042865000175"></a>Accordingly, it recommended a number of changes, most of which the UN subsequently adopted. The council now has 47 elected member states and, through the universal periodic review, it somehow manages to examine the human rights obligations of all UN member states. It may be that the machinery at the UN is improving. But human rights will remain a highly politicised area of the UN, and the issue could still encourage more fragmentation than consensus. Does the Minister consider that the new Human Rights Council is more effective than the old, and that it has fully met the concerns of the high-level panel about membership?</p>

<a name="90428-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="09042865000103"></a>Finally, the Minister will know that there is a UN voluntary trust fund on contemporary forms of slavery which provides direct assistance to victims of slavery and trafficking. Can he confirm that the UK last supported this fund in 2003, and that the Government intend to support it again this year, six years later?</p>

We all recognise that the UN system&#151;and it is very much a system whose specialisations are increasingly important&#151;is necessary but imperfect. It would be wonderful if we could redesign it from the outset, but we cannot. We therefore have to work as well as we can within this deeply imperfect system. With 192 members of the General Assembly and specialised agencies, it clearly is deeply imperfect. It includes some small, corrupt and, sadly, incompetent states. I only discovered that Palau existed when I read about its existence in the UN voting list.</p>

<a name="90428-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="09042865000105"></a>We have, therefore, to work on an expanded agenda of global governance with instruments which are deeply inadequate. This includes the whole new security agenda, for which we need global governance. It includes population growth&#151;population has more than doubled since the UN was formed. That means migration, it means social collapse and it means internal conflict. The whole climate change agenda is desperately central, as are the communications revolution and all the implications of that and the scientific and technical revolution, which has all sorts of implications, including those for the disarmament agenda. There is also the question of culture and civilisation. I note that President Obama spoke at an Alliance of Civilisations conference only the other week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="09042865000106"></a>What, therefore, are the principles with which we have to deal? First, we have to cling to the idea of inclusive global organisations, not exclusive global organisations. The whole concept of an alliance of democracies, instead of a global organisation, is something that we should reject. I was rather worried the other week when I read the Henry Jackson Society&#146;s list of principles and saw that an alliance of democracies was one of the things that it still wished to promote. The Bush Administration were exclusive. Happily, the Obama Administration are now re-engaging.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="09042865000107"></a>The obstacles to the reform of the UN Security Council remain high, so we have to work as far as we can with ad hoc bodies. Perhaps the G20 is an ad hoc body which will work for a bit; at least we have to try it. We have to re-engage with China, India, South Africa and others, and I note that, at the moment, China, India and South Africa all have more troops engaged in UN or African Union peacekeeping than the United Kingdom does. So we really need to co-opt them to work with us as far as we can.</p>

If we cannot co-operate with our neighbours, we certainly cannot co-operate with others around the world. Secondly, we need political leadership for popular education to explain to our publics why sovereignty does not work anymore. I simply end by saying to my colleagues on the Conservative benches as well as to the Government: we all need to explain to our publics how desperately we need stronger global and regional co-operation.</p>

The UN is falling short; the core of it does need reform; it is spectacularly out of step, as she says, and far-reaching transformation is needed. The irony is that successive Secretaries-General have called for reform to come again and again, when people have sincerely wanted reform, but it has not happened. Frankly, it is ridiculous that Japan and Germany and India and Brazil should not now be permanent members of the UN Security Council. Japan and Germany are the second and third largest funders of the United Nations, and Japan pays one fifth of all peacekeeping operations of the UN. It is extraordinary that they are still excluded.</p>

I agree with the noble Lord and I love his phrase &#147;indispensable but ineffective&#148;, which just about sums up the position. The same could be said of many other 20th-century institutions, in fact the whole architecture of the 20th century, which includes NATO, the IMF which has entirely the wrong weighting, the World Trade Organisation which is running out of steam, the nuclear proliferation or NPT regime which needs revising, and indeed the European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="09042865000112"></a>We expect much too much of the United Nations. Our hopes become almost overweighed in favour of the belief that the United Nations, by talking and gathering together, can solve all the world&#146;s problems. It cannot be done in that centralised way. We need new platforms and new networks in a totally transformed global situation. I was glad to hear the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, in particular, say that the Commonwealth had a key part to play in this. When it comes to, as the noble Lord, Lord Judd, said, allowing the people of smaller and deprived nations to feel that they have a part to play, it is organisations such as the Commonwealth that are bound to give a supplementary role to what can be provided in the enormous and sometimes remote United Nations with its 181 members, or whatever the number is, where voices tend to be drowned in the higher babble of the whole organisation.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a><a name="09042865000211"></a>&#147;The globalization now taking place requires a profoundly renewed concept of the State. Between the isolated individual and the world there must be an intermediate element. This element is the State and national sovereignty. They respond to the needs of all human beings for identification. In a world both impersonal and fragmented such a need is greater than it has ever been in history&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09042865000176"></a>That Secretary-General put his finger on the fundamental need for a balance between the great UN forum, which has its part to play, and the needs of national identity and the nation states, which will be the most creative network of the 21st century. Boutros Boutros Ghali was one of the best Secretaries-General that the United Nations has had; of course, they refused him a second term.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="09042865000116"></a>The fact that the most world-weary group of statesmen, and sometimes women, that the 20th century saw, the Allies who had prevailed in that most brutal and extended of wars, the Second World War, could have come together to form the United Nations and write that charter should give us pause, because the case is made frequently that somehow it was a nave undertaking. We forget that these were men who had not just seen the horrors of the Holocaust and the brutality of a global war, but remembered very acutely and recently the failure of the League of Nations. They drew up this charter, not in a spirit of nave hope that somehow humankind was to reform its character and that good would prevail over evil for ever after, but much more in a spirit of realism. This global world that we were embarking on was one where no country alone could exercise an imperial-like control over forces of law and order, or provide security or leadership to the world.</p>

<a name="90428-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="09042865000117"></a>For President Roosevelt, and for President Truman who followed him, the United Nations was an exercise in collective security, where the burden of being the world&#146;s policeman would be shared by the United States, the great victor of the Second World War, both with its allies in that war and more broadly with the rest of the world. This was, if you like, global order on the cheap. The United States did not expect that it would step up to the plate to replace the old colonial powers in some system of direct rule over large parts of the world. Rather, through the charter of the United Nations and the institutions created under it, it hoped that collective security would prevent another world war, that the promotion of economic and social development would liberate hundreds of millions&#151;and, later, billions&#151;from the condition of poverty to which they had been assigned, and that the promotion of the values for which the war was fought&#151;the values of democracy and human rights&#151;would be secured.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="09042865000118"></a>Many years later, when working for Kofi Annan, the previous Secretary-General, we thought of how we might renew this organisation. The Secretary-General commissioned vital reports, including that on the reform of the UN security arrangements, in which the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, participated. It seemed to the Secretary-General that he could do no better than reconfirm the three basic, original principles of the organisation; that it is should have three pillars. One was a peace and security pillar. The second was a development and humanitarian pillar. The third was a human rights and democracy pillar. We saw it as a three-legged stool. You could not have security without democracy and human rights, just as you could not have development without security, nor security without development and human rights. In other words, each of these goals and objectives was dependent not only on its own achievement but on the achievement of the other two as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="09042865000119"></a>I believe that this is an enormously important point about the UN. People tend to select the goal they prefer, be it human rights, development or security.

The security one is about collective security. It is about how we defend our countries as the nature of warfare changes, as terrorism and asymmetrical conflict, with the targeting of civilians, breaks down the traditions of war between states and introduces new and often more deadly forms of conflict. It is about how we mutually deploy armed force to address these threats and how we protect the sovereignty of nations from overbearing neighbours or from attack from within.</p>

<a name="90428-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="09042865000120"></a>The second goal, the goal of development, is one which calls forth, if you like, a more apparently liberal doctrine of how we emancipate and liberate people from poverty, inequality and from the marginalisation that comes from being born into a certain class, caste or race. This third goal, of human rights and democracy, often seems the most elusive, the most nave, of all. Yet over the years we have seen that on many occasions in the modern world security is provided by focusing on human rights and democracy.</p>

<a name="90428-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="09042865000121"></a>Let us look at the UN&#146;s role in achieving each of those goals. I say to my noble friend who introduced this Question that in some ways perhaps the UN has done a better job at living up to these original ambitions than she may fear. We have seen a sharp decrease in the number of people dying from violent conflict. The best analysis of that&#151;carried out, for various reasons, in several institutions in Canada&#151;suggests that UN peacekeeping has made a significant contribution to the decline in conflict both between and within countries. Similarly, with regard to development, we have seen hundreds of millions of people lifted out of poverty. In many cases, that is due to the bold actions of Governments and countries, but the contributing role of UN technical assistance has been critical. I refer to the role of organisations such as UNICEF or my old organisation, UNDP, in contributing advice and resources to help economic and social development. The UN has also played a role on the humanitarian side, where, for example, the World Food Programme and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees have made astonishing differences to the lives of millions of people.</p>

<a name="90428-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="09042865000122"></a>I turn to the area of human rights and democracy. In some ways, the UN has been critical in promoting democracy. However, turning from the historic record to look to the future, and in response to those who have raised the issue of the Human Rights Council, I have to acknowledge that there is, as many speakers have said, a lot of unfinished business. In the case of the Human Rights Council, there has been reform but it has not been effective. I think that its membership became over-expanded. The reform did not create a chamber which was objective and which could rise above the national interests of those in it to provide a truly nation-blind, colour-blind and values-blind view of human rights. Instead, as we saw as recently as last week in the review of the Durban conference, a lot of terrible things have been said in that council. Nevertheless, we have introduced some reforms which, in some ways, have started to improve the quality of the UN&#146;s work in human rights. We have introduced a mechanism called the universal periodic review, under which every member country must present and then defend its human rights record.</p>

<a name="90428-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="09042865000123"></a>Moving on from human rights, there has been an attempt to introduce new doctrines. My noble friend Lady Amos spoke about the doctrine of the responsibility to protect. That is a very important innovation; nevertheless, it is still fragile and, although acknowledged, it is not yet resolutely established. She properly raised the example of Sri Lanka, where the responsibility to protect is very much on display in that an awful lot of civilians&#146; lives have been put in danger by the violent internal conflict. However, to say that the UN has been inactive on this is unfair. It has not, if you like, waved at the doctrine because it is still a provocative one. Many countries see it as amounting to a foot in the door and they do not accept such interference in the internal affairs of member states. Therefore, the doctrine has to be pursued by other means, and the UN has been active in trying to secure humanitarian access. The Secretary-General, like our own Prime Minister, has repeatedly called for a ceasefire in Sri Lanka and for the protection of civilians.</p>

<a name="90428-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="09042865000124"></a>I turn to the reform that has, perhaps, attracted most attention from noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, and my noble friends Lord Judd and Lady Howells. I refer to the reform of the Security Council. In that regard, Britain is very clear indeed. We want to see the council enlarged, made more relevant to today&#146;s world, made more representative and more authoritative as a result. We have pressed hard, most recently in partnership with France, to try to move this forward. The first round of a General Assembly-based debate on UN Security Council reform has just concluded and there will be discussions to follow. We feel strongly, as guardians, if you like, of the charter, which in some ways comes with our P5 membership, that rather than protecting and conserving that as just a privilege locked in history, we must renew this chamber by expanding its membership, by drawing in precisely those countries mentioned in the debate&#151;Japan and the others whose names have been mentioned in this context&#151;as members on some basis or other. Whether or not the membership will agree to an immediate expansion of permanent membership, or some intermediate solution, is a matter for the membership as a whole to conclude.</p>

<a name="90428-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="09042865000125"></a>In finishing, let me just say to noble Lords that this Government are very committed to this. The question was raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, as to whether we should be doing more to press for the so-called &#147;One&#148; UN reforms. Let me say that a member of the panel that led to those recommendations was a certain G Brown Esquire, now Prime Minister of this country, so I do not think she need doubt the commitment of this Front Bench and of my colleagues in Government to achieving those reforms. In fact, a new administrator of UNDP took office this week and already she has had our Secretary of State for International Development in her office arguing the case for &#147;One&#148; UN reforms. The noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, need not be concerned. We are committed, because my right honourable friend the Prime Minister has recognised that, for a country such as Britain, our ability to exert influence in this modern world depends enormously on effective multilateralism and at the heart of that effective multilateralism lies that indispensable institution&#151;to borrow at least half of the phrase of the noble Lord, Lord Hannay&#151;the United Nations.</p>

In Grand Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, spoke about personal health budgets and emphasised the Government&#146;s intention that these should always be voluntary and that exactly the same principle applied to direct payments. The question I want to raise with him is whether the wording in the Bill provides a sufficient safeguard against abuse of the voluntary principle. New section 12A says,</p>
<ul><a name="09042865000227"></a>&#147;make payments with the patient&#146;s consent&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09042865000127"></a>which, at first blush, seems all right, but, if taken literally, the consent could be read as applying to the narrow issue of how the money in someone&#146;s direct payment budget is applied and spent. It might not necessarily prevent a situation arising in which a patient does not really want a personal budget at all but, against his better judgment, he is persuaded or pressurised into accepting one. There is a difference between the right to refuse treatment and the right not to choose a personal budget of any kind. The Minister&#146;s comments up to now have appeared to conflate the two. I have sympathy with the point made by Diabetes UK that the legislation should make it clear that personal health budgets of any kind&#151;notional, third-party or direct payments&#151;should remain voluntary, whether at the pilot stage or in the event that they are rolled out more widely. I am sure that the Minister will say that the wording in the Bill is adequate in this sense but, nevertheless, I would be glad if he would look at the matter again. I beg to move.</p>

As this is the first group of amendments on the subject of direct payments, perhaps I might reflect on the discussion in Committee. It would be accurate to say that we had an extensive debate&#151;almost a full afternoon of one of our sittings in Grand Committee&#151;during which the Minister was bowled question after question about direct payments, individual budgets, the principles underlying them, what the Government&#146;s intentions are, the extent to which individual health budgets might be brought into play in respect of different patients and different conditions and the limitations of the proposed pilots.</p>

<a name="90428-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="09042865000129"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, for his letter of 18 March in which he restated, to a large extent, the answers that he gave in Committee. However, detail is lacking and that continues to be a source of considerable concern to many of us on this side of the House who  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_192"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 192</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are supportive of the principle of direct payments but have considerable concerns about how they might be introduced and about the potential detrimental effects which they might have on the National Health Service and particularly on the provision of services.</p>

<a name="90428-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="09042865000130"></a>Since the Committee, the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, has been kind enough to arrange a meeting for all Peers, attended by the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, at which she and several people from the disability organisations with which she has long been associated and academics such as John Glasby from Birmingham University set out the experience of disabled people. They talked at considerable length about what they consider to be the potential benefits to service users of individual budgets. It seems to be my misfortune throughout this Bill to refer to the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, when she is not in her place and I regret that I have to do so again. It would not be inaccurate to say that although there was considerable support for the potential for direct payments at that meeting, again, when Members of your Lordships&#146; House raised issues and asked questions, there were no answers. I find that deeply troubling.</p>

<a name="90428-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="09042865000131"></a>That meeting gave rise to the tabling of Amendment 31, which, as noble Lords will see, bears a resemblance to an amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, in Committee in which she set out a list of conditions and services to which individual health budgets might apply. The purpose of both these amendments is to probe the Government&#146;s intentions on the extent to which direct payments will be introduced in the NHS. It is of considerable interest and should give rise to a degree of concern that many of the organisations that have supported the principle of direct payments or individual health budgets have expressed their support on the understanding that they will be available to a small minority of patients who suffer from long-term conditions, and that there will be adequate advice and support for any person who has an individual budget. Neither of those two statements can be made with any certainty, given what is in the Bill and our discussions so far.</p>

<a name="90428-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="09042865000132"></a>Amendment 31 refers to two particular conditions, both of which, in different ways, highlight some of the potential issues associated with individual health budgets. In Committee some noble Lords expressed the view that palliative care services, given their place in the National Health Service and the fact that they are largely supplied by independent organisations, principally charities, should be funded through direct payment. But the major providers of hospice care in the country have a very different view. By definition, palliative care&#151;end-of-life care&#151;is provided to individuals but it cannot be predicted when any particular individual will need it. At the moment part of the function of the NHS is to study populations and the incidence of conditions, and to make an assessment of the level of service needed to deal with them. That process runs right through to budgeting. There is an attempt at the heart of the NHS to address issues such as pooling of risk and equity of service. If palliative care came to be primarily funded by direct payments, the ability of providers to predict and provide a certain level of service would be extremely difficult. It might signal the end of the provision of palliative care within the

<a name="90428-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="09042865000133"></a>At the meeting arranged by the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, noble Lords who were interested in the subject discussed at considerable length the benefits of this service, and there are benefits. In Committee we discussed the fact that services can be more personalised and more effective for individual patients, and can contribute to greater health outcomes. At the meeting noble Lords&#151;particularly the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, who, I am sorry to see, is not here to take part in this debate, although she talked in Committee&#151;saw that maternity services would be a good candidate for individual health budgets. Maternity services are required, usually, with about nine months&#146; anticipation of the need for them arising. They are planned on the basis of population studies. Thinking about the matter in greater detail, within the NHS there is at the moment a considerable move towards midwife-led units, on the basis that the majority of deliveries are uncomplicated and routine. However, there are always births that do not go according to plan and in which there is a sudden and urgent need for a woman to be referred to a consultant obstetrician.</p>

<a name="90428-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="09042865000134"></a>The reason for suggesting that maternity services should be included in the pilots for individual health budgets is to test the point that I raised in Committee. To what extent has the Department of Health analysed the risk of turning some services, which may be elective, over to individual health budgets, and to what extent might they then jeopardise acute services because of the coexistence of the two? Amendment 25 suggests that it is the responsibility of the department to set out much more clearly than it has done to date those conditions and circumstances under which direct payment may, must or must not be made available. It is essential not only to the future of the policy but to the expectation that will be placed on it by NHS staff and, most particularly, by users. Both amendments signify a degree of frustration on my part that, having had detailed discussions about these matters over the last three months, we are no further forward in understanding just how radical this policy is intended to be and just what its potential implications are for NHS providers and patients.</p>

<a name="09042865000135"></a><b><a name="90428-0013.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09042865000404"></a>Lord Darzi of Denham:</b> My Lords, this set of amendments deals with consent and the services and circumstances in which direct payments might be used. I turn first to Amendment 23, moved by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. It would require that a patient&#146;s consent to receiving a direct payment is &#147;prior and informed&#148;. It is important to emphasise that personal health budgets, including direct payments, will be entirely voluntary. That is one of the core principles outlined in our policy document, <I>Personal </I><I>H</I><I>ealth </I><I>B</I><I>udgets</I><I>: F</I><I>irst </I><I>S</I><I>teps</I>. Of course, consent is enshrined in the very first sentence of this legislation for direct payments. No one should be forced to have direct payments if they do not want to, and I do not believe that anyone could be forced to accept such payment.</p>

<a name="90428-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="09042865000136"></a>More generally, I agree with the noble Earl that people should give valid consent before they receive any form of care. If they are not able to do so, the  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_194"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 194</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>consent should be obtained from someone acting legally on their behalf. That is fundamental to healthcare, and a legal right, as we have made clear in the NHS Constitution. However, the notion of consent already implies that the person is informed. Expanding the definition of consent will not, in practice, increase the protection that this Bill already offers. I remember debating this in Committee. Although I take the point that the noble Earl is concerned about, I cannot find a better word to cover this being a voluntary scheme. That is well known to the people coming into it. Finally, before even accepting it, they have to obtain consent. I hope I have provided reassurance to the noble Earl on his amendment.</p>

<a name="90428-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="09042865000137"></a>Amendments 25 and 31 were tabled by the noble Baronesses Lady Barker and Lady Tonge. Amendment 25 seeks to limit the services for which direct payments may be made and Amendment 31 would promote the use of direct payments for maternity services but would rule out end-of-life care. I hope to persuade the noble Baronesses that these amendments are not necessary.</p>

<a name="90428-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="09042865000138"></a>It may be helpful if I start by giving an update on how the pilot programme has developed since these clauses were last discussed in this House. In <I>Personal Health Budgets: First Steps</I> we invited PCTs to submit expressions of interest in becoming a pilot site to test personal health budgets. Since then, we have received more than 70 applications from every strategic health authority area, covering a range of services and conditions. Many PCTs want to focus on people with long-term conditions, people who are receiving NHS continuing healthcare or people with mental health needs. We have also received proposals to explore how personal health budgets could be used, for example, to support carers for stroke services. Around a dozen applications included proposals for end-of-life care, while one PCT expressed an interest in using personal health budgets for maternity services. I am sure that will please the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege.</p>

We felt that it was a creative proposal and I have no doubt that it will be looked at quite carefully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="09042865000141"></a>It is too early to say exactly which proposals will go ahead. We are delighted by the enthusiasm and the range of innovative ideas that we have seen. We are looking forward to working with as many sites as possible to develop viable proposals and we intend to feed back shortly to all PCTs that have applied.</p>

<a name="90428-0014.htm_para4"></a>

Subject to the passage of this Bill and the making of necessary regulations, there would be a further stage in the process to decide which pilot site would be authorised to use direct payments.</p>

<a name="90428-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="09042865000143"></a>As I said in Committee, we are looking to build on the enthusiasm for personalisation in the NHS, so we do not intend to set too many prescriptive limits on  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_195"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 195</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the circumstances in which people could use direct payments. The Bill already gives power to exclude services or groups of people. This is something that we might consider where there is a particular risk of abuse: for example, for people who are under compulsory drug or alcohol treatment orders. As I said in Grand Committee, we intend to consult on this in the normal way with draft regulations.</p>

<a name="90428-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="09042865000144"></a>However, across the NHS there are, of course, many services, such as accident and emergency and other acute services, where direct payments will not be appropriate. I do not think it is necessary to list these and exclude them all in regulation. We want personal health budgets and direct payments to be used where they make sense, relying on the judgment of local PCTs, individuals, patient groups and the voluntary sector.</p>

<a name="90428-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="09042865000145"></a>On the specific questions about end-of-life care, clearly this is an area with particular sensitivities. However, there may be great potential for personal health budgets, although not necessarily delivered through direct payments, as per the applications we have received recently. For example, some PCTs have suggested that personal budgets might allow patients to receive a more flexible range of support, or allow a quicker and more responsive way of adjusting a care package to a patient&#146;s changing needs. It is also worth remembering that another person&#151;for example, a carer&#151;can receive direct payments on behalf of the patient. This would mean that people could have the extra flexibility of direct payments while not creating an additional burden at a very difficult time.</p>

<a name="90428-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="09042865000146"></a>I am sure the noble Baroness will agree that some of the policies that we have come up with over the past 18 months are all to improve quality and caring on the end-of-life pathway, in relation to the national strategy. This could be one enabler in relation to that pathway. Rather than making conclusions now about which services are suitable or unsuitable for delivery through direct payments, we would prefer to explore a range of proposals and to build the evidence base through those pilots. If evaluation reveals the need to rule out a specific service, the Bill already provides the power to do that. With these reassurances, I hope that the noble Baronesses will not press their amendments.</p>

If, because of this policy, it is possible that provision of a particular service within an area would cease and that that can be predicted now, is it right that that particular area of service should not be included in a pilot? That is the point I seek to make. For example, that could apply on specialist services such as palliative care, where there are only small numbers of people and the level of need for that service cannot be predicted regularly. The Minister&#146;s answer is important. I feel so strongly that this is of importance, not just to these pilots but to the future of the NHS, that I would be willing to test the opinion of the House on it.</p>

If it is whether a highly specialised service might be destabilised by the concept of direct budgets, I do not think that will change the demand to affect the supply. At the end, the demand will remain the same. It is about the method of payment, and whether the PCT is paying a provider or the patient is holding the direct budget. In my experience of those rare diseases, most patients feel much more empowered to buy their own services&#151;because they are, firstly, expert patients&#151;and that is the purpose of that. If this might be a reassurance, I do not see the situation arising where the supply of a service could demise because the payment method had become direct payment rather than being a direct commission from a PCT. If that were to happen, I can reassure the noble Baroness that the providers of such services will remain, because the local demand will be the same.</p>

His assurances were welcome. He may like to know that it is not only Diabetes UK that has expressed concern to me about the voluntary principle of direct payments; the RNIB is equally concerned. Its worry is that PCTs might make certain long-term healthcare services available only via a direct payments route. In other words, the patient would have no choice in the matter. Whether that is likely is a matter for debate, no doubt, but the RNIB is clearly worried about it. In those circumstances, the proposed constitutional rights that the Minister has referred to would not be easily enforceable. The RNIB would be much reassured to see the right to refuse direct payments explicitly expressed in the Bill. However, while I have sympathy with that I do not propose to press the point tonight, unless other noble Lords think differently. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The issue is again about payments. Under this Bill, the Secretary of State is enabled to discharge various statutory functions under the National Health Service Act 2006 by making direct monetary payments to patients in appropriate cases, initially through pilot schemes. As the Explanatory Notes say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a><a name="09042865000216"></a>&#147;This gives patients receiving direct payments for health care similar rights to those enjoyed by patients accessing services from NHS organisations or from private sector organisations commissioned by PCTs&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09042865000179"></a>So far, that is good. The issue is whether the provider of these services would constitute a public authority under the Human Rights Act 1998. Why is that in  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_198"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 198</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>doubt? It is in doubt because a number of court cases culminated in a judgment by the House of Lords in YL v Birmingham City Council and others in June 2007. As our report says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61"></a><a name="09042865000217"></a>&#147;By a majority of 3 to 2, the Law Lords ruled that the person concerned could not bring a claim against her private sector care home under the HRA, in relation to the infringement of her right to respect for her private life and home under Article 8 ECHR&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09042865000180"></a>As a result, the Government introduced an amendment to the Health and Social Care Bill in the last Session to put that right, but the question is whether the new arrangements on payments are also covered. The report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62"></a><a name="09042865000218"></a>&#147;In their joint evidence to us, Help the Aged and Age Concern argued that private bodies providing health services funded by direct payments should be considered as providing public functions, but&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09042865000181"></a>and here is the key point&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09042865000228"></a>&#147;&#145;it is not clear whether in practice they will be&#146;. They recommended that legislation should clarify the position, given &#145;the overall uncertainty about the HRA status of private healthcare providers&#146;.&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09042865000182"></a>I think that is a reasonable doubt, given the previous House of Lords case.</p>

<a name="90428-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="09042865000151"></a>The Government have argued that it is unnecessary, and there is a straight conflict of view there. We on the Human Rights Committee believe that it is necessary and that there should be an amendment to this Bill for the avoidance of doubt. The recommendation is,</p>
<ul><a name="09042865000229"></a>&#147;that the Bill be amended to make it absolutely clear that it is intended that NHS services funded by direct payments and provided by independent bodies are functions of a public nature for the purposes of the HRA 1998&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09042865000183"></a>I beg to move.</p>

The Human Rights Act is domestic legislation and there is, ultimately, the possibility of going to the court in Strasbourg. I am not sure that this would necessarily be sufficient. I may be wrong about this&#151;I am not sure&#151;but I raise the question whether this would be sufficient to make the provider a public authority within the meaning of the Convention on Human Rights, which is a different document in some substance from the Human Rights Act.</p>

<p><a name="st_196"></a>
<a name="09042865000153"></a><b><a name="90428-0014.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09042865000413"></a>Lord Darzi of Denham:</b> My Lords, the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Dubs on behalf of the Joint Committee on Human Rights would highlight the fact that NHS services funded by direct payments&#151;whoever provides them&#151;are functions of a public nature for the purposes of the Human Rights Act 1998. I hope to persuade my noble friend that there is no need to make this explicit in the Bill; and furthermore, that to do so might cause confusion and have an adverse effect on how other health services are provided. This is not to deny the need for greater clarity about what constitutes a public authority under the Human Rights Act. The Government are aware of concerns raised by the Committee on this matter, and remain committed to consulting on the issue in due course.</p>

<a name="90428-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="09042865000154"></a>The Committee previously sought clarification on whether the Government considered that private providers of health services funded through direct payments  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_199"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 199</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>were to be treated as public authorities under the Human Rights Act. I will reiterate the Government&#146;s position. We do consider independent providers of healthcare to be public authorities, for the purposes of Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998, when they are providing services under the National Health Service Act 2006. The duty of the Secretary of State to continue to provide a comprehensive and free health service under the Act is a core public function. The Government consider that all independent providers of healthcare that provide services in fulfilment of that duty are carrying out a public function, and therefore that they are all public authorities for the purposes of Section 6 of the Human Rights Act.</p>

<a name="90428-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="09042865000155"></a>The Government do not consider that any distinction can be drawn between the situation where the Secretary of State directly enters into a contract with an independent provider of healthcare services&#151;as permitted by Section 12 of the National Health Service Act 2006&#151;and the situation where a patient enters into a contract with an independent provider of healthcare services under the proposed legislation. In both cases, the services will be provided under the National Health Act 2006, and in fulfilment of the Secretary of State&#146;s duties. Similarly, an independent provider of after-care services under the Mental Health Act 1983, whether commissioned by a primary care trust or providing the services under a direct payment arrangement, will be covered by the Human Rights Act.</p>

<a name="90428-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="09042865000156"></a>The Government also note that the costs of services provided under the proposed direct payment arrangements would still be met from public funds. The Government note that there would still be a strong public interest in ensuring that the services were properly provided. The Government do not, however, believe that it is necessary to state this in the Bill, which is what the amendment seeks to achieve. To state explicitly that providers of healthcare procured by direct payments were carrying out public functions for the purposes of the Human Rights Act could cast doubt on whether independent providers of health services acting under other relevant sections of the National Health Service Act were exercising functions of a public nature.</p>

<a name="90428-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="09042865000157"></a>The judgment in YL v Birmingham City Council 2007 does not alter the position. It did not determine the position of any function other than those specifically considered by noble and learned Lords. For example, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mance, explicitly stated that he,</p>
<ul><a name="09042865000230"></a>&#147;would leave entirely open the position of those operating in different areas of health and education services&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90428-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="09042865000158"></a>The provision made in Section 145 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 was necessary only because of the judgment in the YL case. It was intended to ensure that, notwithstanding the judgment, some social care and accommodation that is publicly arranged under the National Assistance Act is a public function subject to the Human Rights Act. The approach was deemed sensible by a range of stakeholders at the time, and no subsequent court judgment has led the Government to consider that independent providers of national health services are not public authorities for the purposes of the Human Rights Act.</p>

What the Government seek to achieve and what I seek to achieve are clearly the same. The question is whether I share the Government&#146;s confidence that, if the matter were to be put to the test of the House of Lords in its judicial capacity, the House would come down on the side of the Government or take the same view as it did in the YL case. I am not a lawyer: I am not qualified to answer some of the detailed legal questions, but my understanding is that there is a little doubt about that. If there is no doubt, that is fine and I hope that I am proved wrong. However, given the persuasive nature of my noble friend's arguments, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

That is a provision for the Secretary of State to make explicit the mechanisms by which a patient, someone on a patient's behalf if they lack capacity or the payee can appeal against the amount of a direct payment or the method of calculation. The Bill provides that the Secretary of State may in regulations make provision about the amount of a direct payment, but there is no indication anywhere that an individual person may have recourse to a means of appeal.</p>

<a name="90428-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="09042865000162"></a>That absence of a means of appeal puts individual health budgets on to a different basis from the provision of direct healthcare services. If a patient is provided with a particular course of treatment under the NHS, they have a means within the current system of raising the issue of their treatment and questioning it. The amendment asks not that individual budget holders be able to determine the level of their payment but that they have a means of appeal. There are a variety of reasons why that should be so. In the new world of a plethora of providers of services to individuals and individual providers of individual services, it could be that the level of costs goes up. That which may be deemed to be a reasonable amount in order to provide a service that has hitherto been a direct provision by the NHS may simply not be possible when it is provided on a small scale without some of the efficiencies and economies of scale&#151;one of the things that NHS patients currently benefit from.</p>

In Committee, there was much debate about direct payments and the impact that they may have. While I appreciate the assurances provided by my noble friend about the safeguards that will be put in place, I have remaining concerns that the fundamental impact that direct payments will have on health services and staff delivering those services has not been fully realised.</p>

<a name="90428-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="09042865000165"></a>UNISON, the union with which I have a non-pecuniary relationship and which I support in amendments in this House when I agree with its positions, recognises and supports the need for National Health Service services to be responsive and able to provide more tailored support to some patients. However, there are still concerns within the union that the introduction of direct payments may have a damaging impact on the delivery of health services to the wider population that have not been fully considered.</p>

<a name="90428-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="09042865000166"></a>During consideration of the Bill in Committee, noble Lords raised their concerns around the potential circumstances that could arise if a direct payment budget ran out and a sufficient safety net was not put in place.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90428-0015.htm"/>


<a name="90428-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="0904291000001"></a>This is a concern both in dealing with the patients who might be turned away from essential care if their direct payment runs out and in relation to the risk that the NHS might be left to foot the bill in situations where a patient spends their direct payment inappropriately. This would, in effect, leave the National Health Service, in the view of UNISON, having to pay twice for the same person&#146;s care.</p>

<a name="90428-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="0904291000002"></a>I welcome the Minister&#146;s comments in Grand Committee, where he provided some reassurances about safeguards to avoid such scenarios occurring; we debated these issues at some length at that stage. However, concerns still remain. It remains the case that there is no detail on this in the Bill and no firm mechanism to reassure those of us with concerns that it will be addressed within regulations. There is a real possibility that, if a patient exhausts their budget, they will either have to pay to top up their care, which I am told is wrong in any event under the Bill, or the NHS will be left to foot the bill. My concern is that, without the inclusion of any safeguards in the Bill, the risk remains that such scenarios could arise. This amendment would provide some security to those of us who are concerned that this significant change to the delivery of healthcare has yet to be fully scrutinised.</p>

It indeed brings us back to the issue that we debated in Grand Committee, which is the need to guarantee that nobody is denied access to NHS treatment purely as a result of having a personal budget or being in a direct payment scheme. When he replied to me in Grand Committee, the noble  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_202"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 202</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord, Lord Darzi, assured me that the worry about someone running out of money and therefore not being able to access the care and treatment that he needed was not well founded. The situations that he described were ones where either there was inadequate resource allocation in the first instance for the defined care package or where a personal health budget might turn out to be inappropriate. However, those situations are not the only ones that are relevant to the underlying concern.</p>

<a name="90428-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="0904291000004"></a>The noble Lord referred to the safeguards outlined in the department&#146;s guidance document, <I>Personal </I><I>H</I><I>ealth </I><I>B</I><I>udgets: </I><I>F</I><I>irst </I><I>S</I><I>teps</I>, but we know that this is not a definitive book of rules; it is, as he said, a framework within which the policy can develop further. The guidance states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a><a name="0904291000044"></a>&#147;Setting the budget at the right level will be one of the major challenges to be addressed during the pilot programme&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0904291000039"></a>I do not doubt that that is right, as we know the process for budget allocation is still under development. It goes on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a><a name="0904291000045"></a>&#147;Once at least an indicative budget is set, the next step is to draw up a detailed care plan designed to meet the individual&#146;s agreed health and well-being outcomes&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0904291000040"></a>With all due respect, that seems to address the problem from the wrong starting point. Unless a detailed care plan is developed prior to resource allocation, how can one identify an appropriate budget?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="0904291000005"></a>My worry on this score is underlined by the Explanatory Notes, in the part that covers new Section 12B(5).

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66"></a><a name="0904291000046"></a>&#147;This means that in prescribed circumstances, but only in prescribed circumstances, the Secretary of State could be considered to have fulfilled his duty to provide a service described at new section 12A(2) by making a direct payment&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0904291000041"></a>This caveat suggests that there may be circumstances in which a service user would not be able to access services through the NHS if their budget had proved insufficient. I should be grateful if the Minister could reassure me that this is not an interpretation that should be placed on those words.</p>

<a name="90428-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="0904291000006"></a>It is perhaps not difficult to see why these issues are causing concern for organisations such as Diabetes UK, because, in that instance, diabetes is not a condition that would appear to lend itself readily to a direct payment scheme. The Minister will know about the Year of Care programme; its aim is to define the differing needs of diabetic patients across the spectrum and then to pin down how much it would cost to deliver different packages of care that will enable each of those patients to manage their own care in an appropriate way. Evidence from the Year of Care pilots indicates that the task of calculating the allocation of personal budgets for people with diabetes will be difficult. A lot of work has to go into assessing and costing out different needs, but the key concern is unpredictability. Even if someone&#146;s diabetes appears to be well managed and stable, there is always a chance that something will happen that throws everything out of kilter.</p>




<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_203"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 203</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90428-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="0904291000007"></a>Diabetes is complex and progressive. Having a personal budget or receiving a direct payment that is meant to cover the entire package for your diabetes runs the serious risk that the budget may run out, thus exposing you to having to put up with a level of care that simply does not meet your needs. It really is a case of saying that what should come first for diabetic patients&#151;indeed, all patients of any kind&#151;is making the right choice of treatment for an individual, based on that person&#146;s clinical needs and preferences. The budget allocation should follow on from that.</p>

<a name="90428-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="0904291000008"></a>That is why there is a fear&#151;here, I return to Amendment 23&#151;because patients need to understand exactly what they are letting themselves in for when opting for a personal budget or signing up to a direct payment scheme. Some conditions and some patients will be tailor-made for both, but others decidedly will not be. I shall not ask the House to vote on my amendment, but I should like the Minister to consider whether we need to beef up the Bill by building in an explicit statutory duty on the NHS to ensure that no one is denied treatment simply because they have opted for a personal budget or direct payment.</p>

<p><a name="st_202"></a>
<a name="0904291000009"></a><b><a name="90428-0015.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0904291000055"></a>Lord Darzi of Denham:</b> My Lords, Amendment 26, tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Barker and Lady Tonge, proposes that there should be a way for people to appeal against decisions on their direct payments. I agree with the sentiment behind this amendment that people should be able to complain and seek redress if there are problems with the services that they receive. Indeed, the NHS Constitution sets out the right to have any complaint about NHS services dealt with efficiently and investigated properly. However, I would be concerned by the idea of setting up an additional complaints or appeals system specifically for direct payments.</p>

<a name="90428-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="0904291000010"></a>In the first instance, we hope that concerns can be resolved locally and informally. We would expect PCTs to discuss any concerns that people have, either about the size of the budget or the mechanism used to set it. We would encourage PCTs to be flexible to meet individual needs, while ensuring the fairness of the system as a whole. If a patient still has concerns, they are entitled to make a complaint, just as with any other NHS decision about which they are unhappy. NHS complaints procedures have recently been reformed to make the system more efficient and certainly more robust. Ultimately, patients may also ask the Health Service Ombudsman to look into their cases. Clause 10 extends the role of the ombudsman to cover services delivered through direct payments, precisely to ensure that people are suitably protected. It is worth reiterating that services paid for by direct payments are NHS services; patients are covered by the complaints procedure protecting patients receiving traditionally commissioned services. It is, therefore, unnecessary to create a new route of appeal or complaint, which might also prove costly and burdensome.</p>

<a name="90428-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="0904291000011"></a>I turn now to Amendment 27, tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and Amendment 29, tabled by my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours. These deal with the related situations of whether patients can receive other services alongside a direct payment and what  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_204"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 204</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>happens if a direct payment budget has run out. I understand these concerns that people might be turned away from the NHS if they have exhausted their budget, or that the NHS should be forced to spend more money inappropriately. However, I assure noble Lords that this should not happen. As I have said before, and as we said in our <I>Personal Health Budgets: First Steps</I>, no one should ever be denied the care that they need. That is a core principle of our policy.</p>

<a name="90428-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="0904291000012"></a>In addition, direct payments will often be for just one aspect of a patient&#146;s care, or even one element of that patient pathway. Patients will still be able to use other traditionally commissioned services where that is appropriate. Direct payment should be used only when there is a likely benefit and it will be wholly voluntary.</p>

<a name="90428-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="0904291000013"></a>In Committee, I emphasised that there were several safeguards in place to protect against the budgets running out. First, the personal health budget would be offered to people only in circumstances where their needs could be assessed and the budget calculated for them. Clarity on how we calculate such budgets is one of the requirements. Getting the calculation right will be important. We were pleased to see that a large number of the pilot applications that we received contained proposals for designing resource allocation systems. Many PCTs are aiming to build on the approaches already developed by local authorities. Others intend to develop their own mechanisms for assessing individual needs. There is a long way to go, but the pilots should produce valuable learning.</p>

<a name="90428-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="0904291000014"></a>The second safeguard that we intend to have is a pre-agreed care plan for how the money would be spent. I take the point raised by the noble Earl, Lord Howe: the care plan must come first, before you calculate the budget. I could not agree more, although, in reading the Bill, I am not entirely sure whether there is an order that might be, in a way, adding confusion. The clinician, in partnership with the patient, must decide on the care plan and then calculate the budget.</p>

<a name="90428-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="0904291000015"></a>Thirdly, there should be regular monitoring and review so that the budget can be adjusted in line with a significant change in the person&#146;s conditions. Diabetes is a good example. It would be very unfortunate to see a diabetic patient progress in their illness into some of the morbidities of diabetes that we are ultimately trying to prevent. If the patient&#146;s condition changed and they required an ophthalmologist to check their retinopathy or a renal physician to check their nephropathy, the budget should be adjusted to accommodate that. Alternatively, the patient may opt out and receive these extra treatments without a direct payment. I am confident that these safeguards will avoid problems arising for the recipient of direct payments or for the other patients and services.</p>

<a name="90428-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="0904291000016"></a>I remind the House that these are pilots. The purpose of having pilots is to learn from them. We will certainly be empowered by the knowledge base from them. These are very innovative areas and I strongly believe that we need to be the leaders in innovations and in empowering patients through direct budgets. I hope that I have reassured noble Lords and that they will feel able not to press their amendments.</p>

It was immensely helpful that the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, made the statement that he did about clinical assessment having to come first and having to be a wholly separate process from financial assessment. It is a point that was the subject of extensive research by CSCI in the report that it produced earlier this year into individual budgets in social care. It wrote extensively about the need to have, first, an assessment of need as it is found in social care followed by a separate assessment of files. That is not a new issue. It has not arisen simply because of the existence of individual budgets; it has been a running issue throughout health and social care for some considerable time. However, given the way in which individual health budgets and direct payments are going to come in, I think that there is potential for great confusion.</p>

<a name="90428-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="0904291000018"></a>I must admit that I am slightly disappointed with the noble Lord&#146;s response to my amendment regarding appeals. I cannot help but think that, by their very nature, individual health budgets and direct payments will bring questions of cost and expense to the direct notice of patients in a way that has not happened before. By and large, with the exception of some areas such as NHS continuing care, discussions on financial transactions have not been conducted with patients, although they will be now. I hesitate to suggest that it may be nave to think that this issue will not arise, but I think that not having an obvious system by which it can be addressed is another flaw.</p>

<a name="90428-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="0904291000019"></a>I bow to the more extensive experience of the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, but I shall be astonished if the NHS complaints procedure is capable of handling the fallout from the introduction of individual budgets. Nevertheless, I note what he said and, in due course, we will see what happens. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

In particular, the introduction of this more individual-centred delivery of healthcare will have a significant impact on workforce planning, especially where a patient embarks on a course of treatment that conflicts with professional opinion. Furthermore, if in the future direct payments create circumstances in which staff are employed directly by patients rather than by healthcare providers or the

<a name="90428-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="0904291000021"></a>This amendment is a retabling of one from Committee stage. It calls for provision to be made in regulations to provide a level of protection for staff involved in providing services. UNISON has thousands of members working in the health service. Perhaps I may draw the House&#146;s attention to the fact that it represents more than 450,000 healthcare workers and 300,000 social care workers employed in the National Health Service and local government and by private contractors, the voluntary sector and general practitioners. Many of those thousands of members working in the health service will be in the front line of implementing these proposals, and therefore clearly they will be affected in a major way by this legislation.</p>

<a name="90428-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="0904291000022"></a>In Committee, the Minister recognised that the success of personal budgets and direct payments will depend on staff and that,</p>
<ul><a name="0904291000049"></a>&#147;the development of personal budgets will require significant cultural changes at all levels of the NHS, which should not be underestimated&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 2/3/09; col. GC 237.]</ul>
<p><a name="0904291000042"></a>Given the extent of this culture change, surely there needs to be a level of protection in the Bill. We need something greater than a reassurance that, if staff engage during the pilot process, they will be properly protected and supported during such a period of change. We need regulation if staff are to be fully protected. I beg to move.</p>

Clearly, there is no argument here in principle, but I am not convinced, as I said in Committee, of the need for setting this out in the Bill. Amendment 28, tabled by my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours, deals with the issue of protecting staff who provide services funded by direct payment. As we discussed in Grand Committee and set out in <I>Personal Health Budgets: First Steps</I>, the successes of personal budgets and direct payments will depend on staff, those who support, agree and monitor care plans and budgets and those who deliver such services. This is a lesson that came across clearly from the evaluation of individual budgets in social care.</p>

<a name="90428-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="0904291000024"></a>It is vital for all staff that they have terms of employment that are legal, reasonable and fair. All of those who directly employ staff will need to understand their responsibilities. Several PCTs have already been considering ideas to ensure that individuals and carers have the information and support they need to manage staff responsibly. We are keen to support that. While most staff would not argue with the aims of personalisation, its delivery will require a significant mindset shift. We have already touched on the cultural change, as pointed out by my noble friend. Staff should be involved and engaged as much as possible in steering the implementation of personal health budgets and direct payments and in developing appropriate training. In our assessment of the pilot proposals so far, we have therefore been looking for evidence that frontline staff and unions are directly engaged.</p>

I have no doubt that my noble friend will agree that these pilots will provide us with wonderful learning opportunities that we can take back to our stakeholders, such as the trade unions, and work out a reasonable proposal for the future. I want to reassure noble Lords that our evaluation programme will specifically look at the implications for staff of personal health budgets, including those involving direct payments, and if there is a case for putting specific safeguards in place, the legislation already gives us the power to do so. Therefore, I do not believe at this stage that an explicit provision in the Bill is necessary.</p>

This is the fact that individual payments and their potential effects on healthcare systems, on the level of healthcare services and healthcare outcomes are all great unknowns. I hope, as do other noble Lords, that they are a positive benefit, but there are a great many uncertainties about the principles and practice that will surround their introduction.</p>

<a name="90428-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="0904291000029"></a>Much of the supposition made by the Department of Health is based on very limited evidence of pilots which have been run in social care. It is worth pointing out that the pilots for direct payments and individual budgets in social care happened at a time when health and social care funding was at an unprecedented level of growth. That is unlikely to be the case when these services are introduced within the NHS.</p>

<a name="90428-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="0904291000030"></a>I also want to direct noble Lords&#146; attention back to the IBSEN research which we quoted extensively in Committee. It is one of the most tentative and circumspect research reports that I have ever seen. In Committee, I drew noble Lords&#146; attention to the cost and cost-effectiveness of individual budgets in social care. The cost and cost-effectiveness of services in social care is  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_208"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column 208</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>very largely determined by salary level and the availability of staff. Given the change in the economy, the availability of social care staff may increase. There has been a horrible shortage of them for several years. Salary levels may go down, which might mean that this becomes a much more cost-effective way of delivering services. For those and similar reasons, which could bear repetition although I do not wish to detain the House, it is reasonable to say that this policy, even on a pilot basis, is built on a whole series of assumptions for which, as yet, there is very little evidence.</p>

<a name="90428-0015.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="0904291000031"></a>My amendment is worded deliberately. It talks about,</p>
<ul><a name="0904291000050"></a>&#147;the effects of direct payments on provision of health services and health outcomes&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0904291000043"></a>It does not talk about the provision of those health services which will be funded by individual budgets. I return to a point that I have made several times before. Services for those with long-term and chronic conditions may be provided by the providers of acute services. By changing the funding patterns for part of what they do, one may potentially jeopardise the funding for the acute service. I make it clear that I am not talking about the impact on those conditions for which people are eligible to receive an individual budget; I am talking about the wider impact on health services and health outcomes.</p>

<a name="90428-0015.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="0904291000032"></a>Why should I propose that there be research every three years? First, I think that that is a long enough period in which to detect changes. Secondly, it is a sufficiently long period of time in which the effects of other relevant policy changes can be thrown up. It is also a similar timescale to that of a Comprehensive Spending Review. The position of health spending and the overall effects on the health service is a direct contributory factor to determining how people will have to use their individual budgets. Finally, a three-year timetable would take the process of research out of the political timescale as regards a change of Government. I believe that this is potentially one of the policies which will have the biggest impact on the provision of health services and health outcomes. It is therefore only right that it should be subject to regular independent review. I beg to move.</p>

This Bill was born in a time of relative affluence when the National Health Service saw huge increases in expenditure. We are going into a period which may be very different indeed. There are going to be all kinds of new pressures exerted on health service budgets with people crying out from every section of the health service for an increased share of the cake.

Let me try to convince noble Lords why I do not believe that is necessary. I would be the first to say that any innovation such as this has to be evaluated, and I could not agree more with the noble Baroness that it needs to be a rigorous evaluation. It could have a tremendously positive impact on the patient and also on the health service. We will be speaking later about how we are calling for bids for independent evaluation. The question here is how long we keep evaluating something once we have had an independent evaluation of the pilots. We do not evaluate anything else independently in the health service. It all comes under our normal evaluation of our commissioning structures. If these pilots are successful, direct payments will be evaluated through the performance management of PCTs and their commissioning function will be evaluated as part of the world-class commissioning programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="0904291000036"></a>The area I do not agree with is the impact of direct budgets on healthcare funding. This is innovation and innovation can save money. If we look at the evidence base of small pilots run in the US and from talking to stakeholders, including patient groups and the voluntary sector, we are constantly reminded of the amount of waste in the system. If the patient is empowered to make these decisions and have control of the payment, what cost savings might arise from that? Remember the wonderful example told by the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, about her mattress. Let us remember the mattress story. The PCT was encouraging her to spend &#163;3,000 and she found the same brand on the internet for about a tenth of the price. Let us have an open mind about this, which is the purpose of the independent evaluation. I hope I have made the case for why the Government see independent evaluation as important. Once we evaluate this independently, we have to make a call. Are direct payments going to benefit patients or do we need to decide what suits who based on our evaluation of the pilots? I hope I have reassured the noble Baroness enough to allow her to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I am not as convinced as he is that they will automatically be more effective and efficient. Even the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, who was a bit embarrassed about the example of her mattress, had the grace to concede that a physiotherapy service in which the physiotherapist goes to somebody&#146;s work to provide physiotherapy at a point and place convenient to the person receiving the service might have a higher unit cost than one that is run for the benefit of several people from a traditional NHS facility. Let us not take one example and from it extrapolate savings that may or may not arise across the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="0904291000038"></a>I want individual budgets to succeed. A critical part of their success will be their being subject to full, rigorous and independent review. I suspect that the process will have to carry on way beyond pilots. Pilots are carried out by people who are enthusiastic and work extremely hard to make sure that they are a success. That may not be the case when they are rolled out, as I am sure that they will be, throughout the whole of the NHS. I thank the Minister and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p>That the Second Reading Committee do consider the Perpetuities and Accumulations Bill [HL].</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="09042851000003"></a><b><a name="90428-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09042851000146"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Bach):</b> Every Bill that comes before your Lordships&#146; House is in some way special, but the Perpetuities and Accumulations Bill is particularly so for three reasons. First, it will reform the long-standing rule of English and Welsh trust and property law known as the rule against perpetuities and the rule against excessive accumulations. Secondly, it is a Law Commission Bill, and there have been all too few such Bills in Parliament in recent years. Thirdly, it is the first Bill in the trial of the new procedure for Law Commission Bills approved by the House last year. We hope that this Bill will be the first of many to use the procedure. This may very well be the first time that a Second Reading of any Bill has been heard in the Moses Room. No doubt inquiries will be made to see whether that statement is accurate. Perhaps we are making history in a small way this afternoon.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000004"></a>Before I consider those three themes in greater detail, I thank those who have been particularly instrumental in developing the new procedure. My noble friend Lady Ashton, as one of my predecessors at the Ministry of Justice, and as Leader of the House, worked closely with the noble Lords, Lord Kingsland and Lord Goodhart, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, to develop an acceptable new procedure for Law Commission Bills. The noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara, and members of the Procedure Committee recommended that the procedure be given a two-Bill trial, which is worthy of thanks. I am grateful to them all.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000005"></a>In thanking those who have contributed to the development of the new procedure, I should not omit to mention Sir Terence Etherton, the chairman of the Law Commission, without whose vigorous prompting we may not have been here today.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000006"></a>The development of the new procedure was only possible because of the co-operation between all parts of your Lordships&#146; House&#151;the Government, the   


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC2"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC2</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>opposition parties and the Cross Benches&#151;and I hope that we will carry this spirit through our debate, because a new procedure is founded on the principle of consensus.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000007"></a>Few, if any, bodies outside Parliament can claim to have had such an influence on our laws as the Law Commission. It has established an international reputation for excellence of legal research and analysis. However, all too often and for all too long, potential Law Commission Bills have languished unimplemented because parliamentary time could not be found for them. The new procedure is intended to address part of this problem. It is not intended for every Law Commission Bill. However, it will be suitable for what might be described as unspectacular but worthy law reform; work that will not command headlines on the front page, but without which our laws will become out of date and dislocated from the real world. It is work that this House, if I may say so, seems to me to be especially suited to scrutinise and carry forward.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000008"></a>I turn now, not without some trepidation, to describe the content of what can only be described as a very technical Bill. The overall aim, which is based on the result of extensive consultation, is to modernise, simplify and streamline the rule against perpetuities and the rule against excessive accumulations. Clauses 1 to 12 deal with the reforms to the operation of the rule against perpetuities, and Clauses 13 and 14 deal with the reform of the rule against excessive accumulations. The remaining clauses are ancillary to these substantive reforms. As the rules are largely independent of one another, I shall deal with each in turn.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000009"></a>The rule against perpetuities is an old common law rule that originally developed in the context of family trusts. The first question facing a prospective settlor, or more likely his or her lawyer, is whether the rule applies. This is defined by common law and not by statute. Over time, the scope of the rule has been extended from family trust-type situations to include commercial transactions such as options, rights of pre-emption and future easements. The rule therefore now reaches into areas well beyond its original justification.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000010"></a>Clauses 1 and 2 define precisely when the rule is to apply and when it is not to apply. It will apply only in three sets of circumstances: successive interests in trusts or executory bequests, non-successive interests subject to conditions precedent, and rights exercisable on breach of conditions subsequent. If it transpires that the rule still applies where it ought not to do so, Clause 3 provides an order-making power for the Lord Chancellor to specify exceptions. This is subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. Where the rule applies, Clause 2 preserves the present exception for gifts over from one charity to another and extends the current exception for pension schemes to all personal occupational and public service schemes. By necessary implication from Clause 1, the rule will no longer apply in other cases. Options, rights of pre-emption and future easements currently subject to this rule will cease to be so. This major reform responds to the concerns of the consultees that the rule was unnecessarily complicating commercial transactions.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000011"></a>Having defined when the rule is to apply, the Bill defines the perpetuity period. At present, that period is the length of a &#147;life or lives in being&#148; designated by  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC3"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC3</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the creator of a trust, plus an additional 21 years, or a fixed period of up to 80 years. Subject to one exception, Clause 5 provides that where the Bill applies, the perpetuity period will be 125 years. This is broadly the maximum likely to be achieved under the present law and present life expectancies. The exception is that where an existing special power of appointment is exercised, the period will be the same as that which applies to the trust from which the power derives. This broadly preserves the effect of the present law.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000012"></a>Clause 6 defines when the period will start. The general rule is that it will begin when the instrument creating the relevant interests takes effect. But for special powers of appointment, as under the present law, the period will start at the date the instrument creating the power took effect.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000013"></a>The Bill is in general only prospective and will not, subject to one beneficial exception, affect the terms of existing trusts or wills. The exception is that where the trustees of a pre-commencement trust believe that it is difficult or not reasonably practicable to calculate whether a perpetuity period defined by reference to &#147;lives in being&#148; has ended, they can opt in to a fixed period under the Bill of 100 years.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000014"></a>The remaining clauses applying to perpetuities broadly replicate in relation to instruments to which the Bill applies the effect of the &#147;wait and see&#148; and class-closing reforms effected by the Perpetuities and Accumulations Act 1964, an Act that, if I may mention in passing, was built upon the work of the Law Reform Committee in 1956. It was work in which the father of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, played a prominent part. I am sure that he would be delighted to see his son continuing in the family tradition today.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000015"></a>The second of the rules to be reformed is the rule against excessive accumulations. Broadly speaking, accumulation is the rolling up of trust income into capital. This rule, originating in a statute enacted at the turn of the 19th century in respect of the Thellusson case of 1799, limits how long income can be added to capital, rather than being distributed to beneficiaries. Currently, six alternative statutory periods can apply. The rule applies to trusts created by natural persons, but not trusts set up by corporations.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000016"></a>The Law Commission found that for most cases the rationale for the rule had disappeared and recommended that the current rule be abolished for all but charitable trusts. Charitable trustees are under a duty to distribute funds to provide for the charitable purposes for which the trust was established. The Bill therefore repeals the present rules but retains a statutory accumulation period of 21 years for property held on trust for charitable purposes. This period will however not apply where the court or the Charity Commission under their existing powers have made specific provision for a charity.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000017"></a>As in the case of the reforms to the rule against perpetuities, these reforms will apply only to instruments taking effect after the Bill comes into force unless the instrument is a will made before that date and taking effect after it. In that case, the present law will apply.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000018"></a>Having completed this brief and, I fear, far from expert summary of the principal provisions of the Bill, perhaps I may mention one final general point. The Bill  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC4"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC4</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is not intended to affect income from taxation. However, with a Bill of this complexity, dealing with matters over such a long time period, it is difficult to be absolutely certain that the Bill would not have any effect on revenue. If, however, any unintended effect on revenue becomes apparent, the Government will act swiftly to remove any unintended Exchequer consequences in the unlikely event that they arise.</p>

The reforms that we propose in the Bill are based on consultation with experts&#151;of course their comments have been taken into account. Some may have wished for more radical reform, but that was not the consensus. I hope that this modest but important Bill will be the first of many to use the new procedure. I beg to move.</p>
<h5><a name="09042851000135"></a>3.51 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09042851000022"></a><b><a name="90428-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09042851000150"></a>Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts:</b> I thank the Minister very much for explaining a complex, technical Bill and for the new procedure under which we are to operate, in which we are, in racing terms, the first out of the traps. I begin by declaring interests&#151;charitable interests which are on the Register. Perhaps in the light of the subject matter that we are discussing, I should draw the Committee&#146;s attention to the fact that I am president of the National Council of Voluntary Organisations, which of course has some interest in our proceedings. That having been said, I am not a lawyer, and I shall leave the legal aspects to my noble friend Lord Kingsland, who has already forgotten more law than I will ever know, and focus instead on one or two practical implications that could be tweaked in the Bill and which may represent an improvement.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000023"></a>As I said, I welcome this new approach, because speeding up the modernisation of legislation is very important. I had a bit of a baptism of fire on this when dealing with what was originally the Company Law Reform Bill&#151;on which I had the honour of representing the party on the Front Bench&#151;which became the Companies Act 2006. As one dug into that, one saw how the 2006 Bill was going to amend the 2004 Act, which amended the 1989 Act, the 1985 Act and, in a few cases, as far back as the 1929 Act. The archaeological layers meant, as the Minister said in his opening remarks, that often provisions have become  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC5"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC5</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>entirely dislocated from the real world and completely incomprehensible other than to the specialist. We were able, thanks to the Government&#146;s good offices, including the Minister&#146;s colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, to expand the Bill to bring everything into one place in a much bigger Bill&#151;a 1,300 clause Bill. There were a couple of exceptions, including community interest companies, which we shall of course touch on later in our debates. In so far as this is part of the same process, I welcome it.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000024"></a>The Minister was unduly modest when he explained the history of the Bill. I understand that the initial consultation on this Bill took place in 1993. It was the subject of a Law Commission report in 1998, a constitutional affairs department report in 2002, more consultation in 2008 and now, 16 years on, we have the Bill. That shows that there is a need to speed up the procedure.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000025"></a>I turn to the Bill itself. My first point concerns the issue of perpetuities. Obviously, I find perpetuity a complex issue, given concepts such as &#147;lives in being&#148;. I ask for one clarification. I hope that the Bill team will forgive me when I say that when I read the Explanatory Notes trying to unravel the matter, I got to paragraph 6 on page 2. The fourth sentence says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09042851000121"></a>&#147;The perpetuity period will be the life of A plus 21 years, measured from the date of X&#146;s death&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09042851000111"></a>Should it not read,</p>
<ul><a name="09042851000128"></a>&#147;at the date of X&#146;s death&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="09042851000112"></a>rather than,</p>
<ul><a name="09042851000129"></a>&#147;from the date of X&#146;s death&#148;?</ul>
<p><a name="09042851000113"></a>&#147;From&#148; indicates a continuum; &#147;at&#148; represents a point in time. This is a single point of measurement. I would be grateful if the Minister could confirm that. If I am wrong, it merely shows that perpetuities are even more complicated than I thought they were.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000026"></a>Specifically, I welcome the extension of the fixed perpetuity period to 125 years from 80 years in Clause 5. Clearly, we want as little complexity as possible. The more time that is offered in terms of the period, the greater time there is to sort out any difficulties that may arise. Therefore, the principle of Clause 5 is greatly to be welcomed. However, there is a problem with Clause 2 on exceptions to the rule&#146;s application. This concerns successive gifts to a charity. For example, charity A receives a gift but is unable, does not wish to or cannot fulfil the conditions of the gift, and so the gift goes to charity B and so on. Paragraph 39 of the Explanatory Notes lays this out very clearly. The exception for successive charitable gifts arises because any gift to a charity, whether to a named charity such as the lifeboats or to an exclusively charitable purpose, fulfils what I understand is the legal requirement for certainty. Therefore, it does not matter if the charitable purpose alters, because it remains a charitable purpose.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000027"></a>Clause 2 does not refer to the second of these gifts for charitable purposes, only to gifts to a charity in subsections (2) and (3). The definitions on page 17 of the Explanatory Notes state that a charity is:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09042851000122"></a>&#147;An organisation established for charitable purposes only&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09042851000114"></a>The 1964 Act allowed gifts for charitable purposes to be excluded from perpetuities. Therefore, when we consider the Bill in more detail, I hope that the  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC6"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC6</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government will think again about this because it represents a narrowing of the way in which perpetuities operate. In this highly technical area there may be an answer to this question, but a simple amendment to the relevant subsections of Clause 2 would enable us to address this apparent narrowing.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000028"></a>My second point concerns accumulations. Although we welcome making the accumulations rule much more straightforward and comprehensible, the charitable sector is concerned about the default provision of 21 years for charitable trusts. The Minister made clear in his opening remarks that there is an opportunity in Clause 14(2) for this to be set aside by a court or the Charity Commission. I accept that. It is also true that charitable trusts will probably be used less frequently in the future because we now have community interest companies and charitable incorporated organisations under the Charities Act 2006. Therefore, the trust structure may be used less in the future. Nevertheless, some people may wish to use trusts. I also accept that it will apply only going forward, not going back, although paragraph 25 at the top of page 6 of the Explanatory Notes states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09042851000123"></a>&#147;Accordingly existing trust instruments and wills, that is, those taking effect before commencement, will generally not be affected by the Bill&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09042851000115"></a>As I say, I am not a lawyer, but when I see words such as &#147;generally&#148; I begin to wonder what they mean in reality. I think that we should be doing everything that we can to encourage philanthropic endeavour, and this 21-year rule is an unduly heavy and inflexible sledgehammer.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000029"></a>I will illuminate the argument with three brief examples. Trusts may have what are known as wasting assets. The wasting assets could be in two particular forms. There will be leaseholds, where the trust&#146;s only asset is the lease of a property with an expiry date. When the lease comes to an end, the property reverts to the original owner; the trust no longer has any asset or any income and therefore will have to cease its operations. In such circumstances, it surely would be appropriate for the trust to be converting income to capital in the latter years of those leases in order to provide for endowment to enable it to carry on its original purposes. Many of these leases will run for longer than 21 years; they may be 99 years.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000030"></a>This comes to its sharpest point on things such as copyright. I think it was Westminster School that benefited enormously from the endowment of AA Milne&#146;s copyright on the Winnie the Pooh books. While Westminster School had a sufficiently large endowment to be able to avoid converting income to capital, because it had other capital endowment of its own, a charity with a single asset which was a valuable copyright would find, as the copyright began to run out, that it had to either cease operation or convert income to capital to provide a sum of money to enable it to continue operations. My Oxford college, being a poor college of relatively modern foundation, had at one time great hopes of getting the Reverend W Awdry&#146;s Thomas the Tank Engine books as he was a member of the college, but unfortunately it was unrequited in the end.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000031"></a>Wasting assets is one thing. Secondly, there is building up the sum endowed. The Minister and I in our different ways might decide that we wish to set up a charitable trust for a purpose that we feel is very worthwhile, and we get proper charitable permission but, being men of modest means, we can put only a smallish sum of capital in. We decide that during the rest of our lives, to have a decent sum of money for its future operation of our trust, we will roll up all the income and keep it in the capital so that there is a bigger pot for the trustees to work on after our death. The Minister and I&#151;I think I am a few years ahead of the Minister&#151;have a reasonable hope of passing 21 years, and therefore we would find that the rule as presently drafted would impact on us. That is a mistake because anything that encourages people to set up trusts and to accumulate income and build up the sum during a lifetime seems to me to be entirely sensible. Under the present rules you can do that, because the life of a settlor is the limit on accumulations at present.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000032"></a>Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, there is what I call the &#147;total return&#148; approach to investment management. Historically, people have considered the return on their investment as being two parts&#151;a flow of capital gain and a flow of income. The income comes from dividends and interest on bonds, and the capital gain comes from the increase in asset values. In recent years, those two streams have become increasingly co-mingled. They have become co-mingled because tax rates for private individuals have become much the same and therefore whether you took it as income or capital gains does not really matter, and because of the emergence of the new asset classes, such as private equity, where there is no income, only capital gains. Therefore, the total return concept of investment management has emerged. If you are looking for a 10 per cent return, you do not really mind whether it is 10 per cent capital gain or 10 per cent income, or some mixture of the two. I am concerned that in the way that we are currently looking at the Bill, with a 21-year life, some charitable trusts will find that the total return concept actually begins to work against the efficient operation of their investment management.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000033"></a>I have already accepted that Clause 14(2) provides a let-out. We are trying to work to a situation where we have certainty and where a philanthropist knows what he or she can do. It may be that you can hope that the court or the Charity Commission will deal with you kindly, but we could try to increase that certainty by providing something a little less inflexible than the present approach. It is bureaucratic. I also think that it brings the Charity Commission into an invidious position of having to make value judgments about the readiness and appropriateness of rolling up income and converting it to capital.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000034"></a>I conclude by welcoming the Bill&#146;s general approach. I have raised a couple of points which I hope the Government will consider and reflect on as we work through the Bill. The Charity Commission&#146;s strategic plan for 2008-11 gives it six tasks, two of which are to be innovative and responsive. I hope that the Government can be innovative and responsive as regards these questions.</p>

If that is not the sole topic of conversation in the village where I live, at least we will have something to relate on future winter evenings. For much too long, the excellent work of the Law Commission has gathered dust on remote shelves because the business managers of successive Governments have found more pressing work for the two Chambers. The report on which this Bill is based was dated 1998.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000036"></a>I do not presume to match the expertise of the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, nor of the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart. I intervene simply because, long ago, a distinguished predecessor of Sir Terence, Lord Scarman, and I plotted to introduce a more expeditious procedure for Law Commission Bills. But our efforts never came to fruition. I suspect that somewhere out there, he is now looking down on us with that enigmatic smile on his face. I regret that I was unable to attend the Second Reading last week of the Law Commission Bill, but I hope that the Government will accept my belated congratulations.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09042851000037"></a>I must confess that so far as I recollect, the last time I had occasion to discuss perpetuities and accumulations was while attempting a question in my law finals. I have grasped that sometimes the mysteries of the law really do engage with the real world. This Bill is not just an exercise in esoteric logic, nor even simply concerned with preserving intact vast estates. It is an attempt to enable ordinary people to make reasonable dispositions of their property without tripping over archaic tangles which, no doubt, once related to genuine practical problems. This is the Law Commission doing what I believe Lord Gardiner originally intended that it should; namely, building bridges between the law and the real world. It deserves to succeed.</p>

There has been no legislation on this since 1964, so I welcome the consensus that appears to lie behind the Bill. It is important to listen to the Chancery Bar, because it will be dealing with this. It is also a happy occasion to see a new procedure for Law Commission Bills. My very first job on graduation was with the commission under the late Lord Scarman, to whom we owe so much.</p>

<p><a name="09042854000002"></a>It would therefore be churlish for anyone to oppose the Bill, but I want to place a few points on record that I hope will be helpful. For example, Clause 1(1) is misleading. One starts by reading the Bill, and this clause suggests that the Bill contains the entire law of perpetuities. Only when they get to Clause 15 does the reader realise that the provisions apply prospectively, although including wills already made where the death occurs after commencement. The net effect of this prospective element is that the Law of Property Act 1925 and the Perpetuities and Accumulations Act 1964 will still be needed for about 100 years to come. This law, complicated as it is, is having yet another layer added to it, possibly needlessly, and it should be made plain  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC9"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC9</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>at the outset that this is what is happening. Were there to be a draftsman skilled enough, some consolidation might be a good idea, but I yield to no one in my admiration of the skilled drafting of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000003"></a>Imagine oneself a lawyer dealing with instruments and settlements affected by perpetuities. You would start, depending on the will of the instrument, by looking at the common law as it was before 1964. If the gift failed under common law, you would then move on to the 1964 Act and see if that helped by the application of &#147;wait and see&#148;. Then, prospectively, there will be this new Bill or something very much like it. Imagine the ignorance among high street solicitors; I have mentioned the Chancery Bar but not them.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000004"></a>My one claim to fame is that I used to lecture on this&#151;I did so for 20 years at Oxford. In a course of eight one-hour lectures we did no more than merely scrape the surface of the subject, and at the end of those eight hours I used to forget it until the following year came around. My second claim to fame was that when I first had the privilege of meeting the Prime Minister before last, Tony Blair, he told me that he remembered me from my lectures.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000005"></a>As soon as I left Oxford, your Lordships will be interested to know that perpetuities were removed as a compulsory part of the syllabus. There is now only one tutor, and he is retiring in three months&#146; time, who gives it two hours a year in tutorials. It is taught at University College, London, and to Cambridge graduates. There is an essay available for purchase online for baffled students who are prepared to download an essay if they need to hand one in. I doubt whether this subject is widely taught or known, and I suspect&#151;indeed, this has been said quite authoritatively in other common-law jurisdictions&#151;that wills are drawn up by lawyers in complete ignorance and carried out in the same state. There is an American film called &#147;Body Heat&#148;, starring Kathleen Turner, where the entire plot turns on the failure to notice the application of the rule against perpetuities in a will, although I suspect that I was the only person in the audience to have been overcome with excitement at that point.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000006"></a>Even where the rule is known by a skilled lawyer, the application of &#147;wait and see&#148;&#151;I will not go on for too long about this&#151;may often mean that the money is spent on the wrong person, because while one is waiting and seeing for maybe 125 years, or 80 years under current law, the trustees have the right to spend the money that is the subject of the trust on the prospective beneficiary, even though it may turn out in 50 years&#146; time that he or she was the wrong recipient.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000007"></a>&#147;Wait and see&#148;, which continues under this law, tempts the testator to reach out. If you know the law and that you have a period of 125 years, you might just as well try to apply conditions for as far ahead in the future as you possibly can on the chance that you might get what you want. That is because if the period of wait and see passes and the law then applies to exclude members of a class, you may very well achieve most of your objectives.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000008"></a>Moreover, some of the retained law is extremely controversial. Who are the lives in being for the purposes of wait and see under common law and under the   


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC10"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC10</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>1964 law? Learned articles still rage on this point and there are different schools of thought. There have been no decided cases that I can find directly on point of the 1964 Act since it was passed. We will be enacting this Bill without even knowing the result of the earlier attempt to reform it in 1964 and, of course, we will not know until probably the middle of this century, when I venture to suggest that many of us will not be around. That is because if people have started to wait and see under a will which came into effect in 1965, it could be some 80 years from then until we find out what happened.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000009"></a>It is therefore welcome that under Clause 12, a trustee who really does not know whether the lives have come to an end may choose to opt in to the new provisions. But the clause serves to demonstrate that the law could be retrospective, and there is no reason why it should not be. However, there will be problems: this involves not only who are the lives&#151;the lives specified in the gift&#151;but also the 1964 Act, which supplies a separate list. It is a question not only of who they are, but also whether they are still alive. It is therefore good that a fixed period of 125 years is provided, although it is probably too long and, of course, it is prospective. The much shorter period of 80 years was regarded as the proper length of time in the 1964 Act. As I have said, 125 years effectively removes any constraint on a testator when coupled with &#147;wait and see&#148;. Frankly, anything can be tried.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000010"></a>Having got this far in&#151;that the testator can probably almost do what he likes&#151;the whole rule becomes rather incredible and lacking in any sound base. It was based on a system of settlements when the age of majority was 21 and settled property was passed from generation to generation. That is simply not the case any more. We have held on to it because of our belief that you need some constraint on a testator or settler to stop them reaching out too far in the future. Indeed, some extraordinary things in which I have had dealings in another job have now come to pass. We all take it for granted, as explained in paragraph 6 of the Explanatory Notes, that A cannot produce more children once dead. However, I need hardly remind at least the younger Members of the Committee that because of advances in fertility law, even it if it is not common, it is perfectly possible to produce children once you are dead. Perhaps I may remind noble Lords of the famous Diane Blood case. It happens quite often in the United States when soldiers freeze their sperm before going off to fight. The statement in paragraph 6 of the Explanatory Notes used to be perfectly valid and understandable, but is no longer so. Further, there is the much-laughed-at clause, or so my students told me, from the Perpetuities and Accumulations Act 1964, that a woman cannot conceive over the age of 55. Noble Lords will know that virtually every day in the red-top press we have yet another story of a woman of 60 or 65 who, with the benefits of modern science, gives birth to what is always termed &#147;my miracle baby&#148;. The law simply does not make sense any more. For aficionados of the topic, Barton Leach&#146;s famous dictum that the child &#147;en ventre sa frigidaire&#148; or the impossibility of the fertile octogenarian have indeed come to pass.</p>




<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC11"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC11</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000011"></a>So we come down to the rationale of why we are keeping this rule. We are taking a leap into the dark because no economic analysis of it has been made, as admitted by the Law Commission. We simply do not know what the economic effect of the law was or will be. One Harvard article suggested that states in the US that abolish the rule have more investments coming their way. The rule does not exist in Scotland to any extent, or indeed in several jurisdictions, with no ill-effects reported. No research has been made into whether life plus 21 years or 125 years is what testators either use or desire. The only justification for the rule is the so-called &#147;dead hand rationale&#148;, in other words: stop the dead hand of the long-since dead testator reaching out into the future. That rationale is several hundred years old with, as I have said, no research behind it. After all, ever since 1925, property legislation has freed up several properties for sale. Taxation on settlements are penal, and it is taxation that will affect their status. The Trusts of Land and Appointments of Trustees Act 1996 gives extremely wide powers of investment. It is now impossible to create strict settlements.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000012"></a>However, the settlor, if he knows the law, can still exclude the power of the trustees to sell. The dead hand rationale has been undermined by tax law and by a testator&#146;s perception of the need to shed conditions and rearrange gifts every now and then when new tax laws are passed. Who, in 1900, could have said what the needs of today&#146;s beneficiaries might be, or the requirements of complying with or avoiding tax today, 109 years later? Yet that is the sort of situation that will arise 100 years from now. If anything, it could be argued that there is too little freedom of testation. The Inheritance Tax Act 1984 takes away great chunks of property on death, while the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975 ensures that family members receive property even where the testator did not want them to. Divorce settlements and the results of divorce will send property off in directions not foreseen.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000013"></a>One might say that it is time the settlor had a bit more liberty by abolishing the rule. The Bill, in effect, keeps a troublesome law while at the same time effectively removing its constraints because 125 years is such a long time. One might worry that, by making it easier to create future interests, we are encouraging donors and testators to suspend future ownership. Is making a gift, as this Bill will allow, to my descendants living in 125 years&#146; time, really a benefit to the public, and will it be welcomed by the family? A famous case called Green where a mother did not accept that her son had been lost in a wartime plane crash left her property,</p>
<ul><a name="09042854000083"></a>&#147;to my son if he reappears within the next 80 years&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09042854000074"></a>Such cases will be cured by the power in this Bill for the trustees. Where the extent of the life is uncertain, trustees will be able to opt in to the fixed-length provision here. But that will take the property out of commerce for even longer. The common law had a lot to be said for it because if a gift was bad, you knew it right away. The conditions were lost and the property was freed up. &#147;Wait and see&#148; has actually made the situation worse. By helping gifts of vest, as this Bill will do, one helps one member of the family at the expense of another.</p>




<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC12"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC12</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000014"></a>What is welcomed widely is that perpetuity will no longer apply to commercial interests, pensions and accumulations, and I think that that is right. There is concern in some quarters about removing the constraints on accumulation. It started with a case called Thellusson, which was a trust for prolonged accumulation, and it was feared at the time, almost 200 years ago, that the entire economy might have been sucked into this trust. In our present financial crisis, it is conceivable that a hedge fund might accumulate and suck up whatever is left of the entire economy. But it would be interesting to know whether economists think there is a real danger in removing this because we simply do not know; we have seen no economic analysis.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000015"></a>To conclude, I welcome the way in which the Bill positively applies perpetuities and takes them away from some other elements, I welcome the application of a fixed period of years, albeit I think it is rather long, and I welcome the drafting. My own preferences, though, would have been, first, abolition and, secondly, to leave it alone; however, if neither of those is on the cards, some consolidation of the three sets of law would be valuable.</p>

I did not put my name down to speak at Second Reading for the good reason that, as the prospective chairman of the committee that will be hearing evidence in due course, it seemed better that I should not express any view at all on the substance of the Bill. However, I did not want my silence today to be taken in any way as meaning that I had any doubts about the new procedure that we are adopting today for the first time; indeed, I warmly welcome it. The Minister said at the end of his introduction that he hoped that this would be the first of many Bills to adopt this course, and I entirely agree.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000017"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, said that he foresaw something of this kind many years ago when he was negotiating with Lord Scarman, the first chairman of the Law Commission. I just hope that the progress that the Bill takes through the House will fulfil some of his early hopes at that stage.</p>

This is the first Bill dealt with under the new procedure for Law Commission Bills. It is a pilot scheme, a trial to see whether the new procedure works. If it does, that will reduce the amount of time spent by Law Commission Bills on the Floor of the House, which is likely to make it possible to get more non-controversial Law Commission Bills enacted, and to get them enacted more swiftly than they are now. That would be very desirable.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000019"></a>This Bill, which is technical and, I believe, non-controversial, is based on the Law Commission&#146;s report that was published 11 years ago, in 1998. Proceedings should have been possible that meant it could have been enacted within a matter of two or three years of the publication of the report. Of course controversial  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC13"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC13</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>or important Bills, even though based on Law Commission reports, will continue to go through the usual procedure, as they should. That will deal with Bills on such recent Law Commission reports as its report on murder or that on the law of corruption.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000020"></a>I turn to the Bill itself. Perpetuities and accumulations are a subject that I am familiar with; indeed, I am prepared to say that looking at it now makes me quite nostalgic. Trusts were a substantial part of my practice as a member of the Chancery Bar, and trusts require knowledge of the rule against perpetuities and the rule against accumulations. The rule against perpetuities limits the time for which money or other property can be held in a trust, and the rule against accumulations limits the time for which income yielded by assets held in those trusts can be added to trust capital instead of being distributed to beneficiaries as income. However, while those principles are in fact both quite simple, the mechanism by which they have been applied is immensely complicated. I will not add to what the Minister has said about how those rules operate, but they are plainly complicated and anachronistic and need to be simplified.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000021"></a>I have some doubts about the detail of two of the Law Commission&#146;s proposals that are proposed to be enacted in the Bill. My first doubt, which I share with the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, concerns whether the perpetuity period of 125 years is too long. I think that it plainly is because if such a rule had been in force in the past, it would mean that a trust set up in 1885 could still be in effect for a few more months. That seems to me pretty absurd. I therefore agree with the noble Baroness that this is a longer period than is needed. However, I do not agree with her that no perpetuity period should be imposed. I think it is desirable that there should be a limit on the time during which any owner of property can direct what happens to that property through creating a trust. If somebody wishes to set up a trust for a young, seriously disabled child who will never be able to manage his or her own affairs, and who might have a long life, that might suggest a maximum period of something like 100 years, given that a large number of people now live into their 90s. However, we can look at that point in detail later.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000022"></a>I also have doubts about the complete abolition of the rule against accumulations. The origin of that rule was the decision of a wealthy banker, Mr Thellusson, to leave a large part of his estate on trust to accumulate the income for the whole period of the trust, which was until the death of his last male descendant living at Mr Thellusson&#146;s death. In theory, the effect of compound interest could have produced a gigantic sum of money by the end of the trust period. That is not so much a danger nowadays given the costs of running a trust, but I think it is still plainly undesirable that property should be locked up so that it cannot be applied for the benefit of anybody over a long period. While Mr Thellusson&#146;s will was, to say the least, an eccentric action, under this Bill as it now stands there would be no way of preventing a new Thellusson creating a similar trust, which I do not think is desirable. My own preference is to allow the accumulation of income throughout a trust period but only as a power for the trustees to implement, not as an obligation imposed on them by the settler or the testator.

<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000023"></a>I noted with interest what the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, said. That is a matter of detail to be dealt with by the Special Public Bill Committee when that is set up, as it shortly will be, and it will need considering. I hope that he will give evidence on that matter to that committee when it is formed. The noble Baroness, Lady Deech, made an important point concerning what to do with the existing trusts, which may go on for many years. I do not think there is an absolute solution to that, but in some circumstances at any rate it may be possible for trustees to opt into the new law and get out of the more complicated old one. Those are the sort of technical issues that ought to be left to the Special Public Bill Committee, not debated on the Floor of your Lordships' House. Subject, therefore, to the points that I have just mentioned, I am strongly in favour of the Bill and in principle I am completely in favour of it. My concerns rest only on relatively subsidiary points. I hope that the Bill will now be formally sent on its way in a day or two&#146;s time to the Special Public Bill Committee. I look forward to the works of that committee.</p>
<h5><a name="09042854000087"></a>4.35 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09042854000024"></a><b><a name="90428-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09042854000094"></a>Lord Kingsland:</b> If we needed any reminder about the historic nature of this Second Reading, it could not have been brought home to us more forcefully than the intervention of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer. It is difficult to convince oneself that it is now more than 35 years since he became Her Majesty&#146;s Solicitor-General, an office which he adorned for many years. I know, because he has told me on a previous occasion, how much he admired Lord Scarman; and his story about their conspiracy does not surprise me in the least. The fact that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, not only took the trouble to come this afternoon but also contributed has enriched the whole occasion.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000025"></a>The initial stage of this new procedure involves the three political parties agreeing that this Bill is uncontroversial. I was perfectly happy to do that and continued in this sublime state of ignorance until I heard the intervention of the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, whose intermittently excoriating remarks about the Government&#146;s draft led me to believe that we are going to have a much more exciting Committee stage than I thought we would. We are extremely lucky that the noble Baroness has taken an interest in this matter. She reminded your Lordships that she lectured on this subject at Oxford University for 20 years. But she modestly failed also to say that she plays a prominent part in the footnotes of the Law Commission&#146;s Bill, particularly in respect of an article entitled, &#147;Lives in Being Revived&#148;, which appeared in the greatest legal periodical that we publish in this country, the <I>Law Quarterly Review</I>. I look forward greatly to later stages of this Bill when I know that the noble Baroness will play a prominent part.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000026"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, made what I believe the noble Lord, Lord Bach, would describe as a characteristically Goodhartian intervention. The noble  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC15"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC15</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord, Lord Goodhart, is of course on home ground in talking about this subject. I suspect that not only the noble Lord, but also his clerk, is rather nostalgic about the days in practice when he had a succession of perpetuities and accumulation cases. He is an acknowledged master in this field and I know that the Government will listen very carefully to any criticisms he has to make about the Bill.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000027"></a>However, the Opposition has their own well established track record in this sphere. My noble friend Lord Henley is a member of the committee. Indeed, he sits beside me as I speak. His great-great-great-great grandfather was Robert Henley, the Earl of Northington, who, in 1759, sitting in your Lordships&#146; House as Lord Keeper, handed down a much admired and much cited judgment on perpetuities and entails in the leading case of Marlborough (Duke) v Earl Godolphin. He said, inter alia:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09042854000079"></a>&#147;The common law seemed wisely to consider that the real property of this state ought, to a degree, to be put in commerce, to be left free to answer the exigencies of the possessors and their families, and therefore permitted no perpetuities by way of entails: although it allowed contingent remainders, it afforded them no protection ... if the law would permit the confinement of an estate beyond a life in being, and the time for a remainderman&#146;s minority to expire&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09042854000075"></a>To these great matters, I have no doubt that my noble friend will bring the same clarity and perspicacity as did his illustrious ancestor exactly 250 years ago.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000028"></a>I also observe that we are extremely fortunate to have heard this afternoon from my noble friend Lord Hodgson, whose combined experience of intensive work on charities law when it came before your Lordships' House not long ago, together with his experience in the City, has given us a great deal of matters to think about.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000029"></a>Unlike many of your Lordships who have spoken this afternoon, I have been rather taken by the Bill. I suppose that the reason for that is the way in which I approached it by, first, looking carefully&#151;some might say uncharacteristically carefully&#151;at the Law Commission report, which I find a most impressive document. I start as someone who has no experience in practice of this subject; so I am perhaps impressed in a way that some who are more familiar with it were not.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000030"></a>Very succinctly, graphically and effectively, the commission put the issue right at the beginning of its introduction:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09042854000080"></a>&#147;A property owner is thinking of making a will or creating a trust. How far into the future should the law allow him or her to reach when tying up that property? Can he or she control the devolution of that property indefinitely? For a lifetime? For a fixed period of years? How far should one generation be given the freedom to dispose of property in ways that will restrict the freedom of the next?&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09042854000076"></a>That is the scope of the investigations that lie before us.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000031"></a>As your Lordships know, since Lord Nottingham's judgment in the Duke of Norfolk case in 1681, there has been a rule against perpetuities, requiring future dispositions of property to vest within a prescribed time limit and making void those dispositions that fall outside it. Despite its name, the rule is concerned with the commencement of interests rather than their duration.</p>




<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC16"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC16</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000032"></a>Historically&#151;as, again, I am sure your Lordships are well aware&#151;the rule falls into two phases. For dispositions taking place before 16 July 1964, the date when the Perpetuities and Accumulations Act took effect, the common law rule prevailed. That is to say that a future interest in property will be void from the date that the instrument that seeks to create it takes effect if there is the merest chance that the interest may invest outside the perpetuity period. This period comprises one or more lives in being plus 21 years. After 15 July 1964, the interest will be void only if it is inevitable that it vests outside the perpetuity period. It is therefore necessary to wait and see to determine whether or not the interest will vest within the prescribed common law period. The 1964 Act furnishes an alternative perpetuity period of up to 80 years and 21 years for options.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000033"></a>Your Lordships have heard the trenchant criticisms made by the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, about the deficiencies in the &#147;wait and see&#148; approach. She is quite right in saying that that concept is preserved in the new law. I must confess that I find her observations most illuminating in that regard. I shall find myself in Committee being more inquiring about that matter than I might otherwise have been.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000034"></a>As far as accumulations are concerned, at common law&#151;again, as we have learnt this afternoon&#151;they were permitted for the duration of the perpetuity period. The modern rule&#151;again, as we have learnt this afternoon&#151;has its origin in the Accumulation Act 1800, which followed the notorious case of Thellusson v Woodford, whose judgment was handed down in 1799. In its existing state, the law prescribes no fewer than six periods during which the accumulation of income is permitted. Four are set out in Section 164 of the Law of Property Act 1925, and two more in Section 13 of the 1964 Act.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90428-gc0003.htm"/>


<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000035"></a>The legislation before your Lordships today seeks to achieve three objectives. The first is to restrict the application of the rule against perpetuities to successive estates and interests in property. It will no longer apply to rights over property such as options, rights of pre-emption and future easements, and would exclude virtually all pension schemes. Secondly, in future, to those remaining interests to which it still applied, there will be a single perpetuity period of 125 years, and the principle of &#147;wait and see&#148; will apply. Thirdly, the rule against excessive accumulation will be abolished except in relation to charitable trusts. These proposals, moreover, when implemented would have prospective and not retrospective effect, as the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, has again pointed out. In other words, we will at the point of implementation and thereafter have three perpetuity and accumulation regimes. The relevant regime in any particular case will, of course, depend on the date of the instrument seeking to create the future interest.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000036"></a>These legislative proposals, essentially, seek to rectify two major flaws in the operation of the existing rules. First, the existing rules were designed to prevent settlers or testators from tying up property so that it was kept in the family permanently. However, its application has developed, as we have seen, so as to cover a variety of future interests that arise in a commercial context,  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC17"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC17</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>such as future easements or options to acquire valuable consideration and interest in land. Secondly, there is considerable uncertainty as to its application both to certain types of pension schemes and to nominations and advancements made under pension schemes.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000037"></a>Clarification with respect to pension schemes appears to have been of particular concern to the Law Commission. Pension schemes are established under trusts. Under them, benefits are made contingent upon beneficiaries attaining a certain pensionable age. Moreover, some benefits may be contingent on the exercise of discretion by trustees. In Lucas v Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Co. Ltd, it was decided that the rule against perpetuities does apply to pension scheme trusts. In that case, Mr Justice Russell held that the period begins to run when the scheme is established. A competing approach is to say that every time an employee forms a scheme, a new settlement is created and he or she is treated as the settlor, so that the perpetuity rule applies to each individual settlement. Under that happier construction, the vesting of any benefits under the pension in favour of the employee&#146;s dependants is almost certain to happen within the perpetuity period. Attractive as the latter analysis is, however, we cannot be sure that it is the law.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000038"></a>Since 1927 there have been statutory exemptions from the rule for certain types of pension scheme. The present position is to be found in Section 163 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993, which states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09042854000081"></a>&#147;The rules of law relating to perpetuities shall not apply to the trusts of, or any disposition made under or for the purposes of a personal or occupational pension scheme at any time when this section applies to it&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09042854000039"></a>This section applies whether the trusts are made before or after Section 163 comes into effect. However, the section does not revive, with retrospective effect, any trusts that the perpetuity rules require to be treated as void before Section 163 becomes applicable.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000040"></a>The application of Section 163 is wide, comprising public service pension schemes, contracted-out occupational pension schemes and personal pension schemes. Nevertheless, the section is not all-encompassing&#151;it excludes, for example, unapproved retirement benefit schemes.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000041"></a>It seems obvious that the need to place limits on the extent to which one generation can control the devolution of property for the future has no relevance to pension funds. Moreover, the reasons for exempting pension schemes from the rule apply to approved and unapproved schemes alike. Why should unapproved schemes to which the perpetuities rule currently applies have to be wound up on a date that is entirely arbitrary?</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000042"></a>The approach to reform adopted by the Law Commission in its 1998 report is inclusionary. The commissioners defined those interests to which the rule should apply rather than those to which it should not. Your Lordships will be relieved to hear that I do not intend to comment on the Bill clause by clause this afternoon; otherwise what is the point of hearing evidence on it? This exercise is best left to a later stage in the procedure, following the evidential hearings. However, I have already noted the observations that the Charity Law Association made when responding to the Law Commission consultations in September  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC18"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC18</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>2008. Generally speaking, we warmly welcome this Bill, which seeks to simplify what the Charity Law Association describes as this,</p>
<ul><a name="09042854000084"></a>&#147;complex and somewhat illogical area of law&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09042854000077"></a>The provisions, with one or two mildly controversial exceptions, appear to have achieved the objective of narrowing the scope for the perpetuities rule by excluding from its grasp pension arrangements and commercial transactions. Moreover, the introduction of an exclusive period for those matters that remain subject to the rule is a welcome simplification; and the extension of time from 80 to 125 years appears unlikely to inhibit the objectives of future settlors, except in the most unusual circumstances.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000043"></a>As far as the law relating to accumulations is concerned, the six options open to settlors until now are to be abolished and replaced by a single period of 21 years, which applies only to charities. If I may respectfully say so to the Government&#151;as yet I have not heard the evidence&#151;this is the one component part of the Bill on which I have hesitations; so I might as well express them now. I wonder whether it would have been wiser to permit, as an alternative to 21 years, the life of the settlor. Given the important role that charitable grants play in our society, I should have thought that we ought to give as much encouragement to settlors as possible.</p>

I hope that House will be pleased to hear that I do not intend to make a long speech in response. The Special Public Bill Committee is the place for many of the matters raised today to be debated, under the chairmanship of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick.

<p>That the Committee do report to the House that it has considered the European Communities (Definition of Treaties) (United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) Order 2009.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="09042854000050"></a><b><a name="90428-gc0003.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09042854000097"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> In speaking to this, I will cover the basis on which the Government propose to ratify this important convention, including the reservations and the interpretative declaration. These are issues that have been covered in the recent report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which is the subject of the Motion to be moved by the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill. I shall turn to these points shortly.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000051"></a>The order specifies the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as a Community treaty for the purposes of the European Communities Act 1972. The provisions of Section 2 of the Act, which provide for the general implementation of Community treaties, will apply in relation to the UN Convention and will be available for implementation of its provisions should the need arise.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000052"></a>In my view the provisions of this order are compatible with the rights in the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000053"></a>The need for specification arises due to the involvement of the European Community which, as noble Lords will be aware, is a signatory to the UN Convention and proposes to become a party to it, in accordance with UN Convention Article 44. Once the European  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC20"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC20</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Community becomes a party to the UN Convention, its provisions, so far as they are within Community competence, will form an integral part of the Community&#146;s legal system.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000054"></a>Matters covered by the UN Convention lie partly within the competence of the European Community by virtue of, for example, Community law on discrimination, and partly within the competence of member states. It is accepted practice, agreed with the European Commission, that mixed agreements such as the UN Convention, which may give rise to directly effective rights, are specified as Community treaties.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000055"></a>The order therefore ensures that the UK is in a position to give effect to Community obligations falling on it as a result of the UN Convention&#146;s incorporation into the Community legal order. Specification enables the provisions of Section 2 of the European Communities Act 1972 to be used to implement any Community obligations which may arise as a result of the convention&#146;s incorporation into the Community legal system and enables expenditure to be incurred out of the Consolidated Fund for that purpose.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000056"></a>While no implementation measures under the powers conferred by specification are at present required, the order must be in place before the UN Convention can be ratified. The order is, therefore, a technical but crucial step in achieving our shared aim of UK ratification of the UN Convention, and I beg to move that it should be approved.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000057"></a>I will move on to discuss the UN Convention, more generally. We are reaching the end of the process leading up to ratification, and will soon be looking to the more exciting journey of implementation. At this point, I would like to pay particular tribute to all those who have campaigned on behalf of disabled people and have helped us to reach this point. These include, of course, my noble friend Lord Morris of Manchester, whose work in the field of disability rights in both the domestic and international arenas is universally recognised. My noble friend specifically asked me to say that he may be unable to join us today because he is, characteristically, moving an amendment on the Health Bill, but he would join us if he could. Of course, there are others as well, such as the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, and the noble Lord, Lord Ashley. The work of my noble friend Lord Morris on Rehabilitation International&#146;s <I>Charter for the Third Millennium</I> was in many ways the origin of the call for a UN convention on disability rights, a call which culminated in the adoption by the UN General Assembly of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000058"></a>I also want to pay tribute to the work of Lady Darcy de Knayth, who is sadly no longer with us. For it was the noble Baroness who, on 14 July 2000, opened the first debate here on the case for a UN convention on the rights of disabled people.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000059"></a>As I have said, we are close to being able to ratify this convention and, subject to consideration of our debate today and the Government&#146;s consideration of the JCHR&#146;s recommendations, I hope that it will be possible to make an announcement next month&#151;May&#151;about the basis on which we will do so.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000060"></a>Let me now talk about the proposals that we have put forward. The basis on which we propose to ratify  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC21"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC21</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was set out in the Explanatory Memorandum that was laid before Parliament on 3 March. As I have said, our proposals have now been the subject of a report by the JCHR. The Government are currently considering the detail of that report&#146;s recommendations and will respond in full in due course. I cannot prejudge the outcome of that consideration today, but I will rehearse briefly the rationale for the position we adopted.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000061"></a>I know that all noble Lords will share the Government&#146;s view of the importance of this convention. It is a powerful statement of the human rights of disabled people in the UK and internationally. While it does not confer new rights, it is an explicit statement that the estimated 650 million disabled people across the world have, and should enjoy, the same human rights as others.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000062"></a>The convention is very wide-ranging in its application and covers all areas of life. In government we have always been very clear about the benefits of the convention. That is why we supported the negotiations leading up to its adoption, why we signed it as soon as it was possible to do so on 30 March 2007, and why we believe that it is important that the UK ratifies it at the earliest opportunity. We have been working hard to achieve this ambition.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000063"></a>There should be no doubt about the UK&#146;s continued commitment to human rights for disabled people at home and abroad. The convention sets international standards for human rights, and it will be incumbent on the UN member states that ratify it to act consistently with its obligations when it comes into force.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000064"></a>The UK already has extensive legislation that outlaws discrimination against disabled people; yet it is undeniable that they still face complex and diverse threats to their rights. Disabled people can too often be easily dismissed or undervalued. The Government&#146;s pledge is that by 2025 disabled people should have the same opportunities and choices as non-disabled people, and should be respected and included as equal members of society. Our firm commitment to the convention is part and parcel of our commitment to the achievement of this equality. I might add that our signature of the optional protocol to this convention, which we also intend to ratify, is further demonstration of our commitment.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000065"></a>As the Government set out in the Explanatory Memorandum, we are proposing to ratify the convention on the basis of a handful of reservations and one interpretative declaration. I recognise that these have been the subject of considerable discussion, and that there is a body of opinion that argues that some or all are not needed.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000066"></a>With regard to education, the Government are proposing to enter an interpretative declaration to make clear that the UK general education system includes both mainstream and special schools, thereby clarifying how the UK Government interpret the convention.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000067"></a>We are also proposing to enter a reservation to allow for circumstances where disabled children&#146;s needs may be best met through specialist provision, which may be some way from their home, and which means that they will need to be educated outside their local community. This also maintains parental choice for schools outside the local community. The purpose of  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC22"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC22</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the proposed reservation and declaration is to maintain the present policy and legislative position in respect of inclusive education.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000068"></a>On freedom of movement, a general reservation is proposed in order to retain the right to apply Immigration Rules and to retain the right to introduce wider health screening for applicants entering or seeking to remain in the UK, particularly in the event of a global health emergency, if this is considered necessary to protect public health. However, the Government are committed to reviewing that reservation 12 months after the UK has ratified the convention, in order to assess whether there is a continued need for it in practice. Disabled people and their organisations will be consulted at an early stage to ascertain how they can be involved in formulating the review.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000069"></a>The Explanatory Memorandum explained that the UK&#146;s reservation in respect of service in the Armed Forces and a complementary one proposed by the European Commission in respect of its proposals for European Community conclusion&#151;that is, ratification&#151;would be the subject of discussion. Following, and reflecting, discussion with the European Commission, the Government propose to enter a reservation in respect of the Armed Forces in the following terms:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09042854000082"></a>&#147;The United Kingdom accepts the provisions of the Convention, subject to the understanding that none of its obligations relating to equal treatment in employment and occupation, shall apply to the admission into or service in any of the naval, military or air forces of the Crown&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09042854000078"></a>That is a slight change of wording, but the substance and rationale for the reservation have not changed. We believe that these provisions are required to preserve the combat effectiveness of the Armed Forces. The Armed Forces are called on to perform a wide range of different tasks, and great damage would be done if the base requirement for physical fitness was abandoned.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000070"></a>Lastly, a reservation is proposed in respect of arrangements for social security benefit appointees. In looking at the relevant article in the convention, my department has been carefully considering the arrangements whereby a person may be appointed to claim and collect benefits on behalf of another person who for the time being is unable to act due to physical or mental incapacity. At present, those arrangements are not subject to the safeguard of regular review. We believe that the convention requires that they should be, so my department is now actively working towards a proportionate system of review. We propose to withdraw the reservation as soon as the arrangements are in place. It is important that we address this issue, and we are engaging with relevant stakeholders, including disabled people and their organisations, as our work on the review of the arrangements progresses.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000071"></a>As I said earlier, I recognise that there is a body of opinion that believes that the UK should not have any reservations or interpretative declarations, or should reduce their number. It has been suggested that by entering them we will undermine the UK&#146;s reputation as a leader in the field of disability rights. We will continue to consider the views expressed by the Joint Committee on Human Rights and others before we make a final decision on how to proceed. The Government&#146;s view, however, is that it is better to ratify the convention now with a small number of reservations rather than  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC23"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC23</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>delay in the hope that they will not be needed&#151;a view shared, I believe, with the JCHR.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000072"></a>To those who suggest that we are undermining our reputation, I argue that our approach must be seen in the wider context of our achievements in respect of disabled people. For example, the Independent Living Strategy details over 50 government commitments that seek to deliver real choice and control for disabled people, along with greater access to housing, health, education and training, employment, transport and participation in community and family life. The Welfare Reform Bill, which, hopefully, will get its Second Reading tomorrow, includes provision to give disabled people a right to control certain services that they use and will pilot how that right will work.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="09042854000073"></a>Ratification of the convention is key if we are to send the very strong and clear message to both disabled and non-disabled people that disabled people have, and should be able to enjoy, the same human rights as others. Specification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as a Community treaty for the purposes of the European Communities Act 1972 is a prerequisite to achieving that ambition, and I therefore commend the order to the House. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09042864000001"></a><b><a name="90428-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09042864000295"></a>Lord Lester of Herne Hill:</b> I will move that the Grand Committee has considered the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, <I>United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities: Reservations and Interpretative Declarations</I>. This is the 12th report, HL Paper 70.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000002"></a>The JCHR has previously published a full report on the Convention&#151;HL Paper 9 of 4 January 2009&#151;and on the Government&#146;s response to that report&#151;HL Paper 46 of 6 March 2009. We warmly welcome the Government&#146;s decision to ratify the convention and to sign the optional protocol. As the Equality and Human Rights Commission has said, the convention represents a major milestone on disabled people&#146;s journey from being treated largely as objects of welfare and charity to being respected as full citizens, with the rights and responsibilities that this status confers.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000003"></a>However, we do not welcome the Government&#146;s refusal to consult publicly about the reservations that they intend to make, or the unnecessary breadth of those reservations. I am grateful to the Minister for his helpful introductory speech and for the indication that the Government&#146;s mind is still ajar and not firmly closed to some of the issues that I shall be raising. I have given notice in advance of some of the questions that I will ask, in so far as they are not clear already.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0003.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000004"></a>I am delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, and my noble friend Lord Maclennan are taking part in this debate, because of their particular experience and concern about the role of Parliament in scrutinising treaties. This is a subject that I have frequently raised in Private Member&#146;s Bills and evidence to the Wakeham committee on Lords reform. I persuaded the previous Conservative Government to enhance parliamentary scrutiny by publishing Explanatory Memorandums when laying conventions to Parliament prior to their ratification, as was done in this case on 3 March, but, despite the Wakeham committee&#146;s recommendations,

The Government have lost enthusiasm for even their timid Constitutional Renewal Bill, grandly described two years ago as,</p>
<ul><a name="09042864000259"></a>&#147;intended to rebalance power between Parliament and Government, and give Parliament more ability to hold Government to account&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09042864000219"></a>It looks more and more likely that that will not be part of this Government&#146;s legacy.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000005"></a>Parliament rarely has the opportunity to scrutinise conventions before they are ratified. The reasons why the House has this brief opportunity to do so are, first, because, as the Minister has explained, the Government have to obtain approval for the draft order specifying the convention as a Community treaty for the purposes of the European Communities Act 1972, and, secondly<I>, </I>because the JCHR has produced a scrutiny report. I managed with help from the Government Whips&#146; Office, for which I am grateful, to squeeze in my Motion while time was running under the Ponsonby rule. I believe that this has never happened before. For the benefit of those who do not know much about the Ponsonby rule, it resulted from the fact that Ramsay MacDonald and his junior Ministers did not like secret treaty-making during the First World War. In the early 1920s, during the debate on the Treaty of Locarno, Arthur Ponsonby, the son of the private secretary to Queen Victoria, got up and gabbled out a new procedure that became the Ponsonby rule. It was out of order but it is a convention which applies to both Houses. The only safeguard that Parliament has is that a convention is laid before Parliament before ratification, but not that there is normally a debate.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000006"></a>I greatly welcome the fact that we are able to have this debate, but I suggest that there is a pressing need to meet the need for better parliamentary oversight of treaty-making as regards important multilateral conventions and other treaties which reach into the nooks and crannies of our lives, while not unduly hampering the necessary powers of the Executive, as happens in the United States Senate. I do not think that we want that. In the JCHR's first report, we recommended that the Government should publish the outcome of their own review of the compatibility of domestic law and practice with the requirements of the convention. That would assist with more detailed scrutiny of the Government&#146;s approach to ratification. The Government should be able to explain clearly why they consider that UK law and administrative practice currently comply with the requirements of the convention.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000007"></a>I am sorry to say that the Government&#146;s response was lamentable. They said have said that,</p>
<ul><a name="09042864000260"></a>&#147;it would be neither practical nor desirable for details of all the matters that have been considered and resolved in over two years work to be published&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09042864000220"></a>That is not what we sought and this is the only opportunity for Parliament to be informed by the Minister about the Government&#146;s views on compatibility with domestic law and practice. We hope that he will be able to do so today and, if not today, in writing quickly thereafter.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000008"></a>The JCHR considers that the Government should have consulted on both the justifications for and the  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC25"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC25</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>precise terms of the reservations and interpretative declarations they proposed to make to the convention. This should have been done either before the convention was laid before Parliament on 3 March or for a specified period thereafter. We explained in our report:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09042864000245"></a>&#147;It is not acceptable for the Government to claim that consultation cannot take place now because of the need to ratify as soon as possible, when the Government delayed its own timetable for ratification in order for departments to agree their positions. Nor can inviting disabled people and organisations to write to the Minister or other parliamentarians be a substitute for a proper consultation on the terms on which the UK will ratify the Convention&#148;.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000009"></a>The JCHR report deals with parliamentary involvement in the ratification process in paragraphs 14 to 18. We again draw attention to the limited extent to which Parliament can scrutinise the Government&#146;s proposals to ratify treaties and we call on the Government to bring forward their proposals for enhancing parliamentary scrutiny of treaties as soon as possible, whether in the Constitutional Renewal Bill or otherwise. We hope the Minister will be able to give in his reply concrete details about the Government's intentions.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000010"></a>We also seek clarification in this debate, regarding paragraph 20 of our report, on whether specifying the convention as a Community treaty is a necessary step to UK ratification and how this will affect the UK&#146;s timetable for ratification, particularly if the scrutiny reserves of parliamentary EU committees are engaged. As regards the Explanatory Memorandum, in paragraph 22 we express regret that it provides no explanation of the Government&#146;s view that the proposals for reservations and an interpretative declaration are compatible with the object and purpose of the convention, which is crucial.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000011"></a>The JCHR&#146;s experience in scrutinising the UK's implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is that reservations, once in place, tend to persist even where UN monitoring bodies, parliamentary committees and civil society organisations are united in the view that they are unnecessary and incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty. We start our scrutiny from the standpoint that there should be as few such statements as possible&#151;preferably none&#151;and that where such statements are necessary, the Government should be committed to making the legislative and other changes necessary to enable them to be withdrawn as soon as possible. We ask the Minister to explain whether the Government agree, and if not, what are their reasons.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000012"></a>We suggest that there are three relevant questions to ask: first, are the proposals necessary; secondly, are the proposals compatible with the object and purpose of the convention; and, thirdly, are there any other additional matters about the Government's proposals that both Houses should consider?</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000013"></a>I turn to the particular issues about the reservations and, first, to the heading:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09042864000246"></a>&#147;Special schools and parental choice; Right to education (Article 24)&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09042864000221"></a>which is dealt with in our report at paragraphs 33 to 46. That is a sensitive issue. The committee understands why the Government feel it necessary to enter a reservation and an interpretative declaration to make clear their understanding that a commitment to inclusive education  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC26"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC26</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is not incompatible with the continued existence of special schools. However, like the EHRC, we are concerned that the scope of the reservation and declaration may send a confused message to people with disabilities about the purpose and intention of the Government's position. I know that my noble friend Lady Thomas of Winchester has particular concerns about that, and we ask the Minister to confirm that the Government do not intend to dilute the strong statutory presumption in favour of mainstream education for children with special educational needs. We also seek confirmation that the purpose is simply to clarify that nothing in the convention requires the UK to work towards the eventual elimination of special schools.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000014"></a>The EHRC has pointed out that a number of other countries with broadly similar approaches to the education of disabled children and which operate both special and mainstream schools, including Australia, New Zealand and Germany, have felt such declarations and reservations to be unnecessary. That is because they interpret Article 24 to require the progressive realisation of an inclusive education system. For example, Germany has not expressed a reservation in relation to Article 24 despite the fact that fewer than 16 per cent of disabled children in Germany experience inclusive schooling.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000015"></a>The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland points out that the Education Minister in Northern Ireland has stated that the convention should be ratified without the interpretive declaration and reservation on education for disabled children. The Northern Ireland commission does not consider that the proposed reservation is necessary, based on the wording of Article 24, which provides that,</p>
<ul><a name="09042864000261"></a>&#147;reasonable accommodation of the individual's requirements&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09042864000222"></a>must be provided.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000016"></a>We look to the Minister to explain the reasons for the Government's insistence on both a declaration and a reservation in respect of Article 24, displaying what the EHRC describes as,</p>
<ul><a name="09042864000262"></a>&#147;an unnecessary and disproportionate degree of cautiousness&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000017"></a>I turn to the heading:</p>
<ul><a name="09042864000263"></a>&#147;Service in the Armed Forces: Work and employment (Article 27)&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000018"></a>As the Minister explained, the Government intend to make a reservation excluding the application of the convention as regards admission into or service in any of the naval, military or air forces of the Crown. So far, no other EU party to the convention has made such a reservation. In the JCHR's view, the existing exemption in the Disability Discrimination Act is incompatible with the convention. We have reiterated at paragraph 57 our recommendation that it should be reconsidered in the Equality Bill. Given the breadth of the proposed reservation, seeking to remove a major public authority from basic provision on non-discrimination in access to employment, we consider that it is open to challenge as being incompatible with the object and purpose of the convention.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000019"></a>The EHRC believes that the Armed Forces exemption from the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 should be lifted in line with the lifting of the previous exemptions for the police and fire services; that recruitment should be based on assessments of individual merit, rather than on the basis of stereotype or prejudice; and that  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC27"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC27</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>an independent review exercise should be carried out to determine the risk to the Armed Forces' operational effectiveness if the exemption is lifted.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000020"></a>The Minister's response, in his letter to the EHRC of 23 March, contends that a direct comparison cannot be drawn between the police or fire services and serving in the Armed Forces. In the words of the right honourable John Hutton MP:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09042864000247"></a>&#147;There are distinct differences, not least in the unique physical and mental demands placed on our Armed Forces working for prolonged periods in difficult and stressful situations in arduous terrain&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09042864000223"></a>For the same reason, the Minister rejected the EHRC's request for an independent review, which he described as potentially &#147;dangerous&#148;.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000021"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Gould, may recall, the MoD used to use similar arguments to justify excluding women from protection against sex discrimination, until EC law came to the rescue. Members of the Armed Forces are now protected by the employment provisions of the main anti-discrimination enactments, except in the case of the Disability Discrimination Act and the age regulations. It is wholly disproportionate to exclude everyone from protection against disability discrimination throughout the Armed Forces.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000022"></a>It is regrettable that the Equality Bill, published yesterday, fails to remove the existing exemption. On the contrary, paragraph 4 of Schedule 9, in volume II, maintains blatant discrimination on the face of the Bill. In the case of women and transsexuals, it must be shown that an otherwise discriminatory requirement is a,</p>
<ul><a name="09042864000264"></a>&#147;proportionate means of ensuring the combat effectiveness of the armed forces&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09042864000224"></a>By contrast, no such proof or safeguard applies. We hope that Parliament, if the Government do not do so, will amend this provision during the passage of the Bill. It is extraordinary that someone might be injured in war on behalf of the Crown but that, in theory, the provision allows blanket discrimination against them if they are disabled from doing jobs in the Armed Forces that have nothing to do with operational requirements.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000023"></a>We ask the Minister to agree to comply with the EHRC's request to see the evidence taken into account by officials in formulating the decision to maintain the reservation, as has been done by the right honourable Ed Balls MP in relation to the reservation for special schools. We also ask the Government to accept the JCHR's recommendation in paragraph 57 to at least keep any reservation under review and to reconsider its necessity after six months of Royal Assent being granted to the Equality Bill. We very much hope, however, that Parliament will boot the provision out altogether, or produce a more moderate exception.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000024"></a>I move on to immigration and liberty of movement. I appreciate that the Minister is having to answer for the MoD and the Home Office, which are not his departments, and is doing the best he can; I sympathise. We have expressed our regret at the lack of clarity in the Explanatory Memorandum in respect of the implications of the proposed reservation on liberty of movement for the requirements of the convention.  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC28"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC28</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The breadth of the proposed reservation and its purpose is entirely unclear. We are disappointed in the elastic text of the proposed reservation, which confirms our earlier concern that the Home Office is seeking catch-all protection for any policy relating to immigration and nationality against the full application of the rights recognised by the convention. We point out at paragraph 63 that the Government's proposal is nearly identical to a similar reservation to Article 22 of the rights of the child convention which has recently been removed, and, in paragraph 64, that nothing in the convention would grant additional rights to people with disabilities who enter or remain in the UK.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000025"></a>We are concerned in paragraph 68 that the Government are pursuing a broad, general reservation relating to immigration control without providing an adequate explanation for its necessity or justification for a reservation of such breadth. We regard it as incompatible with the object and purpose of the convention, and call on the Government to abandon it.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000026"></a>It is regrettable that the Government have not accepted the recommendation to mirror the proportion of reservation made by Australia on ratification. Noble Lords should note that Australia is not noted for having an open-door immigration policy, but it has recognised the rights of persons with disabilities to liberty of movement, the freedom to choose their residence and to nationality on an equal basis with others. It has further declared that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09042864000248"></a>&#147;Australia ... declares its understanding that the convention does not create a right for a person to enter or remain in a country of which he or she is not a national, nor impact on Australia&#146;s health requirements for non-nationals seeking to enter or remain in Australia, where these requirements are based on legitimate, objective and reasonable criteria&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09042864000225"></a>Schedule 3(4) to the Equality Bill contains a completely blanket power to discriminate against disabled people as regards immigration control. Again, it is to be hoped that it will be amended during the passage of the Bill if the Home Office cannot be persuaded to emulate Australia. We ask the Minister or the Home Office to explain now or hereafter why a similar approach to that of Australia is unacceptable and for a clear analysis of why the Government consider the reservation necessary and compatible, and to give examples and evidence to support the continuing need for it.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000027"></a>Lastly, I refer to Article 12(4) on the review of equal recognition of benefit appointees. As we have heard today, the Government rightly accept that the domestic law on benefits is incompatible with the convention because currently there is no review system for Department for Work and Pensions appointees&#151;persons appointed to claim and collect benefits on behalf of another person due to that person&#146;s lack of physical or mental capacity. In paragraph 78, the JCHR welcomes the Government&#146;s recognition that the existing treatment of benefit appointees is incompatible with the requirements of the convention, and we agree that without any change to the current provisions, a reservation is necessary. However, in paragraph 79 we recommend that the Government should publish details of their proposal for a new review mechanism for  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC29"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC29</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>benefit appointees together with any necessary legislative changes, and a timetable for reform, without delay.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000028"></a>We also recommend that the Government should publish their plans for consultation and that the Department for Work and Pensions should consult with disabled people and their organisations. The Government&#146;s proposals would be scrutinised for compatibility with the convention and should be designed to facilitate removal of the proposed reservation. It is good to hear that that is likely to happen. However, if legislative changes are needed to implement the Government&#146;s plans to create a system of review for benefit appointees, we recommend that they consider making appropriate amendments to the Welfare Reform Bill, and once more we call on the Minister to respond fully to these recommendations and indicate whether the Government are minded to amend in that way.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000029"></a>I apologise for the length of my remarks. The fact that it is necessary to raise so many important questions and to seek a detailed and informed government response in this short and rushed debate in the Moses Room is eloquent testimony to the need for a proper system of parliamentary scrutiny of treaty-making, as I said at the outset. We hope that the Minister will respond fully because it is the last chance for the House and, I dare say, both Houses, to call the Government to account on ratification.</p>

<p><a name="09042864000030"></a><b><a name="90428-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09042864000296"></a>Lord Hannay of Chiswick:</b> I should begin by declaring an interest as chair of the board of the United Nations Association of the United Kingdom, because my association lobbied Ministers on behalf of the early ratification of this convention with the minimum of reservations and interpretative declarations. I thank the Minister and the Government for bringing forward these measures, which clear the way to ratification in what I think can be politely described as a reasonably prompt timeframe, and for having reduced the list of reservations below what some of us feared initially was going to be the case.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000031"></a>I also welcome the UK&#146;s agreement that the EU as such can sign and ratify this treaty. That is right for the reasons given by the Minister. I would just like him to state in his reply whether our national ratification will be able to go ahead promptly when the procedures are complete, even if the EU takes longer to get its act together, or whether we are chained together. It would help to have that point clarified.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000032"></a>That is about where the good news ends. Like the noble Lord, Lord Lester, I distinctly dislike some of the reservations and would argue that they are unnecessary. In some cases, they are a little like Don Quixote; there is a tendency to tilt at windmills. I shall take them in a slightly different order from the noble Lord, but follow the path he has laid.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000033"></a>With regard to equal recognition before the law, I accept that the proposed review the Government are going to undertake by a competent, independent and impartial authority into the issue of persons appointed to claim and collect benefits is necessary, that it may not be complete before ratification, and that it therefore justifies a reservation. I hope that it will be carried out with urgency. Perhaps the Minister can say something about the timeframe, as the noble Lord, Lord Lester,  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC30"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC30</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>asked. Will the outcome be reported to Parliament? I would hope so. Will the Government lift the reservation if the review concludes that such a reservation is not necessary? The Minister pretty well said that in his opening, and if he said it categorically, I apologise for asking him to repeat it.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000034"></a>Then there is the military reservation. I, too, do not believe that this reservation is either necessary or desirable. The case of the exemption from the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 for police and fire services, which was lifted in 2005 as it was deemed unnecessary, points to strong arguments for saying that it is not needed and that this would not impose an unnecessary burden on the Armed Forces. This situation sounds similar to me in that both the police and the fire services undertake tasks as onerous&#151;in fact, in this day and age, every bit as onerous&#151;as those of the Armed Forces. A blanket ban is not justified. Is there an intention in any other EU country to make such a reservation for the Armed Forces? If not, that is surely another powerful argument for saying that it is not necessary.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000035"></a>On the question of mainstream and special schools, this reservation and the interpretative declaration seem at least to risk to contradict the commitment of the Department for Children, Schools and Families to develop an inclusive system. As the noble Lord, Lord Lester, has said, countries that have taken a similar approach to our own, like Australia, New Zealand and Germany, are not making similar declarations or reservations. Why are they not doing so if there is an incompatibility? As the noble Lord said, fewer than 16 per cent of disabled children in Germany get inclusive schooling, and yet that country appears not to require any kind of reservation.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000036"></a>Fourthly, there is the question of the liberty of movement and nationality, which seems to be an entirely unnecessary and undesirable reservation. Why can we not make do with an interpretative declaration of the kind that has been made by Australia? It is well drafted, clear and precise, and I do not understand why that does not suffice. As the noble Lord, Lord Lester, said, a similar reservation we made on the Convention on the Rights of the Child has now been withdrawn, so why put one back in here?</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000037"></a>I end by expressing the hope that the Government will reconsider. I welcome the open-mindedness displayed by the Minister when he introduced this debate, pointing out that the Government have not yet reached the final point of decision and will reduce these reservations before we proceed to ratification. The reason for doing so, I would argue, is not so much because of our reputation but because we would set an extremely unfortunate example to a lot of other countries that are probably less liberal and less meticulous&#151;some might say less pernickety&#151;than we are. Festooning our ratification with these reservations merely opens the door for others to make use of them and say that they are merely doing what the United Kingdom has done. They would say that everyone understands that the United Kingdom is a well developed country that has thought these things through, and so why should they not as well?</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000038"></a>The problem, therefore, is that if we open this door, we are acting not only against the interests of disabled  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC31"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC31</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>people in this country but against their interests worldwide because we are enabling such reservations to be entered into by countries that are probably a good deal less advanced than we are in looking after the interests, and furthering the equality, of disabled people. I hope that the Minister and the departments for which he is speaking will see their way to a sharp reduction in the number of reservations.</p>

<p><a name="09042864000039"></a><b><a name="90428-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09042864000297"></a>Lord Maclennan of Rogart:</b> I hope that I will be forgiven for not following too closely what has already been said in this important debate because in my opinion it has been expressed with great clarity. The Minister already has the questions, many of which arise from the sequence of reports from the Joint Committee on Human Rights. However, I hope that the Minister will animadvert, if he can, on the reflection that this debate may cast on the Government&#146;s attitude to the scrutiny of important multilateral conventions by Parliament.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000040"></a>I recognise that the particularity of this debate rests to some extent on the fact that it is a necessary consequence of the provisions being considered for ratification as part of the European Union processes, and consequently there is a requirement to have an order affirmatively accepted. However, there remains the question whether we could and would have contemplated ratifying the convention as a national measure binding on the United Kingdom without that feature and that, if we had, it would have led to such a debate. I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Lester and to the Government for availing the Committee of this opportunity, but it seems to me that a matter of this kind ought not to be discretionary, but a common matter and not one subject to a mere convention. It should be the outcome of this House and the other place, having established the propriety of a full and proper scrutiny prior to the Government finally ratifying such an important treaty.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0004.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000041"></a>I think heard the Minister say early in his remarks that the treaty does not confer new rights. If that is correct, it modifies to some extent the position taken by the JCHR, which has indicated that where there is an evident conflict between the convention and our domestic law, we should seek to align our domestic law with the convention. Our debate about the position of the armed services indicates that there is some willingness to acknowledge that we need to go further than our domestic law presently provides to ensure that there is not an exclusion.</p>

The problem of whether it creates new rights is exemplified by the fact that we asked the Government in our first report to tell us&#151;to tell the public&#151;how domestic law and practice are compatible with the requirements of the convention. I have already explained the Government&#146;s reply to that, but it is impossible to tell whether it confers new rights unless one holds to the Government&#146;s view of how it is   


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC32"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC32</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>compatible with domestic law. As they will not tell us, I for my part very much doubt whether it is correct to say that it does not conform to the rights, but that is why we cannot give a coherent answer.</p>

<p><a name="09042864000043"></a><b><a name="90428-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09042864000299"></a>Lord Maclennan of Rogart:</b> I am grateful to my noble friend. I was attaching myself not so much to the formal reply or explanations in the memorandum as to what the Minister himself said, as I understood it, in his opening comment about this not conferring rights. I understand that that underlay part of the Government&#146;s argument that for the avoidance of any doubt about whether they were amending the law, they would be required to include these reservations. However, there is some certainty about this. It is important that Parliament should not be uncertain before the treaty is ratified.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000044"></a>Notwithstanding the desirability of ratification being expeditiously concluded, if there are new rights, they ought to be clearly set out in an explanatory memorandum or in authoritative statements. If they are not, what is the intention? If domestic law does not reflect the requirements of the convention, the Government should indicate their intention to move towards accepting the agreed international standards.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000045"></a>There has been a definitional point in respect of the education of special needs children. The position is very different in Germany from that in Britain. Fewer children are in comprehensive education in special schools in Germany than in this country. I recall in earlier evidence to the Joint Committee that the Government indicated that they were not interested in the views of other countries in ratifying, that comparisons were not really a matter that exercised them and that some countries entered into such commitments because they were aspirational. Such ambiguity is not appropriate for this country. I accept that we have stated an acceptance of the need to conform our domestic law with the international law to which we subscribe.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000046"></a>The particular points have been made so well made by the noble Lords, Lord Hannay and Lord Lester. What I am most concerned about is that the process should allow that clarity to be fully displayed before Parliament, so that Members of Parliament can give their full-hearted consent to what is being done.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000047"></a>Notwithstanding the fact that the convention has, from the evidence deployed earlier by the Government, reached this stage under the allotted time by quite a margin from that of certain other UN conventions, I fear that because these issues have not been built into the process for ratification, they will be opened up for discussion not just with special interest groups but more widely with their representatives in Parliament.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000048"></a>I hope that we see this debate as one that reflects a transitional state in which the Government are moving towards the recognition that the Ponsonby Rule will not suffice and that in a modern legislature we have a duty to take on the burden of implementing these international obligations. I had hoped that by this time we would have seen the Government&#146;s proposals for the Constitutional Renewal Bill published in a form that takes account of what was said about it by the Joint Committee on which I have the honour to serve.  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC33"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC33</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It seems to be slipping back in the parliamentary Session and one must express some concern about that. This is an important matter and it is not new. The Wakeham commission recommended that there should be a joint committee to scrutinise such legislation and pronounce on its importance, and indeed that has been progressively part of the Government&#146;s own thinking. However, I fear that there has been some recoiling on this and that it is almost in a sense an accident that we are holding this debate. I say that because it is not conceived as appropriately necessary for Parliament to underpin and, indeed, along with the Government, take credit for the enhancement of the protection of human rights&#151;in this case the rights of those with disabilities.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000049"></a>Although I understand the narrow focus of the debate, I hope that the Minister will feel able to give some indication of the Government&#146;s intentions with respect to scrutiny by Parliament, confirm that we are moving in that direction, and further confirm that it is not their intention to confine the debate. The apology given in written evidence so far for not revealing the information requested by the Joint Committee explained that there was a need for speed. Of course that could have been foreseen and responded to earlier, and I hope that we can have a reassurance from the Minister on these points.</p>

<p><a name="09042864000050"></a><b><a name="90428-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09042864000300"></a>Baroness Thomas of Winchester:</b> I, too, welcome the debate about the Government&#146;s decision to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Slowly but surely the milestones are being reached on the long road towards equal treatment for those with disabilities. Like my noble friends, I deplore the Government&#146;s refusal to consult publicly on the reservations they intend to make, which makes it sound as though they have something to hide or are ashamed of them. Before coming to the reservations, I also record my concern that there is still no formal procedure by which Parliament can scrutinise treaties or even conventions before they are ratified. I am grateful to the JCHR for publishing a report on which a debate can be held. In my ignorance, I thought that a treaty scrutiny committee had been agreed, and cannot for the life of me think why it has not.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000051"></a>Turning now to the only reservation I shall speak about, the one on special schools and parental choice in education, one immediately steps into a minefield. What we all want is for all mainstream schools to be able not just to cope with children with all kinds of disabilities, but to do the very best for all these children. I gather that if this reservation goes ahead, the Government are in danger of giving the wrong signal to the mainstream world that they do not have to bother with quite the same urgency with adaptations, extra help and so on, because the special schools are always there to take the children with the most challenging problems. I can see that point. However, I can also see that there are severely disabled children who flourish in some absolutely brilliant special schools, such as Prior&#146;s Court near Newbury, which caters for children at the far end of the autistic spectrum.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000052"></a>So what is the answer? I think that it must be that if the Government are going to lodge this reservation, they will have to demonstrate that they will work   


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC34"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC34</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>doubly hard to ensure that the vast majority of disabled children are enabled to access mainstream education. I heard only this morning that there are still schools where there are no lavatories accessible to children with muscular dystrophy, for example. That is unforgiveable in 2009. I echo the question that my noble friend Lord Lester of Herne Hill asked about whether the purpose of the reservation is simply to clarify that nothing in the convention requires the UK to work towards the eventual elimination of special schools.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000053"></a>My last word on the subject is to ask the Government what new, positive action they are going to take to compensate, if that is the right word, for putting in this reservation on educating people with disabilities. If the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, cannot answer that question now, as I do not expect him to, perhaps he could write to me. As far as the other reservations are concerned, I concur with the views of my noble friend and look forward to hearing the speech of my noble friend or, if I can call her that, my noble colleague Lady Campbell.</p>

<p><a name="09042864000054"></a><b><a name="90428-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09042864000301"></a>Baroness Campbell of Surbiton:</b> First I must apologise to the Minister and to the noble Lord, Lord Lester, for not being here to hear their opening speeches. What can one do? I am a passionate speaker on behalf of haemophiliacs, so I had to support an amendment in the House, but I am equally passionate about this issue. One cannot be in both places at once, so thank you so much for allowing me to come in now.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000055"></a>The significance of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is immense. It represents an international acceptance that disabled people are disadvantaged in society due to social, economic and environmental barriers, and not because of their physical or mental conditions. In the disability world, we call that the social model. Disabled people have campaigned for this definition of their status for more than half a century. This convention reaffirms disabled people&#146;s inalienable human rights to freedom, respect, equality, dignity and autonomy and it charts positive steps that Governments must take to make these rights a reality.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000056"></a>Most significant of all, this convention, the first international human rights treaty of the 21st century, is a genuine product of partnership, of co-production, between disabled people and Governments. The principle of partnership captured in the phrase, &#147;Nothing about us without us&#148; must continue as this treaty is implemented. That is why I must share with noble Lords my grave disappointment that the Government on this occasion have failed to involve disabled people and their organisations in the last stage before ratification. Oh dear, what a shame. We had such a good record on partnership work. It was only on 3 March, with the publication of the Explanatory Memorandum, that the Government set out in detail their proposed reservations and declarations in the areas of education, immigration, employment and legal capacity. This  was the very first opportunity for disabled people  and others, including the Equality and Human  Rights Commission and the Joint Committee on  Human Rights, to examine these reservations and declarations.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000057"></a>No formal consultation has taken place. It is extremely disappointing that a Government with such a proud record on disability rights, respected around the world for their efforts, should have decided that reservations and declarations were necessary, still worse that they were unwilling to consult on them. Of course, what do disabled people think? &#147;What have they got to hide?&#148; So silly.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000058"></a>As time is short, I shall confine my comments to the reservation regarding education, as it is my passion and, of course, because it concerns me the most. I find it extremely sad that the Government should take issue with part of the convention intended to encourage the progressive realisation of an education system that extends belonging and provides the very best start in life for every child, disabled or not. By keeping a place for segregation in the education system, the Government are, I believe, signalling their acceptance of a two-tier system status quo. Many of us, and certainly the disability community, who are campaigning for inclusion feel that this reservation will keep the status quo and move us no further on.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000059"></a>Segregated special schools represent progress not yet made. It is an exercise in doublespeak to describe schools that separate disabled children from their non-disabled peers as inclusive, as the Government now seek to do. Such provision, often requiring children to attend residential schools many miles from their home, is not in my view compatible with the spirit of the convention for private and family life.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000060"></a>One can sympathise with parents deciding, in the absence of viable alternatives, to send their child to such a school, but it is not choice; it is Hobson&#146;s choice.</p>

I hope that meets with your agreement. She says that the progressive realisation of an inclusive education system is the only vehicle through which to genuinely expand parental choice and protect and promote human rights in the process. In the response to her letter, the department provided her with its rationale for this declaration. The department quoted Ofsted&#146;s report, <I>Inclusion: does it matter where children are taught?</I>, as finding that,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09042864000249"></a>&#147;The most important factor in determining the best outcomes for pupils with learning difficulties and disabilities (LDD) is not the type but the quality of the provision&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09042864000226"></a>However, the department neglected to mention that the same Ofsted report goes on to say:</p>

However, mainstream schools with additionally resourced provision were particularly successful in achieving high outcomes for pupils academically, socially and personally. PRUs were the least successful&#148;.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09042864000251"></a>&#147;Pupils with even the most severe and complex needs were able to make outstanding progress in all types of settings.

<p><a name="09042864000062"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, says that she cannot help but fear that such commitment will be needlessly undermined by this declaration, which represents a firm commitment by the Government to a permanent and fixed role for special schools. As such, she considers the declaration incompatible with the objectives of the convention. She notes the commitment of the Home Office to review in 12 months the necessity for the reservation concerning immigration and she would like the Government to withdraw their reservation regarding education. If they are unwilling to do this, at least let them agree to also review this reservation in 12 months. In fact, she would like to ask the Minister whether he will consider securing a review of all the reservations and the specific declaration in relation to education not later than 12 months after the date of ratification, including the full consultation with disabled people and wider society that has been sadly lacking to date.</p>

Thank goodness, then, for the Explanatory Memorandum, which, although brief, shorter than either the speech made by the Minister for Disabled People when he introduced the order in another place or that of the noble Lord himself, is some guidance to what we are discussing this afternoon, namely the United Nations convention.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000064"></a>Interested as I am in parliamentary procedure, I will not be going into the parliamentary actions of treaty-making, or rather, as has been pointed out, the lack of them. They are for another day. I would point out, though, and I think I am right in so doing, that Governments usually sign treaties&#151;one thinks, for example, of war treaties&#151;in some degree of haste and the ratification depends on the number of signatories. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, with his vast experience, will be able to confirm that.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000065"></a>To go back to the convention, its purpose is to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal treatment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms of all disabled people so that they can participate fully in society. Who better to remind us of that need than the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell?</p>

<a name="90428-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000066"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, noted from the Minister&#146;s speech, it is a reaffirmation of these human rights for disabled people. There are, as I understand it, no new rights involved, but one of the questions we ought to ask is where this reaffirmation springs from. Is it a previous UN treaty or is it something else?</p>

<a name="90428-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000067"></a>As the Explanatory Memorandum sets out, this treaty confirms the obligation of the United Nations states to protect, promote and ensure the human rights that all people already have on an equal basis to those of able-bodied people. These are, of course, very wide and encompass several political, economic, social and cultural rights.</p>

I accept that all too often disabled people are treated as second-class citizens across the world, but I would like to hear the Minister&#146;s answer, particularly as I do not believe that this is the case across the European Union. In this country, as has been pointed out, we have the Disability Discrimination Act, which we strengthened only recently, with all-party support. I understand that it has its equivalent in other EU countries.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000069"></a>Since the EU believes that it is necessary, we have to agree today&#146;s order willy-nilly. Despite the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Lester, and the views of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, we on this side of the Grand Committee agree with the Government that a few exceptions are needed. The tenor of the remarks of all noble Lords who have spoken is this: are these reservations new, and are they needed now? I think that is a reasonable paraphrase of the debate that we have had so far.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000070"></a>My honourable friend the shadow Minister for Disabled People, Mr Harper, listed the exemptions in another place. There is an exemption for service in the Armed Forces, which, when able-bodied, do such a magnificent job in helping other nations secure peace around the world and on their own in Northern Ireland, although, mercifully, they are not needed there in such numbers as previously. I heard the noble Lord, Lord Lester, speak of compatibility. Our own DDA excludes them too. However, if they become disabled in the course of their service, there is no requirement to keep them on in another capacity within, say, the Army, or indeed in any other of the Armed Forces. In many cases this would be a waste of their training, and I hope that the MoD, which does so well for disabled veterans, will take that on board. The Minister will correct me, as he loves to do when I am wrong, but I do not believe that this reservation is to do with recruitment. Does he agree that it applies to the retention of troops who become disabled in the course of their armed service? Should our reservation not make that clear?</p>

<a name="90428-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000071"></a>Another exemption retains the right to maintain Immigration Rules, which in essence give us the right to screen immigrants. I believe that this is entirely for health reasons. We agree with that too, although we note that the Government intend to review this in a year&#146;s time to see whether it remains a useful tool in our public health armoury. Perhaps the Minister will expand on that. How confident can we be in this timing, though? The Minister for Disabled People committed the Government to laying this order by the end of last year and we have it three months later&#151;not exactly, to quote from the Minister&#146;s speech, at the &#147;earliest opportunity&#148;.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000072"></a>There is a third reservation, which concerns the DWP itself. The convention requires a regular review of what it calls &#147;substituted decision-making&#148; by a competent, independent and impartial authority or judicial body. The DWP has no review system for people who are appointed to claim and collect benefits on behalf of disabled people. I understand that the department is working towards just such a review. I would therefore be grateful for a progress report, both now and as things evolve.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000073"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Winchester, majored on the interpretative declaration that makes clear that our general education system includes both mainstream and special schools. I am glad that this is so because I believe, perhaps unfashionably, that in most cases disabled children are better off in mainstream schools. The conventional education wisdom on this point has varied, I note, during my time in this House. Nevertheless, there are those for whom special schools are appropriate&#151;indeed, are vital. Although education is not my subject and never has been, I think the Government are in a bit of a muddle here. On the one hand, they have a stated belief in special schools; on the other, local authorities are allowed to close them. I would be grateful for a response on that point.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000074"></a>Will these reservations and the interpretative declaration be attached to the ratification that the EU sends to the UN? How exactly does all this work? As I said earlier, this order does not permit the UK to ratify the convention. Indeed, as the noble Lord, Lord Lester, also said, no parliamentary debate is needed at all.</p>

I think that he said it applies only to retention within the service of those who have been injured in combat, or words to that effect. The text of the reservation is set out in paragraph 48 of the JCHR report. As does the Equality Bill in its present draft, it exempts the whole of the employment and occupation provisions&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09042864000265"></a>&#147;equal treatment in employment and occupation, in so far as it relates to discrimination on the grounds of disability, shall not apply to the armed forces&#148;,</ul>

Notwithstanding these comments, we are pleased to support this order, even though it does not in itself ratify the convention. However, many more states or groups of states will be needed to achieve that. How many are we talking about? Are we talking 30, 40, 50 or 90? I have no idea. Did I understand the Minister correctly when he talked about ratification? As I now understand, and did not when I prepared my speech, we are talking about two ratifications; that is, the EU ratification and this country&#146;s ratification. But still, if we ratify separately, do the reservations and the statutory declaration have to be attached to the EU ratification document?</p>

I apologise for perhaps missing my cue. As I sense that we are pressed for time and coming towards the end of the debate, I will cut short my remarks. I shall cut to the chase and make a few remarks about a couple of the proposed reservations. I welcome the JCHR report. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has iconic significance for disabled people as providing important validation and underpinning of their rights, which have provided such a potent focus for campaigning by disabled people in recent years for improvements in their situation.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90428-gc0006.htm"/>


<a name="90428-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000081"></a>The role of the UK and the process leading to the adoption of the convention has been widely welcomed, but the ratification process has become somewhat contentious as soon as it was learnt that there was some possibility that ratification might be attended by the entering of reservations. I can understand that concern as the JCHR report says that,</p>
<ul><a name="09042864000266"></a>&#147;scrutiny of the reservation and interpretative declaration proposed for this Convention&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09042864000229"></a>should proceed,</p>
<ul><a name="09042864000267"></a>&#147;from the standpoint that there should be as few such statements as possible, preferably none, and that where such statements are necessary, the Government should be committed to making the legislative and other changes necessary to enable them to be withdrawn as soon as practicable&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09042864000230"></a>However, I have never thought that the call for ratification without reservation, irrespective of any consideration of what these reservations might be, was very credible. With the JCHR, I would say that the Government&#146;s view that the UK should not accede to any treaty unless domestic law and practice are capable of complying with its obligations is clearly right. I therefore welcome the balanced approach adopted by the JCHR and the Equality and Human Rights Commission in accepting the necessity for some of the reservations, but subject to review, with the aim of getting rid of them at the earliest possible date.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000082"></a>I shall cut to the brief remarks I want to make about two of the proposed reservations. The first is on education. There seems to be some confusion here. The Joint Committee states that it welcomes the restatement in the Explanatory Memorandum of the Government&#146;s commitment to inclusive education, but that,</p>
<ul><a name="09042864000268"></a>&#147;we are concerned, however, that the scope of the reservation and the interpretative declaration may send a confused message to people with disabilities about the purpose and intention of the Government&#146;s position ... We also ask the Government to confirm that the purpose of its proposed reservation and interpretative declaration is simply to clarify that nothing in the convention requires the Government to work towards the eventual elimination of special schools in the UK. If this is the purpose of the  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC40"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC40</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government&#146;s reservation and interpretative declaration, we accept that a lack of clarity in the convention may necessitate a reservation and an interpretative declaration which is compatible with the object and purpose of the convention&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09042864000231"></a>If one wants to argue for no reservation on the ground that the convention is intended to be progressive, one can hardly object to the Government reiterating that nothing in the convention requires the eventual elimination of special schools. However, the concern here is not with the maintenance of specialist provision, but with the Government being explicit about it in their reservation and interpretative declaration. The JCHR points out that Germany has ratified without reservation, although its system of specialist education is overwhelmingly based on specialist provision. This is surely disingenuous, and the UK is only being straightforward and above board in being explicit about its position&#151;another case, perhaps, of the UK signing up to international obligations only on a basis that it is able to go along with, in contrast to the oft-observed tendency of others to sign up to obligations that they are largely content to ignore. The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, was also at pains to make this point.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000083"></a>There is a continuing need for specialist provision. The disability community is divided about it. For example, the blind, the deaf and the deaf-blind had a major struggle in the negotiations leading to the convention to gain recognition at Article 24(3)(c) of the need to maintain specialist provision to meet their particular needs. Having achieved that, it seems only logical for the Government, in ratifying the convention, to make it clear that the UK&#146;s education system includes specialist provision to meet highly specialised needs.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000084"></a>I turn finally to the reservation concerning service in the Armed Forces. The argument that bans all disabled people from serving in the forces on the basis that people in wheelchairs, or people who are totally blind for that matter, could not possibly go into action, which they could not, is based on a very narrow and outdated stereotype of what disability is, and is certainly not one which is recognised by the DDA. There, disability includes things such as severe disfigurement, diabetes, controlled epilepsy, a history of mental illness and many more conditions, none of which would disable a person from active service in the Armed Forces. All we are talking about here is a right not to be automatically excluded from serving in the forces, not an automatic right to serve. No one is saying that any disabled person can perform any role in the services. All that disabled people want is the right not to be subjected to a blanket ban which says that the one thing a disabled person cannot be allowed to do is fight for his country.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000085"></a>The matter came up&#151;this is my final point&#151;on the Disability Rights Task Force, which sat towards the end of the 1990s and brought forward the recommendations that led to the setting up of the Disability Rights Commission, on which I had the honour to serve with the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell. The task force was nothing if not reasonable on this question. We acknowledged the defence chiefs&#146; concerns about being sued by disabled people claiming to do things that were unreasonable. However, the Act gives disabled people rights only to do things that are reasonable. We suggested that a code of practice should be drawn

I am sorry to say that this suggestion was never followed up. However, I tentatively put it forward again as a basis on which the Government could feel safe in removing the blanket ban on bringing service in the Armed Forces within the scope of the DDA during the passage of the Equality Bill.</p>

<p><a name="09042864000171"></a><b><a name="90428-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09042864000323"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I start by thanking everyone who has contributed to this debate which has been extremely well informed, if somewhat challenging from a Minister&#146;s point of view.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000172"></a>Specification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as a Community treaty under the European Communities Act 1972 may be a somewhat technical issue but nevertheless is a crucial step towards ratification of the convention, and one which must be in place before we can ratify. The convention itself is a very significant landmark for disabled people and their organisations, and for the Government and society as a whole. The noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, expressed that most forcefully. I am delighted that she is able to join us given that she had double duty in another place.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000173"></a>Several points about the Government&#146;s proposals for ratification have been raised in the debate. I shall attempt to deal with as many as I can. As I said in my opening remarks, we need a formal government response to the JCHR report. As I indicated, we hope to move that forward fairly swiftly. I cannot guarantee what it will say or whether it will change anything that I am referring to now. The parliamentary scrutiny of treaties was raised by the noble Lords, Lord Lester, Lord Hannay, Lord Maclennan and Lord Skelmersdale, and by the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas. The point was made that the fact that we have a specification process in this case gives us a rare opportunity to debate treaties. Noble Lords called, not unreasonably, for Parliament to be able to scrutinise proposals to ratify treaties, and for proposals to enhance scrutiny to be brought forward. The Government intend to introduce the Constitutional Renewal Bill covering the ratification of treaties before the Summer Recess. I hope that news is welcome to those who have concerns about this.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000174"></a>I wish to pick up on one or two other points about ratification. The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, sought an assurance that we do not have to wait for the European Community to go through its ratification process before we can complete ours. I am advised that the answer to that is clearly no and that we will move ahead and ratify as soon as we can. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, asked whether our reservations and declarations have to be attached to the European Community&#146;s ratification, and the answer to that is no as well. Our reservations and declarations reflect domestic UK needs. However, the European Community proposes to enter a complementary reservation to ours to cover the position of service in the Armed Forces.</p>

Is the position that the UK Government, having decided on a very broad reservation about the Armed Forces, are saying that within the European Community there should be a matching Community-wide provision that would apply to the 27 member states? I hope that that is not what the Minister is implying. He will probably not know that so far as sex discrimination is concerned, EU law prevents such a broad exclusion, which is why we do not have it in our domestic law. It does not apply to the disabled, unfortunately, but surely the United Kingdom should be setting a good example, as the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, has indicated, by seeking a narrow exception across the European Union rather than by crafting a broad one and then getting a matching one for all the member states? Is the position that we are promoting a similar reservation to our own across the EU, or is it that, for some other completely separate reason, the EU wishes to have something as broad as this? Is the dog wagging its tail or the tail wagging the dog?</p>

I see that the Box is scribbling a note and coming to my aid, so perhaps I might come back to that before I have finished dealing with the rest of the debate.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000180"></a>A number of noble Lords spoke about the reservations and the interpretative declaration. The noble Lord, Lord Lester, asked whether the Government agree that there should be as few reservations and declarations as possible. Our answer to that is yes, clearly we do. However, we do not consider that the handful we are proposing are excessive in this context, and we are proposing to enter them only where we consider there is a need. The noble Lord also asked whether the Government should be committed to making the legislative and other changes necessary to enable them to be withdrawn as soon as possible. The Government have made clear that the reservation in respect of arrangements for the review of benefit appointees will be removed when the proportionate system of review is introduced and the reservation in respect of liberty of movement will be reviewed after 12 months. The need for the other reservations will also be kept under review and where reservations become redundant they will be withdrawn.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000181"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, raised the same point and asked whether there should be a commitment to review all reservations in 12 months. All the reservations will be subject to periodic review and where they are no longer needed they will be removed. The noble Baroness particularly emphasised the need for that review and I anticipate that the Equality and Human Rights Commission, in its role

<p><a name="09042864000182"></a>There were many comments on education issues, not all taking the same position, from the noble Lords, Lord Low and Lord Skelmersdale, and the noble Baronesses, Lady Campbell and Lady Thomas. Concern has been expressed that the reservation and interpretative declaration in respect of education are unnecessary and that other countries with education systems similar to ours have not found it necessary to enter either. Germany was mentioned several times, including by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay. I reiterate that, although I cannot comment on the basis on which other countries may have come to their conclusions when ratifying, the UK Government consider both the declaration and the reservation unnecessary.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000183"></a>I note the concern expressed by noble Lords that the education reservation and declaration represent a change in policy. Let me be very clear: that is not the case. The purpose of the proposed declaration and the reservation is to maintain the present policy and legislative provision for inclusive education, which, in the UK, includes a range of provision including mainstream and special schools. I assure noble Lords that they do not represent a dilution of our commitment but are intended to make the UK&#146;s current position clear. The interpretative declaration is proposed to make it clear that the UK&#146;s general education system includes both mainstream and special schools and thereby clarifies how the UK Government interpret the convention. That will make it clear that special schools are considered part of the UK&#146;s general education system and that parents have a right to express a preference for a special school. The reservation is proposed to allow for specific circumstances where disabled children's special needs may be best met through specialist provision, which may be some way from their home, so that they will need to be educated outside their local community. That also maintains parental choice for schools outside the local community.</p>

It seems to me from this debate that there will be quite broad support for the interpretative declaration explaining what we actually do and how we interpret the obligations under the convention, but I fail to see the need for a reservation. Reservations are far more damaging than interpretative declarations.</p>

<p><a name="09042864000185"></a><b><a name="90428-gc0006.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09042864000329"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> My understanding is that the reservation is to deal with the point that for some children specialist provision&#151;which I think that there is agreement should be a part of our inclusive system&#151;may be some way from the home. I think that that is why that reservation is lodged. I see the noble Lord shaking his head. I will certainly review that and I am sure that we will pick that up more specifically in our response to the JCHR report, but I think that that is the purpose of the reservation. The thrust of the convention is the right to have education in your local community, but some special schools may be some

We see inclusion as being about the quality of a child's experience and providing access to a high-quality education that enables them to make progress in their learning and to participate fully in the activities of their school and community.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000186"></a>I am conscious that there is not an identity view among noble Lords about the extent to which special schools should be maintained, but I am trying to set out the Government's current position on education and special schools. Given that that is the Government&#146;s position, it is appropriate to have both the declaration and the reservation&#151;the latter, perhaps, on the narrow point that I have just outlined.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000187"></a>One noble Lord raised the issue of Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Executive has been fully consulted throughout our work towards ratification of the convention and we understand that the Executive support the proposed basis for ratification. No concerns have been previously raised about the proposal to enter the declaration and reservation on Article 24. My honourable friend Jonathan Shaw is seeking clarification from the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister about Northern Ireland's overall position.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000188"></a>A number of noble Lords asked about the Armed Forces. The rationale for the reservation is based on the need to maintain the operational effectiveness of the Armed Forces, and that relies on teams consisting of fully able personnel who can meet a worldwide liability to deploy. Armed Forces personnel therefore need to have a robust constitution both physically and mentally to serve in situations where they may be called upon to work for prolonged periods under difficult and stressful conditions in arduous terrain. It has been suggested that the fact that the Armed Forces retain a number of personnel who become disabled in the course of their duties, a point probed by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, is evidence that the reservation is necessary.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000189"></a>We would not agree that there is a clear moral obligation for the services to look after personnel who have been injured. Rehabilitation can often best be facilitated within a military environment, particularly as the individuals concerned often have relevant experience which can be exploited to the benefit of all serving. Cases are considered on an individual basis against manpower requirements, and while the services have continued to retain those people injured on operations who wish to stay, where necessary in an alternative role, they do not artificially create posts to accommodate them. There is a fundamental difference between retaining someone who has relevant military experience and recruiting someone with no previous experience and is unable to meet the standards required.</p>

I understand everything he has said, but what is not clear is why a narrow reservation to deal with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, would not suffice. Why is it necessary and proportionate to have a sweeping reservation that excludes from the entire employment and occupation provisions both under the convention and in the Equality Bill under our domestic law every aspect of recruitment,  


<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC45"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column GC45</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>training, promotion, terms and conditions and terms of service throughout the entire Armed Forces? I do not understand why anything the Minister has said so far indicates the need for that kind of reservation when, as the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, has indicated, it does not apply to the police, the fire service, and certainly not to women, transsexuals or others under existing domestic law. Again, why is it necessary to have this extraordinary reservation in place? Indeed, where is the EU competence for a similar reservation to enter into EU law if that is what is proposed?</p>

<p><a name="09042864000191"></a><b><a name="90428-gc0006.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09042864000331"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> All I can say to that is &#147;ditto&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09042864000192"></a><b><a name="90428-gc0006.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09042864000332"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> Let me acknowledge the concerns about the breadth of this reservation, which have been powerfully made. However, I have tried to set out the Government&#146;s position. There is also an issue about the ECHR&#146;s request for evidence in relation to the proposed reservation, and indeed the noble Lord referred to the correspondence with the Secretary of State, John Hutton. There is a general question about whether the reservation will be reviewed, and of course the answer to that is yes, it will. It will be kept under periodic review as part of the process of monitoring and reporting on the convention. This, of course, is not related to the Equality Bill. The noble Lord identified that legislation which was published, I think, on Monday, but it does not itself remove the necessity for a reservation in this area. I should also say that the reservation, as I understand it, does not preclude the Armed Forces from recruiting disabled people into the services. It is not a blanket provision, but judgment on these issues has to be provided. That is the thrust of the point. Perhaps I may refer to what the noble Lord, Lord Lester, said about the UK&#146;s position in relation to the European Community. It will enter into a reservation that effectively mirrors that of the UK. We understand that that will not be outside compliance with Community law. It of course does not require other member states to enter an equivalent reservation. I can see the challenge that might come from the noble Lord about where Community competence runs on that and where that puts other member states. I will have to take further advice on that.</p>

I am not very familiar with this particular area, but I have a certain familiarity with the EU. My assumption is that the EU is signing and ratifying this treaty only for areas where it has competence. It is not signing and ratifying it on behalf of all 27 member states wherever they have competence, which is why we are ratifying it ourselves and why we are entering reservations. If I have got it right, all our reservations as I see them are in areas where the European Union does not have competence directly. Certainly, regarding the Armed Forces, unless we are going to follow the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, galloping down the route towards a European army, I am not sure where the European competence for that comes. It would be a great pity if we were

However, I am happy to await a reply from the noble Lord when he has taken further advice on that point.</p>

I will make sure that that is forthcoming, if not through our response to the JCHR report, then otherwise in correspondence.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000195"></a>Noble Lords also asked about the reservation relating to immigration, the Australian approach to the right of freedom of movement and the review of our reservation after 12 months. Again, I cannot comment on the rationale or merits of the Australian approach. Our assessment has been that a reservation in the terms we are proposing is necessary.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000196"></a>However, as I made clear in my opening remarks, the Government are committed to reviewing this reservation 12 months after the UK has ratified the convention so that we can assess whether there is a continued need for it in practice. As we have made clear, disabled people and their organisations will be consulted at an early stage to ascertain how they can be involved in formulating the review. I hope that noble Lords are happy with the starting scope of that; namely, that the process to review it would find favour.</p>

<p><a name="09042864000197"></a><b><a name="90428-gc0006.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="09042864000335"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> Before the noble Lord leaves that point, will he confirm my understanding that it is there only for health reasons and for no other?</p>

No, the reservation certainly covers health issues, but it is not limited to that. Again, I will look to the Box for some support on that later.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000199"></a>I hope that it is clear that, while we consider it necessary to have a reservation in respect of the arrangements for social security benefit appointees, we intend to remove that reservation as soon as is practical. We anticipate that it will take at least two years before that is possible. Given the number of customers with appointees estimated at half a million, introducing a review system would be a huge undertaking and we need to make sure that we get it right.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000200"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lester, asked whether we should take the opportunity of the Welfare Reform Bill to ensure that the review system can be put in place. But at this time we do not think that we will need to make changes to primary legislation and have no plans to do so in the Welfare Reform Bill. Therefore, we believe that it is not necessary to have that in primary legislation.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000201"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, asked about the review and the timing of it. I have indicated that it could take up to two years. We are scoping the task at the moment, which is neither simple nor small, given that half a million people might be affected by it. Introducing the review system will be a huge undertaking, but it is important that we do it.</p>

<p><a name="09042864000202"></a>A number of noble Lords expressed concern that we are proposing to make more reservations than other countries, and that this could jeopardise our standing with other countries or send a signal that the UK has concerns about the contents of the convention. However, the Government&#146;s view is that comparisons cannot be made on the basis of the number of reservations and/or interpretative declarations made by other countries. Countries have different cultures, different ways of doing things and different legal systems and policies, which may raise different issues. Whether that is us being meticulous or pernickety I leave to noble Lords to judge for themselves, but we believe that it is the right approach.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000203"></a>The issue was raised of the compatibility of domestic law with the convention, and of the reservations with the convention. The UK&#146;s approach, and I make no apology for it, is not to ratify any international treaty until it can ensure that it can implement the provisions and therefore comply with the obligations that it has accepted. That is why government departments and the devolved Administrations have compared their policies, programmes, practices and procedures with the convention&#146;s requirements. The noble Lord, Lord Lester, asked about the Government&#146;s views on the compatibility of domestic law and practice with the terms of the convention. The Government took account of the requirements for reservations to be compatible with the object and purpose of the convention when considering the terms on which we were proposing to ratify, and we set out our rationale in the Explanatory Memorandum.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000204"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Lester and Lord Maclennan, asked about compatibility with the convention and what these reservations mean. The UN convention allows for the making of reservations and interpretative statements so long as they do not defeat the object and purpose of the convention, so this is specifically provided for. We have considered the reservations and interpretative statement that the UK will be entering, and we are satisfied that they do not defeat the convention&#146;s object or purpose.</p>

<p><a name="09042864000205"></a><b><a name="90428-gc0007.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09042864000337"></a>Lord Lester of Herne Hill:</b> Unfortunately, the Explanatory Memorandum does not tell anyone, article by article, how domestic law already complies. There is nothing in it that says that, nor is there anything in any other government document. The Joint Committee has asked not for the fruits of two years of interdepartmental discussion but for a short document that says, &#147;Article 13 is already covered in UK law by Section so-and-so of the Commonwealth so-and-so and the Disability so-and-so, while Article 14 is covered by so-and-so&#148;. That is what one needs to answer, for example, my noble friend Lord Maclennan&#146;s question. Unless we have that, we cannot tell how it is that the Government are saying that legislation is not necessary in order for ratification. It is important that the public should know where existing law gives full protection and, therefore, where it is unnecessary to legislate further.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000206"></a>On the broader questions about review, I am sure the Government will realise that Parliament will be reviewing all this during the Equality Bill debates. It

<p><a name="09042864000207"></a><b><a name="90428-gc0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09042864000338"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> On that latter point, I am well aware that the Equality Bill is now with us and I have no doubt that several noble Lords will be actively engaged on that, pressing some of the points that they have raised today.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000208"></a>I understand the point that the noble Lord is making about the quest for some form of document that lists all the UK provisions and matches them against the convention. I doubt whether that would be a short document; rather, I imagine that it would be extensive. That does not necessarily argue against it being produced, but the fact that we are supporting the signing and ratification of the convention, given our starting proposition, means that that work has been undertaken, although I accept that it has not necessarily been fully visible.</p>

<p><a name="09042864000209"></a><b><a name="90428-gc0007.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09042864000339"></a>Lord Lester of Herne Hill:</b> I am very grateful. I am not asking for new work to be done, nor am I asking for revelations of all the old work that has been done. All I am asking for is a summary of the work that has already been done. It does not matter whether that is in short form or long form. There is no reason why that should not be disclosed in a convenient form so that the public are well informed. That is all we are saying. I hope that can be done.</p>

<p><a name="09042864000210"></a><b><a name="90428-gc0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09042864000340"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I shall certainly take that away and raise it with colleagues to see whether we can do more on that front. I can see that that would be helpful.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000211"></a>I wish to pick up on the point that several noble Lords raised about whether new rights derive from the convention. The convention sets out what was considered by those negotiating it to be a list of existing rights applying to disabled people. These are general rights and the convention allows for those ratifying it to take into account provisions in their own legal systems, so long as in doing so, as I said a moment ago, they do not defeat the object and purpose of the convention. Therefore, national differences can be accommodated.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000212"></a>Issues were raised about consultation, particularly by the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, that we are not ashamed of these reservations. We have tried to explain their purpose. There is no hidden agenda here. However, I recognise that many groups with whom we have worked actively and fully are disappointed, which is a shame.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000213"></a>It has been suggested that the Government should have consulted more about their proposals and that they should have consulted on the justifications for and precise terms of the reservations and interpretative declaration that they propose. However, the Government made clear in May 2008 that at that time they were considering reservations and/or interpretative declarations in respect of service in the Armed Forces, education and immigration, and were continuing to explore whether there were any compatibility issues that might result in the need for an interpretative declaration or reservations in respect of measures relating to the exercise of legal

<a name="90428-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000214"></a>A further update on the position was provided in the response to correspondence from the Joint Committee on Human Rights in the autumn and in the Minister for Disabled People and the South East&#146;s evidence to the Joint Committee on Human Rights in November 2008. Ministers and officials have had meetings with a number of stakeholders. The Explanatory Memorandum on the convention, laid before Parliament on 3 March, provided a detailed explanation of our proposals for ratification and the rationale behind those proposals. This information was circulated widely, and this and other information has been placed on the website of the Office for Disability Issues. Information has therefore been in the public domain for some considerable time.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000215"></a>Looking forward, the Government recognise that it is essential that disabled people and their organisations are involved in the future implementation of the convention&#151;for example, through participation in the monitoring and reporting processes that will be developed.</p>

<a name="90428-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09042864000216"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, asked what we were doing to promote the convention around the world. The UK is active, both at home and abroad, in promoting the convention. Overseas the FCO supports local NGOs to promote awareness of the issues covered by the convention and is supporting the work of the Council of Europe in promoting the UN convention among member countries that have not yet signed and ratified. The Department for International Development has made positive efforts to integrate disability into development practice and has, for example, provided country office staff with practical advice on how to engage with disabled people as part of poverty reduction efforts.</p>

I assure noble Lords that we will consider the views that have been expressed today, together with those expressed by the JCHR and others, before we make a final decision on how to proceed to ratification. Specification of the convention is a step that moves us closer to ratification, and ratification is the immediate objective and the end of a detailed process. Equally importantly, it will be a beginning of the implementation of this important convention when it comes into force within the UK. I look forward to us embarking on that journey.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09042871000004"></a>The challenge of forming a diverse judiciary is substantial. The work of the Judicial Appointments Commission&#146;s (JAC&#146;s) Judicial Diversity Forum and proactive trilateral work between the Ministry of Justice, the judiciary and the JAC has made this clear. While the JAC has encouraged more diverse applications to the judiciary and the efforts of the trilateral work have meant that we are now seeing increasing numbers of women and black and minority ethnic applicants for judicial office, progress has been slower than we would like.</p>

<a name="90428-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="09042871000005"></a>Given the personal commitment of the Lord Chief Justice and the Chairman of the JAC to this cause, we need a better understanding of the factors behind this relative lack of progress and a clear agenda for how we move forward.</p>

<a name="90428-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="09042871000006"></a>I have therefore decided to establish an Advisory Panel on Judicial Diversity to be chaired by Baroness Julia Neuberger with the following terms of reference:</p>

<a name="90428-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09042871000007"></a>To identify the barriers to progress on judicial diversity and to make recommendations to the Lord Chancellor on how to make speedier and sustained progress to a more diverse judiciary at every level and in all courts in England &amp; Wales.</p>

<a name="90428-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="09042871000008"></a>In considering this question the panel will:</p>
 Examine the nature of the problem;Consider research undertaken on the UK system as well as considering international comparators; Draw on the lessons learnt from current initiatives, including the JAC Judicial Diversity Forum and the follow-up work from the Lord Chief Justice&#146;s conference on &#147;A Judiciary for the 21st century&#148;;Draw up a list of practical measures that could be taken, identifying those that could happen quickly and those that would require legislation.
<a name="90428-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="09042871000009"></a>The panel is asked to report to the Lord Chancellor no later than November 2009.</p>

<a name="90428-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="09042871000010"></a>The other members of the panel are Lord Justice Goldring, Professor Dame Hazel Genn, Andrew Holroyd CBE, Winston Hunter QC, Dr Nicola Brewer.</p>

<a name="90428-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="09042871000011"></a>This will be work that must bring together and make the best use of the combined expertise of the senior judiciary, the JAC, the legal professions and diversity and equality advisors to identify how we can make swifter progress to a judiciary more reflective of the communities it serves.</p>

<a name="90428-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="09042871000021"></a>On 19 March the Minister for Women &amp; Equality, Harriet Harman, announced a &#163;1.6 million cross-government special fund for Rape Crisis Centres (members of Rape Crisis England &amp; Wales) and the Survivors&#146; Trust sexual violence charities in England and Wales.</p>

<a name="90428-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="09042871000022"></a>These charities provide invaluable support and specialist services, such as counselling and advocacy, to women and men who have been raped or experienced sexual violence.</p>

Details of how to apply and the eligibility criteria will be available on my department&#146;s website

This special fund is a cross-Government initiative involving the Government Equalities Office, Department of Health, and Home Office.</p>

<a name="90428-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="09042871000024"></a>Last year&#146;s special fund ensured that 20 rape crisis centres (members of Rape Crisis England &amp; Wales) did not have to close or reduce services to victims of rape and sexual abuse. Since the announcement of last year&#146;s fund, the Survivors&#146; Trust has provided information that its members&#146; services and groups were at risk of closure. That is why the terms of this new fund have been expanded to ensure that members of both Rape Crisis (England &amp; Wales) and the Survivors&#146; Trust  can apply.</p>

Officials across government are working to consider what more we can do, based on the recommendations made by the Home Office&#146;s Stakeholder Advisory Group on Sexual Violence and Abuse Funding Sub-group. Government Equalities Office is working with the Improvement and Development Agency (IDeA) in local government to improve the way local commissioning of services from the violence against women third sector works.

<notus-date day="28" month="4" year="2009" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS14"></a><b>28 Apr 2009 : Column WS14</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90428-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="09042871000031"></a>I would like to update the House on the UN Durban Review Conference, the follow-up to the 2001 UN World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance which took place in Geneva from 20-24 April. The Government are firmly committed to the elimination of all forms of racism and intolerance. We engaged in this conference because we share its goal of fighting racism.</p>

<a name="90428-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="09042871000032"></a>The UK&#146;s engagement in the review process has always come with clear red lines that, if breached, would have led to our withdrawal. We made clear in particular that we would not accept a repeat of the appalling anti-Semitism seen at the first Durban Conference in 2001. And the outcome text would need to meet a number of explicit conditions.</p>

<a name="90428-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="09042871000033"></a>In the event, we negotiated a text that did meet those conditions. In particular, we resisted attempts for language calling for restrictions to the right of freedom of expression, including through the concept of &#147;defamation of religions.&#148; We secured language on Holocaust remembrance (to which Iran objected but then, in a minority of one, agreed) and the fight against anti-Semitism, and successfully rebutted attempts to single-out any country for criticism in the outcome document. We also ensured the text included references to multiple forms of discrimination, which we interpret to cover also the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and the importance of the right to freedom of expression in combating racism.</p>

<a name="90428-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="09042871000034"></a>Given that the UK and its partners were successful in achieving our red lines in the outcome document, we decided that the UK should participate in the conference. But we shared the concerns of those who feared the misuse of this conference for intolerant ends and worked hard to avoid such a scenario. I wrote to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on 17 April making clear that we would not accept intolerant behaviour in the conference.</p>

<a name="90428-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="09042871000035"></a>On 20 April, on the first day of the conference, President Ahmadinejad of Iran delivered a statement to the conference, in which he made unacceptable comments describing Israel as a &#147;racist government&#148; established on the &#147;pretext of Jewish suffering.&#148; The Government deemed these comments offensive, inflammatory and utterly unacceptable. That such remarks were made at the UN's anti-racism conference was all the more shocking and outrageous. On instructions agreed between several like-minded countries, the UK delegation, along with a number of others, left the hall in protest and in solidarity with those targeted by the Iranian President. The delegation returned to the hall once the Iranian President had finished speaking.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="09042871000036"></a>The British Ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Peter Gooderham, delivered a statement on 22 April condemning the Iranian President&#146;s speech, but also making clear that we did not want to leave the stage only to those, like President Ahmadinejad, who would take global efforts against racism backwards. We remained in the UN conference because we wanted an outcome that advanced global efforts against racism. The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon, and High

<a name="90428-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="09042871000037"></a>The UK delegation kept in close touch with UK-based non-governmental organisation stakeholders throughout the conference.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="09042871000038"></a>The fight against racism remains a global struggle. Victims of racism deserve better than political squabbling and intolerant polemics. I believe that the Government did the right thing by remaining in the conference, having our voices heard, and ensuring an acceptable outcome document.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a><a name="09042866000007"></a>My right honourable friend the Prime Minister has raised our concerns with President Karzai. We welcome President Karzai&#146;s decision to ask the Minister of Justice to review the legislation in question, known as the &#147;Shia Family Bill&#148;. The Afghans have the right to write their own laws. However, we were dismayed that some reported provisions of the Bill, as it was drafted, ran counter to Afghanistan&#146;s international human rights obligations.

We regularly discuss women's rights with members of the Afghan  Government, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and parliamentarians. Examples of our work and progress made are as follows.</p>
In 2007-08 UK provided &#163;55 million to the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund to help finance the salaries of thousands of teachers. These resources have contributed to the increase of pupils in school from 2 million in 2002 to around 6million enrolled today. A third of the pupils in school are now girls, up from virtually none under the Taliban.With the help of a constitutional quota, over a quarter of seats in the Lower House of the Afghan Parliament are now held by women.We support various NGO projects, for example supporting the NGO Womankind to implement a &#163;500,000 women's empowerment programme.Since 2001, the UK has given nearly &#163;2 million to support the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission. The Commission has over 500 staff across Afghanistan, actively tackling issues such  as women&#146;s rights, children&#146;s rights and false imprisonment, as well reporting on concerns.

climate science, especially in Africa;climate change in national and international policy;adaptation strategies;reducing the impact of climate change and promoting low carbon growth;and ecosystem services for poverty alleviation.

The costs presented in the Climate Change Act impact assessment (IA) are based on the estimated reduction in UK gross domestic product (GDP) from the constraints the Act creates on UK net greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<a name="90428w0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_10"></a><a name="09042866000017"></a>The costs are estimated for an indicative trajectory to reach the long-term target of an 80 per cent reduction in UK net emissions (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050. The estimate of the costs comes from modelling work performed by the Committee on Climate Change, which has stated:</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_11"></a><a name="09042866000018"></a>&#147;A combination of existing technologies, and those currently under development, could deliver the required global emissions reduction at an economic cost of  1-3 per cent of GDP in 2050 in line with the conclusions of the Stern Review. The UK could achieve an emissions reduction of 80 per cent below 1990 levels at a cost of 1-2 per cent of GDP in 2050.&#148;</p>

<a name="90428w0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_12"></a><a name="09042866000019"></a>The Climate Change Act does not propose specific policies or their method of implementation. The &#163;324 billion to &#163;404 billion cost is an estimate of the underlying technology and behaviour change costs required to deliver the reductions over the period between 2008 and 2050. The incidence of this cost will depend on the specific design of the policies that are implemented&#151;the share of the cost borne by the public or private sector is contingent on policy decisions between now and 2050.</p>
